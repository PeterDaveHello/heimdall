    "originBody": "MicroMac, a Macintosh for under £5 Jun 16, 2024 A microcontroller Macintosh This all started from a conversation about the RP2040 MCU, and building a simple desktop/GUI for it. I’d made a comment along the lines of “or, just run some old OS”, and it got me thinking about the original Macintosh. The original Macintosh was released 40.5 years before this post, and is a pretty cool machine especially considering that the hardware is very simple. Insanely Great and folklore.org are fun reads, and give a glimpse into the Macintosh’s development. Memory was a squeeze; the original 128KB version was underpowered and only sold for a few months before being replaced by the Macintosh 512K, arguably a more appropriate amount of memory. But, the 128 still runs some real applications and, though it pre-dates MultiFinder/actual multitasking, I found it pretty charming. As a tourist. In 1984 the Mac cost roughly 1/3 as much as a VW Golf and, as someone who’s into old computers and old cars, it’s hard to decide which is more frustrating to use. So back to this £3.80 RPi Pico microcontroller board: The RP2040’s 264KB of RAM gives a lot to play with after carving out the Mac’s 128KB – how cool would it be to do a quick hack, and play with a Mac on it? Time passes. A lot of time. But I totally delivered on the janky hack front: You won’t believe that this quality item didn’t take that long to build. So the software was obviously the involved part, and turned into work on 3 distinct projects. This post is going to be a “development journey” story, as a kind of code/design/venting narrative. If you’re just here for the pictures, scroll along! What is pico-mac? A Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller (on a Pico board), driving monochrome VGA video and taking USB keyboard/mouse input, emulating a Macintosh 128K computer and disc storage. The RP2040 has easily enough RAM to house the Mac’s memory, plus that of the emulator; it’s fast enough (with some tricks) to meet the performance of the real machine, has USB host capability, and the PIO department makes driving VGA video fairly uneventful (with some tricks). The basic Pico board’s 2MB of flash is plenty for a disc image with OS and software. Here’s the Pico MicroMac in action, ready for the paperless office of the future: The Pico MicroMac RISC CISC workstation of the future I hadn’t really used a Mac 128K much before; a few clicks on a museum machine once. But I knew they ran MacDraw, and MacWrite, and MacPaint. All three of these applications are pretty cool for a 128K machine; a largely WYSIWYG word processor with multiple fonts, and a vector drawing package. A great way of playing with early Macintosh system software, and applications of these wonderful machines is via https://infinitemac.org, which has shrinkwrapped running the Mini vMac emulator by emscriptening it to run in the browser. Highly recommended, lots to play with. As a spoiler, MicroMac does run MacDraw, and it was great to play with it on “real fake hardware”: (Do you find “Pico Micro Mac” doesn’t really scan? I didn’t think this taxonomy through, did I?) GitHub links are at the bottom of this page: the pico-mac repo has construction directions if you want to build your own! The journey Back up a bit. I wasn’t committed to building a Pico thing, but was vaguely interested in whether it was feasible, so started tinkering with building a Mac 128K emulator on my normal computer first. The three rules I had a few simple rules for this project: It had to be fun. It’s OK to hack stuff to get it working, it’s not as though I’m being paid for this. I like writing emulation stuff, but I really don’t want to learn 68K assembler, or much about the 68K. There’s a lot of love for 68K out there and that’s cool, but meh I don’t adore it as a CPU. So, right from the outset I wanted to use someone else’s 68K interpreter – I knew there were loads around. Similarly, there are a load of OSes whose innards I’d like to learn more about, but the shittiest early Mac System software isn’t high on the list. Get in there, emulate the hardware, boot the OS as a black box, done. I ended up breaking 2 of and sometimes all 3 of these rules during this project. The Mac 128K The machines are generally pretty simple, and of their time. I started with schematics and Inside Macintosh, PDFs of which covered various details of the original Mac hardware, memory map, mouse/keyboard, etc. https://tinkerdifferent.com/resources/macintosh-128k-512k-schematics.79/ https://vintageapple.org/inside_o/ Inside Macintosh Volumes I-III are particularly useful for hardware information; also Guide to Macintosh Family Hardware 2nd Edition. The Macintosh has: A Motorola 68000 CPU running at 7.whatever MHz roughly 8MHz Flat memory, decoded into regions for memory-mapped IO going to the 6522 VIA, the 8530 SCC, and the IWM floppy controller. (Some of the address decoding is a little funky, though.) Keyboard and mouse hang off the VIA/SCC chips. No external interrupt controller: the 68K has 3 IRQ lines, and there are 3 IRQ sources (VIA, SCC, programmer switch/NMI). “No slots” or expansion cards. No DMA controller: a simple autonomous PAL state machine scans video (and audio samples) out of DRAM. Video is fixed at 512x342 1BPP. The only storage is an internal FDD (plus an external drive), driven by the IWM chip. The first three Mac models are extremely similar: The Mac 128K and Mac 512K are the same machine, except for RAM. The Mac Plus added SCSI to a convenient space in the memory map and an 800K floppy drive, which is double-sided whereas the original was a single 400K side. The Mac Plus ROM also supports the 128K/512K, and was an upgrade to create the Macintosh 512Ke. ‘e’ for Extra ROM Goodness. The Mac Plus ROM supports the HD20 external hard disc, and HFS, and Steve Chamberlin has annotated a disassembly of it. This was the ROM to use: I was making a Macintosh 128Ke. Mac emulator: umac After about 8 minutes of research, I chose the Musashi 68K interpreter. It’s C, simple to interface to, and had a simple out-of-box example of a 68K system with RAM, ROM, and some IO. Musashi is structured to be embedded in bigger projects: wire in memory read/write callbacks, a function to raise an IRQ, call execute in a loop, done. I started building an emulator around it, which ultimately became the umac project. The first half (of, say, five halves) went pretty well: A simple commandline app loading the ROM image, allocating RAM, providing debug messages/assertions/logging, and configuring Musashi. Add address decoding: CPU reads/writes are steered to RAM, or ROM. The “overlay” register lets the ROM boot at 0x00000000 and then trampoline up to a high ROM mirror after setting up CPU exception vectors – this affects the address decoding. This is done by poking a VIA register, so decoded just that bit of that register for now. At this point, the ROM starts running and accessing more non-existent VIA and SCC registers. Added more decoding and a skeleton for emulating these devices elsewhere – the MMIO read/writes are just stubbed out. There are some magic addresses that the ROM accesses that “miss” documented devices: there’s a manufacturing test option that probes for a plugin (just thunk it), and then we witness the RAM size probing. The Mac Plus ROM is looking for up to 4MB of RAM. In the large region devoted to RAM, the smaller amount of actual RAM is mirrored over and over, so the probe writes a magic value at high addresses and spots where it starts to wrap around. RAM is then initialised and filled with a known pattern. This was an exciting point to get to because I could dump the RAM, convert the region used for the video framebuffer into an image, and see the “diagonal stripe” pattern used for RAM testing! “She’s alive!” Not all of the device code enjoyed reading all zeroes, so there was a certain amount of referring to the disassembly and returning, uh, 0xffffffff sometimes to push it further. The goal was to get it as far as accessing the IWM chip, i.e. trying to load the OS. After seeing some IWM accesses there and returning random rubbish values, the first wonderful moment was getting the “Unknown Disc” icon with the question mark – real graphics! The ROM was REALLY DOING SOMETHING! I think I hadn’t implemented any IRQs at this point, and found the ROM in an infinite loop: it was counting a few Vsyncs to delay the flashing question mark. Diversion into a better VIA, with callbacks for GPIO register read/write, and IRQ handling. This also needed to wire into Musashi’s IRQ functions. This was motivating to get to – remembering rule #1 – and “graphics”, even though via a manual memory dump/ImageMagick conversion, was great. I knew the IWM was an “interesting” chip, but didn’t know details. I planned to figure it out when I got there (rule #1). IWM, 68K, and disc drivers My god, I’m glad I put IWM off until this point. If I’d read the “datasheet” (vague register documentation) first, I’d’ve just gone to the pub instead of writing this shitty emulator. IWM is very clever, but very very low-level. The disc controllers in other contemporary machines, e.g. WD1770, abstract the disc physics. At one level, you can poke regs to step to track 17 and then ask the controller to grab sector 3. Not so with IWM: first, the discs are Constant Linear Velocity, meaning the angular rotation needs to change appropriate to whichever track you’re on, and second the IWM just gives the CPU a firehose of crap from the disc head (with minimal decoding). I spent a while reading through the disassembly of the ROM’s IWM driver (breaking rule #2 and rule #1): there’s some kind of servo control loop where the driver twiddles PWM values sent to a DAC to control the disc motor, measured against a VIA timer reference to do some sort of dynamic rate-matching to get the correct bitrate from the disc sectors. I think once it finds the track start it then streams the track into memory, and the driver decodes the symbols (more clever encoding) and selects the sector of interest. I was sad. Surely Basilisk II and Mini vMac etc. had solved this in some clever way – they emulated floppy discs. I learned they do not, and do the smart engineering thing instead: avoid the problem. The other emulators do quite a lot of ROM patching: the ROM isn’t run unmodified. You can argue that this then isn’t a perfect hardware emulation if you’re patching out inconvenient parts of the ROM, but so what. I suspect they were also abiding by a rule #1 too. I was going to do the same: I figured out a bit of how the Mac driver interface works (gah, rule #3!) and understood how the other emulators patched this. They use a custom paravirtualised 68K driver which is copied over the ROM’s IWM driver, servicing .Sony requests from the block layer and routing them to more convenient host-side code to manage the requests. Basilisk II uses some custom 68K opcodes and a simple driver, and Mini vMac a complex driver with trappy accesses to a custom region of memory. I reused the Basilisk II driver but converted to access a trappy region (easier to route: just emulate another device). The driver callbacks land in the host/C side and some cut-down Basilisk II code interprets the requests and copies data to/from the OS-provided buffers. Right now, all I needed was to read blocks from one disc: I didn’t need different formats (or even write support), or multiple drives, or ejecting/changing images. Getting the first block loaded from disc took waaaayyy longer than the first part. And, I’d had to learn a bit of 68K (gah), but just in the nick of time I got a Happy Mac icon as the System software started to load. This was still a simple Linux commandline application, with zero UI. No keyboard or mouse, no video. Time to wrap it in an SDL2 frontend (the unix_main test build in the umac project), and I could watch the screen redraw live. I hadn’t coded the 1Hz timer interrupt into the VIA, and after adding that it booted to a desktop! The first boot As an aside, I try to create a dual-target build for all my embedded projects, with a native host build for rapid prototyping/debugging; libSDL instead of an LCD. It means I don’t need to code at the MCU, so I can code in the garden. :) Next was mouse support. Inside Macintosh and the schematics show how it’s wired, to the VIA (good) and the SCC (a beast). The SCC is my second least-favourite chip in this machine; it’s complex and the datasheet/manual seems to be intentionally written to hide information, piss off readers, get one back at the world. (I didn’t go near the serial side, its main purpose, just external IRQ management. But, it’ll do all kinds of exciting 1980s line coding schemes, offloading bitty work from the CPU. It was key for supporting things like AppleTalk.) Life was almost complete at this point; with a working mouse I could build a new disc image (using Mini vMac, an exercise in itself) with Missile Command. This game is pretty fun for under 10KB on disc. So: Video works Boots from disc Mouse works, Missile Command I had no keyboard, but it’s largely working now. Time to start on sub-project numero due: Hardware and RP2040 Completely unrelated to umac, I built up a circuit and firmare with two goals: Display 512x342x1 video to VGA with minimal components, Get the TinyUSB HID example working and integrated. This would just display a test image copied to a framebuffer, and printf() keyboard/mouse events, as a PoC. The video portion was fun: I’d done some I2S audio PIO work before, but here I wanted to scan out video and arbitrarily control Vsync/Hsync. Well, to test I needed a circuit. VGA wants 0.7V max on the video R,G,B signals and (mumble, some volts) on the syncs. The R,G,B signals are 75Ω to ground: with some maths, a 3.3V GPIO driving all three through a 100Ω resistor is roughly right. The day I started soldering it together I needed a VGA connector. I had a DB15 but wanted it for another project, and felt bad about cutting up a VGA cable. But when I took a walk at lunchtime, no shitting you, I passed some street cables. I had a VGA cable – the rust helps with the janky aesthetic. Free VGA cable The VGA PIO side was pretty fun. It ended up as PIO reading config info dynamically to control Hsync width, display position, and so on, and then some tricks with DMA to scan out the config info interleaved with framebuffer data. By shifting the bits in the right direction and by using the byteswap option on the RP2040 DMA, the big-endian Mac framebuffer can be output directly without CPU-side copies or format conversion. Cool. This can be fairly easily re-used in other projects: see video.c. But. I ended up (re)writing the video side three times in total: First version had two DMA channels writing to the PIO TX FIFO. The first would transfer the config info, then trigger the second to transfer video data, then raise an IRQ. The IRQ handler would then have a short time (the FIFO depth!) to choose a new framebuffer address to read from, and reprogram DMA. It worked OK, but was highly sensitive to other activity in the system. First and most obvious fix is that any latency-sensitive IRQ handler must have the __not_in_flash_func() attribute so as to run out of RAM. But even with that, the design didn’t give much time to reconfigure the DMA: random glitches and blanks occurred when moving the mouse rapidly. Second version did double-buffering with the goal of making the IRQ handler’s job trivial: poke in a pre-prepared DMA config quickly, then after the critical rush calculate the buffer to use for next time. Lots better, but still some glitches under some high load. Even weirder, it’d sometimes just blank out completely, requiring a reset. This was puzzling for a while; I ended up printing out the PIO FIFO’s FDEBUG register to try to catch the bug in the act. I saw that the TXOVER overflow flag was set, and this should be impossible: the FIFOs pull data from DMA on demand with DMA requests and a credited flow-contr…OH WAIT. If credits get messed up or duplicated, too many transfers can happen, leading to an overflow at the receiver side. Well, I’d missed a subtle rule in the RP2040 DMA docs: Another caveat is that multiple channels should not be connected to the same DREQ. So the third version…… doesn’t break this rule, and is more complicated as a result: One DMA channel transfers to the PIO TX FIFO Another channel programs the first channel to send from the config data buffer A third channel programs the first to send the video data The programming of the first triggers the corresponding “next reprogram me” channel The nice thing – aside from no lock-ups or video corruption – is that this now triggers a Hsync IRQ during the video line scan-out, greatly relaxing the deadline of reconfiguring the DMA. I’d like to further improve this (with yet another DMA channel) to transfer without an IRQ per line, as the current IRQ overhead of about 1% of CPU time can be avoided. (It would’ve been simpler to just hardwire the VGA display timing in the PIO code, but I like (for future projects) being able to dynamically-reconfigure the video mode.) So now we have a platform and firmware framework to embed umac into, HID in and video out. The hardware’s done, fuggitthat’lldo, let’s throw it over to the software team: How it all works Back to emulating things A glance at the native umac binary showed a few things to fix before it could run on the Pico: Musashi constructed a huge opcode decode jumptable at runtime, in RAM. It’s never built differently, and never changes at runtime. I added a Musashi build-time generator so that this table could be const (and therefore live in flash). The disassembler was large, and not going to be used on the Pico, so another option to build without. Musashi tries to accurately count execution cycles for each instruction, with more large lookup tables. Maybe useful for console games, but the Mac doesn’t have the same degree of timing sensitivity. REMOVED. (This work is in my small-build branch.) pico-mac takes shape, with the ROM and disc image in flash, and enjoyably it now builds and runs on the Pico! With some careful attention to not shoving stuff in RAM, the RAM use is looking pretty good. The emulator plus HID code is using about 35-40KB on top of the Mac’s 128KB RAM area – there’s 95+KB of RAM still free. This was a good time to finish off adding the keyboard support to umac. The Mac keyboard is interfaced serially through the VIA ‘shift register’, a basic synchronous serial interface. This was logically simple, but frustrating because early attempts at replying to the ROM’s “init” command just were persistently ignored. The ROM disassembly was super-useful again: reading the keyboard init code, it looked like a race condition in interrupt acknowledgement if the response byte appears too soon after the request is sent. Shoved in a delay to hold off a reply until a later poll, and then it was just a matter of mapping keycodes (boooooorrrriiiiing). With a keyboard, the end-of-level MacWrite boss is reached: One problem though: it totally sucked. It was suuuuper slow. I added a 1Hz dump of instruction count, and it was doing about 300 KIPS. The 68000 isn’t an amazing CPU in terms of IPC. Okay, there are some instructions that execute in 4 cycles. But you want to use those extravagant addressing modes don’t you, and touching memory is spending those cycles all over the place. Not an expert, but targeting about 1 MIPS for an about 8MHz 68000 seems right. Only 3x improvement needed. Performance I didn’t say I wasn’t gonna cheat: let’s run that Pico at 250MHz instead of 125MHz. Okay better, but not 2x better. From memory, only about 30% better. Damn, no free lunch today. Musashi has a lot of configurable options. My first goal was to get its main loop (as seen from disassembly/post-compile end!) small: the Mac doesn’t report Bus Errors, so the registers don’t need copies for unwinding. The opcodes are always fetched from a 16b boundary, so don’t need alignment checking, and can use halfword loads (instead of two byte loads munged into a halfword!). For the Cortex-M0+/armv6m ISA, reordering some of the CPU context structure fields enabled immediate-offset access and better code. The CPU type, mysteriously, was dynamically-changeable and led to a bunch of runtime indirection. Looking better, maybe 2x improvement, but not enough. Missile Command was still janky and the mouse wasn’t smooth! Next, some naughty/dangerous optimisations: remove address alignment checking, because unaligned accesses don’t happen in this constrained environment. (Then, this work is in my umac-hacks branch.) But the real perf came from a different trick. First, a diversion! RP2040 memory access The RP2040 has fast RAM, which is multi-banked so as to allow generally single-cycle access to multiple users (2 CPUs, DMA, etc.). Out of the box, most code runs via XIP from external QSPI flash. The QSPI usually runs at the core clock (125MHz default), but has a latency of ~20 cycles for a random word read. The RP2040 uses a relatively simple 16KB cache in front of the flash to protect you from horrible access latency, but the more code you have the more likely you are to call a function and have to crank up QSPI. When overclocking to 250MHz, the QSPI can’t go that fast so stays at 125MHz (I think). Bear in mind, then, that your 20ish QSPI cycles on a miss become 40ish CPU cycles. The particular rock-and-a-hard-place here is that Musashi build-time generates a ton of code, a function for each of its 1968 opcodes, plus that 256KB opcode jumptable. Even if we make the inner execution loop completely free, the opcode dispatch might miss in the flash cache, and the opcode function itself too. (If we want to get 1 MIPS out of about 200 MIPS, a few of these delays are going to really add up.) The __not_in_flash_func() attribute can be used to copy a given function into RAM, guaranteeing fast execution. At the very minimum, the main loop and memory accessors are decorated: every instruction is going to access an opcode and most likely read or write RAM. This improves performance a few percent. Then, I tried decorating whole classes of opcodes: move is frequent, as are branches, so put ‘em in RAM. This helped a lot, but the remaining free RAM was used up very quickly, and I wasn’t at my goal of much above 1 MIPS. Remember that RISC architecture is gonna change everything? We want to put some of those 1968 68K opcodes into RAM to make them fast. What are the top 10 most often-used instructions? Top 100? By adding a 64K table of counters to umac, booting the Mac and running key applications (okay, playing Missile Command for a bit), we get a profile of dynamic instruction counts. It turns out that the 100 hottest opcodes (5% of the total) account for 89% of the execution. And the top 200 account for a whopping 98% of execution. Armed with this profile, the umac build post-processes the Musashi auto-generated code and decorates the top 200 functions with __not_in_flash_func(). This adds only 17KB of extra RAM usage (leaving 95KB spare), and hits about 1.4 MIPS! Party on! At last, the world can enjoy Missile Command’s dark subject matter in performant comfort: Missile Command on pico-mac What about MacPaint? Everyone loves MacPaint. Maybe you love MacPaint, and have noticed I’ve deftly avoided mentioning it. Okay, FINE: It doesn’t run on a Mac 128Ke, because the Mac Plus ROM uses more RAM than the original. :sad-face: I’d seen this thread on 68kMLA about a “Mac 256K”: https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/the-mythical-mac-256k.46149/ Chances are that the Mac 128K was really a Mac 256K in the lab (or maybe even intended to have 256K and cost-cut before release), as the OS functions fine with 256KB. I wondered, does the Mac ROM/OS need a power-of-two amount of RAM? If not, I have that 95K going spare. Could I make a “Mac 200K”, and then run precious MacPaint? Well, I tried a local hack that patches the ROM to update its global memTop variable based on a given memory size, and yes, System 3.2 is happy with non-power-of-2 sizes. I booted with 256K, 208K, and 192K. However, there were some additional problems to solve: the ROM memtest craps itself without a power-of-2 size (totally fair), and NOPping that out leads to other issues. These can be fixed, though also some parts of boot access off the end of RAM. A power-of-2 size means a cheap address mask wraps RAM accesses to the valid buffer, and that can’t be done with 192K. Unfortunately, when I then tested MacPaint it still wouldn’t run because it wanted to write a scratch file to the read-only boot volume. This is totally breaking rule #1 by this point, so we are staying with 128KB for now. However, a 256K MicroMac is extremely possible. We just need an MCU with, say, 300KB of RAM… Then we’d be cooking on gas. Goodbye, friend Well, dear reader, this has been a blast. I hope there’s been something fun here for ya.

Let me share you some moments of my own with you. I was leaving university campus with my buddies, talking about building magnetic card reader to check contents of my campus library card. Just as I was explaining magnetic heads to one of the guys I see a random cassette player few meters from us, in pile of illegaly dumped trash. Mid sentence I stop, grab and smash the radio open on the curb, pull out the magnetic head and continue talking about the said magnetic head. Guys were bewildered. At other time I was watching a video about TV fresnel lens based lighting fixture, waiting for my date. After the date while taking the girl to the car I spotted a flat TV next to a dumpster box. Car was right across the street so I took the TV home. She quickly learned I'm no stranger to dumpster adventures. I had the light don't by the morning. Almost 2 years before that I needed a short (30cm max) ac plug with wire to fix something in the workshop, and I remembered seeing a broken electric tea pot behind our local dumpster while taking out the trash, it was exactly the right length of wire, and awh better than I needed. Recently, I was renovating something with my wife, and I needed a vacuum cleaner for the drywall sanding and other dust and spills related to that. Just few days after settingy eyes on karcher vacuum I find one in the dumpster as we were walking from the cinema back home. I opened it up next day and realized previous owner had thrown away brand new vacuum cleaner. They had not unpacked and set the filter, hair and piece of cloth got into the air sucking fins and got it stuck. I pulled the trash out, set the filter and voila! Over the last 10 years I had many more situations like that :) reply ssl-3 14 hours agorootparentA million years ago, I spent two cold nights standing on my head in the driver's side footwell of my E36 BMW, installing an inexpensive Wal-Mart-sourced CodeAlarm remote starter to make my then-wife happy. It worked great. It could even operate the door locks and roll the windows up with the fob (none of which sounds very special for a modern vehicle, but my car was not equipped with remote-anything from the factory so all of this was very nice). Over a decade later, the fob got destroyed in an unfortunate boating incident. I was bummed. Replacements were available to purchase and I hemmed and hawed about buying one, or maybe upgrading to a fancier system, or just getting over it and continuing to use the key in the lock cylinder (like some commoner!) to lock and unlock the doors. And then I was walking down the street in Bexley, Ohio, and I saw a broken laundry basket full of discarded things (\"illegally dumped\" things) on the curb. It appeared to have all manner of random household trash. But on the top of that basket of stuff was a plastic clamshell. And inside that clamshell was an identical remote starter kit -- exactly the same as the one I'd bought forever ago. It was unopened. A few careful slashes with my pocket knife later, and I had a new remote. Even the ancient tiny little 12V (A23) alkaline battery still worked -- and kept working for months. (I left the rest of the trash where it was.) Sometimes the universe does provide for those who keep their eyes open. (Pairing the new remote was interesting because it involved operating the brake pedal switch while the car was turned off, and the E36 turns off the brake light circuit completely when the car is turned off... But those are just BMW problems. I got it sorted.) reply r00fus 4 hours agorootparent> Over a decade later, the fob got destroyed in an unfortunate boating incident.

I got the idea to tinker with satellite dishes to make a simple radio telescope. I remember riding around and constantly seeing old DirectTV satellite dishes constantly on the side of the road for trash. Before this idea. So I figured, oh, I can easily get my hands on one. As soon as I committed to that project, I never saw a single satellite dish sitting by the street as I rode around. reply jetti 4 hours agorootparentIf it makes you feel better you probably would not have been able to just pick up the dishes and use them without buying extra parts.

A while back I purchased a KVM switch - it came with 3 DP cables, which went straight into my e-waste box. I've also seen office fit-outs where mountains of cables that came with monitors went straight from factory to landfill because they were the wrong length. I understand some of the reason it happens - it's not a great experience to buy a product and then be unable to start using it immediately because you don't have the right cables. And there are a lot of low-quality cables out there which might have the right connectors but not actually work - I bought at least 3 different 5m DP cables before I found one that reliably worked at 4K. But surely that can't justify the literal mountains of e-waste the practice creates. Sadly I don't think it'll ever change without regulation. reply rjmunro 8 hours agorootparent> possible exception of unit-specific power adapters No. Unit-specific power adapters should not exist. Either put a USB-C or a 120v/240v AC connector on the device, depending on power requirements. It's really not that hard. Note: it must be connector, not a fixed cable. I.e. an IEC C8 or C14. reply ale42 6 hours agorootparentThis might apply to (most) IT devices. But there are devices that require 24 V, or 48 V, or any other voltage that USB-C can't supply, and that for various reasons (space, EMI, possibly even compliance with some safety regulation) can't contain an integrated power supply unit from 120/230 V mains. Of course this should be an exception and most consumer devices can definitely work with the regular voltages and currents that USB-C can supply. reply lupire 3 hours agorootparentThat's fine but it should be a standard for a entire class of products. reply rjst01 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree in principle, but I think there has to be some room for exceptions here. Some portable devices like smartwatches are too space constrained for USB-C and some devices might use too much power for USB-PD but still be too small to include the power supply internally. Also, some of my synth gear uses a locking barrel connector, which I think is a better trade-off than a locking USB-C connector because it can be locked and unlocked faster. Bundled power bricks are also much less likely to directly be e-wasted without being used. reply forgotacc240419 10 hours agorootparentprevA really bad one now is devices providing crappy power only usb micro cables, very often these will still have the 4 pin head.

I think it's a great thing that many phones no longer ship with chargers. The mild inconvenience of having to buy a separate charger should not outweigh the reduction amount of waste we produce with new chargers.

If anything, it should be illegal to not give the option to unbundle cables from the package. reply yrro 10 hours agorootparentprevPrinters stopped coming with a USB A-to-B cable many years ago. Who knew that the printer makers were in the right all along? reply xp84 2 hours agorootparentYes, and I think they did that for relatively cynical reasons -- as a handout to the Best Buys of the world who would then be able to attach a 90% margin \"Printer cable\" at $29.95 to your $50 Black Friday special inkjet. I suspect the reason why this didn't go on to become standard across all classes of device, is because since 2010 or so, the average or median margin on accessories has cratered thanks to Amazon Marketplace sellers. You could realistically end up needing to buy a Belkin $30 printer cable in 2005, unless you'd heard of Monoprice. Today by contrast if you just search Amazon for it, you'll have one for $4.94-$6.49 delivered within 2 days. If margins were still what they used to be on cables and stuff, I think you'd have a strong incentive for places like Amazon and Walmart to pressure suppliers to make cables a la carte (officially for environmental reasons, but also, for great profits, lol) reply II2II 18 hours agoparentprevThe thrift stores in my area have tonnes of VGA cables.

The stuff that doesn't make the cut get sold by the pound periodically at a local scrap yard after I prep them by snipping the connectors off, which generates a meaningful amount of folding cash -- enough for a coney dog and some ice cream from around the corner, anyway. (Rules vary; the scrap yard near me is very happy to buy deconnectorized insulated computer-ish cables. Some might buy them with the connectors attached. Some might not want this kind of wire at all.) I like having what I might need on-hand, but I also dislike the notion of hoarding. I try to keep it balanced. Sometimes, this bites me. I hadn't use a VGA cable for years during the last culling so they all got recycled, and then I needed one a few months ago for an old Compaq server. I found a beige HD15 cable at work that functioned well-enough, but it was a blurry mess (real VGA cables have coax inside, and this cable did not). I even ran out of bog-standard IEC computer power cords a couple of years ago and had to -- you know -- actually buy one. I never thought this would be a possibility.

We've got various marketplaces for used items (eBay, CL, FB Marketplace, etc.) and we've got various rental/sharing platforms for niche things (Uber, Airbnb, etc.) and those are decent for what they are, yet somehow the inherent inefficiencies (effort to list an item, effort to discover an item, platform fees, etc.) suggest that there is a lot of room for improvement. It's kind of like how scheduling assistant features/products, such as Calendly, offer a massive improvement over writing messages back and forth along the lines of \"send me your availability,\" yet a verbal/synchronous discussion isn't nearly as bad as written/async, since it gets you across the finish line quickly despite many round trips, so lots of people are fine doing that instead of using efficient tools, so there's no mass adoption/demand. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentIt's just hard to get away from the transaction costs associated with exchanging low-value physical goods over distance.

It seems their attitudes changed soon after, perhaps due to their almost total market dominance, and they became aggressive towards their users in the pursuit of profits. The last Adobe software I really used was Lightroom as that was one of the last pay-once software titles. Now the only Adobe product most of us at work have is except Acrobat Reader. We were quite glad when the Figma purchase failed. reply gorkish 1 hour agoparentWhen creative cloud was very first released, it was excellent value. I was actually quite supportive of Adobe's initial SaaS strategy. It was well and truly a \"why would anyone ever pirate photoshop ever again?\" type of product. Fast forward a decade and that $19.99/mo product has become $89.99/mo and the value prop has plummeted on top of it. The big difference today is that instead of people returning to the high seas and continuing to use adobe software, they are just moving to different ecosystems -- procreate, davinci, foxit, etc. reply Eji1700 1 hour agorootparent> When creative cloud was very first released, it was excellent value. I was actually quite supportive of Adobe's initial SaaS strategy. It was well and truly a \"why would anyone ever pirate photoshop ever again?\" type of product. This is the entire issue with these kinds of things. They always launch at a good value because they know they can capture the market. Yes if they were benevolent or whatever it'd be fine, but these things almost ALWAYS turn into cluster fucks. They couldn't launch at worse value than the current product line because they need full adoption before they can put the screws to you. reply duped 51 minutes agorootparentOr you do what everyone else does, which is force everyone to adopt the SaaS model by revoking their licenses or otherwise bricking the software. That's why it's important to own your own data in a way that can be reused and adapted when they try and screw you later. You see this all the time with video games nowadays. Everyone wants their own launcher and subscription services. reply whycome 3 minutes agorootparentYou can \"own\" a copy of Adobe's software (like earlier Creative Suite DVD versions) but then Adobe essentially bricked them by killing the activation server. reply exe34 10 minutes agorootparentprevI'll never again learn another proprietary tech unless I'm getting paid to do it. open source or nothing. reply CrimsonCape 30 minutes agorootparentprevEvery corporate leader has the opportunity to \"bring value\" to the company by upping the subscription fee a few dollars.

But I agree that there's little difference between the two ultimately. reply mistrial9 20 minutes agorootparentprevAdobe did not \"capture\" the old single license sales customers, they are just walking away from them.. any way they can, into the cloud.. the results look similar but thinking about the power dynamics that drive them, here... what I meant to say is.. that the driver to launch a great experience is first, then it is easy and tempting to change the cloud terms.. not compared to the deal you get with desktop purchase.. not because you captured the single license customers with better deals in the cloud.. but because the cloud is just so easy to change, the money so tempting.. maybe the anecdote.. when Apple stopped caring so much about the desktop, after the iPhone.. they did not \"capture\" the single sale customers.. they just walked away to focus completely on the new, more profitable model reply Trollmann 52 minutes agorootparentprevNot for students. CS6 single product was up to $250, CS6 DS $350, CS6 MC $800 compared to CC 1st year $240 increasing to $360. If you only needed a single product you were off worse after one year.

Load a file = 1 credit. Save a file = 1 credit, etc. You could even turn this into an ecosystem by itself, so instead of buying or 'renting' the software users are buying credits to actuallyt operate the software. Newer features like AI could cost more credits up front. There could be sales on credits etc. Somebody please show me a downside to this model? reply swores 33 minutes agorootparentI think there's multiple downsides, but the biggest one is that it makes it a massive pain in the ass for any price-conscious users to decide whether it's worth paying for. Right now if I want to install some software to edit images on my PC, I can look at how much Photoshop costs, how much rival 1 costs, and look at Free Alternative 2, and decide what I'm willing to pay. But under your scenario, I have no clue how much more (or less) expensive Photoshop will be than the paid or free alternatives, unless I can first forecast all the individual steps that will be needed to do the editing I have in mind, and then spend time adding up each action's costs to get an idea of the total price. Not only would it be extremely hard to accurately list every action that would be needed before actually doing them, but even if I thought that were possible then the amount of hassle would be a big enough deal breaker that I just wouldn't be willing to bother with it. reply kbolino 6 minutes agorootparentprev> Somebody please show me a downside to this model? For whom? The user? It's an absolute clusterfuck. Always online video games have already done this shit, and it's been a nightmare for the end user, and that software doesn't do anything \"important\".

Classic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification reply jonathankoren 42 minutes agorootparentIt's not. The quality stayed the same, even improved. It's run of the mill monopoly pricing. reply crote 34 minutes agorootparentIt is 100% enshittification. The definition is even in the linked article: > Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. I call this enshittification, (..) The core point here is \"abuse the user\", not \"make features worse\". Price gauging would be included in that definition. reply roywiggins 19 minutes agorootparentEnshittification usually refers to companies that run two-sided markets (\"platforms\"), like rideshare and delivery apps. Adobe raising prices on everyone isn't really the same thing. Enshittification works by first subsidizing everything for everyone, then alternately squeezing the sellers and buyers on the platform by increasing their cut and raising prices. It's about playing a game where you alternately squeeze one side or another of a marketplace that you control. Adobe doesn't really run a platform, they're selling a product and finding ways to raise the price. reply Retric 11 minutes agorootparentEnsnittification definitely applied to home appliances like washing machines. IMO inkjet printers where the front runner here before online platforms really took off. reply roywiggins 6 minutes agorootparentI don't think any of that stuff really follows the definition as quoted though. That definition is all about a middleman squeezing buyers and sellers. That people use it to mean \"any scummy business practice that uses lock-in and corner-cutting to squeeze customers\" doesn't make those uses fit that definition. That stuff is not new, enshittification was coined to the relatively new ways that platforms started to squeeze people. behringer 1 hour agorootparentprevI only pay 32/mo for creative cloud. Sign up for the free trial, then \"cancel\" you'll get a screen that says \"offers\" and you can choose a realistic price plan.

[1] https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-apr-09-fi-micro... reply CobrastanJorji 58 minutes agoparentprevIt's weird to watch Adobe make these fundamentally short sighted decisions. I can only assume the ultimate cause is the individual motivations of executives and managers. \"Oooo, if we raise subscriptions $10/mo, we'll make lots of money, and it'll look really good on my annual review.\" \"Oooo, this cancellation fee will really help our retention, which will look really good on my annual review.\" \"Making Photoshop subscription only will do amazing things for our revenue.\" When you have complete market dominance, you have little opportunity for growth. If your employees and investors have an insatiable need for growth, you have to try anyway, and that's where things fall apart. The #1 threat to your magical money faucet is something replacing your product as the photo editor of choice, and you should be 100% focused on making sure that doesn't happen. To do that, you need to be focused on keeping up quality, periodically adding the latest features, and making absolutely sure that the next generation of artists is coming up using your tool. That Adobe rep 25 years ago was 100% correct, but \"I keep the money pipe flowing and did not actively make it worse\" does not get you a promotion. reply alt227 37 minutes agorootparentWhen you make the industries best software and pretty much have a monopoly on the market, the only place left to go is adding markup to your product. reply tombert 1 hour agoparentprevI haven't used any Adobe products since they started doing the subscription-only model. I want to use it, they typically make good enough software, but I have a line in the sand that I will not pay for a subscription. I want to buy my software and own it and use it for as long as I want. Basically my options if I don't want top pay a license fee for forever is to find alternatives, or pirate the software. I've opted for the former, but either leads to Adobe getting $0 from me, where they could have gotten >$0 if they had had a \"pay outright\" program. I have generally found good enough alternatives with their competitors (Toonboom is generally good enough for basic animation, Krita is good enough for artsy stuff, Final Cut Pro is good enough for video editing). reply jimmaswell 45 minutes agorootparentAdobe software isn't quite \"good\" in my experience. The company is an Oracle: all-in on giving the right bullet points to pointy-haired managers but with a palpable paucity of technical merit. I have to work with Adobe Experience Manager and it's a weird, painful, slow/inefficient kludge, not to even get into the licensing terms and what devs are \"allowed\" to do on their own servers. Acrobat Reader stands out in my memory only as that extremely slow, bloated thing you launched by accident, then closed 5 minutes later once it loaded to use Sumatara instead. They killed Flash by neglect after buying it from Macromedia - we might still have it around if they invested in it properly and made it up to par for the iPod. Thankfully we finally have good emulators that work in the browser to see the vast amount of old Flash content. Creative Suite is fine and mostly functional from what I hear, but they didn't make that codebase either, and I've never felt limited by free or cheaper alternatives like GIMP or Sony Vegas. (I find it baffling how people rag on GIMP - I use it in a professional and personal capacity and I love it, and I'm familiar enough with Photoshop to compare it.) reply tombert 33 minutes agorootparentI don't think Vegas has been Sony for quite awhile has it? Vegas is great, but as far as I'm aware there's not really a way to get it running on Mac, and I don't own a Windows computer anymore (I still will VM it if I really need it). For my video stuff I've been using Final Cut Pro and Apple Motion for the last couple years since it's a one-time purchase and I think pretty good. I'd like to use Premiere and After Effects but, as stated, I don't want to pay for subscriptions. I don't know enough about photo editing to say if GIMP sucks, I've used it before and it seems fine. reply johndhi 1 hour agorootparentprevYou'd pay $1500 or whatever for a perpetual Photoshop license? I wouldn't reply bobim 1 hour agorootparentThat's dirt cheap for a software you can make a living off. For FEA or CFD one would need to shell off in the order of 50-100k plus 20k per year. 1500? I would. reply SomeCallMeTim 39 minutes agorootparentBut not all of us make a living off of Photoshop. I'm a programmer. I periodically need to make a tiny tweak in a file that's been created by a real artist, or I want to edit a photo I took, or whatever. It's insane to spend $1500, or even $500 (the CorelDraw buy-it-outright price) for hobby and occasional-use software like that. And yeah, I use other things like Affinity Photo, which is Good Enough for many of my purposes, but it's just annoying to not be able to use the same software as my artists--unless they flatten the image before giving it to me, it's a crap-shoot whether I can import it in anything but the exact version of PhotoShop they were using. It feels like extortion: I have to pay the artist to make the tiniest changes because I can't edit the original file, or I have to pay Adobe an outrageous sum to do it myself. Lose-lose. reply bobim 18 minutes agorootparentFully understood, this carefully engineered vendor lock-in is the cherry on the cake. It's in all CAD software for no reason and forces you to follow the herd. Open standards should be imposed by state actors... reply tombert 1 hour agorootparentprevI mean, sure, there's probably an upper bound of a number I'd pay, and I don't do enough photo editing to justify paying really any amount of money for Photoshop. For software I'd actually use though? Upper bound is probably $600 judging by what I paid for Toonboom Harmony. Honestly if I had known about Moho at the time I probably would have gotten that since it's considerably cheaper and on Humble Bundle fairly often. I'm not in a creative industry so it's tough for me to know \"fair\" numbers, just \"what can I justify as a toy\" numbers. I like to occasionally whip out an animation tool and draw stuff with stick figures, and I like having that readily available, and I don't want my tool to change from under me so I don't want transparent updates. I just want to buy my software once. reply jimmaswell 42 minutes agorootparentprevI wouldn't pay $1 for Photoshop when GIMP is free and open source. It's been my daily driver in a personal and professional capacity for ages, and Photoshop offers nothing special for me. reply vsuperpower2020 3 minutes agorootparentI'm glad there are people willing to pay for the development of software so I'm not stuck using GIMP. It's actually a good thing when people get paid for their work, the issue here is that adobe's predatory pricing models and making it difficult to cancel. reply bongodongobob 38 minutes agorootparentprevIf GIMP is a replacement for you, you're not Adobe's target customer. reply ipaddr 24 minutes agorootparentBut you are their average customer reply dangerboysteve 1 hour agorootparentprev\"ToonBoom, is generally good enough for basic animation\". What? This is the premier 2D animation package used by most of the top studios. reply tombert 1 hour agorootparentOh no question, bad phrasing on my end, I sort of meant it inverted. Toonboom is excellent if you're a professional. I'm very much not a professional, I barely know what I'm doing. I think Flash/Animate appealed to someone like me, because I found it easier to draw some goofy thing really quick and animate it. I feel Toonboom has a much higher learning curve and isn't really for people like me. It's not insurmountably difficult or anything, just that I'm not really the target audience and as such I don't know that it's a good fit for \"basic\" stuff, if that makes any sense. reply Topgamer7 1 hour agoparentprevI don't want to pay for a subscription for software I use thrice a year. I was looking forward to having Affinity's suite be the replacement, where I could buy it, and use it. However I don't want to support another company that is inevitably going to go subscription. Since they've been bought by canva, it's just a matter of time. I even went so far as to get Affinity Photo being able to start on Wine. But lost interest since their acquisition. (I'm sure people will question why I don't just use inkscape, krita, or gimp. And its because all of them have a subpar vector experience IMO) reply shostack 11 minutes agorootparentI use Lightroom and Photoshop very irregularly. I now can't access Photoshop 5 that was installed on my Macbook because it doesn't work with the current MacOS. So now not only can I not deauthorize the license to free it up for my Windows machine, I can't actually use it either. reply gmjosack 1 hour agorootparentprevI ended up grabbing the Affinity bundle since it's half off despite concerns about Canva. I'd expect even if they end up moving to a subscription I'd at least have the versions I bought for an extended amount of time. I still have a working copy of Photoshop CS 5 as well. Hopefully we see Affinity remain committed to affordable non subscription plans but if they don't I think the one time purchase will last me a long time. If they put out a version 3 without subscription and it's compelling i'll upgrade, if not i'll continue to use 2 for I'm sure years to come. reply tombert 1 hour agorootparentprevCorel's (or whatever they call themselves now) stuff is generally pretty ok, and most of their stuff still lets you buy it outright. I don't know much about Affinity Photo but Paint Shop Pro and Aftershot have been \"good enough\" for the limited uses I have for photo editing (though I'm definitely far from a professional). CorelDraw is, I think, a very decent vector drawing program if nothing else. reply SomeCallMeTim 45 minutes agorootparentCorelDraw is great, but for years they were also subscription-only. In the last six months or so they finally started offering a single-price license again--at a prohibitive level. I bought the previous single-price version years ago, and it's so stale that I prefer to use Inkscape, despite the more limited feature set, and I've been using the Affinity suite as a more professional replacement. Now it looks like they let you buy it again, but at $550, I'm still giving them the finger. Their upgrade price used to be ~$200; I would pay that once ever 3-4 years or so, and consider that a reasonable expense to get a good product and have it available when I did need it. But for $550, I'd need to be planning on keeping it for something like a decade to get a similar value--and it's too much to justify buying at my limited usage level. All of these subscription services should get over themselves and allow you to rent them for occasional usage for a reasonable amount of money. If I could give them $20 for intermittent (time-limited? operation-limited?) use, with no \"auto-renewal\", I might do that every time I actually needed the product. But no, they need to be greedy and demand that you pay for a year of usage in advance (or by using deceptive practices like Adobe above). I've used Paint Shop Pro, and I really don't like it. I can use Corel PhotoPaint and Affinity Photo, and they're fine, but PSP makes me crazy when I try to use it. I'd almost rather use Gimp. reply tombert 40 minutes agorootparentFair enough. I've never paid full price for any Corel product. They're frequently on Humble Bundle where you get a bunch of them on the order of like $30 total. It looks like right now there's even a sale going on: https://www.humblebundle.com/software/corel-productivity-cre... My CorelDraw license is for 2020, so not super up to date, but I've generally liked it. I've not tried the Essentials package. reply technothrasher 49 minutes agorootparentprevI bought the Affinity suite and have gotten good value out of it. If at some point in the future new versions go to a subscription model, I just won't buy them. reply duped 43 minutes agorootparentprevIs that the exact situation that subscription pricing (in principle) solves? If you only use it thrice a year then you can pay for it as you go instead of needing pay for the thing outright. reply carlosjobim 1 hour agorootparentprevCompletely agree! I also refuse to put gas in my car because I know that prices will go up later... Or on a more serious note: I use Affinity professionally (previously PhotoShop). Why would I care the slightest about what they might or might not do with their pricing model in the future? I need software that delivers right now. reply earthling8118 59 minutes agorootparentI don't want to pay for the car nor the gas. Let's not let the same hostage situation extend to other aspects of our lives it we can avoid it. reply anonymousab 44 minutes agorootparentprevFor the same reason that you would care with Photoshop or Premier or Lightroom; you're investing money in learning and building your workflow around a tool that is guaranteed to go down the subscription and enshittification path. reply carlosjobim 34 minutes agorootparentYour computer will not explode if or when Affinity changes to a subscription model. You'll still have the software and can use it until the next ice age if you please. reply roughly 16 minutes agorootparentWell, until there's an OS update. Most of us have gone down this road before - the old software works until it doesn't, it runs on the old hardware until that doesn't, it's usable until it's not. The actuarial table for any given software release is north of 5 years and south of 10. reply carlosjobim 4 minutes agorootparentWe're talking about professional software. If you're a professional you have a machine dedicated to that work. If a software update will break software you've paid for and need to use, you don't update that machine. Between 5 and 10 years is a perfectly reasonable run time for paid pro software. You can also keep the old machine around for the software and have a new machine for other needs. roughly 0 minutes agorootparent> Between 5 and 10 years is a perfectly reasonable run time for paid pro software.

Adobe wasn’t going to risk bad publicity going after some freelancer for $800, but they could count on everyone in that world needing to use Adobe products for compatibility reasons to provide the inertia which meant that the businesses who hired those freelancers kept paying Adobe rather than switching at the threat of a lawsuit. reply dylan604 1 hour agorootparentAnybody remember the Business Software Alliance[0] from years ago threatening to audit your company for using unlicensed software?

Though, obviously as per the article, this is a pain to do. It’s really a shame there’s nothing comparable to Adobe’s products on the really pro-artist end of things. Companies like Serif have tried with Affinity but it’s lackluster when you really need to do some high end work. OSS stuff like Krita, Inkscape and Gimp have improved a lot but there’s still a huge gulf. Photoshop is perhaps the easiest to replace, but the rest of the suite like Illustrator really has no competition when it comes to functionality. Affinity Designer lacks so many of the gradient tools, shape repetition, and even certain alignment tools. InDesign similarly has many QoL features that Affinity Publisher lack. After Effects has some competition but nowhere near the ecosystem it provides. I guess premiere and animate (previously flash) have a lot of competition but that’s about it? For reference of where I’m coming from , I own licenses to the full Adobe suite and the full affinity suite. I have professionally done art and programmed for features in multiple domains for a decade and my work has shipped with major products from FAANG-like companies.

The problem with much of the Creative Suite subs, and what the FTC are also suing over, is that it looks and smells like a monthly sub you can cancel at any time, but you often can't - its “annual paid monthly” as the linked article describes. The big problem is their ridiculous “annual paid monthly” plan - you often can't cancel, or it takes a ridiculous amount of effort to escape “annual paid monthly”.

My only question is, what the heck took the FTC this long? Why didn't they do this years ago? The problems with cancelling Adobe CC are well known: - Consumers think they've subscribed to a monthly plan only to discover it's yearly - If they cancel before the year is over they still have to pay 50% of the remaining time, while the software stops working immediately, and they had no idea - But worst of all, if you want to set it to NOT autorenew at the end of the year, YOU CAN'T [1]. You can't cancel renewal but keep the existing subscription through the end of the year. Which is insane. You have to wait until some brief \"cancellation window\" period at the end of your year, and cancel it AFTER the window has opened up but BEFORE it actually renews. Again, this is INSANE And all this is on top of the complaints that people try to cancel over the phone even within the cancellation window, and either can't do it, or think they've done it but it hasn't. There's no way the FTC won't win here. And I hope the FTC levies a truly massive fine on Adobe, ON TOP OF refunds to consumers of all previous cancellation fees. It's absolutely despicable behavior, and there's no way Adobe would be able to get away with it if they didn't have network lock-in effects from what have become the industry file formats of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, etc. If you collaborate in the graphics space you need to use their tools period, so you can edit files people send you and vice-versa.

In general, the government and its agencies move very slowly. Compared to the FTC, Adobe's move over to subscription is quite recent. Adobe's only been doing subscriptions for what, maybe 10 years? And these problems are even more recent than that. It also takes time to build up a case, even if they had looked into it immediately.

So you can leverage one dump / leak, and now go after lots of players that have to comply with a data export request to get everything you want to know about someone.

    "originBody": "How to get your stuff repaired when the retailer and manufacturer don't wanna: take 'em to court A few weeks ago I was roasting some pumpkin for a delicious soup and towards the end of the cooking time the fan on the oven started into overdrive, making a lot of noise then it started beeping and popped up this obscure error message. I phoned the manufacturer, Electrolux, on the provided number and they told me I'd need to pay at least $160 to have their engineer come out and tell me what was wrong. You've probably had this experience with lots of stuff. \"Sorry, the item is out of warranty so you'll have to pay.\" The problem with this is that Australian Consumer Law gives an automatic warranty. You can expect the item to last a reasonable amount of time. Now an old fashioned light bulb shouldn't be expected to last a decade, but an oven? Challenged on this, I went around and around in circles with the Electrolux call centre worker. \"So you think an oven should only last for two years?\" and eventually I asked to be escalated to a manager who could actually make a decision. After some follow up, I finally got a call from a manager who was well drilled in shutting down any idea I should expect something from them. Eventually I said okay thanks, I'll see you at the Tribunal. How long should an appliance last? The \"warranty\" companies talk about is actually an \"express warranty\" and if you read them you'll notice these days they now include mandatory text about how they aren't able to exclude guarantees that come from the Australian Consumer Law. Anything they offer in their written warranty is in addition to your base rights. So you have a reasonable expectation that your appliance will last a reasonable amount of time. So how long is reasonable? Well if you look around on the web you'll find different lengths of time for different classes of appliance. And if you buy the cheapest Chinesium appliance, you shouldn't expect it to last as long as the exxy Miele model. So my Electrolux was a mid-range model bought in 2015, so it's about 9 years old. Hilariously the retailer's parent company has a blog post that gives explicit ranges for different appliances. Electric ovens should last 13 years according to them. Time to book a court date NSW (and I think all the other states) has a tribunal especially for consumer claims, what used to be the \"small claims court\" is now the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, NCAT. It's specifically designed to be low cost and straightforward. You shouldn't need a lawyer and can turn up with your documents. The important thing to know about tribunals like NCAT is you're paying mostly with your time. You'll need to front up on the booked date and make your case. There's a small filing fee: in this case it was $58, which is still a lot less than Electrolux wanted to charge just to tell me what the problem was. Before you book your date, you need to work out who is the other side of the transaction. You don't ordinarily go after the manufacturer but the retailer. So I contacted Appliances Online to talk it through. They took the same line as Electrolux that it was out of warranty and so not their problem. Again: see you in the Tribunal. I filled in the forms. They're annoyingly slow, but the online system mostly works. Paid my fee and bingo, out comes an email with a tribunal date and location. Amazing service, just add NCAT date And the next day I get a call from the lovely Dylan from Appliances Online, someone who's evidently empowered to make decisions that make tribunal appointments go away. He tells me he'll get Electrolux to invoice them instead, an appointment is booked and we're off to the races. One thing worth understanding is this: if the retailer has to send someone along to the Tribunal, they lose already. Even the cost of a junior lawyer going to the tribunal is going to be more than it would cost to repair your appliance. They might do it on principle if you're taking the piss but if you have a decent case they're wasting time and money. A couple of engineer visits Don't go cancelling your NCAT date just yet though! First you need the problem resolved. Remember, this could have all been resolved by them applying Australian Consumer Law when you first asked, so keep that clock ticking, it keeps things moving. I had a lovely engineer from Electrolux visit and take a look. He wasn't sure what the problem was: tested the fan and heater element and found no problem. In the end he replaced the light bulb (which hadn't worked for years, we hadn't bothered replacing it) and the message had gone away anyway. Next day the message is back, and Dylan drops me a note asking me to remove the NCAT booking. I respond saying it still isn't resolved and magically another engineer appointment pops up. The second visit does the trick. The engineer replaced the heating element and fan and the message has gone away. We've done a few baking projects since and all seems good! Satisfaction, but annoyed I have to assert my rights So my oven is fixed. Otherwise it's a great oven. It's annoying that I have to push to get my consumer rights though. It should just be standard! My hope is that by encouraging others to also assert their rights it'll become easier. Don't put up with this shit about appliances having a tiny warranty period!",

And I only purchase brands with a good reputation, like Feit and the like. reply surge 4 hours agorootparentThe rule of thumb I've found with light bulbs is similar to the Boots Theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory), which is you need to spend at least $8-$10 on a bulb to get something that will actually last. Feit is good but its hit or miss on life span, especially when I get them close to the same price and incandescent, often times its the little A/C to DC converter that dies (really need DC light circuits or dedicated converter in the light fixture). I feel its worth spending the extra to not replace them. reply SoftTalker 4 hours agorootparentHaving lived most of my life with incandescent bulbs which you could buy at four for a dollar if you watched for sales, the idea of paying $8-10 for a light bulb is insane to me. I have probably close to 50 bulbs in my house. But yes, the reasonably-priced LED bulbs don't last any longer than incandescents. I am replacing a few every year around the house. The saving grace is that they generate a lot less heat. I was in a house the other day that still had incandescent bulbs in the bathroom fixures, and could feel the heat from them as soon as I switched them on. reply brianshaler 3 hours agorootparentIn a bathroom, a hot lamp is likely intentional. It's typically on its own circuit for use while taking a hot shower. reply TonyTrapp 4 hours agorootparentprevThere's a variety of reasons: - Lower-quality components (especially capacitors) being used to meet the lower price point. This is by far the most common failure mode I have experienced, it's never the LEDs dying but the power supply. - Higher-quality LED light is usually result of driving the LEDs harder, causing them to fail earlier. - Probably some other reasons too. reply Frenchgeek 3 hours agorootparentThe design may also be completely ignoring heat dissipation, and cook its components. reply CapitalistCartr 4 hours agorootparentprevThe LEDs themselves are made in a handful of factories around the World and are usually robust. The power supplies are the weakness. Each bulb manufacturer makes their own, and it's a race to the bottom. reply Scoundreller 4 hours agorootparentprevAt least you have a fighting chance of fixing your LED bulb, unlike an incandescent. Usually they’re over-driven and you can jump a burned out LED and scrape off a bit of a resistor to reduce the amount of current going through to (over-)account for the reduced current need. https://youtu.be/JBKF7rKB3zc reply seventyone 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is definitive proof. They over-drive the LEDs which is why they die so quickly. If they were under-driven they last much much longer. It's the heat that kills them IIRC. reply kube-system 3 hours agorootparentThat design doesn't prove anything about any malicious intent to decrease the lifespan of the bulb, any more than it proves that they're optimizing lumens/dollar for the customers who want it. reply Dutchie987 3 hours agorootparentThey are optimizing dollars extracted per customer. Either that, or they are so incompetent designing electronics they shouldn't be allowed to. reply kube-system 3 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, electronics design does not operate outside the bounds of economics. Given a target retail price of ~$1.25/unit -- many of these bulbs are the best design possible. The existence of poor quality products does not indicate malice -- many buyers demand low end products. Cost/quality/performance is an engineering tradeoff without a \"correct\" answer. The answer is up to the opinion of the customer. reply Dutchie987 3 hours agorootparentI think that argument only holds when the customer is informed about those specific tradeoffs. The customer will choose the cheap bulbs because they can't be sure the expensive ones are better quality. They often aren't. Buyers want cheap bulbs, they don't want crap bulbs. If that means $1.25/unit is impossible, so be it. reply HeyLaughingBoy 1 hour agorootparent> They often aren't. And sometimes the better quality isn't worth the price. I bought a \"Coochear\" brushcutter on Amazon for a whopping $125 when my more expensive Husqvarna died due to a spun main bearing. At $125, I didn't care if it lasted longer than the time it would take me to remove the saplings that I needed to. The thing goes through 2\" trees like they weren't even there. Yeah, it vibrates a lot more than it should and runs really rich, but it works a lot better than I expected for that price. I know that I could have gotten another Husq that would work great but I really don't want to spend $600 for something that only gets used a couple times a year. reply kube-system 3 hours agorootparentprevOr alternatively, the customer simply DGAF about the quality of their $1.25 purchase. I have $1.25 bulbs in my home. I use them in unimportant locations with infrequent use. They are perfectly serviceable for this use. > The customer will choose the cheap bulbs because they can't be sure the expensive ones are better quality. They often aren't. This is a big problem for all consumer products. The root of the problem is that most consumers are wholly unqualified to be a judge of engineering quality themselves, few even know how to effectively obtain trustworthy information about quality, and those who do often value their time more than the effort required to do so. For larger purchases, some people who care to be informed will do some research, but I don't really think there's a solution for productsThe customer will choose the cheap bulbs because they can't be sure the expensive ones are better quality. This can't be understated. You never know with a bigger price tag if you are actually paying for a better build or just for branding + tidy profit. So you see two light bulbs with similar specs and the pictures on the box look indistinguishable.. unless you have specific experience or knowledge you are often doing yourself a favor to buy the cheaper one. Sometimes things are priced because they are actually better, but too often it is purely branding that justifies the price tag. Not specific to lightbulbs, but I've also noticed a trend where a more expensive product with a big name and obviously more of an ad/branding budget actually is better for a few years... and then at some random date the bottom drops out and the product becomes almost indistinguishable from cheaper options while the price tag remains the same. Or even increases if they have enough market share and brand recognition. reply Am4TIfIsER0ppos 1 hour agorootparentprevWTF do you mean?

Company X is going broke. Now, Company X must either invest in innovation or reduce the lifespan of its current offering. There's nothing inherently evil about this concept, but we tend to want to chalk it up to greed when Company X really just wants to survive and make a profit, which I suppose is the point. The problem is the concept is ripe for abuse. If Company X makes their product worse, but starts charging more while laying off employees, posting record profits during recessions, adopts unnecessary subscription models cosplaying as continued service and development, etc...now we get to the greed part. There seems to be a line between designing a product to secure the longevity of Company X and straight up using your customers as micro-transaction ATMs with planned obsolescence.

No, that's exactly the problem. Company X surviving isn't a good enough justification for it to start making shittier products. Especially when they don't inform the customers of the degradation. This is a business model problem, or perhaps a whole-market problem; papering over it with \"oh just a little planned obsolescence is good, because it lets the vendor survive\" is kind of a bailout, and prevents the problem from being corrected.

My experience: swan-neck kitchen taps all now seem to be quite different in design from one-another. To replace a washer, you have to dive under the sink, completely dismantle the tap, replace the washer, and re-assemble the tap. And the new taps start dripping after just a couple of years. So you have to hire a plumber; and he'll probably work faster (i.e. lower charges) if he's fitting a new tap than repairing an old one. So you might as well order a new tap before you call the plumber out. reply cafard 7 hours agorootparentprevSome do go broke. We rely on New York Replacement Parts for cartridges for our bathroom faucets, the original manufacturer being long out of business. Double-glazed windows may get blurry over the years, I guess, and then one would replace those. But that should take ten or more years. A properly protected door should last many years.

Yes, there was a cartel, but it was not all bad. There were legitimate reasons to go for 1000h light bulbs. reply Youden 9 hours agoparentprevIt wasn't as simple as them wanting to make more money: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7Bs98KmnY Key points from an AI summary: - Incandescent bulbs had to balance factors like light output, efficiency, and lifespan - hotter filaments produced brighter, whiter light but reduced bulb lifespan. - Longer-lasting bulbs were less efficient and produced dimmer, yellower light, so they were not simply \"better\" products being suppressed. - The 1,000 hour target was a reasonable compromise that balanced these competing priorities, not necessarily a sinister plot. - Even after the Phoebus cartel dissolved, the 1,000 hour lifespan remained the industry standard for general-purpose incandescent bulbs. reply jimmydorry 8 hours agorootparentYou're missing the fact that the Phoebus cartel fined members that sold lightbulbs lasting longer than 1,000 hours. Aftr reaching a stable equilibrium, it's not surprising that 1,000 hours remained the industry standard. It drove sales! [1] https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/cheeri... reply hmottestad 7 hours agorootparentThe reason for this, as I understand it, is that it's super easy to make a lightbulb that lasts 30 years. But there are two main trade-offs that make it bad for consumers: 1. Stronger filaments that last longer will be a lot less efficient, so the consumer ends up using a lot more electricity. 2. The filament doesn't burn per-say, but actually evaporates. This is why it'll eventually break. But where does the evaporated metal go? It condenses on the inner surface of the glass, making the lightbulb dimmer than when it was new. So 1000 hours is a good middle ground. The lightbulb is fairly efficient and 1000 hours isn't long enough for the inside of the glass to get too dark from the condensed filament metal. Price of the bulbs was also reasonably low. It's cheaper to change out a lightbulb every 1000 hours than the electricity costs of a 10 000 hour lightbulb that emits the same amount of visible light. I don't have hard numbers for that, but it's my understanding. Watch the youtube video linked by one of the grandparent comments. It's super informative and also contains some experiments to show the trade-offs. reply macNchz 5 hours agorootparentI really don't see this as a debunking of the idea that the cartel was set up primarily to increase profits among its members. The engineering tradeoffs make sense, but it doesn't follow that because of these tradeoffs, the companies manufacturing lightbulbs were compelled to set up an organization that fined its members for making bulbs that lasted too long. The tradeoffs explanation seems like a post-hoc justification for something that was clearly done with anti-competitive intent. Ultimately which scenario makes the most sense: that these businesses went through the time and effort to set up this testing organization out of a desire to ensure they all made better products for consumers, or out of a realization that they could all stabilize their revenues if they all sold products that would need to be replaced on a regular basis? This also strikes me as an area where consumer choice can be particularly effective: most of the attributes of a lightbulb aside from energy consumption are pretty tangible to the end user, and since they are fairly inexpensive and replaceable, the buyer is more able to evaluate them side by side than many other things. It makes total sense to me that the manufacturers would see this as a problem, and choose to limit consumer choice instead of competing to make better products. reply glenstein 2 hours agorootparentThis is a both can be true situation. Its legacy was a cartel oriented around protecting profits, but the coordination nevertheless also reflected an array of engineering compromises that made sense. The situation we have now is that those compromises continued to have a rationale beyond the existence of the cartel. reply tpmoney 4 hours agorootparentprevIf I remember right from the last time I looked into this, they also fined members for making bulbs that lasted shorter than 1000 hours. The goal was a standardized product, largely to protect regional sales agreements rather than any specific concerns about long bulb life vs sales. reply AnthonyMouse 7 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds like classic corporate bamboozlery. Find some real trade off that actually exists and then exaggerate its importance or pretend that no other solutions can be found when in fact they don't want solutions because the problem is profitable. Undoubtedly there are some alternate materials you could make a light bulb out of that present a trade off between longevity and efficiency. But there will also be materials that last a long time and have high efficiency. Moreover, even if they want to use the filament material that emits whiter light and then burns up faster, they could then use more of it so it still doesn't burn out quickly. But they don't want to do that, because it would cost marginally more and more importantly then you wouldn't have to buy as many light bulbs. It's no good to pretend this isn't possible. There isn't an inherent trade off between brightness and efficiency, because inefficiency is just the percentage of the electricity that goes to producing heat rather than light. At the same power consumption, a more efficient bulb is brighter. LEDs are rated as \"100W equivalent\" even though they consume ~20W. And the LEDs themselves last far longer than the equivalent incandescent light, but then they purposely combine them with a power converter that burns out much sooner. It's marketing, not physics. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparent> Undoubtedly there are some alternate materials you could make a light bulb out of that present a trade off between longevity and efficiency. You seem to be out of your depth here, while accusing people of propaganda. Anyway, no there aren't. The efficiency x longevity trade-off is inherent to the incandescent bulbs, you can't just wave all of Quantum Mechanics away. Material changes will increase or decrease the entire pair, and bulbs were already made with the best material that could possibly be used. And leds, of course are different. Anyway, nobody on the entire thread is denying that the cartel wanted to increase profits.

Additionally, the companies set up a whole compliance regime with bulb testing and fines, not for bulbs being too dim, but for bulbs that lasted too long, which I think clarifies the intent more than anything else. reply ndiddy 6 hours agorootparentThere were long-lasting bulbs on the shelf, but they were niche products because they produced poor quality light and were inefficient.

Electrical resistance is very similar for solid vs stranded conductors. reply mrWiz 3 hours agorootparentprevLower resistance per weight doesn't seem right to me. Spot checking a few values on a chart provided by a wire manufacturer[0] shows that stranded wire has greater resistance per weight.

You could say such a thing when talking about really small (micro/miniature) devices. But as size increases, the validity of such arguments rapidly goes down. A phone case/bumper for example - makes the device larger, yes - but increases strength while not hurting reparability. The \"problem\", imo, is two-fold: 1. Apple does not care too much about making repairs easy. If it costs $100 to make a board they can charge a customer $500 to repair, or $800 for a new phone, it's easy for them. 2. (Some) people prefer sleeker designs. Samsung has its active range of phones, CAT makes durable phones - but many prefer a smaller thickness/bezel etc. This means that when tech improves to make smaller bezels, manufacturers decrease the bezel a little and add protective padding a little... haha no. It's only bezel reduction. Because it sell, I suppose. For example gorilla glass/protective glass has improved in technology, but thinner screens (for thinner devices) have eaten up the benefits of stronger tech. The real \"killer\" argument? The presence of companies like Framework. I'm typing this out on my FW13 & its build quality is really good.

The thing is, all the theories of communication for persuasion (Social Judgement Theory and Elaboration Likelihood Model mostly) boil down to \"hear your audience\". If you really want to convince or persuade anyone, the starting point is to understand what's in the head of the audience you are trying to persuade. It's not often easy to get this information, so you start by expressing your views and carefully listening to the answers and arguments of those who have different views. So if you have a chance to get the arguments in advance – before communicating your opinion – it's a blessing. It's a free lunch for persuasive communication. You're given people's opinions and arguments on the plate, basically. And here this free lunch is thrown away just to be replaced with \"here is my opinion and I don't care about arguments\" communication style.

That isn't compatible with a model where regulators are trying to run the economy, because then the regulators get captured by industry and thwart rather than protect competition, and competition can't save you from needing complicated rules if it is not present. And those kinds of complex competition-destroying regulations are showing up everywhere, including in the US. Conversely, the model in the EU is to not care a lot about small businesses and just regulate the large ones. But that model isn't really compatible with free trade. You can't impose expensive regulations on domestic companies and then put them into competition with countries that don't do that and expect them to succeed. But people want to have their cake and eat it too. They want the expensive regulations but not the correspondingly higher prices, and then the stuff they buy gets made in China where the rules don't exist (or exist on paper but the government waives them in order to capture the market). If you want to have the rules without destroying domestic industry then you have to impose them on the manufacturers of imported products too. Which would actually help the US increase competition, because the regulations would then shackle global megacorps that want to sell into the EU but not smaller domestic US companies that don't. But then foreign-produced stuff sold in the EU would cost as much as domestically-produced stuff -- a boon to local industry but higher prices on local consumers, and apparently they're not willing to suffer the latter. reply bluefirebrand 5 hours agorootparent> The problem is people keep trying to stamp the diversity out. I'm very cynical about this \"diversity is our strength\" stuff In my opinion the problem is that society has been working hard to reduce \"diversity\" to mean different skin colors, genitals or sexual preferences, with a sprinkling of different cuisine. What most people refer to as diversity is very superficial Diversity of ideas, diversity of politics, diversity of beliefs are still not very popular The idea seems to be that the superficial diversity automatically produces the meaningful diversity, but I don't think that is true reply account42 2 hours agorootparentWell said. And ironically \"diversity\" is a topic where diverse opinions are often met with particularily hard scorn. reply throwaway7ahgb 6 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't the US allow \"diversity\" by allowing different states to pass laws that their residence find important? I'm pretty sure CA has some specific right to repair laws. Also, this (to me) is a strange use for the word diversity. reply AnthonyMouse 6 hours agorootparentStates and localities can pass their own laws but they can't remove the federal ones, and federal laws preempt state laws. Naturally large corporations then make a point to capture the federal regulators. reply vlovich123 5 hours agorootparentIt can be slightly more complicated with things like CARB which has an explicit waiver in the Clean Air Act to enact its own standards and given how big it is it basically ends up setting de facto standards for the state (it’s one of the big complaints from Republican states). A similar issue comes up around education although things are a bit more even there with Texas and Florida also using the size of their markets to set their version of education standards. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentprevThe difference of culture between different parts of the world fosters bigger legal variations. reply gpderetta 6 hours agorootparentprevDo US consumers buy less Made In China stuff than EU ones? According to ustr.gov, US imports from China in 2022 were worth $562.9 billion. According to eurostat EU imports from China were 627.3€ billion, so a significant difference (note the currency). As a rate of the total import/export they are actually quite comparable. reply AnthonyMouse 6 hours agorootparentIt \"shouldn't\" be a problem for the US to do that, because it's supposed to be minimizing regulatory overhead and promoting competition so its companies are globally competitive. Importing something from a country because they have a large labor market is a different thing than importing things from that country because your country imposes high regulatory overhead on domestic producers but not on foreign imports. This also gets back to my point about the US increasingly failing at its ideal of not imposing high regulatory overhead. reply Y_Y 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm often guilty of missing mistakes in my own posts, but as a PSA: please proofread your posts, especially if using prediction on a phone.

It's also a great consumer friendly regulation! reply madaxe_again 7 hours agoparentprevIt’s trivial for companies to avoid complying. Meta don’t, for instance. They sell their quest headsets throughout Europe, but offer no warranty or support in many European countries in which they sell them, which is illegal under the EU CRD. I foolishly bought one, knowing the risk - and it stopped working after a week, and that’s the end of the story - they refused to do a return or exchange, said I could ship it at my own expense, which I tried, only for them to “lose” the inbound package. They received it from the courier, mislaid it - my problem. They then kindly offered to ship a replacement controller at my expense (€150), but only to a different country, not to where I live. They then “lost” that too, forcing me to do a chargeback to get my money back, as despite having no proof of delivery to me, they insisted it had been. As to “take them to court” - they know damned well that it’s not worth it to spend €10,000+ on legal fees over a €500 piece of electronics, which is why they knowingly and willingly act illegally. The EU needs a simple, pan-European way to deal with bad actors, or it’s just meaningless legislation that provides no protection to consumers. reply valicord 5 hours agorootparent> offer no warranty or support in many European countries in which they sell them Do you mean that you can buy it from the manufacturer website and have it shipped directly to a country where it's not released officially? Or are you taking about third party retailers selling grey market units? reply madaxe_again 3 hours agorootparentI’m talking about buying from a reputable third party retailer (Amazon) who reasonably passed the buck for RMA support to meta - and ultimately, if you sell your product in an EU country, or allow the sale of your product in an EU country via a retailer, you are liable to provide support for that product. reply tossandthrow 7 hours agorootparentprevDid you do a charge back on the card used for the purchase? reply madaxe_again 7 hours agorootparentOnly for the purchase of the replacement controller that they lost in transit, as I had proof that that was delivered to the wrong address in the wrong country - the original purchase, no, as my bank said I could just return it to them for a refund, and I had to exhaust that first - but because they wouldn’t accept a return, I couldn’t be seen to have exhausted that option by the bank.

I’d have to go to a higher court, and again, the calculus here is that it’s not worth the consumer’s time - I don’t want to spend years and thousands of euro fighting over it - so the quest just went in the trash, and I’ll never buy anything from them again. reply drra 6 hours agorootparentThe European Small Claims Procedure[1] might be helpful.

I was not aware of this - will give it a go, thanks! reply bartread 6 hours agoprevI mean, litigation is fine and all, but what you can do will vary by jurisdiction. In the past 14 months I've had to deal with two misbehaving insurance companies, one misbehaving utility provider (overcharging), and a few other things as well that I don't really want to talk about here. I did not get to the point of actually having to take legal action but I did have to threaten it in two cases, along with action from the relevant ombudsmen. Nothing like this, or on this scale, has ever happened to me before (once, about thirty years ago, I had to threaten a company with small claims for unpaid wages, but that's it). There are, to an extent, processes you have to follow before you can get to the point where you are within your rights to threaten to throw the legal book at companies. You usually have to have gone through their complaints procedures and got to what you consider an unsatisfactory result. This in itself can take weeks or months of emailing back and forth, phone calls, etc. You gradually escalate your approach, you cover the internet in bad reviews, you contact your local MP and the local media, and so it goes on. Its an exhausting and kafkaesque shitshow and this is with the backing of authorities, such as ombudsmen, who operate with the backing of legislation. I understand why you have to do it: because some consumers are vexatious and dishonest. But it takes too long (elapsed) and it takes far too much time (effort) that could be better spent with family and friends (as an example). I am currently gearing myself up to deal with the other insurance company, who I haven't so far had to threaten with legal action, and file a police complaint due to some new information that's come to light that shows our insurers, and the advice they gave us, in a very bad light. Honestly, I don't know if I can be bothered any more. Taking the actions that I have, well, I wouldn't say they've left us better off, but they've left us much less worse off, because we haven't been taken for mugs... but the cost to my sanity and my soul. I don't know if the juice has always been worth the squeeze. And that, of course, is what these companies bank on: that you'll get tired of it all and stop bothering them. It's extremely scummy behaviour, and frustrates me that I have to get to the point of threatening them with legal action just to get them to do the right thing. I strongly resent being forced to act like an asshole just to get a fair outcome. I welcome any legislation that helps consumers get to a fair outcome more easily, but I also suggest that we need to look at the question of the obfuscatory tactics companies use to force consumers to jump through ridiculous hoops first. reply jopsen 10 hours agoprevAsking a warranty repair on a 9 years old oven is a bit of a stretch. I doubt it'd fly in the EU. reply justinclift 9 hours agoparentFrom the article, the parent company themselves clearly say 13 years for ovens. To quote from that article on the parent company's website: According to the American National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) - who helpfully released research called the Study of Life Expectancy of Home Components - the contemporary average lifespans are as follows: • Fridges - 13 years • Dishwashers - 9 years • Electric ovens - 13 years • Gas stoves - 15 years • Microwaves - 9 years • Dryers - 13 years http://web.archive.org/web/20240318135242/https://www.winnin... reply dbetteridge 10 hours agoparentprevWhich is entirely irrelevant in Australia as the consumer law is based on expectations and the value of the item.

On one hand this seems rather short to me, on the other hand, it's kind of a \"you get what you pay for\" affair. I don't really know what profit margins manufacturers have, but when I worked for a store profit margins for us really weren't all that big for us (and also didn't scale as much with price as many people assume). reply Denvercoder9 9 hours agorootparentNote that this table comes from \"Techniek Nederland\", which is a business association of (among others) technical retailers. They've an interest in lowering the expected lifespan of appliances, as that means their members have less warranty to provide. They actually note (probably for legal reasons) along with their table that it contains average usage, not expected lifespan (i.e. how long people use things before they replace it, as opposed to how long you could use it before it breaks). Courts will, and have in the past, throw this table out, if you make a reasonable argument why you could expect a longer lifespan. reply arp242 9 hours agorootparentIt was linked from the ACM or consumentenbond, or some such consumer website. I don't have the tab open, but it wasn't just a random link from Google. But yeah, it's just a guideline like I said. Some people here are throwing out numbers such as a \"15 years\" or \"decades\" with no qualifiers, and I'm not sure if that's reasonable for a €230 oven (cheapest in a quick check). Aside on retailers: I haven't worked in a store in 15 years, but back then a lot of manufacturers just said \"lol fuck you\" when you tried to claim warranty above their stated warranty period. It was typically up to the retailers to bear the costs. One (of several) reason we left the consumer business: it's hard to compete as a small independent store for many different reasons, and this just made it that much harder. You can't spread out the costs, and you have almost no leverage against Asus or HP. In short, at least back then the manufacturers could just keep shipping wank without really suffering too much damage to their bottom line, and the retailers with essentially no power to change anything were getting screwed. I don't know if that's changed, but probably not. reply Denvercoder9 9 hours agorootparent> It was linked from the ACM or consumentenbond, or some such consumer website. I don't have the tab open, but it wasn't just a random link from Google. Yes, it gets often quoted, but things don't become true by being often repeated. It probably wasn't the Consumentenbond, as they actively call out the list from Techniek Nederland (previously Uneto-VNI) as being too short on their website.

These price/lifespan things are cow manure and made by trade associations and have no value in law. 200 euro also says nothing: 200 euro for a small tabletop oven is extremely expensive, for a large build-in one it's cheap. Considering as well it's usually a build in one, you can expect to not have to change it every two years. reply bzzzt 10 hours agorootparentprevNote that this doesn't mean you get 8 years of warranty on an expensive oven. Just that if it fails in 4 years you still can claim 50% of the purchase price. reply Denvercoder9 9 hours agorootparentThis is not true. You have the right to a \"deugdelijk product\" (good product) for the entire expected lifespan of the product, and if it breaks in that, they do have to fix it (or provide a comparable replacement). If, however, for whatever reason you don't want that, you can't demand all your money back, but only 50%. That's only if you agree to the money though, the seller can't unilaterally choose to give you 50% back instead of repairing it. reply jopsen 9 hours agorootparentprev> how long do you think an oven should last? 30 years :) But I actually think it's fine that the warranty shorter than 9 years. Even, if I agree that 2 years (as is common) is too short. reply Jamie9912 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my opinion, maybe 20 years at the very least reply cornel_io 10 hours agorootparentprev9 years is a lot to expect it to be under warranty... reply memen 10 hours agorootparentWarranty is not the same as reasonable expected lifetime. Under warranty, the burden of proof is at the manufacturers side. The 2 years is typical for electric appliances, but it is from jurisprudence only. The law actually states that it should last as long as can reasonably expected. Intentionally vague, but yes, I would expect an oven to last longer than 2 years! In fact, we should be able to build ovens that last a lifetime. And not only ovens, there are many appliances and gear that can easily be made to last a lifetime, except for some wearing parts. However, many companies that did this were competed to bankruptcy by cheap low quality competing products. With the abundance of low(er) quality products, we tend to expect a shorter lifetime. reply VBprogrammer 7 hours agorootparentI recently replaced an element on our oven. It's 5 years old. Honestly, if manufacturers could make some of that stuff standardised I'd be quite happy to replace or pay to have them replaced. As it happens there are thousands of different shapes of \"heating elements shaped to go around the fan\". Same with the brushes in our washing machine I changed a while back. Finding the right replacement took more work than actually doing the replacing. reply promiseofbeans 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you've been conditioned by anti-consumer companies who want you to BUY BUY BUY to expect that. Ovens should last 20 years or more, and if you're sold a faulty product, it's fair to expect it to be fixed. Luckily there are still a few countries at the bottom of the world with good consumer legislation. reply cbmuser 10 hours agorootparentYou do realize that in the end the manufacturers will just increase prices or move production to low-wage countries, no? reply Dylan16807 9 hours agorootparentYes, they'll increase per-unit prices to do a longer warranty. But that price increase will go into longer-lasting parts, because that costs a lot less than needing to replace every unit halfway through the warranty period. And since the 20 year oven is a lot cheaper to build than two 10 year ovens, the per-year price to the consumer will go down. reply graemep 10 hours agorootparentprevHow will moving production to low wage countries help?

    "originBody": "On being laid off & unplanned entrepreneurship June, 2024🧅 🤠 🐂Peter Askew 〰 it’s weird to look back; I sometimes get confused on how I got here 〰 Whiteside Mountain in Highlands NC Most folks dream of being entrepreneur; “a path that seemed inevitable“, they say. None of that shit applies to me. I’m only here cause I kept getting laid off and that nonsense infuriated me. I treated my first layoff as a joke, as I’d seen them in movies & TV; “now they’re happening to me – how funny“. My second felt like a whispered “fuck-you”, as the company had been acquired and I was deemed useless. The third and fourth scrambled my brain and forced me down a path I never intended to travel. I’m only here cause I had to save myself. I remember thinking: I can’t trust them anymore; I gotta figure out a way to generate revenue myself; from my own business; that I control. Online preferably. That’s where I started. Daunting for someone with a History degree. I had no other choice. So, I took stock of my background at that moment. Web analytics, Paid Search, and pittance of SEO. Ok, I’ll start there. I’ll skip coding for now. I’d recently been exposed to a new online ad network, that paid by lead and/or click. I had previously implemented it on a company’s website & it generated around $30-$50 a day for them. Sounds good to me, let’s try something like that. Since I couldn’t code, I couldn’t launch a website. So the gears of my dusty cobweb cranium began to turn. What can I do that doesn’t require coding? Eventually, a thought bubbled up: Well, what’s stopping me from signing up for one of those ad networks, and then going to a search engine, typing a popular search term, digging through the organic results, searching for sites WITHOUT advertising, emailing them to request ad rates, and implementing //my own// ad pixel there. There wasn’t a damn thing stopping me. So I started doing that (with the hopes the website owner never found out about said ad network, as I could be cut out of loop). This was late 2003. I needed a topic. Alot of people seemed to search for tourism information online, so I leaned into that corner. Began searching broad terms & phrases in any search engine. My thought was, if site is in top ten results for major keyword, then it’s safe to say they’re receiving a significant (enough) amount of traffic. I’d search ‘Aruba’, and would email every site that fit the bill. “Do you accept advertising? If so, what are your rates?” I’d search ‘Bahamas’ & repeat process. Then ‘Key West’. And on and on. I’d get a nibble occasionally. I’d reply asking their traffic levels & monthly ad rates. Then I’d napkin math whether I’d be able to cover *their* ad expense & (possibly) generate profit with my own ad revenue from the network (which was guesstimated, on my part). Oftentimes, the numbers wouldn’t work. Until the owner of a Cancun travel website replied. His rate was $50/month to advertise. His site ranked well for several Cancun related terms & received significant traffic. I estimated my ad unit, if placed in a certain section on the page, would receive 2% CTR. Then I multiplied that number by his daily traffic levels, and guesstimated $5-$8 of revenue per day. I remember thinking I was going to get hosed on the deal, but me being me, I kept going. He asked what type of ads I’d run. I didn’t know, as they were dynamically generated based on the content of the site/page. I told him “several travel & tourism promotions targeted to Cancun“. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ That worked for him, so I began paying $50 a month, and shot him my ad pixel to implement. Off-the-bat, the darn thing began generating $300-$350 a month. The ads were perfectly targeted. Cancun hotels. Swim with dolphins. Paragliding. Cruises. Most months I was clearing $300/month profit (after ad expenses to the website owner). I couldn’t fukkin believe it. It was my mini-watershed moment; exposing me to the fact that, yes, dolt-brain me could do this. If I could generate revenue from this disgustingly duct-taped business model, I could do it in other fashions online. I just didn’t know what those fashions were yet. One thing I did know: I gotta learn how to code This was the avenue hanging me up & intimidating me. I was currently advertising on other folks websites. That they built. They hosted. They managed. I had to mimic that same position. And that meant coding, launching, & managing my own sites. Outside of its complexities, coding tripped me up cause it required a basic tenet that I typically veered away from: basic reading. I don’t mind reading, I just don’t like doing it, I find it difficult to focus (I’m more of a distinguished MAD Magazine type of reader). I’d rather watch a video tutorial, listen to an audiobook, or have someone side-by-side explaining things. Those avenues didn’t quite exist back then; so I had to get creative. Instead of lamenting & bemoaning my position, I decided to throw out all the rules and ✨ just start building a website although I didn’t know how ✨. I’d figure out the rest once I started. Someone told me ‘hosting’ was required, so I bought a cheap package and began to poke around. Once I skipped the documentation, I discovered they had a ‘ticket’ system where they allowed customers to submit support questions. Huhmm. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Ticket #1: from: Peter message: please help me get a website online (╯˘ -˘ )╯ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ … and – God bless them – they replied. That’s where I learned about the “index.html” file. They became my unpaid tutors. Volleying countless questions on how all this stuff works. What the hell a domain name was. How to update my DNS. File transfer protocol. They pushed me far enough where I became comfortable researching myself. Googling questions. Forum questions. Twitter. Asking friends. All of it. Hell, my friend Charles Lumpkin educated me on the wonders of atag. From there, I got a basic one-page website online. Hand-coded. I felt like trashcan-Superman. Then I channeled my advertising/marketing background. “What’s a website I can build that might generate ad revenue & serve small businesses?” My father’s friend worked in the Yellow Pages industry, and always remarked how profitable that business model was. We were still in early internet days (2004’ish), so I mused how I could mimic that industry online. In other words, create a central directory bringing buyers & sellers together. Buyers searching for services; businesses providing those services. I liked this simple model, so I swung that way. I grabbed a Yellow Pages book in my apartment, opened it up, and began to flip through. In those days, basic listing were free, but businesses could advertise large rectangle ads in their category. As I fanned through the pages, I’d keep an eye out for sections with heavy ad promotion (as it indicated an industry that understood the value of advertising). I found a few. Windshield repair. Limos. Carpet cleaning. Self storage. Pest control. And on and on. Then, I’d buy an ugly domain & create an online directory of that category (ie. pest control), mixed in with geography based terms for seo, like ‘atlanta pest control’. And on that page, I’d curate several atlanta pest control operators, and list all their contact info. About as basic & boring of a site as you can get. But simple to navigate, and no hoops to jump through. Then, as I further began to code, I discovered the wonders of “view page source”. I could right-click, copy & paste another website’s syntax into my editor; monkey with that updated design; then upload it to my server. Tables & rows, mainly. I’d swap out the logo; change the background color; the width of the container; manually add new pages. My trashcan-Superman aura was morphing into trashcan-Zeus. It felt like walking through a deep fog treasure-chest where I could only touch & feel what was directly in front of me, and each outcome was bizarrely fascinating. An ape could have designed better, yes, but I was proud. Then traffic began trickling in. From outreach; from sponsorships I placed; from seo stuff; from all kinds of marketing endeavors. I began offering premium listings; businesses began signing up; I’d charge them through Paypal (no Stripe back then). Then I began adding those ad networks (I mentioned above). And more revenue began to appear. A somewhat consistent monthly recurring revenue stream. I was still working 9-5, but an escape hatch was coming into focus. A path to avoid someone else’s bonehead business decision which kneecaps a company & executes my career. The glitter of fancy salaries had already grown dim – that hook they’d dangle to entrap me. I yearned for my own {mini} golden goose that provided the independence I was blindly searching for. The Rage Against The Machine lyric often came to mind: “Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin’ ’em”. [src] My development path accelerated when I discovered WordPress. Most hosts had one-click installation. WP had recently added the ability to create ‘Pages’, so I moved my development focus inside that petri dish. The pre-built themes (free & paid) were a boon to my design inadequacies. I built more sites ~ nights & weekends ~ thanks to WordPress. But that became time consuming, so I began *buying* fully developed websites, direct from mom & pop operators via cold email. Usually informational sites. Then I could expand the content based on search volume trends and incorporate small bits of advertising. AppalachianTrail.com circa 2008’ish (now sold) AppalachianTrail.com was a good example. I cold emailed the owner a $3,000 offer for the site & domain. I received no reply, which was normal. Until I did receive a reply; 30 days later; accepting the offer. I further built the site out & it began generating around $500/month for me. What I kept noticing, though, when I’d transfer a site under my wing, I’d {immediately} focus on domain transfer, as control of that asset dictated ownership of the site. These domain ‘things’ seemed intriguing, so I dug deeper. I discovered the expiring domain name market. A universe where 50k-100k domains expire & auction every day. There, I discovered the impact of a blue chip, descriptive .com domain name ~ especially in development. An unfair advantage that allows small players to punch up. I remember sitting in a pizza joint with my friend Allen Graber, grabbing lunch one day. At some point, he stepped away from the table and my mind was wandering. Dissecting my path to that point, and trying to stitch together what it all meant, and if there was a next step. And a thought surfaced: Why not just wait. Sit and wait. And watch the expiry lists. For a premium .com domain to expire, that has development potential. I was in no rush. That seemed to jive with my inner-nature. I’d already witnessed a few gorilla .com’s go up, so I understood others could as well. I’d just need to empty my mind and wait for the pull to arrive. The pull came in 2009. The domain was marvelous. A group in NY state abandoned ‘DudeRanch.com’, and I acquired at auction for $17,949. It provided the backbone for me to build a vacation marketplace for that historic industry. An environment where I could shepherd vacationers towards dude ranches that met their needs. And monetize the asset through premium (highlighted) listings that paid me a flat-fee per year. The mild success I achieved there allowed me to quit the 9-5. It opened me to more projects. More domains. And opened me to empty myself into these endeavors. I didn’t raise any money for these projects. I funded them with my 9-5 salary. Solo. And the reason for that was simple – why on earth would I vehemently abandon boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the 9-5 world only to raise money & adopt a board of boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the startup world. If I’m gonna build, I’m gonna have free-rein decision making to pursue any and all ludicrous business models, with no oversight. If I fail, fine. That’s on me. If it works, son-of-a-gun, my job will feel like play. I still to this day, over 20 years later, experience the sting from those layoffs. The check-mate move that I couldn’t counter. I had no plan, but I started. I had no goal; I just got going. I guess I’m still going; I don’t quite know where. But I’m quite content. And thankful. It appears peace of mind is the prize I’m pursuing. it’s weird to look back.

    "commentBody": "Being laid off and unplanned entrepreneurship (deepsouthventures.com)318 points by eightturn 7 hours agohidepastfavorite125 comments ilamont 3 hours agoHad an epiphany like this after an earlier startup project failed, which my cofounder and I had tried to do following the formulaic approaches advocated by various accelerators, investors, and experts (often people with zero experience running a startup, but had been involved as angels after BigCo stock options vested, and then got into mentoring local accelerators). I hated the startup theater, pitching, networking, and accelerator applications including YC and TechStars and MassChallenge. My cofounder flaked. I wound down business #1, returned most of the investor capital, and then started out on #2, determined to do things completely differently. For #2, I had 3 criteria: 1) Prototype on my own, without an engineer 2) Don't just talk lean, do lean 3) The product must generate revenue from day 1 While I am not an engineer, I had strong enough digital skills to set up websites and leverage other tools to prototype. Month 1 was building the prototype, month 2 was getting it out to the marketplace and actually getting some early sales ... and then plowing that money back into the business to improve the product. 10+ years later, the business brings in a respectable middle class income, has helped put my kids through college, and, as TFA articulated, lets me \"pursue any and all ludicrous business models, with no oversight.\" Like a lot of people who bootstrap, I had to consult as well (still do, mainly as a hedge against platform risk). I am eternally grateful to my spouse who not only has an income to help support the family, but also good health insurance (more on this below, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40707068). reply aunty_helen 2 hours agoparentThe career accelerator people kill me. Honestly why do I want to hear from someone who's biggest risk was getting a job talking to people taking big risks. I have a similar startup backstory to this, for my second venture I went fully to the get paid to do your work camp. It's still hard, harder than anything I've ever done, but it's working out. reply grecy 3 hours agoparentprev> but also good health insurance. I'm always amazed how blatantly clear it is that having health insurance tied to employment specifically discourages this kind of entrepreneurship, and the ability to \"strike out on your own\". Literally handcuffs keeping people at their jobs. reply ilamont 3 hours agorootparentIt really is a detriment to entrepreneurship in the U.S., as well as early retirement for those who have saved up enough money but are locked into a job until Medicare kicks in at 65. One other observation: During the pandemic my spouse left her job to work with me full time. We had COBRA (health insurance based on her previous plan per federal law) for 18 months, which was great. Then we had to go to the open health marketplace. What a freaking disaster that was. If you make any sort of middle class income, which we did through my business, you don't qualify for any breaks in our state's marketplace (Massachusetts Health Connector). The broker database they had for small businesses insurance was a joke - no one ever returns your call; it seems they are looking for midsized businesses where their commission will be larger. I spent many hours comparing family plans on the Massachusetts Health Connector and eventually decided to bypass the marketplace and purchase insurance directly from the insurance company because it was a little less expensive and had a slightly lower deductible (but was still sky-high compared to COBRA/her previous employer's plan). We got reamed on the monthly insurance cost as well as the crazy-high deductible. She eventually went back to her old employer, and one of the primary reasons was getting access to affordable health insurance without crushing OOP costs. reply aftbit 2 hours agorootparentprevAlright here are three health care reforms that we could implement without going all the way to Universal Health Care: 1. Anyone who pays cash for a procedure should pay a price that is no more than the lowest price that any insurance company has negotiated for the same service. 2. Anyone who buys a health care plan from the marketplace should get a price that is no more than 10% higher than the cheapest negotiated price any company pays for the same plan. 3. Anyone should be able to deduct the cost of health care for income tax purposes, not just companies that buy health insurance for their employees. reply JohnAaronNelson 12 minutes agorootparentIt’s not as easy in reality as theory. 1) Services are often unique per patient. Even for patients with the same ICD-10 codes, the quality of service will vary. Hospitals cost different amounts to run. If you always peg the price to the lowest, it will be a race to the bottom for quality of service. 2) Patients are unique, with different health profiles, with different preferences for paying. Markets are different. Some markets only have one insurance payer. 3) Healthcare is already tax deductible reply johnkpaul 2 minutes agorootparentRegarding #3, do you mean in the United States? That's not generally true. Your health insurance premiums, under normal employer plans, are not tax deductible, but they are paid pre-tax. Additional out of pocket healthcare expenditure is only deductible if you itemize your deductions and you're only allowed to deduct medical expenditures in excess of 7.5% of your income (AGI to be technical). heyoni 2 hours agorootparentprevIs that universal healthcare with extra steps? Almost, but on a serious note, why not go all the way with universality? reply brink 9 minutes agorootparentBecause universal healthcare is not the best solution, as is becoming increasingly evident in Canada and the UK. We need to fix the price gouging in the medical system by incentivizing competition. With the way things are currently set up in the US, the hospitals are essentially written a blank check any time a patient steps foot on their premises. If we bring competition between the hospitals with price transparency, the prices will fall dramatically. reply Spooky23 1 hour agorootparentprevOr just have Medicare for everyone. The current scheme only benefits rich people whose ability to pay outrageous insurance rates is easy and less than taxes. Poor people get substandard care, middle class workers get boned. I spend more on healthcare than taxes, and half my taxes are paying for stupid healthcare, either directly or through proxy. reply kovezd 2 hours agorootparentprevThose are fair. But why impose them through regulations? Entrepreneurs see business potential on this arbitrage opportunities. reply marcus0x62 1 hour agorootparentWell, for starters, two things come to mind: 1. The healthcare and health insurance marketplace is riddled with regulation. There is no such thing as offering a health insurance plan or a healthcare service in the United States absent any regulation. Every existing service is, more or less, imposed via regulation. 2. The current health insurance system dates, in its current form, either to shortly after WWII or to the adoption of the ACA, depending on your perspective. That’s somewhere between 14 and 75 years. Where are the plans you speak of from these entrepreneurs? What are they waiting for, letting all of this sweet, sweet, arbitrage pass them by? Biding their time? Toward what end? reply aksss 1 hour agorootparentprevAll else being equal, I'd rather see the pricing pressure done by market competition rather than enforced price caps benchmarked against some metric controlled by the industry (see Medicare Part D - gov. negotiates hard to only reimburse xx%, drug industry says fine, we'll just raise the book price - you'll get your talking point, and we'll still get our asking price). So more significantly: * bring back association health plans across state lines and industries, so small businesses can band together for group rates. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/biden-admin... * Expand Direct Primary Care. https://www.dpcare.org/ * Allow primary care physicians, dentists, etc. to offer services without a state board providing \"certification of need\". This seems to just be gate-keeping / moat-building. I'm not saying either or all of these are a perfect solution (nor do I think we need to find that solution immediately). As a small business owner, they'd make the health insurance handcuff problem easier to navigate by driving costs down. I will say this - flying solo without health insurance does make you a FAR better consumer of healthcare services. You will comparison shop (made easier by price transparency rules). You will critically consider the necessity of gratuitous tests / procedures. You will learn that doctors are running profit-minded businesses like everyone else. It also makes you reconsider some life choices (re: physically risky behavior). I think the biggest fear I faced was the lack of catastrophic coverage (cancer, etc.). When we didn't have insurance (both small business owners) my wife and I probably consumed less than $1000 of direct services combined, per year. That part (direct pay for services used) was fine. Walking the tightrope without a safety net for expensive medical developments was our biggest risk. With kids it's even less of an option to operate that way. I've known many that have returned to corporate jobs for this reason alone. reply matwood 3 hours agorootparentprevYep. I’ve been saying for awhile now that universal healthcare would likely lead to one of the biggest small business booms ever. Not only does it help people strike out on their own, but makes easier/cheaper for them to hire. reply kingTug 2 hours agorootparentSame for housing. In Tokyo median rent price for a 1BR is $600-$700. No onerous contracts either with month-to-month rental options.

It's a great system for them. reply rbultje 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople don't appreciate how expensive health insurance in the US is. A high-quality PPO plan for a whole family on the open market can cost $4k/month. reply generic92034 3 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand startup culture and entrepreneurship are much more common in the US, compared with the EU. But the latter does not tie health insurance to employment, in most countries. Probably other factors are more important. reply sanderjd 2 hours agorootparentI don't think so. I think it means other factors are also very important. I think both things are true, that we're getting a bunch of things right toward a successful entrepreneurial culture, but are also getting this one thing massively wrong and leaving a huge amount of further potential on the table! reply no_wizard 3 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't mean Universal Healthcare wouldn't be a net win for entrepreneurship. We should unlock all barriers to entry that we possibly can reply ThePowerOfFuet 2 hours agorootparentIt's a net win for everyone except the middlemen. reply aksss 1 hour agorootparentI think to have an honest conversation about universal healthcare is to admit that it would cause health care rationing. Costs would be tighter across the board, and the best experiences of health care services enjoyed with (many) corporate plans would degrade, relatively speaking (unless supplemental private insurance continues). Doctors would probably make less profit, not just insurers. I think it's okay to talk honestly about that. There's a LOT of waste and purely indulgent service in the current system. And as a person striking out on a business venture, I don't need concierge health services. I need a health safety net. I think it hurts the conversation about UHC when that's waved away - telling people that they'll be bringing the best of low deductible in-network, gratuitously provided services to everyone. UHC isn't about bringing great service to everyone, it's about bringing a higher level of minimal coverage to everyone. reply anoncow 2 hours agorootparentprevUniversal Healthcare in the US will negatively impact entrepreneurship. reply sanderjd 2 hours agorootparentWhy? reply jhawleypeters 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat are some good examples of countries with a different healthcare policy and more entrepreneurship, small businesses, and/or craftspeople than the USA? reply ilamont 1 hour agorootparentTaiwan has a solid national health insurance plan.

I'm very lucky to have had multiple interactions with folks in that thread as well as having contacts that have raised funds and sold businesses... the advice is a resounding \"not really doable\" outside of a friends & family fundraise. All of this to say, I admire Peter (have read his writings previously) and I share the same feelings quoted above although I am still willing to entertain outside investors (and all that comes with that) for the chance to have agency in executing a software business with less \"lose my house\" risk. For the same reason I would also take a leadership position at a startup.

They bullshitted the right sounding bullshit to a specific audience who absolutely laps up particular flavors of bullshit.

Can basically build anything but committing to an idea is the sticking point. What product would you want to start with today? reply llmblockchain 4 hours agorootparentI'm unsure if my advice is any good, but it's what worked for me. Here's the general thought process/flow I use. 1) Start by picking your customer. Pick a customer that is easy to find and has a clear channel to access them. For example, maybe I want to target sales people. I know a lot of sales folks use LinkedIn, seems like an easy channel to them. edit: Also, pick a customer that _pays_ for things. B2B-type customers. You don't want to be selling a product to teenagers, developers or anyone that doesn't like to pay for solutions :) 2) Don't invent anything new. Pick a well established idea/business that is already being done (and most importantly, people are paying for). Continuing on the sales example, I know sales people often pay for technographic data. There are plenty of SaaS products out there selling that kind of data. I build a list of them. 3) Scope the product down to its bare essentials. What exactly are the sales people buying? The products probably have a lot of fluff that isn't needed. Get rid of it. This is a good time to talk to the target customer. It can be nice to hear their complaints about the products they are currently using, etc. 4) Finally, build the product and ship it. Get the initial version out quickly and keep refining it. reply codazoda 4 hours agorootparentprevReach out if you want to start a conversation. I'm thinking maybe a Slack for people at this stage.

That's the same idea of people's \"potential [being] misdirected\" that you are talking about. People often chase the newest shiny things and follow the money for both hiring and funding, but that isn't always good for both the people themselves and for innovation as a whole. We need to make it possible for people to develop their talents and skills, whatever they are and even if they don't match the current needs or desires of the environment, so they we have experts and experienced folks when the time comes for those innovations and technologies.

For big companies, sure, you can probably tell that if someone left various tech darlings in late 2022 that it was probably a layoff. But like outside of that, how the heck do you know? Are you googling \"$coname layoffs $year\" for every entry on a resume you're screening or something? Or are you literally just asking them \"tell me why you left each job\" and people are for some reason answering honestly? This just seems really hard to actually pin down unless employees are volunteering the information. Even if you did leave right on a publicly-known layoff date, it seems pretty easy to just explain that \"uh yeah they were doing so poorly they laid off X% of people, I left for greener pastures\".

No way I can convince businesses to pay me for ads when they can be paying Facebook or YouTube who own practically every eyeball on the internet. reply bornfreddy 1 hour agoparentThe frontier is always moving.

Pissed me off, something fierce, being treated that way (especially as I figured out it was being supported from the C-Suite). However, I have since realized that it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I enjoy writing software. So much, that I will do it for free. When no one’s paying me, I get to do it the way that I want to do it. No scrum standup humiliation sessions, no deliberately writing terrible software, so terrible programmers can understand it, no being told how lucky I am, to be “allowed” to work. reply HeyLaughingBoy 3 hours agoparentI quit a company that was showing all the signs of trying to get rid of its senior developers so a couple of us jumped ship before the inevitable layoff. I went straight into another place that the recruiter said \"preferred to hire more seasoned engineers.\" In my 5 years there I only remember two engineers that were under 30. Median age probably hovered around 50. There are outfits that realize that you get better with experience and want to capitalize on that. Unfortunately, they seem to be few and far between. reply jhawleypeters 2 hours agorootparentAssuming the pool of engineers is growing exponentially, I’d expect a very small population of seasoned engineers. reply HeyLaughingBoy 1 hour agorootparentI think that's why we got the two younger ones.

Was in a similar situation myself - always wanted to be an \"entrepreneur\" but ultimately, needing to survive to feed the family is what kickstarted it all. I really appreciated how, even though you didn't have a technical background, you found a path that works for you and even more so, focusing on what you CAN do vs what you CAN'T do.

I, for one, plunk down money to read 200 pages of this stuff interested with anecdotes from personal life. What are the insights I gained from this particular piece: * self depreciation is funny if done in earnest * note that the OP had a huge handicap (not knowing to code and ignorant of web technologies) but he was not clueless: he had deep knowledge (at least deeper than most site operators) about the ad business and how to monetize * building up from the above, he innovated in an area what he knew, i.e. ads. He didn't try to jump into the idea de jour. Too many first time entrepreneurs miss this point. * he used simple tools and approaches(e.g. Yellow Pages, source view) but used them effectively. Didn't try to go after shiny tools, e.g. get on a bootcamp to learn web frontend development Overall vibe (don't know if it's a persona or the real thing, judging from the wackiness of his ideas I'm guessing the latter) from his writings is a person who you'd want to grab coffee (or beer) and just hang out with. reply eightturn 3 hours agoparentthanks Jun8... writing these small essays is taxing (but rewarding) - I can't imagine what it's like to write a book (unlikely).

GitHub did not even have the concept of CODEOWNERS back then. After getting laid off, I decided to roll the dice instead of looking for another work-for-hire. Yeah, it's too late, but I needed this just to get excited about technology again. I was seriously jaded from debugging the microservices spaghetti at every frigging job, trying to make a pile out of water and not actually building anything. I torches through my savings, and no regrets. I am in my 40s, and the time to take a chance is running out. The point is, there is such a thing as \"right place, right time\". The idea and the execution have to be well-timed. It might be too early, or it might be too late (as it was for me). Take The Globe, for example - the Facebook before Facebook. They failed because a) there were no phones b) not enough people online to get the network effect. Similarly, good luck getting your \"crypto\" getting traction at this point. If you have an idea, and you think the time is right - take the chance. Not knowing what will happen is part of the fun. Don't look at it as taking risk, look at it as rowing through a river and without knowing where the river goes. If you don't row, you will never find out what's around the bend. reply marginalia_nu 3 hours agoparent> If you have an idea, and you think the time is right - take the chance.

If you don't row, you will never find out what's around the bend. I think you kinda need to re-evaluate your relationship with uncertainty when doing something like this. As a wagie, unexpected news is nearly universally bad news (layoffs, corporate mergers), whereas the status quo is neutral-good. When you're starting up a business, unexpected news can be good (new customer, new investor), but the status quo is neutral-bad (slowly running out of momentum and funds). reply chaostheory 1 hour agoprevGoing on a slight tangent with unplanned entrepreneurship, the Korean PC cafes had their roots in their owners being laid off from their corporate jobs. reply amunozo 6 hours agoprevReally inspiring read.

If you spend any time in the \"indie hacker\" entrepreneur space today it is oversaturated with people trying to root out every single angle they can possibly try to address with their tech solution. They are all listening to podcasts, newsletters and buying courses about how to be a tech entrepreneur, but the people selling the 'how to get rich' info are the only ones consistently making money. Total admiration for the author, it was very savvy to identify that opportunity and they put their money on the line. The modern self-made entrepreneur is less appealing. Success stories nowadays are like \"We dropship japanese candy boxes\" or \"My Crypto Substack has 5k subscribers\". reply dinkleberg 1 hour agorootparentI might be way off the mark, but I get the sense with a lot of the indie hackers it is less about the money and more about the attraction of the community and the sense of belonging. If you \"build in public\" you'll get attention and will be cheered on by the others doing the same. If they were really in it for the money then spending all of their free time for a couple of years to get a few hundred dollars MRR would be a fail, yet many of them keep at it. I suspect the rewards they get from being an active part of the community feel worth it. I think a better choice is to either go day job + hobby that isn't for money, as restricting yourself to what makes money is going to be less enjoyable. Or day job + heavily profit focused side business with the goal of quickly replacing your day job with said business, then freeing up some time to have your hobbies again. I think the mistake is trying to do both at the same time. You can't really focus on both profit and personal enjoyment in the same project (unless profit is a big source of enjoyment for you). reply verzali 6 hours agoparentprevThe opportunities are different, but the attitude of keeping your eyes open to opportunities and figuring out what works is still true. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparentWe are at a low point, where everything is gated and huge corporations will decide to scare your customers away.

    "originBody": "NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes# Note The release of 2.0 is in progress and the current release overview and highlights are still in a draft state. However, the highlights should already list the most significant changes detailed in the full notes below, and those full notes should be complete (if not copy-edited well enough yet). NumPy 2.0.0 is the first major release since 2006. It is the result of 11 months of development since the last feature release and is the work of 212 contributors spread over 1078 pull requests. It contains a large number of exciting new features as well as changes to both the Python and C APIs. This major release includes breaking changes that could not happen in a regular minor (feature) release - including an ABI break, changes to type promotion rules, and API changes which may not have been emitting deprecation warnings in 1.26.x. Key documents related to how to adapt to changes in NumPy 2.0, in addition to these release notes, include: The NumPy 2.0 migration guide The NumPy 2.0-specific advice in For downstream package authors Highlights# Highlights of this release include: New features: A new variable-length string dtype, StringDType and a new numpy.strings namespace with performant ufuncs for string operations, Support for float32 and longdouble in all numpy.fft functions, Support for the array API standard in the main numpy namespace. Performance improvements: Sorting functions (sort, argsort, partition, argpartition) have been accelerated through the use of the Intel x86-simd-sort and Google Highway libraries, and may see large (hardware-specific) speedups, macOS Accelerate support and binary wheels for macOS >=14, with significant performance improvements for linear algebra operations on macOS, and wheels that are about 3 times smaller, numpy.char fixed-length string operations have been accelerated by implementing ufuncs that also support StringDType in addition to the fixed-length string dtypes, A new tracing and introspection API, opt_func_info, to determine which hardware-specific kernels are available and will be dispatched to. numpy.save now uses pickle protocol version 4 for saving arrays with object dtype, which allows for pickle objects larger than 4GB and improves saving speed by about 5% for large arrays. Python API improvements: A clear split between public and private API, with a new module structure, and each public function now available in a single place, Many removals of non-recommended functions and aliases. This should make it easier to learn and use NumPy. The number of objects in the main namespace decreased by ~10% and in numpy.lib by ~80%, Canonical dtype names and a new isdtype introspection function, C API improvements: A new public C API for creating custom dtypes, Many outdated functions and macros removed, and private internals hidden to ease future extensibility, New, easier to use, initialization functions: PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI and PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI. Improved behavior: Improvements to type promotion behavior was changed by adopting NEP 50. This fixes many user surprises about promotions which previously often depended on data values of input arrays rather than only their dtypes. Please see the NEP and the NumPy 2.0 migration guide for details as this change can lead to changes in output dtypes and lower precision results for mixed-dtype operations. The default integer type on Windows is now int64 rather than int32, matching the behavior on other platforms, The maximum number of array dimensions is changed from 32 to 64 Documentation: The reference guide navigation was significantly improved, and there is now documentation on NumPy’s module structure, The building from source documentation was completely rewritten, Furthermore there are many changes to NumPy internals, including continuing to migrate code from C to C++, that will make it easier to improve and maintain NumPy in the future. The “no free lunch” theorem dictates that there is a price to pay for all these API and behavior improvements and better future extensibility. This price is: Backwards compatibility. There are a significant number of breaking changes to both the Python and C APIs. In the majority of cases, there are clear error messages that will inform the user how to adapt their code. However, there are also changes in behavior for which it was not possible to give such an error message - these cases are all covered in the Deprecation and Compatibility sections below, and in the NumPy 2.0 migration guide. Note that there is a ruff mode to auto-fix many things in Python code. Breaking changes to the NumPy ABI. As a result, binaries of packages that use the NumPy C API and were built against a NumPy 1.xx release will not work with NumPy 2.0. On import, such packages will see an ImportError with a message about binary incompatibility. It is possible to build binaries against NumPy 2.0 that will work at runtime with both NumPy 2.0 and 1.x. See NumPy 2.0-specific advice for more details. All downstream packages that depend on the NumPy ABI are advised to do a new release built against NumPy 2.0 and verify that that release works with both 2.0 and 1.26 - ideally in the period between 2.0.0rc1 (which will be ABI-stable) and the final 2.0.0 release to avoid problems for their users. The Python versions supported by this release are 3.9-3.12. NumPy 2.0 Python API removals# np.geterrobj, np.seterrobj and the related ufunc keyword argument extobj= have been removed. The preferred replacement for all of these is using the context manager with np.errstate():. (gh-23922) np.cast has been removed. The literal replacement for np.cast[dtype](arg) is np.asarray(arg, dtype=dtype). np.source has been removed. The preferred replacement is inspect.getsource. np.lookfor has been removed. (gh-24144) numpy.who has been removed. As an alternative for the removed functionality, one can use a variable explorer that is available in IDEs such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook. (gh-24321) Warnings and exceptions present in numpy.exceptions (e.g, ComplexWarning, VisibleDeprecationWarning) are no longer exposed in the main namespace. Multiple niche enums, expired members and functions have been removed from the main namespace, such as: ERR_*, SHIFT_*, np.fastCopyAndTranspose, np.kernel_version, np.numarray, np.oldnumeric and np.set_numeric_ops. (gh-24316) Replaced from ... import * in the numpy/__init__.py with explicit imports. As a result, these main namespace members got removed: np.FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORT, np.FPE_*, np.NINF, np.PINF, np.NZERO, np.PZERO, np.CLIP, np.WRAP, np.WRAP, np.RAISE, np.BUFSIZE, np.UFUNC_BUFSIZE_DEFAULT, np.UFUNC_PYVALS_NAME, np.ALLOW_THREADS, np.MAXDIMS, np.MAY_SHARE_EXACT, np.MAY_SHARE_BOUNDS, add_newdoc, np.add_docstring and np.add_newdoc_ufunc. (gh-24357) Alias np.float_ has been removed. Use np.float64 instead. Alias np.complex_ has been removed. Use np.complex128 instead. Alias np.longfloat has been removed. Use np.longdouble instead. Alias np.singlecomplex has been removed. Use np.complex64 instead. Alias np.cfloat has been removed. Use np.complex128 instead. Alias np.longcomplex has been removed. Use np.clongdouble instead. Alias np.clongfloat has been removed. Use np.clongdouble instead. Alias np.string_ has been removed. Use np.bytes_ instead. Alias np.unicode_ has been removed. Use np.str_ instead.

Use np.inf instead. Alias np.mat has been removed. Use np.asmatrix instead. np.issubclass_ has been removed. Use the issubclass builtin instead. np.asfarray has been removed. Use np.asarray with a proper dtype instead. np.set_string_function has been removed. Use np.set_printoptions instead with a formatter for custom printing of NumPy objects. np.tracemalloc_domain is now only available from np.lib. np.recfromcsv and recfromtxt are now only available from np.lib.npyio. np.issctype, np.maximum_sctype, np.obj2sctype, np.sctype2char, np.sctypes, np.issubsctype were all removed from the main namespace without replacement, as they where niche members. Deprecated np.deprecate and np.deprecate_with_doc has been removed from the main namespace. Use DeprecationWarning instead. Deprecated np.safe_eval has been removed from the main namespace. Use ast.literal_eval instead. (gh-24376) np.find_common_type has been removed. Use numpy.promote_types or numpy.result_type instead. To achieve semantics for the scalar_types argument, use numpy.result_type and pass 0, 0.0, or 0j as a Python scalar instead. np.round_ has been removed. Use np.round instead. np.nbytes has been removed. Use np.dtype().itemsize instead. (gh-24477) np.compare_chararrays has been removed from the main namespace. Use np.char.compare_chararrays instead. The charrarray in the main namespace has been deprecated. It can be imported without a deprecation warning from np.char.chararray for now, but we are planning to fully deprecate and remove chararray in the future. np.format_parser has been removed from the main namespace. Use np.rec.format_parser instead. (gh-24587) Support for seven data type string aliases has been removed from np.dtype: int0, uint0, void0, object0, str0, bytes0 and bool8. (gh-24807) The experimental numpy.array_api submodule has been removed. Use the main numpy namespace for regular usage instead, or the separate array-api-strict package for the compliance testing use case for which numpy.array_api was mostly used. (gh-25911) __array_prepare__ is removed# UFuncs called __array_prepare__ before running computations for normal ufunc calls (not generalized ufuncs, reductions, etc.). The function was also called instead of __array_wrap__ on the results of some linear algebra functions. It is now removed. If you use it, migrate to __array_ufunc__ or rely on __array_wrap__ which is called with a context in all cases, although only after the result array is filled. In those code paths, __array_wrap__ will now be passed a base class, rather than a subclass array. (gh-25105) Deprecations# np.compat has been deprecated, as Python 2 is no longer supported. numpy.int8 and similar classes will no longer support conversion of out of bounds python integers to integer arrays. For example, conversion of 255 to int8 will not return -1. numpy.iinfo(dtype) can be used to check the machine limits for data types. For example, np.iinfo(np.uint16) returns min = 0 and max = 65535. np.array(value).astype(dtype) will give the desired result. np.safe_eval has been deprecated. ast.literal_eval should be used instead. (gh-23830) np.recfromcsv, np.recfromtxt, np.disp, np.get_array_wrap, np.maximum_sctype, np.deprecate and np.deprecate_with_doc have been deprecated. (gh-24154) np.trapz has been deprecated. Use np.trapezoid or a scipy.integrate function instead. np.in1d has been deprecated. Use np.isin instead. Alias np.row_stack has been deprecated. Use np.vstack directly. (gh-24445) __array_wrap__ is now passed arr, context, return_scalar and support for implementations not accepting all three are deprecated. Its signature should be __array_wrap__(self, arr, context=None, return_scalar=False) (gh-25409) Arrays of 2-dimensional vectors for np.cross have been deprecated. Use arrays of 3-dimensional vectors instead. (gh-24818) np.dtype(\"a\") alias for np.dtype(np.bytes_) was deprecated. Use np.dtype(\"S\") alias instead. (gh-24854) Use of keyword arguments x and y with functions assert_array_equal and assert_array_almost_equal has been deprecated. Pass the first two arguments as positional arguments instead. (gh-24978) numpy.fft deprecations for n-D transforms with None values in arguments# Using fftn, ifftn, rfftn, irfftn, fft2, ifft2, rfft2 or irfft2 with the s parameter set to a value that is not None and the axes parameter set to None has been deprecated, in line with the array API standard. To retain current behaviour, pass a sequence [0, …, k-1] to axes for an array of dimension k. Furthermore, passing an array to s which contains None values is deprecated as the parameter is documented to accept a sequence of integers in both the NumPy docs and the array API specification. To use the default behaviour of the corresponding 1-D transform, pass the value matching the default for its n parameter. To use the default behaviour for every axis, the s argument can be omitted. (gh-25495) np.linalg.lstsq now defaults to a new rcond value# lstsq now uses the new rcond value of the machine precision times max(M, N). Previously, the machine precision was used but a FutureWarning was given to notify that this change will happen eventually. That old behavior can still be achieved by passing rcond=-1. (gh-25721) Expired deprecations# The np.core.umath_tests submodule has been removed from the public API. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.15) (gh-23809) The PyDataMem_SetEventHook deprecation has expired and it is removed. Use tracemalloc and the np.lib.tracemalloc_domain domain. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.23) (gh-23921) The deprecation of set_numeric_ops and the C functions PyArray_SetNumericOps and PyArray_GetNumericOps has been expired and the functions removed. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.16) (gh-23998) The fasttake, fastclip, and fastputmask ArrFuncs deprecation is now finalized. The deprecated function fastCopyAndTranspose and its C counterpart are now removed. The deprecation of PyArray_ScalarFromObject is now finalized. (gh-24312) np.msort has been removed. For a replacement, np.sort(a, axis=0) should be used instead. (gh-24494) np.dtype((\"f8\", 1) will now return a shape 1 subarray dtype rather than a non-subarray one. (gh-25761) Assigning to the .data attribute of an ndarray is disallowed and will raise. np.binary_repr(a, width) will raise if width is too small. Using NPY_CHAR in PyArray_DescrFromType() will raise, use NPY_STRING NPY_UNICODE, or NPY_VSTRING instead. (gh-25794) Compatibility notes# loadtxt and genfromtxt default encoding changed# loadtxt and genfromtxt now both default to encoding=None which may mainly modify how converters work. These will now be passed str rather than bytes. Pass the encoding explicitly to always get the new or old behavior. For genfromtxt the change also means that returned values will now be unicode strings rather than bytes. (gh-25158) f2py compatibility notes# f2py will no longer accept ambiguous -m and .pyf CLI combinations. When more than one .pyf file is passed, an error is raised. When both -m and a .pyf is passed, a warning is emitted and the -m provided name is ignored. (gh-25181) The f2py.compile() helper has been removed because it leaked memory, has been marked as experimental for several years now, and was implemented as a thin subprocess.run wrapper. It was also one of the test bottlenecks. See gh-25122 for the full rationale. It also used several np.distutils features which are too fragile to be ported to work with meson. Users are urged to replace calls to f2py.compile with calls to subprocess.run(\"python\", \"-m\", \"numpy.f2py\",... instead, and to use environment variables to interact with meson. Native files are also an option. (gh-25193) Minor changes in behavior of sorting functions# Due to algorithmic changes and use of SIMD code, sorting functions with methods that aren’t stable may return slightly different results in 2.0.0 compared to 1.26.x. This includes the default method of argsort and argpartition. Removed ambiguity when broadcasting in np.solve# The broadcasting rules for np.solve(a, b) were ambiguous when b had 1 fewer dimensions than a. This has been resolved in a backward-incompatible way and is now compliant with the Array API. The old behaviour can be reconstructed by using np.solve(a, b[..., None])[..., 0]. (gh-25914) Modified representation for Polynomial# The representation method for Polynomial was updated to include the domain in the representation. The plain text and latex representations are now consistent. For example the output of str(np.polynomial.Polynomial([1, 1], domain=[.1, .2])) used to be 1.0 + 1.0 x, but now is 1.0 + 1.0 (-3.0000000000000004 + 20.0 x). (gh-21760) C API changes# The PyArray_CGT, PyArray_CLT, PyArray_CGE, PyArray_CLE, PyArray_CEQ, PyArray_CNE macros have been removed. PyArray_MIN and PyArray_MAX have been moved from ndarraytypes.h to npy_math.h. (gh-24258) A C API for working with numpy.dtypes.StringDType arrays has been exposed. This includes functions for acquiring and releasing mutexes which lock access to the string data, as well as packing and unpacking UTF-8 bytestreams from array entries. NPY_NTYPES has been renamed to NPY_NTYPES_LEGACY as it does not include new NumPy built-in DTypes. In particular the new string DType will likely not work correctly with code that handles legacy DTypes. (gh-25347) The C-API now only exports the static inline function versions of the array accessors (previously this depended on using “deprecated API”). While we discourage it, the struct fields can still be used directly. (gh-25789) NumPy now defines PyArray_Pack to set an individual memory address. Unlike PyArray_SETITEM this function is equivalent to setting an individual array item and does not require a NumPy array input. (gh-25954) The ->f slot has been removed from PyArray_Descr. If you use this slot, replace accessing it with PyDataType_GetArrFuncs (see its documentation and the NumPy 2.0 migration guide). In some cases using other functions like PyArray_GETITEM may be an alternatives. PyArray_GETITEM and PyArray_SETITEM now require the import of the NumPy API table to be used and are no longer defined in ndarraytypes.h. (gh-25812) Due to runtime dependencies, the definition for functionality accessing the dtype flags was moved from numpy/ndarraytypes.h and is only available after including numpy/ndarrayobject.h as it requires import_array(). This includes PyDataType_FLAGCHK, PyDataType_REFCHK and NPY_BEGIN_THREADS_DESCR. The dtype flags on PyArray_Descr must now be accessed through the PyDataType_FLAGS inline function to be compatible with both 1.x and 2.x. This function is defined in npy_2_compat.h to allow backporting. Most or all users should use PyDataType_FLAGCHK which is available on 1.x and does not require backporting. Cython users should use Cython 3. Otherwise access will go through Python unless they use PyDataType_FLAGCHK instead. (gh-25816) Datetime functionality exposed in the C API and Cython bindings# The functions NpyDatetime_ConvertDatetime64ToDatetimeStruct, NpyDatetime_ConvertDatetimeStructToDatetime64, NpyDatetime_ConvertPyDateTimeToDatetimeStruct, NpyDatetime_GetDatetimeISO8601StrLen, NpyDatetime_MakeISO8601Datetime, and NpyDatetime_ParseISO8601Datetime have been added to the C API to facilitate converting between strings, Python datetimes, and NumPy datetimes in external libraries. (gh-21199) Const correctness for the generalized ufunc C API# The NumPy C API’s functions for constructing generalized ufuncs (PyUFunc_FromFuncAndData, PyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignature, PyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignatureAndIdentity) take types and data arguments that are not modified by NumPy’s internals. Like the name and doc arguments, third-party Python extension modules are likely to supply these arguments from static constants. The types and data arguments are now const-correct: they are declared as const char *types and void *const *data, respectively. C code should not be affected, but C++ code may be. (gh-23847) Larger NPY_MAXDIMS and NPY_MAXARGS, NPY_RAVEL_AXIS introduced# NPY_MAXDIMS is now 64, you may want to review its use. This is usually used in a stack allocation, where the increase should be safe. However, we do encourage generally to remove any use of NPY_MAXDIMS and NPY_MAXARGS to eventually allow removing the constraint completely. For the conversion helper and C-API functions mirroring Python ones such as take, NPY_MAXDIMS was used to mean axis=None. Such usage must be replaced with NPY_RAVEL_AXIS. See also Increased maximum number of dimensions. (gh-25149) NPY_MAXARGS not constant and PyArrayMultiIterObject size change# Since NPY_MAXARGS was increased, it is now a runtime constant and not compile-time constant anymore. We expect almost no users to notice this. But if used for stack allocations it now must be replaced with a custom constant using NPY_MAXARGS as an additional runtime check. The sizeof(PyArrayMultiIterObject) no longer includes the full size of the object. We expect nobody to notice this change. It was necessary to avoid issues with Cython. (gh-25271) Required changes for custom legacy user dtypes# In order to improve our DTypes it is unfortunately necessary to break the ABI, which requires some changes for dtypes registered with PyArray_RegisterDataType. Please see the documentation of PyArray_RegisterDataType for how to adapt your code and achieve compatibility with both 1.x and 2.x. (gh-25792) New Public DType API# The C implementation of the NEP 42 DType API is now public. While the DType API has shipped in NumPy for a few versions, it was only usable in sessions with a special environment variable set. It is now possible to write custom DTypes outside of NumPy using the new DType API and the normal import_array() mechanism for importing the numpy C API. See Custom Data Types for more details about the API. As always with a new feature, please report any bugs you run into implementing or using a new DType. It is likely that downstream C code that works with dtypes will need to be updated to work correctly with new DTypes. (gh-25754) New C-API import functions# We have now added PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI and PyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI as static inline functions to import the NumPy C-API tables. The new functions have two advantages over import_array and import_ufunc: They check whether the import was already performed and are light-weight if not, allowing to add them judiciously (although this is not preferable in most cases). The old mechanisms were macros rather than functions which included a return statement. The PyArray_ImportNumPyAPI() function is included in npy_2_compat.h for simpler backporting. (gh-25866) Structured dtype information access through functions# The dtype structures fields c_metadata, names, fields, and subarray must now be accessed through new functions following the same names, such as PyDataType_NAMES. Direct access of the fields is not valid as they do not exist for all PyArray_Descr instances. The metadata field is kept, but the macro version should also be preferred. (gh-25802) Descriptor elsize and alignment access# Unless compiling only with NumPy 2 support, the elsize and aligment fields must now be accessed via PyDataType_ELSIZE, PyDataType_SET_ELSIZE, and PyDataType_ALIGNMENT. In cases where the descriptor is attached to an array, we advise using PyArray_ITEMSIZE as it exists on all NumPy versions. Please see The PyArray_Descr struct has been changed for more information. (gh-25943) NumPy 2.0 C API removals# npy_interrupt.h and the corresponding macros like NPY_SIGINT_ON have been removed. We recommend querying PyErr_CheckSignals() or PyOS_InterruptOccurred() periodically (these do currently require holding the GIL though). The noprefix.h header has been removed. Replace missing symbols with their prefixed counterparts (usually an added NPY_ or npy_). (gh-23919) PyUFunc_GetPyVals, PyUFunc_handlefperr, and PyUFunc_checkfperr have been removed. If needed, a new backwards compatible function to raise floating point errors could be restored. Reason for removal: there are no known users and the functions would have made with np.errstate() fixes much more difficult). (gh-23922) The numpy/old_defines.h which was part of the API deprecated since NumPy 1.7 has been removed. This removes macros of the form PyArray_CONSTANT. The replace_old_macros.sed script may be useful to convert them to the NPY_CONSTANT version. (gh-24011) The legacy_inner_loop_selector member of the ufunc struct is removed to simplify improvements to the dispatching system. There are no known users overriding or directly accessing this member. (gh-24271) NPY_INTPLTR has been removed to avoid confusion (see intp redefinition). (gh-24888) The advanced indexing MapIter and related API has been removed. The (truly) public part of it was not well tested and had only one known user (Theano). Making it private will simplify improvements to speed up ufunc.at, make advanced indexing more maintainable, and was important for increasing the maximum number of dimensions of arrays to 64. Please let us know if this API is important to you so we can find a solution together. (gh-25138) The NPY_MAX_ELSIZE macro has been removed, as it only ever reflected builtin numeric types and served no internal purpose. (gh-25149) PyArray_REFCNT and NPY_REFCOUNT are removed. Use Py_REFCNT instead. (gh-25156) PyArrayFlags_Type and PyArray_NewFlagsObject as well as PyArrayFlagsObject are private now. There is no known use-case; use the Python API if needed. PyArray_MoveInto, PyArray_CastTo, PyArray_CastAnyTo are removed use PyArray_CopyInto and if absolutely needed PyArray_CopyAnyInto (the latter does a flat copy). PyArray_FillObjectArray is removed, its only true use was for implementing np.empty. Create a new empty array or use PyArray_FillWithScalar() (decrefs existing objects). PyArray_CompareUCS4 and PyArray_CompareString are removed. Use the standard C string comparison functions. PyArray_ISPYTHON is removed as it is misleading, has no known use-cases, and is easy to replace. PyArray_FieldNames is removed, as it is unclear what it would be useful for. It also has incorrect semantics in some possible use-cases. PyArray_TypestrConvert is removed, since it seems a misnomer and unlikely to be used by anyone. If you know the size or are limited to few types, just use it explicitly, otherwise go via Python strings. (gh-25292) PyDataType_GetDatetimeMetaData is removed, it did not actually do anything since at least NumPy 1.7. (gh-25802) PyArray_GetCastFunc is removed. Note that custom legacy user dtypes can still provide a castfunc as their implementation, but any access to them is now removed. The reason for this is that NumPy never used these internally for many years. If you use simple numeric types, please just use C casts directly. In case you require an alternative, please let us know so we can create new API such as PyArray_CastBuffer() which could use old or new cast functions depending on the NumPy version. (gh-25161) New Features# np.add was extended to work with unicode and bytes dtypes.# (gh-24858) A new bitwise_count function# This new function counts the number of 1-bits in a number. bitwise_count works on all the numpy integer types and integer-like objects. >>> a = np.array([2**i - 1 for i in range(16)]) >>> np.bitwise_count(a) array([ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], dtype=uint8) (gh-19355) macOS Accelerate support, including the ILP64# Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library, including ILP64 (64-bit integer) support, in macOS 13.3 has been added. This brings arm64 support, and significant performance improvements of up to 10x for commonly used linear algebra operations. When Accelerate is selected at build time, or if no explicit BLAS library selection is done, the 13.3+ version will automatically be used if available. (gh-24053) Binary wheels are also available. On macOS >=14.0, users who install NumPy from PyPI will get wheels built against Accelerate rather than OpenBLAS. (gh-25255) Option to use weights for quantile and percentile functions# A weights keyword is now available for quantile, percentile, nanquantile and nanpercentile. Only method=\"inverted_cdf\" supports weights. (gh-24254) Improved CPU optimization tracking# A new tracer mechanism is available which enables tracking of the enabled targets for each optimized function (i.e., that uses hardware-specific SIMD instructions) in the NumPy library. With this enhancement, it becomes possible to precisely monitor the enabled CPU dispatch targets for the dispatched functions. A new function named opt_func_info has been added to the new namespace numpy.lib.introspect, offering this tracing capability. This function allows you to retrieve information about the enabled targets based on function names and data type signatures. (gh-24420) A new Meson backend for f2py# f2py in compile mode (i.e. f2py -c) now accepts the --backend meson option. This is the default option for Python >=3.12. For older Python versions, f2py will still default to --backend distutils. To support this in realistic use-cases, in compile mode f2py takes a --dep flag one or many times which maps to dependency() calls in the meson backend, and does nothing in the distutils backend. There are no changes for users of f2py only as a code generator, i.e. without -c. (gh-24532) bind(c) support for f2py# Both functions and subroutines can be annotated with bind(c). f2py will handle both the correct type mapping, and preserve the unique label for other C interfaces. Note: bind(c, name = 'routine_name_other_than_fortran_routine') is not honored by the f2py bindings by design, since bind(c) with the name is meant to guarantee only the same name in C and Fortran, not in Python and Fortran. (gh-24555) A new strict option for several testing functions# The strict keyword is now available for assert_allclose, assert_equal, and assert_array_less. Setting strict=True will disable the broadcasting behaviour for scalars and ensure that input arrays have the same data type. (gh-24680, gh-24770, gh-24775) Add np.core.umath.find and np.core.umath.rfind UFuncs# Add two find and rfind UFuncs that operate on unicode or byte strings and are used in np.char. They operate similar to str.find and str.rfind. (gh-24868) diagonal and trace for numpy.linalg# numpy.linalg.diagonal and numpy.linalg.trace have been added, which are array API standard-compatible variants of numpy.diagonal and numpy.trace. They differ in the default axis selection which define 2-D sub-arrays. (gh-24887) New long and ulong dtypes# numpy.long and numpy.ulong have been added as NumPy integers mapping to C’s long and unsigned long. Prior to NumPy 1.24, numpy.long was an alias to Python’s int. (gh-24922) svdvals for numpy.linalg# numpy.linalg.svdvals has been added. It computes singular values for (a stack of) matrices. Executing np.svdvals(x) is the same as calling np.svd(x, compute_uv=False, hermitian=False). This function is compatible with the array API standard. (gh-24940) A new isdtype function# numpy.isdtype was added to provide a canonical way to classify NumPy’s dtypes in compliance with the array API standard. (gh-25054) A new astype function# numpy.astype was added to provide an array API standard-compatible alternative to the numpy.ndarray.astype method. (gh-25079) Array API compatible functions’ aliases# 13 aliases for existing functions were added to improve compatibility with the array API standard: Trigonometry: acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2. Bitwise: bitwise_left_shift, bitwise_invert, bitwise_right_shift. Misc: concat, permute_dims, pow. In numpy.linalg: tensordot, matmul. (gh-25086) New unique_* functions# The unique_all, unique_counts, unique_inverse, and unique_values functions have been added. They provide functionality of unique with different sets of flags. They are array API standard-compatible, and because the number of arrays they return does not depend on the values of input arguments, they are easier to target for JIT compilation. (gh-25088) Matrix transpose support for ndarrays# NumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an array (or stack of arrays). The matrix transpose is equivalent to swapping the last two axes of an array. Both np.ndarray and np.ma.MaskedArray now expose a .mT attribute, and there is a matching new numpy.matrix_transpose function. (gh-23762) Array API compatible functions for numpy.linalg# Six new functions and two aliases were added to improve compatibility with the Array API standard for numpy.linalg: numpy.linalg.matrix_norm - Computes the matrix norm of a matrix (or a stack of matrices). numpy.linalg.vector_norm - Computes the vector norm of a vector (or batch of vectors). numpy.vecdot - Computes the (vector) dot product of two arrays. numpy.linalg.vecdot - An alias for numpy.vecdot. numpy.linalg.matrix_transpose - An alias for numpy.matrix_transpose. (gh-25155) numpy.linalg.outer has been added. It computes the outer product of two vectors. It differs from numpy.outer by accepting one-dimensional arrays only. This function is compatible with the array API standard. (gh-25101) numpy.linalg.cross has been added. It computes the cross product of two (arrays of) 3-dimensional vectors. It differs from numpy.cross by accepting three-dimensional vectors only. This function is compatible with the array API standard. (gh-25145) A correction argument for var and std# A correction argument was added to var and std, which is an array API standard compatible alternative to ddof. As both arguments serve a similar purpose, only one of them can be provided at the same time. (gh-25169) ndarray.device and ndarray.to_device# An ndarray.device attribute and ndarray.to_device method were added to numpy.ndarray for array API standard compatibility. Additionally, device keyword-only arguments were added to: asarray, arange, empty, empty_like, eye, full, full_like, linspace, ones, ones_like, zeros, and zeros_like. For all these new arguments, only device=\"cpu\" is supported. (gh-25233) StringDType has been added to NumPy# We have added a new variable-width UTF-8 encoded string data type, implementing a “NumPy array of Python strings”, including support for a user-provided missing data sentinel. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for arrays of Python strings and missing data sentinels using the object dtype. See NEP 55 and the documentation for more details. (gh-25347) New keywords for cholesky and pinv# The upper and rtol keywords were added to numpy.linalg.cholesky and numpy.linalg.pinv, respectively, to improve array API standard compatibility. For pinv, if neither rcond nor rtol is specified, the rcond’s default is used. We plan to deprecate and remove rcond in the future. (gh-25388) New keywords for sort, argsort and linalg.matrix_rank# New keyword parameters were added to improve array API standard compatibility: rtol was added to matrix_rank. stable was added to sort and argsort. (gh-25437) New numpy.strings namespace for string ufuncs# NumPy now implements some string operations as ufuncs. The old np.char namespace is still available, and where possible the string manipulation functions in that namespace have been updated to use the new ufuncs, substantially improving their performance. Where possible, we suggest updating code to use functions in np.strings instead of np.char. In the future we may deprecate np.char in favor of np.strings. (gh-25463) numpy.fft support for different precisions and in-place calculations# The various FFT routines in numpy.fft now do their calculations natively in float, double, or long double precision, depending on the input precision, instead of always calculating in double precision. Hence, the calculation will now be less precise for single and more precise for long double precision. The data type of the output array will now be adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, all FFT routines have gained an out argument that can be used for in-place calculations. (gh-25536) configtool and pkg-config support# A new numpy-config CLI script is available that can be queried for the NumPy version and for compile flags needed to use the NumPy C API. This will allow build systems to better support the use of NumPy as a dependency. Also, a numpy.pc pkg-config file is now included with Numpy. In order to find its location for use with PKG_CONFIG_PATH, use numpy-config --pkgconfigdir. (gh-25730) Array API standard support in the main namespace# The main numpy namespace now supports the array API standard. See Array API standard compatibility for details. (gh-25911) Improvements# Strings are now supported by any, all, and the logical ufuncs.# (gh-25651) Integer sequences as the shape argument for memmap# numpy.memmap can now be created with any integer sequence as the shape argument, such as a list or numpy array of integers. Previously, only the types of tuple and int could be used without raising an error. (gh-23729) errstate is now faster and context safe# The numpy.errstate context manager/decorator is now faster and safer. Previously, it was not context safe and had (rare) issues with thread-safety. (gh-23936) AArch64 quicksort speed improved by using Highway’s VQSort# The first introduction of the Google Highway library, using VQSort on AArch64. Execution time is improved by up to 16x in some cases, see the PR for benchmark results. Extensions to other platforms will be done in the future. (gh-24018) Complex types - underlying C type changes# The underlying C types for all of NumPy’s complex types have been changed to use C99 complex types. While this change does not affect the memory layout of complex types, it changes the API to be used to directly retrieve or write the real or complex part of the complex number, since direct field access (as in c.real or c.imag) is no longer an option. You can now use utilities provided in numpy/npy_math.h to do these operations, like this: npy_cdouble c; npy_csetreal(&c, 1.0); npy_csetimag(&c, 0.0); printf(\"%d + %di\", npy_creal(c), npy_cimag(c)); To ease cross-version compatibility, equivalent macros and a compatibility layer have been added which can be used by downstream packages to continue to support both NumPy 1.x and 2.x. See Support for complex numbers for more info. numpy/npy_common.h now includes complex.h, which means that complex is now a reserved keyword. (gh-24085) iso_c_binding support and improved common blocks for f2py# Previously, users would have to define their own custom f2cmap file to use type mappings defined by the Fortran2003 iso_c_binding intrinsic module. These type maps are now natively supported by f2py (gh-24555) f2py now handles common blocks which have kind specifications from modules. This further expands the usability of intrinsics like iso_fortran_env and iso_c_binding. (gh-25186) Call str automatically on third argument to functions like assert_equal# The third argument to functions like assert_equal now has str called on it automatically. This way it mimics the built-in assert statement, where assert_equal(a, b, obj) works like assert a == b, obj. (gh-24877) Support for array-like atol/rtol in isclose, allclose# The keywords atol and rtol in isclose and allclose now accept both scalars and arrays. An array, if given, must broadcast to the shapes of the first two array arguments. (gh-24878) Consistent failure messages in test functions# Previously, some numpy.testing assertions printed messages that referred to the actual and desired results as x and y. Now, these values are consistently referred to as ACTUAL and DESIRED. (gh-24931) n-D FFT transforms allow s[i] == -1# The fftn, ifftn, rfftn, irfftn, fft2, ifft2, rfft2 and irfft2 functions now use the whole input array along the axis i if s[i] == -1, in line with the array API standard. (gh-25495) Guard PyArrayScalar_VAL and PyUnicodeScalarObject for the limited API# PyUnicodeScalarObject holds a PyUnicodeObject, which is not available when using Py_LIMITED_API. Add guards to hide it and consequently also make the PyArrayScalar_VAL macro hidden. (gh-25531) Changes# np.gradient() now returns a tuple rather than a list making the return value immutable. (gh-23861) Being fully context and thread-safe, np.errstate can only be entered once now. np.setbufsize is now tied to np.errstate(): leaving an np.errstate context will also reset the bufsize. (gh-23936) A new public np.lib.array_utils submodule has been introduced and it currently contains three functions: byte_bounds (moved from np.lib.utils), normalize_axis_tuple and normalize_axis_index. (gh-24540) Introduce numpy.bool as the new canonical name for NumPy’s boolean dtype, and make numpy.bool_ an alias to it. Note that until NumPy 1.24, np.bool was an alias to Python’s builtin bool. The new name helps with array API standard compatibility and is a more intuitive name. (gh-25080) The dtype.flags value was previously stored as a signed integer. This means that the aligned dtype struct flag lead to negative flags being set (-128 rather than 128). This flag is now stored unsigned (positive). Code which checks flags manually may need to adapt. This may include code compiled with Cython 0.29.x. (gh-25816) Representation of NumPy scalars changed# As per NEP 51, the scalar representation has been updated to include the type information to avoid confusion with Python scalars. Scalars are now printed as np.float64(3.0) rather than just 3.0. This may disrupt workflows that store representations of numbers (e.g., to files) making it harder to read them. They should be stored as explicit strings, for example by using str() or f\"{scalar!s}\". For the time being, affected users can use np.set_printoptions(legacy=\"1.25\") to get the old behavior (with possibly a few exceptions). Documentation of downstream projects may require larger updates, if code snippets are tested. We are working on tooling for doctest-plus to facilitate updates. (gh-22449) Truthiness of NumPy strings changed# NumPy strings previously were inconsistent about how they defined if the string is True or False and the definition did not match the one used by Python. Strings are now considered True when they are non-empty and False when they are empty. This changes the following distinct cases: Casts from string to boolean were previously roughly equivalent to string_array.astype(np.int64).astype(bool), meaning that only valid integers could be cast. Now a string of \"0\" will be considered True since it is not empty. If you need the old behavior, you may use the above step (casting to integer first) or string_array == \"0\" (if the input is only ever 0 or 1). To get the new result on old NumPy versions use string_array != \"\". np.nonzero(string_array) previously ignored whitespace so that a string only containing whitespace was considered False. Whitespace is now considered True. This change does not affect np.loadtxt, np.fromstring, or np.genfromtxt. The first two still use the integer definition, while genfromtxt continues to match for \"true\" (ignoring case). However, if np.bool_ is used as a converter the result will change. The change does affect np.fromregex as it uses direct assignments. (gh-23871) A mean keyword was added to var and std function# Often when the standard deviation is needed the mean is also needed. The same holds for the variance and the mean. Until now the mean is then calculated twice, the change introduced here for the var and std functions allows for passing in a precalculated mean as an keyword argument. See the docstrings for details and an example illustrating the speed-up. (gh-24126) Remove datetime64 deprecation warning when constructing with timezone# The numpy.datetime64 method now issues a UserWarning rather than a DeprecationWarning whenever a timezone is included in the datetime string that is provided. (gh-24193) Default integer dtype is now 64-bit on 64-bit Windows# The default NumPy integer is now 64-bit on all 64-bit systems as the historic 32-bit default on Windows was a common source of issues. Most users should not notice this. The main issues may occur with code interfacing with libraries written in a compiled language like C. For more information see Windows default integer. (gh-24224) Renamed numpy.core to numpy._core# Accessing numpy.core now emits a DeprecationWarning. In practice we have found that most downstream usage of numpy.core was to access functionality that is available in the main numpy namespace. If for some reason you are using functionality in numpy.core that is not available in the main numpy namespace, this means you are likely using private NumPy internals. You can still access these internals via numpy._core without a deprecation warning but we do not provide any backward compatibility guarantees for NumPy internals. Please open an issue if you think a mistake was made and something needs to be made public. (gh-24634) The “relaxed strides” debug build option, which was previously enabled through the NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_DEBUG environment variable or the -Drelaxed-strides-debug config-settings flag has been removed. (gh-24717) Redefinition of np.intp/np.uintp (almost never a change)# Due to the actual use of these types almost always matching the use of size_t/Py_ssize_t this is now the definition in C. Previously, it matched intptr_t and uintptr_t which would often have been subtly incorrect. This has no effect on the vast majority of machines since the size of these types only differ on extremely niche platforms. However, it means that: Pointers may not necessarily fit into an intp typed array anymore. The p and P character codes can still be used, however. Creating intptr_t or uintptr_t typed arrays in C remains possible in a cross-platform way via PyArray_DescrFromType('p'). The new character codes nN were introduced. It is now correct to use the Python C-API functions when parsing to npy_intp typed arguments. (gh-24888) numpy.fft.helper made private# numpy.fft.helper was renamed to numpy.fft._helper to indicate that it is a private submodule. All public functions exported by it should be accessed from numpy.fft. (gh-24945) numpy.linalg.linalg made private# numpy.linalg.linalg was renamed to numpy.linalg._linalg to indicate that it is a private submodule. All public functions exported by it should be accessed from numpy.linalg. (gh-24946) Out-of-bound axis not the same as axis=None# In some cases axis=32 or for concatenate any large value was the same as axis=None. Except for concatenate this was deprecate. Any out of bound axis value will now error, make sure to use axis=None. (gh-25149) New copy keyword meaning for array and asarray constructors# Now numpy.array and numpy.asarray support three values for copy parameter: None - A copy will only be made if it is necessary. True - Always make a copy. False - Never make a copy. If a copy is required a ValueError is raised. The meaning of False changed as it now raises an exception if a copy is needed. (gh-25168) The __array__ special method now takes a copy keyword argument.# NumPy will pass copy to the __array__ special method in situations where it would be set to a non-default value (e.g. in a call to np.asarray(some_object, copy=False)). Currently, if an unexpected keyword argument error is raised after this, NumPy will print a warning and re-try without the copy keyword argument. Implementations of objects implementing the __array__ protocol should accept a copy keyword argument with the same meaning as when passed to numpy.array or numpy.asarray. (gh-25168) Cleanup of initialization of numpy.dtype with strings with commas# The interpretation of strings with commas is changed slightly, in that a trailing comma will now always create a structured dtype. E.g., where previously np.dtype(\"i\") and np.dtype(\"i,\") were treated as identical, now np.dtype(\"i,\") will create a structured dtype, with a single field. This is analogous to np.dtype(\"i,i\") creating a structured dtype with two fields, and makes the behaviour consistent with that expected of tuples. At the same time, the use of single number surrounded by parenthesis to indicate a sub-array shape, like in np.dtype(\"(2)i,\"), is deprecated. Instead; one should use np.dtype(\"(2,)i\") or np.dtype(\"2i\"). Eventually, using a number in parentheses will raise an exception, like is the case for initializations without a comma, like np.dtype(\"(2)i\"). (gh-25434) Change in how complex sign is calculated# Following the array API standard, the complex sign is now calculated as z / |z| (instead of the rather less logical case where the sign of the real part was taken, unless the real part was zero, in which case the sign of the imaginary part was returned). Like for real numbers, zero is returned if z==0. (gh-25441) Return types of functions that returned a list of arrays# Functions that returned a list of ndarrays have been changed to return a tuple of ndarrays instead. Returning tuples consistently whenever a sequence of arrays is returned makes it easier for JIT compilers like Numba, as well as for static type checkers in some cases, to support these functions. Changed functions are: atleast_1d, atleast_2d, atleast_3d, broadcast_arrays, meshgrid, ogrid, histogramdd. np.unique return_inverse shape for multi-dimensional inputs# When multi-dimensional inputs are passed to np.unique with return_inverse=True, the unique_inverse output is now shaped such that the input can be reconstructed directly using np.take(unique, unique_inverse) when axis=None, and np.take_along_axis(unique, unique_inverse, axis=axis) otherwise. (gh-25553, gh-25570) any and all return booleans for object arrays# The any and all functions and methods now return booleans also for object arrays. Previously, they did a reduction which behaved like the Python or and and operators which evaluates to one of the arguments. You can use np.logical_or.reduce and np.logical_and.reduce to achieve the previous behavior. (gh-25712) np.can_cast cannot be called on Python int, float, or complex# np.can_cast cannot be called with Python int, float, or complex instances anymore. This is because NEP 50 means that the result of can_cast must not depend on the value passed in. Unfortunately, for Python scalars whether a cast should be considered \"same_kind\" or \"safe\" may depend on the context and value so that this is currently not implemented. In some cases, this means you may have to add a specific path for: if type(obj) in (int, float, complex): .... (gh-26393)",

There are so many different ways to build views and multiply arrays that I can’t remember them and never know which to use, and have to relearn them every time I use numpy… broadcasting, padding, repeating, slicing, stacking, transposing, outers, inners, dots of all sorts, and half the stack overflow answers lead to the most confusing pickaxe of all: einsum. Am I alone? I love numpy, but every time I reach for it I somehow get stuck for hours on what ought to be really simple indexing problems. reply salamo 18 hours agoparentWhen I started out I was basically stumbling around for code that worked. Things got a lot easier for me once I sat down and actually understood broadcasting. The rules are: 1) scalars always broadcast, 2) if one vector has fewer dimensions, left pad it with 1s and 3) starting from the right, check dimension compatibility, where compatibility means the dimensions are equal or one of them is 1. Example: np.ones((2,3,1)) * np.ones((1,4)) = np.ones((2,3,4)) Once your dimensions are correct, it's a lot easier to reason your way through a problem, similar to how basic dimensional analysis in physics can verify your answer makes some sense. (I would disable broadcasting if I could, since it has caused way too many silent bugs in my experience. JAX can, but I don't feel like learning another library to do this.) Once I understood broadcasting, it was a lot easier to practice vectorizing basic algorithms. reply singhrac 16 minutes agorootparentThis is also helpful: https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles reply nerdponx 16 hours agorootparentprevThe broadcasting doc is surprisingly readable and easy to follow. And the rules are surprisingly simple. The diagrams and examples are excellent. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html After taking the time to work through that doc and ponder some real-world examples, I went from being very confused by broadcasting to employing intermediate broadcasting techniques in a matter of weeks. Writing out your array dimensions in the same style of their examples (either in a text file or on a notepad) is the key technique IMO: Image (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3 Scale (1d array): 3 Result (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3 And of course with practice you can do it in your head. reply o11c 14 hours agorootparentprevExplicit internal broadcasting (by adding an axis with an explicit `indefinite` size instead of `1`) would be so much simpler to reason about. Unfortunately there is far too much existing code and python is not type-safe. reply bramblerose 12 hours agorootparentYou can do this with `np.newaxis` - in the NumPy course I wrote as TA we required students to always be explicit about the axes (also in e.g. sums). It would be nice if you could disable the implicit broadcasting, but as you mention that would break so much code reply o11c 4 hours agorootparent`np.newaxis` explicitly adds a `1` dimension, not an `indefinite` one. reply akasakahakada 19 hours agoparentprevTo be honest einsum is the easiest one. You get fine control on which axis matmul to which. But I wish it can do more than matmul. The others are just messy shit. Like you got np.abs but no arr.abs, np.unique but no arr.unique. But now you have arr.mean. Sometimes you got argument name index, sometimes indices, sometimes accept (list, tuple), sometime only tuple. reply samsartor 18 hours agorootparenthttps://github.com/mcabbott/Tullio.jl is my favorite idea for extending einsum notation to more stuff. Really hope numpy/torch get something comparable! reply enkursigilo 9 hours agorootparentYeah, Tullio.jl is a great package. Basically, it is just a macro for generating efficient for loops. I guess, it might be hard to achieve similar feature in Python without metaprogramming. reply hansvm 14 hours agoparentprevIt gets more comfortable over time, but I remember feeling that way for the first year or three. My wishlist now is for most of numpy to just be a really great einsum implementation, along with a few analogous operations for the rest of the map-reduces numpy accelerates. I've been writing my own low-level numeric routines lately, so I'm not up-to-date on the latest news, but there have been a few ideas floating around over the last few years about naming your axes and defining operations in terms of those names [0,1,2,3]. That sort of thing looks promising to me, and one of those projects might be a better conceptual fit for you.

I think it's a logical next step in the evolution of the array programming paradigm. I particularly recommend checking out xarray. It has made my numpy-ish code like 90% shorter and it makes it trivial to juggle six+ dimensional arrays. If your data is on a grid (not shaped like a table/dataframe), I see no downsides to using xarray instead of bare numpy. reply mFixman 8 hours agoparentprevMost of the bugs I got on numpy programs came from a variable with a different ndims as expected being broadcast implicitly. Implicit type casting is considered a mistake in most programming languages; if I were to redesign numpy from scratch I would make all broadcasting explicit. My solution to these problems is asserting an array's shape often. Does anybody know is there's a tool like mypy or valgrind, but that checks mismatched array shapes rather than types or memory leaks? reply cozzyd 48 minutes agorootparentnumpy's API was carefully designed to match matlab, where most of its early users came from. reply mFixman 43 minutes agorootparentThen we are lucky they didn't decide to start their arrays at 1 :-) reply chpatrick 16 hours agoparentprevhttps://einops.rocks/#why-use-einops-notation reply pizza 16 hours agorootparenthttps://einx.readthedocs.io/ :) reply notrealyme123 10 hours agorootparent+1 been at your talk presenting it at a Retreat.

Pandas has a .pipe(fn) method, but without the lazy evaluation to enable the R symbol capturing magic, the syntax is pretty clunky and not particularly useful. The closest approximation is method chaining, which at least is more consistently available in Pandas than in Numpy. If you're talking about Dplyr \"verbs\" then no, there's nothing quite like that in Python, but it's much less necessary in Pandas or Polars than in R, because the set of standard tools for working with data frames in the bear libraries is much richer than in the R standard library. reply ayhanfuat 19 hours agoprev> The default integer type on Windows is now int64 rather than int32, matching the behavior on other platforms This was a footgun due to C long being int32 in win64.

That’s not true? Python string implementation is very optimized, probably have similar performance to C. reply mirashii 14 hours agorootparentIt is absolutely true that there is massive amounts of room for performance improvements for Python strings and that performance is generally subpar due to implementation decisions/restrictions. Strings are immutable, so no efficient truncation, concatenation, or modifications of any time, you're always reallocating. There's no native support for a view of string, so operations like iteration over windows or ranges have to allocate or throw away all the string abstractions. By nature of how the interpreter stores objects, Strings are always going to have an extra level of indirection compared to what you can do with a language like C. Python strings have multiple potential underlying representations, and thus have some overhead for managing and dealing with those multiple representations without exposing those details to user code reply Too 14 hours agorootparentThere is a built in memoryview.

Unless their dependencies/environments break, I expect that casual users won't even notice the upgrade. Even the new string dtype I expect would go unnoticed by half of users or more, because they won't be using it (because Numpy historically only had fixed-length strings and generally poor support for them) and so won't even think to try it. Pandas meanwhile has had a proper string dtype for a while, so anyone interested in doing serious work on strings in data frames / arrays would presumably be using Pandas anyway. Most of the breaking changes are in long-deprecated oddball functions that I literally have never seen used in the wild, and in the internal parts that will be a headache for library developers. The only change that a casual user might actually notice is the change in repr(np.float64(3.0)), from \"3.0\" to \"np.float64(3.0)\". reply cozzyd 14 hours agorootparentI suspect the C ABI break to be the biggest issue, though maybe fewer packages than I imagine compile against the numpy C ABI... reply notatoad 19 hours agoprevit feels like the first major release in 18 years which introduces lots of breaking changes should just be a fork rather than a version. let me do `pip install numpy2` and not have to worry about whether or not some other library in my project requires numpy:auth:api and this use Dan::Pandas:ver:auth:api; (of course, authors must authenticate to upload modules) reply sestep 15 hours agorootparentprevCould you elaborate further on this? Is it not the case that they'll still need to support numpy 1.x for at least the near-term future? My understanding was the parent comment was specifically talking about the technical difficulty of multiple versions for the same Python package, not the social problem of project and community management across breaking changes. reply vessenes 13 hours agorootparentYes, agreed they’ll need to support 1.x for (probably) quite a while, depending on API and interface changes between major versions. My point, or at least the point I had in mind, was that the social and technical go together in a lot of subtle and sometimes surprising ways; in this case, I’d bet the idea of a second package name a) is a bad one because it’s likely to create differing community expectations about whether or not it’s okay to keep using the 1.0 package, and b) would let people feel okay not upgrading for a while / demanding security and bug fix point releases on 1.x longer than if the package itself just updates its major version. reply rovr138 14 hours agorootparentprevFor the near term future, they can use the latest 1 version reply theamk 2 hours agoparentprevThat was my first reaction as well, but apparently as far a Python goes, numpy 2 code is fully compatible with numpy 1 code [0], with exception of single \"byte_bounds\" function (which sounds super rare, so I doubt it'd be a problem) So at least the migration path for python modules is clear: upgrade to be numpy 2 compatible, wait for critical mass, start adding numpy 2 features. Sounds way better than python2 -> python3 migration, for example. However, the fact that I had to look at 3rd party page to find this out is IMHO a big documentation problem.

When given the names \"kiki\" and \"bouba\", many cultural and linguistic communities worldwide robustly tend to label the shape on the left \"kiki\" and the one on the right \"bouba\". The bouba/kiki effect, or kiki/bouba effect, is a non-arbitrary mental association between certain speech sounds and certain visual shapes. Most narrowly, it is the tendency for people, when presented with the nonsense words bouba /ˈbuːbə/ and kiki /ˈkiːkiː/, to associate bouba with a rounded shape and kiki with a spiky shape. Its discovery dates back to the 1920s, when psychologists documented experimental participants as connecting nonsense words to shapes in consistent ways. There is a strong general tendency towards the effect worldwide; it has been robustly confirmed across a majority of cultures and languages in which it has been researched,[1] for example including among English-speaking American university students, Tamil speakers in India, speakers of certain languages with no writing system, young children, infants, and (though to a much lesser degree) the congenitally blind.[1] It has also been shown to occur with familiar names. The effect was investigated using fMRI in 2018.[2] The bouba/kiki effect is one form of sound symbolism.[3] Research[edit] Discovery[edit] This effect was first observed by Georgian psychologist Dimitri Uznadze in a 1924 paper.[4][non-primary source needed] He conducted an experiment with 10 participants who were given a list with nonsense words, shown six drawings for five seconds each, then instructed to pick a name for the drawing from the list of given words. He describes the different \"strategies\" participants developed to match words to drawings and quotes their reasoning. He also describes situations where participants described very specific forms that they associated with a nonsense word, without reference to the shown drawings. He develops a theory of four factors that influence the way names for objects are decided. In total, there were 42 words. For one particular drawing, 45% picked the same word. For three others, the percentages were 40%. Uznadze points out that this is significantly more overlap than one could expect, given the high number of possible words. He speculates that there must therefore be certain regularities \"which the human soul follows in the process of name-giving\". German American psychologist Wolfgang Köhler referred to Uznadze's experiment in a 1929 book[5] which showed two forms and asked readers which shape was called \"takete\" and which was called \"maluma\". Although he does not say so outright, Köhler implies that there is a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with \"takete\" and the rounded shape with \"maluma\".[6] Extension to other contexts[edit] In 2001, V. S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words \"kiki\" and \"bouba\" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India, \"Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?\" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as \"bouba\" and the jagged one as \"kiki\", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds consistently.[7][failed verification – see discussion] Daphne Maurer and colleagues showed that even children as young as 21⁄2 years old may show this preference.[8] More recent work by Ozge Ozturk and colleagues in 2013 showed that even 4-month-old infants have the same sound–shape mapping biases as adults and toddlers.[9] Infants are able to differentiate between congruent trials (pairing an angular shape with \"kiki\" or a curvy shape with \"bubu\") and incongruent trials (pairing a curvy shape with \"kiki\" or an angular shape with \"bubu\"). Infants looked longer at incongruent pairings than at congruent pairings. Infants' mapping was based on the combination of consonants and vowels in the words, and neither consonants nor vowels alone sufficed for mapping. These results suggest that some sound–shape mappings precede language learning, and may in fact aid in language learning by establishing a basis for matching labels to referents and narrowing the hypothesis space for young infants. Adults in this study, like infants, used a combination of consonant and vowel information to match the labels they heard with the shapes they saw. However, this was not the only strategy that was available to them. Adults, unlike infants, were also able to use consonant information alone and vowel information alone to match the labels to the shapes, albeit less frequently than the consonant–vowel combination. When vowels and consonants were put in conflict, adults used consonants more often than vowels. The effect has also been shown to emerge in other contexts, such as when words are paired with evaluative meanings (with \"bouba\" words associated with positive concepts and \"kiki\" words associated with negative concepts)[10] or when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as \"Molly\" with round silhouettes, and names such as \"Kate\" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (e.g., easygoingness with \"round names\"; determination with \"sharp names\"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.[11] Contexts where the effect is smaller or absent[edit] Other research suggests that this effect does not occur in all communities,[12] and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.[13] The bouba/kiki effect seems to be dependent on a long sensitive period, with high visual capacities in childhood being necessary for its typical development. Although the congenitally blind have been reported to show a bouba/kiki effect, they show a much smaller one for touched shapes than sighted individuals do for visual shapes.[14][15] Languages where the effect is smaller or absent[edit] Studies show that speakers of certain languages have notably failed to show the effect, namely including Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, and Romanian.[1] Neuroscience[edit] In 2019, Nathan Peiffer-Smadja and Laurent Cohen published the first study using fMRI to explore the bouba/kiki effect.[2] They found that prefrontal activation is stronger to mismatching (bouba with spiky shape) than to matching (bouba with round shape) stimuli. A subsequent study by Kelly McCormick and colleagues reported a similar pattern of greater activation for mismatched word-shape stimuli, but with most activity in parietal regions including the intraparietal sulcus and supramarginal gyrus, regions known to play a role in sensory association and perceptual-motor processing.[16] Peiffer-Smadja and Cohen also found that sound-shape matching also influences activations in the auditory and visual cortices, suggesting an effect of matching at an early stage in sensory processing.[2] Implications for understanding language[edit] Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.[7]: 17 The rounded shape may most commonly be named \"bouba\" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sounds in \"kiki\".[17] Alternatively, the distinction may be between coronal or dorsal consonants like /k/ and labial consonants like /b/.[18] Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects, at least for languages that make a vowel length distinction.[19] The presence of these \"synesthesia-like mappings\" suggest that this effect may be the neurological basis for sound symbolism, in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and events in the world.[citation needed] Research has also indicated that the effect may be a case of ideasthesia,[20] a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek idea and aisthesis, meaning \"sensing concepts\" or \"sensing ideas\", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.[21] See also[edit] Color symbolism Japanese sound symbolism Origin of language Semiotics Universal language References[edit] ^ a b c Ćwiek, Aleksandra; Fuchs, Susanne; Draxler, Christoph; Asu, Eva Liina; Dediu, Dan; Hiovain, Katri; Kawahara, Shigeto; Koutalidis, Sofia; Krifka, Manfred; Lippus, Pärtel; Lupyan, Gary; Oh, Grace E.; Paul, Jing; Petrone, Caterina; Ridouane, Rachid; Reiter, Sabine; Schümchen, Nathalie; Szalontai, Ádám; Ünal-Logacev, Özlem; Zeller, Jochen; Perlman, Marcus; Winter, Bodo (2022). \"The bouba/Kiki effect is robust across cultures and writing systems\".

(Reggio Emilia is similar to Montessori in that it is child-led exploration but different in that encourages multiple cross-modal forms of expression to aid comprehension.) The Reggio Emilia exhibit featured children performing a cross-modal exercise of drawing the sounds of various types of shoes walking down stairs to illustrate the \"Hundred Languages of Children\" concept. It showed how kids translate auditory experiences into visual ones - high heels would been drawn with spikey patterns and construction boots would be big wavey ones. This is reminiscent of the Bouba-Kiki effect. But other smaller nuances such as duration translating to span and loudness to magnitude. I took away a fascinating insight from childhood cognition: children effortlessly bridge sensory modalities, an ability that often diminishes in adults to the point that asking an adult to “draw this sound” or “build something that feels like this smell” is met with a blank look but which a child is often completely game to try. Tasking an adult with a cross-modal assignment literally does not compute. This cross-modal perception revealed that children possess a remarkable synesthetic intuition, using diverse forms of expression to understand and interpret the world—an ability I had completely forgotten as an adult, which hindered my communication with young children in early education environments. It highlighted the importance of nurturing cross modal communication styles and once one notices it (like in say Mr. Rogers opening ritual to use multiple queues to engage children’s parasympathetic nervous system) one unlocks a whole new vocabulary with not just children but adults. It’s been a powerful tool in my creative toolbox since. reply spencerchubb 19 hours agoparentI wonder if the ability diminishes in adults, or if adults are more inhibited and worried about looking foolish. Try the same experiment with adults after drinking alcohol! reply anonymous_sorry 10 hours agorootparentAs a kid I instinctively associated different days of the week with colours. This is a form of synaesthesia. As an adult I never think this way, and even when I try can only even remember one of the colour associations (Friday was orange). My cod-biological explanation is that a child's brain is still forming connections and the process of becoming an adult involves pruning many of these connections to become more focused and efficient. reply zeta0134 5 hours agorootparentMy letter-color synesthesia continues to fire on all cylinders well into adulthood. It's just a form of memory association of course. I can see that this 'e' is (in my editor) white text on a muted grey background. But that 'e' is also, simultaneously, the brightest lime green you ever laid eyes on. Like #00FF00, extremely light green. Every 'e' in every word lights up in my mind's eye in exactly this color. Most vowels do the same, consonants are inconsistent, numbers are pretty strong. It's a fun little memory trick, and it was surprising to learn that it's not a universal experience. Not just \"your letter-color association is different from mine\" (it seems to be highly personal) but \"wait, you don't do that at all?\" reply anbardoi 7 hours agorootparentprevWhile reading this comment, I was thinking \"tuesday is blue, friday? Definitely orange\" and then read you saying (Friday was orange) a split second later reply jspash 5 hours agorootparentTuesday rhymes with blue. Not to mention \"Blue Tuesday\" is a phrase used quite often. You might be associating orange with Friday because it makes you think of the sun and going outdoors? It's all very interesting. Even more so because I don't think of days/colours. My mind gives the days size and mass. ie. starting with Sunday (I'm American) the day is small. And as the week progresses the days get larger, heavier and denser. Until Saturday, which is a big fat puffy ball of \"day\". You can do what you want with it and it will just be there and be your friend. I love Saturdays. reply redman25 4 hours agorootparentprevHmm, my first thought was that Friday was purple. Tuesday is definitely blue though. reply automatic6131 5 hours agorootparentprev+1 for tuesday being blue. Is Wednesday green? reply mandmandam 3 hours agorootparentIf Tuesday is blue, Wednesday is green, and Friday is orange then it would makes sense that Thursday is yellow, Monday is violet, Sunday is indigo and Saturday is red... Nature abhors a vacuum, but it loves a rainbow. reply sethammons 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you take this picture and ask adults and kids which way the bus is traveling, kids get it right more often than adults https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/which-way-bus-going-why-adult... Spoilers: adults prune information for more efficient processing and in doing so lose information reply cdrini 9 hours agorootparentI'm not sure I think this illustrates different types of intelligences. For me, looking at the image, I have to suspend disbelief about a lot of things. This is a very simplified picture of a bus, lots of elements are missing/unrealistic, so I have to try to determine what missing things are part of the puzzle and which things are just coincidence. I think children would not be able to suspend their disbelief as quickly, and will instead immediately map the image to the real world object. They don't notice that the back bumper and the front bumper are identical (which they shouldn't be) or that the back window and the front window are identical (which they shouldn't be). So looking at this image, I decided \"ok so this isn't meant to be a real bus, it's some sort of puzzle, so let me look for clues about it's direction of motion.\" That first part, \"this isn't meant to be a real bus\", is the piece that causes the difference, I believe. It's that thinking that makes it difficult to think \"well what's on the other side of the bus?\", because who knows, this bus doesn't have real world bumpers who knows if it has real world doors. As an adult, we can abstract and reason about a theoretical bus that might not have doors, whereas I think a child would connect that to the concrete bus and have difficulty abstracting. reply mopierotti 19 hours agorootparentprevI don't think this is a good example. The bus is clearly a simplified representation. If the answer/explanation given was actually correct then you'd also expect the bus to have other details like side view mirrors. Edit: I hate to dwell on this too much, but even if a door and mirrors were visible, the bus could be in reverse. This seems to be more of a case of accidentally picking the intended answer due to a lack of knowledge. (Of levels of abstraction in representation and of vehicle design.) That said, I don't necessarily disagree with the underlying point being made. reply anonymous_sorry 10 hours agorootparentI don't think the point is to nitpick how realistic the representation is or how fair the question is. The point is children react to the question differently from the way adults do. And that's true despite (or perhaps because of) what an adult thinks of the question. reply YurgenJurgensen 5 hours agorootparentBut that's a different point to what GP was making. It wasn't that children answer differently to adults, it's that they get it 'right' more often than adults. Which is still more about ignorance allowing them to make the same assumptions as the questioner than thought processes. A child might not even be aware that people in other countries might drive on the other side of the road, and so be sure of their 'correct' answer, but most adults know that without knowing the location of this image, the question can't be answered. EDIT: And if the question weren't ambiguous, you'd basically be telling people the answer, since as soon as you say \"assume it's in the US\", you give a massive clue that bilateral asymmetry is relevant. reply soared 17 hours agorootparentprevOr because kids are very familiar with busses and adults are not. reply dkdbejwi383 11 hours agorootparentWhy would kids be more familiar with busses than adults? reply I_am_uncreative 10 hours agorootparentSchool buses are a staple of childhood, at least in the US. reply xattt 11 hours agorootparentprev> Why are [large vehicles] so exciting to a kid? Perhaps it is obvious: they are loud, big, fast, complex, powerful. There is the element of danger. Adaptively, there must be a survival advantage for children who are curious about loud, large, fast beings and objects. https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry... reply dkdbejwi383 10 hours agorootparentI don’t see the correlation, sorry! I’d expect an adult to be more familiar with a bus by virtue of having taken the bus more often than a child. Whether or not that’s exciting or just a mundane commute shouldn’t affect familiarity. reply bowsamic 13 hours agorootparentprevInterestingly I got it instantly but I’ve used busses far more in my adult life than as a child reply iforgotpassword 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn't this exactly the point? You look at this the analytical way, decide the bus doesn't have enough detail to be a realistic representation and stop there, maybe looking around for other clues. A very good example imo. Sure, the bus could be in reverse, but it could also be a British bus driving in the US. Or we could be looking at a reflection of the bus. Or we could be looking at the reflection of a British bus going in reverse. This is not about determining the direction with 100% certainty. This is about having a clue at all which you can justify, which adults mostly don't. reply cnasc 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this bus is clearly intended to be a school bus but it’s missing too much detail. If the absence of the door is a valid clue, then so is the absence of the big red stop sign that is on the non-door-side. reply phist_mcgee 11 hours agorootparentBig red stop sign? Like on the bus? reply portaouflop 12 hours agorootparentprevLay off the copium - busses don’t have red stop signs everywhere (for example they don’t have them here) But they always have doors… reply defrost 12 hours agorootparentThe other day someone pointed at the open platform of RM1353 and asked me: did you take the doors off this bus? “No, it was built that way.” She looked amazed, and pleased. https://www.theredbus.co.uk/blog/platform-sharing reply asddubs 8 hours agorootparentprevthey also always have mirrors, which is the first thing an adult would probably look for (since it applies more universally to vehicles) reply smokel 13 hours agorootparentprevI tried to find some source for this, but could not trace it back further than a YouTube video from 2016 [1], which is very light on details, to say the least. This kind of \"research\" does not really warrant the amount of inspirational blog posts that has resulted from it. In fact, as an adult I tend to reject 80% of these stories as nonsense. [1] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVKR4A8a4lw reply underyx 13 hours agorootparentprevI think in the US kids use buses (school buses) at a higher rate than adults. The bus in the image is also colored yellow, just like school buses. Perhaps it has more to do with kids just having more recent experiences solving the same problem in real life? reply nkrisc 7 hours agorootparentprevI actually did have trouble with that bus image. However it’s not as though adults make this trade-off for no gain. Ask a 6-year old to spot a bird in a tree a hundred feet away and they’ll be looking around everywhere for it simply because they don’t know what they’re looking for. An adult knows exactly what to look for: a dark shape in the branches moving separately from the motion of the branches in the wind behind it, briefly silhouetted against the sky while those same branches move, probably 30 ft or higher off the ground (depending on the size of the tree, of course). You probably even know instinctively what size of thing you’re looking for based on your knowledge of the apparent angular size of a bird at a given distance you’re also instinctively able to estimate. reply tempestn 13 hours agorootparentprevHuh, it seems to me that realizing buses have doors on the side adjacent to the edge of the road is more an example of crystallized intelligence than fluid. reply crazygringo 17 hours ago [flagged]rootparentprevnext [9 more] That bus example is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Spoiler follows: The solution is supposedly that in countries where you drive on the right-hand side of the road, children immediately deduce that the bus is traveling to the left. This seems nonsensical to me because it's not even clear the bus is on a road, or it it is, that it's on the far side of the road. As far as I can tell, the bus is in a dirt field. Or if it's a dirt road, there clearly seems to be enough space for another bus to pass behind it. And since there are no citations, I actually don't even believe it. I've seen enough completely made-up statistics on LinkedIn blogs that unless there's a link to a study, at this point I assume the authors are just making sh*t up. reply strbean 16 hours agorootparentThe rationale they provide is that you can't see the door to the bus. So we are looking at the driver's side of the bus. Ignore \"Which was is the bus going?\" and instead ask \"Which side is the front of the bus?\" And, knowing that we are looking at the driver's side because of the absence of doors, the answer depends on which side of the road the bus is designed to be driven on. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentOh is that supposed to be the rationale? I mean I can't even tell. Because no bus looks the way the bus in the image looks. I've never in my life seen a bus where the windshield was the same size and shape as the back window. Never in my life seen a bus that didn't have brake lights or turn signals. And so forth. In other words, there are so many things wrong with the \"bus\" that I don't know why you'd assume that if the \"artist\" had drawn it from the other side they would have bothered to include a door. reply smeej 16 hours agorootparentI think you've just confirmed the post's point about overanalysis. This type of thinking is exactly why adults get it right less often than children. Kids immediately recognize the view must be from the driver's side of the bus because they're not examining the situation. They're taking the first piece of relevant information and rolling with it. No door means passengers get on the other side, so it's going whatever way you assume traffic across the street should go based on where you live. reply ffsm8 15 hours agorootparentBut there is a difference in the picture. You'd also determine that it's going left when looking at the windshields, as only the left side is completely straight. Honestly, this image is a terrible example to illustrate their point. I think it's more likely that children are more likely to actually use public transit, which is why they'd be able to detect the missing door quickly. reply Biganon 10 hours agorootparentThe right windshield is straight as well, you see part of a building behind it reply ffsm8 8 hours agorootparentI meant the small indention below the windshield that's only on the right side. The black line from the window ends slightly further out then the chassis of the bus reply piperswe 16 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, my assumption was that this was some simplified drawing of a bus that didn't have doors in the first place reply colordrops 11 hours agorootparentprevThe bus is missing many details of a real bus, so it's clearly an abstraction that leaves out detail, meaning that it's reasonable to assume the artist may have crudely left out doors from the picture. This doesn't make the kids \"right\". reply barrenko 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, adults are RLHF'ed kids. reply npteljes 8 hours agorootparentprevI'd say that adults worry, and that's because they are explicitly taught as children to label such behavior nonsense and discard it. reply mistermann 4 hours agorootparentprevMy theory is that a lot of capabilities remain in the hardware stack, but they are made inaccessible by the software stack (culture mainly, but also that type of media we consume, which can act as a catalyst...or not, if the right kind isn't present/popular). reply mock-possum 16 hours agorootparentprevI think that’s it - they know they don’t know the ‘right’ way to draw sound, so instead of just doing whataver occurs to them, they wait, for fear of doing it ‘wrong.’ The concept that the only ‘wrong’ thing to do is to do nothing is a real important thing to internalize as an adult - not always where professional work is concerned, but nearly always where artistic pursuits are concerned. You’re doing it ‘right’ if you’re doing it. reply avg_dev 19 hours agoparentprevyou know, i think this skill can be learned. i used to definitely have very little ability to \"bridge sensory modalities\", but i've been studying music and performance as a hobby somewhat seriously for about 6 years now. and i now feel like i have much more of that ability than i did before. i probably had it as a kid, just as you were saying, but i am definitely well into adulthood now :) (there is a radio program i listen to where the guy talks about the music he plays and the context and he explains many things in this sort of \"bridging sensory modalities\" sort of way. and i used to always think, \"that is just some straight up nonsense that he is saying.\" but now, i often see what he is saying very literally...) reply mionhe 15 hours agorootparentThat's interesting. Does that program have a name? I'm interested in looking it up... reply avg_dev 5 hours agorootparenthttps://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/about-time reply DaoVeles 17 hours agoparentprevHuh, that is pretty cool. I mean I wouldn't have any problem with trying to do that \"Draw a sound\", \"What colour is the concept of the wind\" etc. Maybe I'm just odd but it is something I just never really lost with time, I suppose. reply anal_reactor 12 hours agoparentprev>This cross-modal perception revealed that children possess a remarkable synesthetic intuition The more I learn about children the more it seems like childhood is basically 20-year-long acid trip with a bit of amphetamine here and there. reply dyslexit 55 minutes agoprevI wonder if this effect can be explained by the we form the \"bouba\"/\"kiki\" sounds when we speak them. \"Kiki\" has a sharper enunciation when using your tongue and mouth to form it, while \"bouba\" feels more like an open round one. reply jesprenj 22 hours agoprevWhat about the effect where for some pairs of words that don't theoretically have ordering preference (kiki/bouba vs bouba/kiki), (plus/minus vs minus/plus), (on/off vs off/on), (positive/negative vs negative/positive) have some psychological order that most people use and if the other ordering is used, it sound weird? Does this effect have a name? reply JoshTriplett 21 hours agoparentEven among words that do theoretically have an ordering preference, some people have different habits. I knew someone who habitually said \"three or two\", rather than \"two or three\". Leaving aside the effect of prosody mentioned in another comment, I think the rest of it is habit, together with the brain's tendency to group things. If you're used to hearing \"plus or minus\", your brain may be grouping it together into a phrase whose meaning you understand directly without decomposition, so if you hear \"minus or plus\" there's a moment of having to map the components to the composite meaning, together with wondering if the speaker intends the difference to have a meaning.

English if you were to describe some thing and you had many adjectives for its size, color, origin, age, a visual pattern like \"polka dot\" or striped, and so on - many native speakers (at least in my region) would intuitively assemble that clause in the same order as each other without really being able to clearly articulate why. There are some supposed grammar rules that inform it but in my circles people just explain it as basically due to vibes. It was definitely not anything I remember from my public school education growing up. If I'm describing a large, heavy, square, shiny, metal, block - that's the order that feels right for me. If I try shifting any pair of those around it just feels weird and the farther apart they appear in my original ordering, the weirder the swap would feel for me. \"square metal heavy shiny large block\" has awful 'mouthfeel', as it were.

The shape with sharp, jagged edges would occur in real life if it were made of some hard material, perhaps, like glass, metal, etc. The shape with the soft, curvy lines would occur if it were made of something softer and possibly elastic. It doesn't take much intuition to guess that the sharper shape will produce a sound closer to \"ki,\" with sharp transients and lots of high frequencies - like a piece of glass or metal falling - and the rounded one perhaps closer to \"bou,\" with softer transients and perhaps a time-varying resonant frequency as the shape is malleable (think of the sound of a drop of water landing). reply madebythejus 19 hours agoparentThe effect is somehow also visible in the shapes of the letters, with ‘B’, ‘O’ ‘U’ being rounded and soft.

But the same preference was there: \"kepick\" with its \"sharp\" sounds favored the angled drawing, \"Oona\" the more undulating. There were some other questions as well, such as a hypothetical about which shape was male and which female (strong preference in the class towards \"Oona\" being female).

I was referring to waveforms because of the duality with sound reply rcxdude 21 hours agorootparentI think the surprising thing would be if the logic goes high frequency -> spiky waveform -> spiky shape, because that would imply that that particular representation of the sound is being used as part of the intuition. Which would be unusual, as it's not generally how people experience sound (for sure the opposite doesn't really occur: even someone very used to looking at waveforms will struggled to actually understand a sound by looking at the waveform to anywhere near the detail of listening to it).

For example sine waves, saws and square waves are very intuitive to me. I think with graphical representation of sound the problem is that the experience of complex sounds is a 3 dimensional thing to humans. When we talk about music, layers or tracks or whatever you want to call them always become a thing. For the sound nerds: A spectrum representation also does not reflect how we experience sound. We humans/animals are so trained or born to distinguish sound sources by timbre. A spectrum analyser splits it on the spectrum of tones, not the spectrum of timbres, therefor it's still not a good representation. reply bowsamic 13 hours agorootparentprevOf course we do, humans can sense timbre and transients and all that reply Biganon 10 hours agorootparentBeing able to sense timbre has nothing to do with being able to tell the shape of the waveform of a sound.

True, we don't know what frequency we hear/wavelength we see is associate with which specific number, but that's irrelevant. Humans are born with the capability of doing a mechanical Fourier decomposition in our ears. Knowing the amplitude at each frequency, as all humans that can hear do, gives us information about the waveform. Sensing timbre therefore is information about the waveform. We do not have complete information (e.g. we do not sense all the phase information) but we have approximate information about the time-domain waveform. reply bowsamic 6 hours agorootparentTo be more specific, lots of high frequency content means we are hearing sharp transients, so quickly changing waves.

    "commentBody": "I learned Haskell in just 15 years (duckrabbit.tech)248 points by aranchelk 15 hours agohidepastfavorite165 comments munchler 14 hours agoCute. All kidding aside, though, functional programming is worth the effort to learn, and it doesn't actually take 15 years. The payoff is at the end of the article: \"It’s quite natural to program in Haskell by building a declarative model of your domain data, writing pure functions over that data, and interacting with the real world at the program’s boundaries. That’s my favorite way to work, Haskell or not.\" Haskell can be intimidating, though, so I would recommend F# for most beginners. It supports OOP and doesn't require every single function to be pure, so the learning curve is less intense, but you end up absorbing the same lesson as above. reply initplus 13 hours agoparentYes - the value of functional programming isn't that working in OCAML, or F#, or Haskell is 10x as productive as other languages. But that it can teach you worthwhile lessens about designing software that apply equally to imperative languages. Modelling the business domain, reasoning and managing side effects, avoiding common imperative bugs, these are all valuable skills to develop. F# is a great language to learn, and very approachable. Worst part about it is interacting with antiquated .NET API's. (I can't believe the state that .NET support for common serialization formats is still in...) reply sidkshatriya 13 hours agorootparent> Yes - the value of functional programming isn't that working in OCAML, or F#, or Haskell is 10x as productive as other languages. This is not true in my personal experience. As has been famously said (paraphrased): Functional programming makes tough problems easy and easy problems tough. In other words the value of functional programming depends on your domain. reply chrischen 4 hours agorootparentIt’s only tough to change your way of thinking. Most people making the switch find it tough because they are trying to find imperative techniques to do something in a functional way and struggling because they can’t find an if else statement or a for loop. But if you were never taught to think in terms of conditional branching or looping indexes you’ll save a lot of time. reply initplus 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe my phrasing is not clear - I meant that these languages are indeed not significantly more productive. reply grumpyprole 1 hour agorootparentBy what measure? Haskell can be a huge productivity multiplier. The standard library is built upon many powerful, unifying and consistent mathematical abstractions. For example, there is almost no boilerplate to write for any traversal, mapping, error handling etc. The average Pythonista simply has no idea what they are missing. But Haskell doesn't have anywhere near the third party ecosystem of Python, so is less productive by some measures. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevBut (and I agree with the GP) they are. They are overwhelmingly more productive, in a way that you often can't even compare quantitatively. They are also a lot less productive. It depends entirely on what you are doing. reply antonvs 13 hours agorootparentprev> easy problems tough. That needs a qualifier: it can make easy problems tough if you're not familiar with how to solve them in a functional context. A big part of that is because smart people have already solved the tough problems and made them available as language features or libraries. reply cubefox 9 hours agorootparent> That needs a qualifier: it can make easy problems tough if you're not familiar with how to solve them in a functional context. All problems are easy if you are familiar with how to solve them. Unfortunately it's part of the problem to find out how to solve them, and that can be unusually hard in case of functional programming. Like solving something with recursion instead of loops + states. There is a reason cookbooks use loops not recursion. reply simiones 6 hours agorootparentprevNot really, certain problems are just inherently harder to express in a purely functional way than they are in an imperative way (and the reverse is just as true). For example, computing a histogram is much simpler in imperative terms (keep an array of histogram values, go through the original list, add 1 to the array element corresponding to the current element in this list) than in a purely functional style, especially if you need a somewhat efficient implementation. My favorite example of this is implementing quicksort. It's significantly easier in C than it is in Haskell. reply chuckadams 5 hours agorootparent> My favorite example of this is implementing quicksort. It's significantly easier in C than it is in Haskell. Oh please, what's so hard about qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] qsort [] = [] qsort (p:xs) = qsort lesser ++ [p] ++ qsort greater where lesser = filter (= p) xs :) folks, take that with a big ol /s, you would never want to actually use that algorithm. But the real deal isn't all that awful: https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2019/5/13/quicksort-with-haskell reply trealira 4 hours agorootparentI know you're being sarcastic, but even in this linked-list quicksort, it could be made more efficient. By defining lesser and greater separately, you're traversing the list twice. You could compute them at the same time by changing those last two lines to this: where (lesser, greater) = partition (imperative code Monads if you wanted, and that gives a \"functional by default\" environment, whereas most imperative languages default to mutable objects etc that are not friendly to functional-style programming. But then the more modern languages are catching on with immutable by default variables etc. so in the end the differences between newer languages may not be that great after all... reply simiones 5 hours agorootparentprevWell, I'd say using an entirely different collection type than the rest of language (STArray instead of [a]) is already a big complication. It also ends up being more than double the size of the Java code. And, as the author admits, it's actually even slower than the original not-quicksort implementation above, because it actually has to make a copy of the original list, and then return a copy of the mutated array. So, one of the best sorting algorithms ever devised is not actually usable to sort a [a] in Haskell... I maintain this is a good example of making an easy problem tough. reply tome 4 hours agorootparent> I'd say using an entirely different collection type than the rest of language (STArray instead of [a]) is already a big complication Haskell uses many different collection types, just like any other language. Why not? > it's actually even slower than the original not-quicksort implementation above, because it actually has to make a copy of the original list, and then return a copy of the mutated array. Sure, but it could also not do that, if callers are happy to provide a mutable array, just like any other language ... > one of the best sorting algorithms ever devised is not actually usable to sort a [a] in Haskell Indeed! One of the best algorithms for sorting a mutable array can't be used on an immutable data type, just like any other language ... None of this invalidates your original claim that \"It's significantly easier in C than it is in Haskell\" of course. reply chuckadams 4 hours agorootparentprevquicksort2 has a very reasonable constraint of Array, it's the helpers that use the STArray implementation. I suspect it wouldn't be hard to port to MArray, though I don't know that it would perform any better (maybe avoiding some copies since MArray is actually usable outside of runST). I also suspect the overhead of the copies pays off with larger lists given the lack of space leaks compared to the naive algorithm. Some benchmarks of different-sized lists would have been nice. I'm not a cheerleader for Haskell, it's not the most appropriate language for every job (certainly not for quicksort). But some folks suddenly become hyper-optimizing assembly programmers whenever anyone has the thought of porting a sql crud app to another language... Horses for courses and all that. reply jiggawatts 11 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely! Any beginner can readily combine the catamorphisms and anamorphisms in `recursion-schemes`, or use the ready-made hylomorphisms for common tasks such as setting a value in a data structure. What could be simpler? /s https://wiki.haskell.org/Zygohistomorphic_prepromorphisms reply amoss 1 hour agorootparentThey have played us for absolute fools. reply NinoScript 13 hours agorootparentprevSo you’re saying that it does make you 10x as productive? reply pyuser583 4 hours agorootparentprevHow do you “Hello World” in a functional language? Doesn’t it have side effects? reply trealira 4 hours agorootparentYes, and AFAIK, you're pretty much free to cause side-effects in functional languages; it's just a bit awkward and somewhat discouraged. It's kind of like how C still has goto, yet it's still a structured programming language. Even in Haskell, which tries to control side-effects more, it's not hard; it's just that it's stuck with an \"IO\" annotation. Any function that calls an IO function also becomes an IO function; it's infectious. main :: IO () main = putStrLn \"hello, world\" reply dllthomas 2 hours agorootparentprevIt has an effect. Whether it's a \"side effect\" depends on how we've defined that. One way of viewing Haskell is that you are lazily constructing the single composite \"effect on the world\" called main. helloWorld :: IO () then is a value representing an effect, but it only actually happens when it becomes a part of main. Threads complicate this but don't completely destroy the model. reply sevensor 4 hours agorootparentprevThere's some real confusion about what \"functional\" means, because it depends on who's speaking. Writing _exclusively_ pure functions is a Haskell thing. A much looser definition of the functional style would be to say that you mostly write pure functions over immutable data, but when you have to actually do a side effect you write a procedure that talks to the outside world and go on with your day. If you go digging in this site's archives from about ten years ago, I recall numerous debates about what constituted functional programming, and whether the latter counts at all. But if we _are_ talking about Haskell, the answer to your question is obviously \"Monads.\" reply cess11 4 hours agorootparentprevThe string \"Hello World\" evaluates to itself, what else do you need? Edit: Eh, I thought it was a fun quip. reply pyuser583 47 minutes agorootparentI laughed reply williamcotton 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat easy problems are tough in F#?

In other words, if we call the class of tough problems T and easy problems NT, we have T==NT, given FP. reply baby 4 hours agorootparentprevOcaml definitely doesn’t make you more productive reply Bostonian 2 hours agorootparentI have not used OCaml, but presumably Jane Street thinks OCaml makes their coders more productive. reply wruza 11 hours agorootparentprevHot take of the day: you learn that with imperative programming just as well. I familiarized myself with fp to the point of writing scheme and haskell around 15 years ago. Read the classics, understood advanced typing, lambda calculus and so on. The best “fp” I’m using nowadays is closures, currying in the form of func.bind(this[, first]) and map/filter. Which all are absolutely learnable by the means of closures, which are useful but I can live without. Sometimes not having these makes you write effing code instead of fiddling with its forms for hours. Still waiting for the returns from arcane fp-like code I produced earlier. Cannot recognize nor understand none of my projects in this style that I bothered to save in vcs. Imperative code reads like prose, I have some of it still in production since 2010. These FP talks are disguised elitism imo (not necessarily bad faith). Beta reduction and monadic transformers sound so cool, but that’s it job-wise. reply cubefox 9 hours agorootparent> These FP talks are disguised elitism imo (not necessarily bad faith). Beta reduction and monadic transformers sound so cool, but that’s it job-wise. They may be disguised mathematics. People are into math because it is neat / elegant / cool. So they study it regardless of whether it has a practical use or not. reply photonthug 7 hours agorootparentSome programmers have serious math envy.

Seniors should be people that have dealt with this aspect of their own talent, not juniors who are promoted in spite of or because of it reply dboreham 5 hours agorootparentprevMathematics is just a kind of programming. And vice versa. reply cubefox 1 hour agorootparentPrograms fundamentally have state, while mathematical equations have not. Math is in its core declarative, while programming is essentially imperative, at least under the hood. reply jerf 5 hours agorootparentprevIn theory, you could pick up your one language, say, Java, and through the course of a normal career learn everything necessary to program in that language in the best possible way. In practice, it's a pretty well-known phenomenon experienced by many skilled programmers that being forced into different styles by different languages results in learning things that you would only have learned very slowly if you had stuck only to your original language. To be concrete about the \"very slowly\", I'm talking time frames of your entire career, if not your entire life and beyond. It would be a long time programming in Java before you discover the concept of something like \"pure functions\" as a distinct sort of function, a desirable sort of function, and one that you might want organize your programming style around. Of course, having heard of the concept already, we'd all like to fancy ourselves smart enough to figure it out in less than, say, three decades. But we're just lying to ourselves when we do that. Even the smartest of us is not as smart as all of us. You are not independently capable of rediscovering everything all the various programming communities have discovered over decades. If you want to know what even the smartest of us can do on their own without reference to decades of experience of others, you can look into the state of computer programming in more-or-less the 1980s, 90s if you're feeling generous. I think we've learned a lot since then, and the delta between the modern programmer and a 1980s programmer certainly isn't in their IQ or anything similar, it is in their increased collective community experience. By getting out into systems that force us to learn different paradigms, and into communities that have learned how to use them, we draw on the experience of others and cover far more ground than we could ever have covered on our own, or in the context of a single language where we can settle into a local optima comfort zone. Jumping out of your original community is kind of an annealing process for our programming skills. \"The best “fp” I’m using nowadays is closures, currying in the form of func.bind(this[, first]) and map/filter.\" That is really not the lesson about software design that FP teaches, and blindly carrying those principles into imperative programming is at times a quite negative value, as your experience bears out. FP has more to say about purity of functions, the utility of composition of small parts, the flexibility of composition with small parts, ways to wrap parts of the program that can't be handled that way, and providing an existence proof that despite what an imperative programmer might think it is in fact possible to program this way at a system architecture level. I actually agree 100% that anyone whose takeaway from FP is \"we should use map everywhere because they're better than for loops and anyone who uses for loops is a Bad Programmer\" missed the forest for the leaves, and I choose that modification of the standard metaphor carefully. I consider my programming style highly influenced by my time in functional programming land and you'd need to do a very careful search to find a \"map\" in my code. That's not what it's about. I'm not surprised when imperative code is messed up by translating that into it. reply SkyMarshal 1 hour agorootparent> FP has more to say about purity of functions, the utility of composition of small parts, the flexibility of composition with small parts, ways to wrap parts of the program that can't be handled that way, and providing an existence proof that despite what an imperative programmer might think it is in fact possible to program this way at a system architecture level. Adding to that, in my case it also made realize that deterministic elimination of entire classes of errors in large, complex code bases, in a systematic rather than ad-hoc way, is actually possible. Prior to discovering fp, and particularly Haskell's type system, I spent much effort trying to do that with a combination of TDD and increasingly elaborate try/catch/throw error handling. Discovering Haskell's compiler, type system, and monadic quarantining of effects obsoleted all that effort and was a huge eye opener for me. And a nice side-effect is easy, reliable refactor-ability. Being able to apply those concepts to imperative and other programming paradigms is where the real value in fp is, imho. Programmers still wrangling with the Tarpit [1] need to take a look if they haven't already. [1]:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34954126 reply wruza 4 hours agorootparentprevThat might be, probably is. But the representation of FP gets mostly done by those who are only halfway there, creating an impression that it is a better way of programming overall, when it’s just a mixed bag of approaches dictated by a set of esoteric languages (from business pov). The worst part is that it doesn’t translate verbatim to any non-fringe language and creates a mess in it, due to adopted inertia. At least that is my experience with FP “recruitment”. I wish I skipped this FP tour completely and instead learned how to structure my programs directly. Could save me a year or five. Maybe there’s no better way, but in practice clear explanations are always better than these arcane teachings where you repeat something until you get it by yourself. reply cess11 4 hours agorootparentprev\"In theory, you could pick up your one language, say, Java, and through the course of a normal career learn everything necessary to program in that language in the best possible way.\" OK, then you know about currying, immutable data structures, map/reduce/filter, &c. Because Java has that since way back when. No real closures, I think, but that doesn't matter much because the anonymous functions do what you want pretty much all the time and you could probably invent your own closures if you really want something else. reply cess11 4 hours agorootparentprevI commonly implement things in an imperative style as a quick hack, then if it gets use I translate it into a more functional style. It kind of just happens as I clean it up and refactor during revisits. It might be a matter of taste, but I enjoy code built with functional abstractions that allow neat composable data flows and some caches loitering around. I find it also helps when adding UI. Sometimes performance could be better with mutation, but when I'm at that point I've already spent much more time tuning the thing with caches. reply beders 12 hours agoparentprevI feel the same pay-off - but arrived at that point via Clojure. Immutable-first, aim for purity, ability to drop out of it when necessary. As stringent as you need it to be (static vs. dynamic types vs. specs), as flexible as you want it to be. reply czhu12 3 hours agoparentprev> doesn't require every single function to be pure having never done F# or haskell, doesn't that start getting into the territory of languages that encourage functional programming like ruby or javascript (modern javascript)? reply realPtolemy 11 hours agoparentprevOr Elixir! Quite easy to grasp as well. reply nequo 13 hours agoparentprevThat’s interesting because F#’s OOP, as someone who knows neither C# nor Java, makes it more intimidating to me than OCaml. Also interesting that when FP is mentioned, Hindley-Milner is implicitly understood to be part of FP too even though it doesn’t have to be. Clojure emphasizes immutability and FP but with dynamic typing and everything that comes with that. reply munchler 13 hours agorootparentDoesn't the \"O\" in OCaml stand for \"Object\", though? I think you could pick up either F# or OCaml just as easily. The nuances of OOP in F# can be ignored by beginners, so I really wouldn’t let yourself be intimidated coming from Clojure. [0] https://ocaml.org/docs/objects reply armchairhacker 11 hours agorootparentOCaml classes and objects are (ironically) rarely used and generally discouraged. There are some cases where they’re practically required, such as GUI and FFI (js_of_ocaml). But otherwise, most code does encapsulation and abstraction using modules and functor modules (which are more like Haskell and Rust typeclasses than traditional OOP classes). I don’t know much about F#, but last time I used it most of its standard library was in C# and .NET, so F# code would interact with objects and classes a lot. AFAIK F# also doesn’t have functor modules, so even without the dependence on C# code, you still can’t avoid classes and objects like you can with OCaml (e.g. you can’t write a generic collection module like `List` or `Set` without functors, it would have to be a collection of a specific type or a class). reply neonsunset 7 hours agorootparentF# uses .NET's generics, so the statement regarding List/Set is completely incorrect (all base collections are generic). reply mrkeen 41 minutes agorootparentF# has \"generics\" just like Python and PHP now \"have types\". It's not a yes/no feature. reply penteract 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you misread their claim - they said that generic list/set would have to be classes, not modules (generic modules are a specific thing in OCaml and aren't the same as a module of generic classes). reply mrkeen 13 hours agorootparentprev> Clojure emphasizes immutability Is \"emphasizes\" just another word for second-class support?

If I import a method 'foo()', is there any kind of contract, notation ... anything which could suggest whether it mutates or not? reply eyelidlessness 3 hours agorootparent> What safeguards around mutability does Clojure have? Very nearly the entire language and standard library operate on immutable values only. Immutable values are the default, and you will use them for the vast majority of logic. You must do so, unless you very specifically opt to use dedicated reference types, at which point you’ll still need to produce intermediate immutable values to interact with that vast majority of the standard library. And… > is there any kind of contract, notation ... anything which could suggest whether it mutates or not? Functions which mutate state are almost always suffixed !. They will typically fail if you pass them immutable values; they only operate on reference types, which have to be dereferenced (typically with the prefix @) to access their state. reply chipdart 9 hours agorootparentprev> Is \"emphasizes\" just another word for second-class support? I don't know what's your personal definition of \"second-class support\" but what it means is that it's explicitly supported by the language. reply mrkeen 5 hours agorootparentC++ explicitly supports memory-safe programming.

Haskell has very bad syntax. It's not hard to understand it, it you rewrite the same things in something saner. Haskell was developed by people who enjoy one-liners and don't really need to write practical programs. Another aspect of Haskell is that it was written by people who were so misguided as to think that mathematical formulas are somehow superior to typical imperative languages, with meaningful variable names, predictable interpretations of sequences of instructions etc. They, instead, made it all bespoke. Every operation has its own syntax, variables are typically named as they would in math formulas (eg. X and X'). This makes no sense, and is, in fact, very harmful when writing real-world programs, but because, by and large, Haskell never raises to the task of writing real-world programs, it doesn't deter the adepts from using it. reply tome 3 hours agorootparentThat's what (some) other people do.

I must have made up all those programs I wrote on my stream, the ones I use to maintain my website, and all the boring line-of-business code I write at work. /s In all seriousness, Haskell has its warts, but being impractical isn't one of them. To some purists the committee has been overly pragmatic with the design of the language. As far as functional programming languages go it's pretty hairy. You have \"pure\" functions in the base libraries that can throw runtime exceptions when given the wrong values for their arguments (ie: the infamous head function). Bottom, a special kind of null value, is a member of every type. There exist functions to escape the type system entirely that are used with some frequency to make things work. The committee has gone back more than once to reshape the type-class hierarchy much to the chagrin of the community of maintainers who had to manually patch old code or risk having it not longer compile on new versions of the base libraries. These are all hairy, pragmatic trade-offs the language and ecosystem designers and maintainers have had to make... because people write software using this language to solve problems they have and they have to maintain these systems.

So Fortran's \"pure\" functions aren't referentially transparent. (F'2023 added a stronger form of \"pure\" and calls it \"simple\", but it didn't strengthen the places where a \"pure\" procedure should be required to be \"simple\", such as DO CONCURRENT, so being \"simple\" will be its own reward, if any compiler actually implements it. And a \"simple\" function's result value can still depend on a mutable pointer target.) reply crabbone 3 hours agoparentprevI would recommend neither of those. Haskell has very bad syntax (with extensive backing from Microsoft, iirc the guy who writes the compiler is a Microsoft's Research employee). F# is a straight-up Microsoft's language.

It has exceptions You can divide by zero It has unsafe IO primitives reply tome 11 hours agorootparentYou're right: \"pure\" is not a well-defined concept. The well-defined concept that describes Haskell's benefits in this regard is \"referential transparency\". That means that this code let x =in ... x ... x ... (i.e. defining a variable x and then using it some number of times) is equivalent to ......... Seen in the opposite direction (transforming the bottom code to the top code) this means that extracting repeated code is always a valid thing to do. It's not valid in most other languages, and certainly no mainstream ones. reply simiones 9 hours agorootparentWell, technically that isn't true if you use, for example, unsafePerfomIO in the defintion of x. Referential transparency is still a spectrum, just like purity. Haskell is much closer to purity than the vast majority of languages out there. Also, even if Haskell were perfectly pure, the fact that it uses lazy evaluation is far more important to actually being able to make use of referential transparency. In a strict language you will still see a massive performance differences if replacing the first version with the second, in the most common cases. reply tome 8 hours agorootparent> technically that isn't true if you use, for example, unsafePerfomIO in the defintion of x Ah, well, regardless of whether it holds in Haskell, referential transparency is a well-defined concept. Purity is not a well-defined concept (at least as far as I know. Please share a formal definition if you have one!). That's primarily what I'm trying to say. But I also disagree with your point about unsafePerformIO. In practice, nothing in Haskell violates referential transparency in a significant way. Who knows why? It's an emergent phenomenon that in principle need not have occurred, but in practice it did. Debug.Trace and similar are about the only things that technically violate referential transparency (and they are extremely tame). > the fact that it uses lazy evaluation is far more important to actually being able to make use of referential transparency Yes, I agree with that. reply simiones 6 hours agorootparentIt seems that someone did come up with a formal definition to try to capture the concept [0], though I haven't looked into the details to see whether it really matches the colloquial use of the terms \"pure\" and \"impure\" functional programming. In short, the formal definition they came up with is that a language is pure if the result of a valid program is the same under any parameter passing strategy. I should note that I agree that, in practice, Haskell is almost always pure and/or referentially transparent. I was just pointing out that technically the GP was correct that it's not perfectly 100% so. [0] https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functiona... reply tome 5 hours agorootparentSabry's definition of \"pure\" fails to satisfy me for two reasons: 1. It assumes that the language is \"a conservative extension of the simply typed λ-calculus\". That's rather high-powered yet also really restrictive! Haskell doesn't satisfy that requirement. It also assumes the language has functions. Expression languages (i.e. ones without functions) are perfectly reasonable languages and it makes sense to ask whether they are pure. 2. It assumes that a language putatively has multiple evaluation orders (which I suppose is a consequence of the assumption \"It is a conservative extension of the simply typed λ-calculus\"). Haskell doesn't have multiple evaluation orders. It has one! (notwithstanding you can influence it with seq/!) If you unpick the essence of what Sabry's really saying you find you can translate it into the Haskell world through imposing two conditions: C1. soundness of the β-axiom (a.k.a. referential transparency) (this plays the role of Sabry's condition that call by need and call by value have the same result). C2. That let x =in ... gives the same result as let !x =in ... whenever the latter terminates. (This plays the role of Sabry's condition that call by name and call by value have the same result.) I omitted this condition from my original. I probably shouldn't have because technically it's required, but it risks getting into the weeds of strictness versus laziness. So Sabry's definition of \"pure\" is a long-winded and restricted way saying something that can be much more conveniently expressed by C1 and C2. If you disagree with me, please demonstrate a property of purity that can't be deduced from C1 and C2! > I should note that I agree that, in practice, Haskell is almost always pure and/or referentially transparent. I was just pointing out that technically the GP was correct that it's not perfectly 100% so. OK, fine, but I also said the GP was correct! I am keen to point out, however, that exceptions (including division by zero) do not violate referential transparency (and if someone thinks they violate \"purity\" that may be a sign that \"purity\" is ill-defined). reply afiori 9 hours agorootparentprevI feel like exceptions where added as a mix of \"look we can do that too\" and \"maybe if so many functions return optional values then it is going to be too much of a pain to use\" In hindsight I think few would now regret not having added them in the first place. reply fire_lake 8 hours agorootparent> maybe if so many functions return optional values then it is going to be too much of a pain to use I strongly believe that there is a point in the PL design space that makes optionals everywhere usable.

A great Haskell programmer (generally speaking) is going to be a culture misfit in any Java, C#, golang, etc shop.

To be clear I'm not saying you can't find a compatible Java shop (I actually did find a startup with a lot of Java devs who appreciated FP and used much of it in Java, and that was pretty great honestly), just that the odds are highly against you. My biggest advice to people who like FP is: Find a job in a language like Clojure, Elixir, Scala, etc. There are a lot more jobs than you'd think. But if you can't, Ruby and Javascript/Typescript can be pretty close depending on where you go. Talk to existing devs and see how feel about FP in general before you join though! reply anon291 3 hours agorootparentprevI mean sure. Realistically, I'm certain I would do that if I were working on a typical code base, which is why I'm in an extremely niche field where that sort of thing is valued.

I think it has more to offer in terms of insight, because wrapping your head around the language only takes a couple days, but wrapping your head around its consequences is a gift which keeps on giving for quite some time. Immutable functional programming is basically what 80% of your Prolog code will look like. The benefit is that you'll be able to understand how everything works from end-to-end. reply Valodim 5 hours agoparentProlog is a logic programming language though, I wouldn't expect it to have a lot of overlap with functional programming? reply usgroup 4 hours agorootparentProlog variables are immutable by default. Data structures are the same as the immutable functional programming counterparts (no arrays, and tree based everything). Recursion is the only way to loop. Map, filter, fold(l/r), reduce, accumulate, etc, are staple predicates. As I said, 80% of your code, or more, will look just like a functional programme. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's also biased into informal definitions, mixing side effects with logic, and encapsulating complex behavior together. It's way more biased into being a scripting language, while Haskell has all those biases pointed at being an application language. So, I'd say that both languages lead people into very different programing styles. reply cess11 3 hours agorootparentprevAn execution pipeline in a functional language is just half a relation in Prolog. Prolog allows you to also run it 'backwards', you can provide the output and have it figure out what the inputs would need to be. reply usgroup 2 hours agorootparentRun in backwards, so they say, but not really. Most things you'll write can't run backwards. You have to write them in a special way for that to be possible, and even then what it means is that you can do a depth first search to find the value. There are some useful extensions like clpfd and asp but really if what you're doing is solving a constraint programming problem, you're much better of with OR-tools or MiniZinc. Prolog is beautiful.

You don't grep through code to find snippets or anything, you use `ucm`. It does a whole lot more, but that's just the trivial example. * You need `ucm` because Unison stores code as a syntax tree, not text. This is awesome because versioning/dependency conflicts/rename issues just go away. This is not awesome because nothing else knows how to understand this: other source control systems will just not work. * It's really trying to drag functional coding into this decade and what we use code for in production. It's not trying to be Haskell which is a great language, but doesn't (to me) feel like it was designed to do something like a simple web app. * It is supposed to do distributed cloud computing without modification (this smells like where the VC money came from), but again, you have to use their platform because other clouds don't understand Unison. The list goes on. Each individual piece of Unison I think is really great. I love the `ucm` model of having an assistant sit next to you the whole time. What I don't love is that there is just _so much_ learning placed on the developer. To understand Unison, you need to understand a lot of what they're doing, a lot of what they are doing is novel, and so you have to eat the whole elephant that they are.

It makes it easy to learn how to structure a program in a pure way, which is hard to do in languages that offers you a easy way out. 2. Since \"everything\" is pure, writing tests is easier. 3. You know for certain that if you discard the result of a function call, all the side-effects that it would normally trigger would be stopped as well. 4. A program where all side-effects are guaranteed to be pushed to the boundaries, is a program that's easy to reason about. > a language which has adapted the best bits and pieces [...] Languages that has adapted to best bits and pieces from X, Y, Z tend to be worse than a language specifically for X, Y and Z. For instance, Java supports functional programming but functional programming languages are much better at it because they were designed for that specific paradigm. In the same vein, sure you can write pure programs in F#, but not as easily as in Haskell that was designed for doing just that. > and is used to handle data and events from the real world Pure code really only means (in practice) that side-effects are controlled, which is generally very helpful. It forces you to structure programs in a way which makes it easy to pinpoint where data is coming in, and where data is going out. It also makes for easier testing. Being able to know, definetly, the answer to \"will calling foo perform a network request\" without having to read the source for foo is quite nice, especially when dealing with third-party code. All this said, I probably wouldn't begin with Haskell. A language like Elm is much better suited for learning writing pure programs. reply freedomben 2 hours agorootparentAgree with all the reasons, but number 1 is really the most important: > 1. It makes it easy to learn how to structure a program in a pure way, which is hard to do in languages that offers you a easy way out. When there's an escape hatch, you will reach for it at some point. It helps with getting things done, but you never end up really confronting the hard things when you have that, and the hard things are an important part of the learning/benefit. reply neonsunset 6 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with Haskell is that it's slow and memory-heavy (and OCaml is the same, but worse). F# and Scala (and Clojure?) are pretty much the only reasonably usable FP languages. reply crabbone 2 hours agorootparentWhere are you getting your info from? Typical OCaml programs, when compared to similar C++ would be slower but use less memory. F# and Scala are both OCaml in disuse. I don't know what you mean by \"reasonable\"... but, if the idea is \"easy to reason about\", then these two don't particularly stand out much. Languages that are easy to reason about would be generally in the category where you need to do fewer translations before you get to the way the program is executed (i.e. bytecode adds an extra step, thus making a language harder to reason about). Also, languages with fewer primitives are easier to reason about, because the program text becomes more predictable. In general, \"functional\" languages are harder to reason about when compared to imperative, because computers inherently don't work in the way the programs are modeled in \"functional\" languages, so there will be some necessary translation layer that transforms an FP program into a real computer program. There are people who believe that FP programs are easier to reason about due to the lack of side effects. In my experience, the lack of side effects doesn't come close to compensating the advantages of being able to map the program to what computer actually does. All kinds of behind-the-scenes mechanisms in the language, s.a. garbage collector, make the reasoning harder too, in a sense. We pretend that GC makes reasoning easier by making a mental shortcut: we pretend that it doesn't matter when memory is freed. But, if you really want a full picture, GC adds a whole new layer of complexity when it comes to understanding a program. Yet another aspect of reasoning is the ability of reasoner to act on their reasoning. I.e. the reasoning might be imperfect, but still allow to act (which is kind of the human condition, the way we are prepared to deal with the world). So, often, while imperative programs cannot be formally easily reasoned about, it's easy to informally reason about them to be efficient enough to act on that reasoning. \"Functional\" programs are usually the reverse: they are easier to reason about formally, but they are very unnatural to the way humans reason about everyday stuff, so, acting on them is harder for humans. \"Functional\" languages tend to be more in the bytecode + GC + multiple translations camp. And, if forced to choose with these constrains, I'd say Erlang would be the easiest and the best designed language of all the \"popular\" ones. SML would be my pick if you need to get into the world of Haskell, but deciphering Haskell syntax brings you to the boil. reply neonsunset 2 hours agorootparentHeh, no. You are suggesting to replace FP languages with powerful type systems that perform marginally slower than C# and Java (and can access their ecosystems) with a language that is dynamically typed and performs, in most situations, marginally slower than PHP and marginally faster than Ruby. reply elbear 12 hours agoparentprevWhat's the benefit? You start to see functions as self-contained things, as lego blocks. All the logic of the function is there in the function. It only works on values it receives as inputs (it can't read global variables). It only outputs its results (it doesn't assign them to some other global variable that you have to track down). This makes your code modular. You can add a function in a chain of functions, if you want to perform an extra transformation. Or, you can replace a function with a different one, if you want to change something about the logic. reply Dylan16807 11 hours agorootparentIs there a benefit if you're already familiar with writing functions like that? Is it wrong for me to expect that most programmers are already familiar with functions that only use their inputs, but treat that style as significantly more optional? I wrote pure functions for a minute there but that's not the same, a function that only uses its inputs can modify an object while a pure function would have to return a new object. But, similarly, I bet that a lot more people know about pure functions than have any working knowledge of Haskell. reply elbear 11 hours agorootparentIt seems you only focused on one of the conditions I mentioned. You have to follow both rules: the one about inputs and the one about outputs. This is like a contract. If you enforce it throughout your program, you gain some guarantees about your program as a whole. reply Dylan16807 11 hours agorootparentI was looking at both rules, and specifically I was using the long version where you said \"it doesn't assign them to some other global variable that you have to track down\". If you pass in a mutable object then that's not \"some other global variable\". If I interpret \"It only outputs its results\" in a very strict way, that still allows having output and in/out parameters. The latter of which can break purity. Though you can break purity with just inputs: define f(o): return o.x let a = {x=1} f(a) a.x = 2 f(a) If you meant to describe pure functions then that's fine, that's why I addressed pure functions too, but I don't think your original description was a description of pure functions. reply elbear 10 hours agorootparentSo, another definition of a pure function is that, for a particular input it will always return the same output. Your example respects the rule: f({x=1}) == 1 f({x=2}) == 2 But it's true that the two rules I gave are not enough to make a function pure. Because I didn't say anything about I/O. So, a function that follows the rules about inputs and outputs, could still do I/O and change its outputs based on that. Starting from the question that gave birth to this whole thread: \"What's the benefit of learning a PURE functional programming language...\" The other benefit is that such a language forces you to be explicit about I/O. It does it in such a way that even functions that do I/O are pure. The good part is that, if you use it long enough, it can teach you the discipline to be explicit about I/O and you can use this discipline in other languages. For example, this is how I see this principles being used in Python: https://elbear.com/functional-programming-principles-you-can... reply Dylan16807 9 hours agorootparent> Your example respects the rule: Every definition of purity I can find that talks about objects/references says that if you pass in the same object/reference with different contents then that's not pure.

Either way, to be clear, the above would be rejected by Haskell (if declared as a pure function.)

Believe it or not, functional programmers -- even ones writing Haskell -- often think about and deliver software for \"real world,\" use. reply cosmic_quanta 3 hours agoparentprevPure functional programming doesn't preclude side-effects like IO; it makes side-effects explicit rather than implicit! At my previous job, we used pure functional programming to ensure that custom programs only had access to certain side-effects (most importantly, not IO). This meant that it was trivial to run these custom programs in multiple environments, including various testing environments, and production. reply keybored 8 hours agoparentprev> Given that you want write code that sees \"real world\" use, and is used to handle data and events from the real world. Real world? As opposed to what? Is there any benefit to answering such polemical questions as if they are not rhetorical? reply lukan 8 hours agorootparentAs opposed to the abstract academic world? The only time I had contact with Haskell was in university and I did not see it appealing back then, nor now, nor have I ever seen a program that I use, written in it. So learning a bit of pure Haskell might have been beneficial for me to become a better programmer, but I still fail to see it being more than that - a academic language. Useful for didactic purposes. Less to actually ship software. reply padthai 6 hours agorootparent> nor have I ever seen a program that I use, written in it The only mass market Haskell software that I know of is Pandoc. Others like Shellcheck and Postgrest are popular in their niche. I am not sure that Haskell is faring worse that other programming languages in its level of popularity, like Julia, Clojure or Erlang. reply lukan 5 hours agorootparentPandoc seems useful, but maybe \"mass market\" is a bit of an overstatement? And since many programmers like myself had to learn Haskell, I think Haskell should have a better head start and be in a better position, if it would be so useful for \"real world\" use cases. But please don't take this as an attack on haskell. I have nothing against the language, or its users and I did not suffered because of it in university, I am just curious on the appeal. Because I love clean solutions, but I also want to ship things. So part of me are wondering if I am missing out, but I so far I see not much convincing data. (But I am also mainly interested in high performance and real time graphics and haskell is really not the best here) reply padthai 4 hours agorootparentI am not a user of the language (although I learned it like you). I just came to chime in that (a) there is at least one very popular software written in Haskell and (b) Haskell seems to ship a good amount of software for its popularity.

    "originLink": "https://howtoware.co/wyldcard",
    "originBody": "Jonah StiennonDecember 22, 2023 How I Made Trading Cards with E-Ink Displays What is your project? Wyldcards are plastic E-Ink tiles about the size of a credit card and as thick as a phone. They are intended to be used for trading card games. The pictures on the cards can change and a memory chip in the card can hold game stats and other characteristics. The digital nature of the cards unlock new game mechanics, impractical or impossible with just tokens and paper, while keeping the physical feel of a tabletop game. I drew inspiration from the fictional games I wished existed when I was in school, like Yu-gi-oh, Card Captors, Angelic Layer, etc. How did you come up with the idea? In 2014, I had been working on mobile device UI testing. At one point, I grabbed a stack of iPhones and splayed them out like a hand of cards. I had the idea that, if each phone displayed the image of a card, you could shuffle the deck just by pressing a button, no physical movement necessary. I am a software developer by trade. I worked at an IoT 3D printer company running the software team. My experience is mostly in web backend, DevOps, and mobile. While running the web app and cloud infrastructure side of things at the 3D printer company, I also found myself running a team of incredibly talented embedded firmware and electrical engineers. I've spent my life building all kinds of things, but they showed me that electronics today were more approachable than I had realized; by simply applying my existing software skills and what I knew of mechanical design, I could build physical products which had never existed in the world before! This gave me the confidence to attempt a project I had dreamed of a decade earlier, but seemed far beyond my abilities at the time. Wyldcard is the result of taking the concept of digital/physical playing cards and bringing down the price of materials as low as I could while still maintaining the core functionality of the concept. How did you design, prototype, and manufacture the cards? I had a few design constraints: I wanted it to be affordable relative to other children's toys, be playable at camp or on the playground, and to be alluring when found in an older sibling's closet years later. LCD displays would be the cheapest, but then each card would require a built-in battery that would be a pain to keep charged; a card found in a closet years later would be completely dead and probably inoperable. E-Ink displays have the magic property of retaining the image on them without requiring any energy at all. After deciding what display to use, I needed a way to send new information to them during a game and detect the presence of other cards in play. I thought about radio mesh networks, but that would require batteries in each card and increase the complexity by an order of magnitude. I decided on simple electrical contacts on the backs of the cards that would connect to a supporting base. This is a familiar concept for card games, as many come with play mats you lay cards on, and Yu-gi-oh used the same concept, though sometimes mounted on the player’s arm. The base houses a battery with a standard charger and a microcontroller to run the game logic. I planned out some game mechanics and ideas for how a game would actually work, but it became clear that until people had the cards in their hands it was hard to imagine what would be fun and what wouldn't. I felt like I knew all the capabilities the cards would need, and could build some prototypes and start game design after they worked to my satisfaction. Prototyping started with purchasing some E-Ink displays off Alibaba and sending images to them using the development board built by the supplier. At this point, I decided to use the Rust programming language because I had been wanting to learn it and I wasn't that great at C. I learned Rust for embedded devices and decided I could run it from a Raspberry Pi while prototyping and recompile the code to a microcontroller later when mass production was needed. I fiddled around with the code until I could send images to the displays, then I used a reference diagram contained in the datasheets to design my own custom development board. I learned PCB design and started to order PCBs from China. My coworkers gave me some tips on what tools and suppliers to use and shook their heads at my disregard for all electrical engineering conventions. Now that I had a circuit board which could take signals from my Raspberry Pi and display images on a screen, I needed to control multiple screens and find the maximum number of pins I could share between screens, in order to minimize the number of contacts each card would need. This required a few iterations, some breadboarding, and a mess of jumper cables. After I had the code and circuitry working in order to address 4 separate screens each with their own circuit board, all wired together, I had a functionally complete system. Now I needed to design the physical card, and work in the physical interface between the cards and the base. Using my self-taught CAD skills and the industrial 3D printers we built at my day job, I started printing plastic enclosures which could house an E-Ink display, my PCB, and four magnets to hold it to the base. I printed some sample bases and started iterating on different designs for the contacts to make the connections. This was the part of the design phase which required the most iterations, though I'd say the longest step of the project was the back-and-forth of ordering PCBs from China and reading datasheets, trying to get the screens to work in the first place. While the Rust code was certainly better than C or C++, my most comfortable language is Javascript, and I decided that if I wanted to iterate on game design quickly, it'd be easier to write the games in Node.js. The same would go for anyone else online, Javascript being so much more accessible than C. I wrapped my Rust driver as a native Node.js addon, and wrote some sample code in Javascript. I designed the DevKits to be as easy to manufacture as I could. It helped that I had already optimized on cost, so the number of components was limited to the essentials. I make everything in my bedroom, and the workshop space we have in the backyard. The work is mostly soldering, polyurethane resin casting, woodworking, and painting. I've been posting videos of the process to YouTube. You raised $7277. How did you do crowdfunding? I got burnt out at my job and realized it was conflicting with my side project. I quit my job, did some traveling, and finished the initial prototypes. I took the prototypes with me when visiting my parents in Michigan for the holidays, had a photoshoot, and posted a video to Hacker News where I've been reading about cool stuff my entire adult life. Something about the holiday season, combined with Hacker News’ obsession with E-Ink and the whims of internet 'virality', lead to my post being voted to the #1 position, where it stayed for over 24 hours. This was incredibly fun, exciting, rewarding, and a lifetime dream achieved. I stayed up all night responding to comments. I had intended on putting the project down after the blog post was published. I saw the post as taking the project to completion, having created something and then put it out there into the world. I figured I'd take some time off, pursue some smaller projects, then do some game design and start playing with the cards. Fueled by all the attention, I decided to keep going. Many people asked if I would be selling them or doing a kickstarter, but the problem is, there was still no game to sell. I floated the idea of a DevKit to let game designers attempt to build their own games using Wyldcards and this was met with some interest. I had built these prototypes as a way for me to iterate on game design after all, so it wouldn't be that much harder to allow others to use them that way as well. I was approached by CrowdSupply, which suggested that my DevKits might be a good fit for their platform, and so I began that process. I built new prototypes with a slightly better design and made an extra fancy one with higher margins. I filmed videos, wrote content and ran a crowdfunding campaign. Most of the orders are from friends and family, and people who had emailed me with interest in the DevKits when they had seen them on HN. When the HN post started to get traction, I modified my website and added an email signup button. I sent my campaign to this mailing list and CrowdSupply published my campaign to all their email subscribers. Now it's a year since the first prototypes were completed, and 2.5 years since I bought a Raspberry Pi and some e-ink displays. I'm nearing the end of my production run, building the 25 DevKits I sold. You have outlined plans for scaling up the project. How did you learn about these larger scale manufacturing processes? I've watched videos, read books, and taken factory tours my whole life. I've spent my whole life as an engineer really. I watched How It's Made, Junkyard Wars, and all that. Nowadays we have all these great Youtube makers, but it's true that they all make one-offs and not large runs of things. It's really very different, the experience of making one thing versus making a production line. For some reason it's like 100x the work to make something 10 times rather than once. Also it's hard for it to be as exciting/interesting. I’ve studied everything I saw, but, I always had this mental barrier that the tools and processes used in a real factory were masterfully created by craftspeople at the peak of their careers with a perfected process. The thing I learned from all my coworkers at the 3D printer startup is that these things are not magical and not designed perfectly; it's just smart people using the skills they have to solve problems. I was already doing the same thing for software: building a production line that reliably pumped out products at scale. This was just the same thing, in a different medium. Humans usually go with a straightforward solution to things, and you can often just muddle about trying things and spending money until you figure out what works. It's interesting to look at different industries and see how they use their skills to solve their own problems. So all the tooling for woodworking are jigs made of wood. Automatic assembly lines for metal objects are monstrosities made of metal. Software is built using software and AI researchers use AI to solve all their problems. So you just use what's at hand and eventually you settle into a local maximum of an optimal process. Also, I live in the Bay Area. I'm biased, but this place is full of awesome engineers building things and you can just walk up to them and ask them to explain everything about their project and they will. After you're done with fulfilling the orders what are your plans for the future? This past year I took some time off traveling, I had a brief detour where I won a Hackathon with an AI Slackbot, there were a few forays into startups, I made all the campaign content, and I did a bunch of paperwork. I ran out my budgeted year of unemployment, so I completed a job search and am now working full time again. I must say, this project has gone on much longer than I intended, but that was partly due to unexpected success. The crowdfunding campaign has been a ton of effort to only get a few kits out into the wild, but I learned a lot and it's been fun overall. I've got a whole stack of smaller projects which have piled up in the meantime and I can't wait to deliver these DevKits and table the project for a bit. I'll do a few weekend projects to rejuvenate myself and then start designing a game for Wyldcard. --- Get Interviews Faster. I try to get a new interview monthly. It's free.

Trading card games usually have a notion of rarity, collection, and, well, trading. It is a controversial aspect so I understand that you want to stay away from that as much as possible. But if you embrace this aspect, how would it be implemented? reply jonahss 3 hours agoparentHi, Wyldcard creator here, thanks to HowToWare for the interview :) The cards can store data, and I imagine that things which happen to the card during a game leave a lasting impact, which is carried from game to game. The cards grow and change over time, and so when you trade one, you're trading an entire legacy :D reply nerdjon 3 hours agorootparentThat sounds more like a legacy style board game than an actual trading card game. Which seems to me like the better implementation of this technology, anything else due to its digital nature just feels like it is going to be exploited making any value disappear completely. I think this would be an amazing idea for a legacy style game, especially since it opens up the possibility of resetting the game and it really simplifies picking up and playing later. But I really don't think it will work as a TCG. reply jonahss 2 hours agorootparentAh yeah. TCG is just a quick way to explain it to people so they get what I'm going for. I personally dislike the whole \"rarity\" aspect of TCGs, though it was fun when I was a kid. Living Card Games like Netrunner are more fun to play IMO. My elevator pitch usually goes something like: MTG meets Yu-gi-oh meets Pokemon (the RPG) meets Tamagotchi. reply shagie 31 minutes agorootparentConsider Button Men ( https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/226312/button-men-beat-p... and the original https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17/button-men https://web.archive.org/web/20050205124221/http://beatpeople... ) These were originally implemented as buttons that you could pin on your shirt. There was a game convention long ago where sometimes you'd find two random people wearing them have a \"hey! Let's play a game\" moment since it also advertised playing the game. Break out the dice that you've already got, sit down and play in a minute or two (with no weird rules you everything ran real fast). Likewise, you could have the \"this is the game\" clipped on one's shirt and then playing a digital game with your selected character. reply ramses0 1 hour agorootparentprevTamagotchi is the best metaphor. Take a look at this old school BBS game \"The Pit\" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK69uCBtI18 Could you do a janky version of \"Street Fighter\" where your dude (and assistant/second character) both had permanent stats + inventory + needing to \"rest\" or \"heal over time\" to recover after the battle? Same, but it's more of an RPG \"character card + inventory card\" vs. \"opponent character + opponent inventory\"? The concept of 1x$100 base, and 4x$15 playing cards seems approachable (vis: MTG booster packs). Definitely look to have some sort of replaceable / lay-in play mat (see the little cards on this toy: https://www.amazon.com/VTech-80-178200-Drill-Learn-Toolbox/d... ). You could have a \"Street Fighter\" 2v2 playmat, or \"Texas Hold-em\" flop/turn/river mat. \"Scan the QR Code, bluetooth connect to the base, load the 'game' into the device's memory\", and then you're phone-free (forever) to negotiate between the base and the cards. You're \"missing\" some sort of cover/door on the cards themselves (eg: configure the base station for texas hold'em, and how do you \"shuffle\" the two player cards w/o revealing their values to others? Actually, what you should do is to put some sort of pin-pattern on the top that can be accessed from the front or the back (eg: four pins \"as rivets\" on left and right sides, two pins on top/bottom), so you could \"load\" or \"shuffle\" the card face up or face down. Face-Up + buttons 1/2/3 => the display changes, you take your action, etc. Face-Down + buttons 1/2/3 => the display changes, but the result is \"hidden until revealed\". Another useful tool would be to allow some sort of spinners/selectors on the \"cards\" themselves (vis: el-grande's spinners: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/105293/el-grande ). Being able to have some sort of dumb switches or a rotating selector on the cards themselves that are then \"read\" by the base station will let people do their thinking and take their turns \"in their own hand\" is super powerful (eg: let people select punch/kick/block on the cards in their hands vs. having to \"dock\" the card and only then being able to select punch/kick/block) is super-important to enable a smooth-flowing game instead of a novelty toy. Overall, there's tons of cool options with it! reply fragmede 1 hour agorootparentprevNo Sabacc? reply dllthomas 3 hours agoparentprevIIUC (and I haven't RTFA but from my recollection of my conversations with Jonah around that same time frame) there is not really a game yet, it's more of a platform, with \"trading\" intended to be a possible feature of some games. reply jonahss 2 hours agorootparent:wave: Yes, still no game, I spent the last year delivering the crowdfunded devkits. reply tomrod 2 hours agorootparentThis is a fantastic idea, Jonah, and I hope you see it gain widespread adoption!

I don't foresee a large uptake of this. reply xipho 4 hours agoprevNice. I've thought of various similar applications (probably because I saw such somewhere). For example conferences require lanyards with passes attached. Most contract with some company to handle all their creation, then also require you (more or less) to use their app to get a schedule, etc. Why not create a generic, re-usable pass (like OP) that attaches to your lanyard, has some basic features at a glance (schedule, your favorite emoji), and could of course be used to track or facilitate flash-gatherings as needed. IIRC defcom did something like this, I'm thinking more generic. I think scientists I know would snap something like this up so they didn't add to their kilograms of plastic pass/lanyard waste (if conferences can be roped in to adopting them). Level them up with rare editions (conference awardees could be given titanium frames to swap over), etc. and you have a playing-card-esque market for professionals who go to 3-5 conferences a year, and a flashy feature that conferences would like to offer, etc. Another use- digital cards that can help care practitioners communicate with their audience: \"can you hand me the cards the tell me how you feel?\" (cards that describe your symptoms). Customize those pictures, icons, graphics on the card as needed, on the fly, per patient type, etc. Think everything from kids bullied at school to medical and law offices where communication can be a barrier. reply toyg 3 hours agoparentHave you heard of our lord and saviour the Pimoroni Badger? https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040?variant=39752...

If the old one is obsolete in a year or two there was so little reuse that everyone is better off with old fashioned paper/plastic. You would have to commit to not coming up with a better model every year - but if you do that someone else will compete by coming out with the better model instead. Which is to say you can't win. reply oopsallmagic 3 hours agorootparentDon't forget the e-waste aspect... You can recycle paper easily, but several rare earth metals and e-ink all mashed together are much more difficult, and require a lot more energy to produce. Honestly, this is exactly the kind of overconsumption that got us to where we are. I don't care what someone's favorite emoji is, quite frankly, and I don't think it's worth strip mining the Congo just to do a Neat Thing.

Conversation starters (perhaps I do want to put poo on my badge) in what is a social event with many rapidly-changing sub-contexts. Sticker and pin collecting is fun though, so maybe not such a compelling use-case. Smaller meetings provide markers for name-tags all the time, that's different from the conference-provided ID I'm required to wear in a conference of 6k+ people. reply xipho 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just paper, perhaps at least run the numbers? Though I completely agree it's likely more environmentally costly. My initial thought process evolved from coming back from yet another conference, and tossing yet another lanyard (colorful plastic, metal clips) and plastic covering into the garbage. I have done this probably around 50 times. So think replacing 100-200 of these for an academic, far, far more for con staff, sales vendors, etc. reply foobarchu 2 hours agorootparentOne of the hurdles you would have to overcome is convincing all of the conferences to go with these reusable e-ink badges. Let's say all the organizers are convinced...why not use a common, non-electronic badge instead, since you have everyone agreeing to a common standard anyway? Perhaps something simple where the conference organizers can print out a paper slip (recycled paper even!) that you insert so they get some customization. reply johannes1234321 1 hour agorootparentThere is still the main purpose of those things: Verifying people are allowed to enter. That is (aside from sponsors, who want their logo there) a reason why it looks as it looks and having it somewhat different from event to event. A shared programmable batch would require scanning them while entering each room, which creates bottlenecks at doors and more effort as each door needs staff and tech (and as soon as you have staff and tech at each door you can also provide all information there, thus the gain of being able to share information into the badge is gone) and you get to privacy issues. And then half the badges people bring are broken and most participanta didn't ever have one/lost it/forgot it. reply foobarchu 1 hour agorootparentI feel like the paper slips solve those problems already, in the same way they are solved today with single-use plastic badges. The plastic ones can already be forged, switching to paper wouldnt make it any easier as long as you don't publicize what it will look like in advance. reply xipho 2 hours agorootparentprev> One of the hurdles you would have to overcome is convincing all of the conferences to go with these reusable e-ink badges. This is the only thing that matters buisiness-wise, its what I'd expect people who frequent HN do routinely, pitch. It doesn't have to be logical, fun, environmentally friendly, it just has to make it to their level of control. I've seen very illogical things become \"standard\" with little or no questioning for why it is now this way for no other reason than someone was very good at expressing \"this is the way it is and should be\" (i.e. they where very good at BS). reply xipho 3 hours agorootparentprevI completely agree. Thinking more along the lines of- whether or not something is better may not drive a market, people loved Tamagotchi but vanilla stuffed animals last generations... but Tamagotchi still work for many. Something that has dirt simple utility (you have a visual que that can be rotated that indicates to staff processing thousands of people an hour that you're payed) without requiring a phone that can do all that and more maybe be generically useful. reply SiempreViernes 3 hours agorootparentIf you try to sell something on the basis of \"so they didn't add to their kilograms of plastic pass/lanyard waste\", the question of whether it actually saves anything is clearly relevant.

I was looking to replace my GoPro with the DJI Action, but their app was not on the Play-store. It can only be side-loaded on Android, because their app breaks a number of policies on privacy and data gathering. I believe I saw a site that decompiled their app and found a number of worrisome things. reply dji4321234 37 minutes agoparent> It can only be side-loaded on Android, because their app breaks a number of policies on privacy and data gathering. I don't think this is the reason, I think it's more that they're just too lazy to jump through the approval and maintenance hoops that come with an app store, especially because their home market (China) doesn't even use the Play Store. The iOS version of their app is Apple-approved and present in the App Store. I do research in this space. Their consumer apps are loaded to the gills with product-manager telemetry (tap/action tracing, etc., think Firebase/Flurry/whatever), and until recently they had a \"sync flight logs\" feature that would do what it said: give your detailed flight logs to DJI. It was opt-in, but it was easy to do by accident and many years ago there were bugs in the opt-in toggle. They just removed this feature from US apps this week (too little too late, and too attached to reality and not attached enough to political pandering). DJI also have a terrible track record with data security, with their entire AWS account getting ripped in 2017. I don't think they're explicitly a CCP data-collection front, but sufficient product telemetry is indistinguishable from surveillance malware (this applies to US-based companies and US intelligence, too, of course). However, their apps run on their own controllers are generally alright, and their enterprise apps run on their enterprise controllers in Local Data Mode are legitimately clean, barring a few versions with small bugs. I fly DJI drones all the time using DJI RCs with network credentials forgotten, and I wouldn't hesitate to use one of these for consumer use. For the truly paranoid, use a burner email and a VPN to activate the drone. I also wouldn't worry about using DJI Enterprise drones with the pro controllers in Local Data Mode for even moderately sensitive applications (infrastructure, law enforcement, etc.). Of course I wouldn't use one for US military applications, insofar as it would be foolish to use any non-allied electronic device in this way. ps - note that the analysis in the sibling comments are of older apps, DJI Go 4 and Pilot 1, not the newer flagship apps DJI Fly and DJI Pilot 2. The general theme (tons of dirty analytics platforms) remains the same, but the newer apps use more American platforms (Firebase, AWS-hosted proprietary stuff) rather than Chinese, and the \"disable telemetry\" and \"disable data sync\" options generally have fewer bugs now. reply consumer451 30 minutes agorootparent> I don't think this is the reason, I think it's more that they're just too lazy to jump through the approval and maintenance hoops that come with an app store If that was the case, then why jump through all the hoops of extensive code obfuscation for the Android app?

Everything on https://www.diu.mil/blue-uas-cleared-list is either widely different, 15x as expensive, not purchasable by civilians at all, or all of the above. Parret appears to have stopped selling their consumer model entirely. Skydio 2+ seems like the closest thing but it also no longer appears to be for sale either. All their links to the starter kit are dead and only options is to contact sales for enterprise deals. reply dji4321234 10 minutes agoparentThere's nothing. Skydio exited the consumer market. Their drones had good autonomy and flight characteristics. However, they struggled with wireless link quality due to the use of consumer WiFi, and had much older, inferior camera sensors compared to even contemporary DJI drones. They were also ridiculously loud and inefficient. Their enterprise drones are comically expensive and loaded with nickel-and-dime cloud features. Parrot drones struggle with the same issues as Skydio (Skydio actually used a Parrot remote controller for their consumer drones), plus their autonomy isn't nearly as good as even Skydio's, the overall drone behavior is \"clunky\" (slow boot times, slow connection times, non-responsive flight controls), and even basic flight is more challenging. The main issues plaguing US consumer drones are imaging sensors and wireless link. LTE and other well-suited long range wireless technologies capable of handling speed differential between the station and access point are locked in a vault of patents. Imaging sensors are legendarily impossible to acquire in low to moderate quantities and image sensor parameters are carefully locked behind a billion levels of NDA (thus why even the Raspberry Pi camera is full of DRM). reply Arrath 42 minutes agoparentprevI was on a project that was subject to the cleared UAS list you linked, and I cannot recommend either Parrot (incredibly long boot times, underpowered motors meant it was slow and had poor station keeping in high winds) or Skydio (bad heat management/low thermal cutoffs to the point that during the California high desert summer our unit wouldn't even start due to reporting that it was overheated) at all.

If some device requires internet access, then it cannot be trusted to not transmit personal data, therefore it should be possible to replace the software on that device, so that something that is trusted by the consumer can be installed. While DJI here might create good hardware, their internet and account requirement makes it uncontrollable by the consumer, so I do understand that some consumers or, the possible more security aware US, will not trust it. But for the same reason China and other countries might not trust Apple or similar. Trust is something that needs to be earned and which has to go both ways, if a company doesn't trust their users, and prevents people using their bought products however they like, then why should their users trust the company and let their uncontrollable software record their private lives and possible report back to them? reply jpgvm 8 minutes agorootparent> direct internet access or an account with the manufacturer to work Unfortunately this is required by regulators in many countries.

It happens all the time and frequently targets allies like Canada rather than rivals like China. What U.S. citizens should watch out for is when U.S. protectionism winds up hurting the U.S.'s own economy. e.g. Tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber may have helped out a few U.S. softwood lumber producers with good lobbyists (and Jimmy Carter), but the increase in lumber prices had a much larger negative impact on the U.S. economy as a whole due to higher costs of building materials impacting pretty much everyone. reply nostrademons 1 hour agorootparentThat's a large part of the issue, though. The narrative 10 years ago was that we were preventing Chinese from dumping low-cost crap on the U.S. market. Okay, fair enough, keep the crap out. But recent U.S. protectionism has been targeting very high-quality, best-in-class Chinese manufacturers that honestly outcompete anything their U.S. competitors bring to market. Without that competition, there's no incentive for U.S. makers to raise their technological game, and the sector just stagnates and falls behind the rest of the world. North America has the benefit of two oceans for national defense, but the risk associated with that is one of insularity and stagnation.

This is surely not a representative sample so take with a grain of salt, but generally speaking this is their (paraphrased) analysis: In Europe it just takes a lot more capital investment to get started. You can't do it as a side-gig with a hope/dream working nights and weekends like you can in the US. The process to MVP is just way more complicated because there's a ton of compliance/legal stuff that has to be there at launch. The actual product might take 60 hours of work to build, but then there's another 200 hours of compliance to do which doesn't add any product value at all. You also typically have to hire an expert to help at least consult, because trying to do it all yourself just requires you to have a ton of expertise that no single person ever has. Hiring is also a mixed bag. Market salaries in Europe are a lot less which helps, but firing a bad fit is also way harder so there's big risk. You also can't offer stock-based comp as much in Europe as you can in the US, which all serves to make it harder to get launched. Once you reach a certain scale, Europe can be just as friendly or more-so than the US, but that scale acts as a great filter for people that don't already have the deep pockets to fund things on their own to get to that point, and most investors won't take that kind of risk without validating product-market fit. The European culture of more longevity also makes it easier in some ways to keep a young company stable because people aren't constantly leaving and you aren't constantly in bidding wars for talent. Overall it's just a mixed bag, but that early filter is why you don't see as many working-class people doing a tech startup in Europe and making it big. On the flip side, when companies make it through that filter, they tend to be a lot healthier and more viable, and quality tends to be higher.

IMO, often innovation happens because it is motivated to work around rules and regulations. So in many cases regulation and rules are what drives innovation.

It sounds to me like the equivalent of not wanting socialized healthcare because \"the poors\" might get it, not caring about the fact that you're the one who will benefit. This is the \"everyone in the US is a temporarily embarrassed millionaire\" of consumer rights. Everyone in the US is a temporarily embarrassed capitalist overlord. reply danem 1 hour agorootparentThe resistance to socialized healthcare in America can be easily understood without resorting to bizarre strawmen about hating poor people. Healthcare is of course a huge part of our economy and lives. Many (most?) people are satisfied with the status quo and are hesitant to see (what they consider to be) a huge increase in government power, spending, and general involvement in their lives. It's the same impulse that motivates people to oppose new housing -- people are loss averse and hate change. reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentWill it be a huge increase in spending?

It's a non-starter to attempt to reduce health insurance companies power, because it would gut their employee numbers. It's an unsavory thought, but the US has a significant amount of people employed in the business of denying healthcare to other people, which amounts to hundreds of thousands of jobs. Any politician attempting to fix this would be committing political suicide. reply newfriend 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is a strawman. \"Rich\" people don't want socialized healthcare because of perceived or real disadvantages of that system. Not because \"the poors might get it\". Also the \"temporarily embarrassed millionaire\" is another strawman, used by those who dislike capitalism. People can and do support a variety of causes and policies without they themselves benefitting from them. reply stavros 1 hour agorootparent> \"Rich\" people don't want socialized healthcare because of perceived or real disadvantages of that system. Not because \"the poors might get it\". That's fair, I should have said \"because the poors might benefit\". Rich people don't like socialized healthcare because they, by definition, will pay for people who can't afford it. The problem is when people who will benefit from this identify with people who will lose from it. > People can and do support a variety of causes and policies without they themselves benefitting from them. They do, but here we're talking about the opposite: People being against policies they benefit from, because they identify with the group that will not. P.S. I liked your comment, it was a reasoned reply that furthers the debate, thank you. reply EgregiousCube 1 hour agorootparentYou'll find very few people who don't want poor people to have things and it's disingenuous to put it that way. The two commonly held arguments against socialized healthcare in America are: First, a distrust that the government will create a system that is good and a belief that quality will decrease under such a system, and; Second, that such a system would be funded by a large tax increase and that Americans are in general hard to get excited about tax increases. The financial concern is in the taking, not in the getting. reply danaris 22 minutes agorootparent> You'll find very few people who don't want poor people to have things and it's disingenuous to put it that way.

IIUC denying any non-essential cookies should always be as easy as accepting all cookies. This is something many cookie banners have not managed.

Totally hearsay from me. reply kuschku 1 hour agorootparentRegulation isn't going to stop innovation that much, or the tech industry wouldn't be in california. The primary difference is that the US is one homogenous, huge market. If I build something in California, to California's laws, and it becomes a success, I can immediately sell it across the entire rest of the US, and I can expand across the US, using the same employment contracts as in california, same lawyers as in california, etc. Sure, later on I can save money by making the Delaware version of my product with more cancerous chemicals, or have stricter NDAs in my Florida contracts. But if I start with California regulations, I can expand to the entire US with a small team of employees. There's nothing like that in Europe. If my product works in Germany, I'll need a french, spanish, italian translation to sell it in these countries. I can't just hire people from these countries either — they've got different holidays, different work hours, different unions I'll have to deal with. Different tax codes and agencies. And often these are conflicting with one another. In the US, I need one or two support shifts in one or two languages. In the EU I need 27. In the US, I need one version of the product, with one plug. In the EU, unless I'm okay with 10A and a plastic chassis, I need a dozen different versions. And even if the product can be used universally, European culture is significantly more diverse than US culture. Is a phone call at 7am or 8pm more appropriate? Depends on whether you're in Germany or Spain. When a job applicant includes a photo of themselves and lists their parents' degrees and jobs on their own CV, is that appropriate or not? In Germany, that's often expected, in many other regions, a huge no-go. To be successful in the US, I need to build one company. To be successful in the EU, I need to build a multinational corporation with 27 local branches. reply nostrademons 1 hour agorootparentCalifornia's tech industry works because there is a long-established tradition of lawbreaking in California. We pass all these regulations, and then ignore them. Sometimes the more enlightened legislators put in explicit carve-outs for businesses of less than 50 employees or a $B in revenue, so that startups don't have to actually break the law, they can just ignore it. But they're going to ignore it anyway, so the carve outs really serve the law's benefit rather than the startup. In practice, the way California tech startups work is 1) Break *all* the laws. 2) Get customers 3) Raise capital 4) Profit! 5) Hire lawyers to bring the company into compliance with the laws. 6) Hire lobbyists to bring the laws into compliance with the company. 7) Try to prevent your employees from doing the same thing you did. Steps #5-6 aren't limited to a particular state. At that point, you have buckets of money anyway, so you contort your company structure and product into a configuration that is legal in as many jurisdictions as possible, including internationally. reply kuschku 1 hour agorootparentSure, but that's not any different in EU. Lobbyism exists here, too. But the social differences of the two markets remain. reply drra 1 hour agorootparentprevAlso since national markets in Europe are relatively big by themselves a lot of companies tend to be satisfied with comfort of a single market success. reply kuschku 1 hour agorootparentAnd once you've got control of one EU country, expanding to another EU country is just as complicated as expanding to the US is. So if you're spending the same effort anyway, expanding to the US with 300 million people is much more profitable than expanding to Germany with 80 million people, or the Netherlands with 20 million people. Which is why Spotify became available in Sweden, the US, and the rest of the EU in that order. reply mrtksn 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's a meme on Twitter, essentially libertarians are pushing the idea that EU killed its tech industry through heavy reagulation and by tech they mean online advertisement. They keep posting graphs of market capitalisation claiming that Europe must be failing because doesn't have speculative public trading stocks. There's also the top-list theme, making list of top-10 companies by market cap, claiming that if your country doesn't have monopolistic speculative giant public companies you must be failing. It's very annoying because its very repetitive, I guess they are trying the Goebbles' propaganda technique of keep repeating something until people believe in it. Someone really really wants to turn the European economy into this short term high growth long term who cares casino that the US has become. reply mardifoufs 50 minutes agorootparentThere's no speculative stocks in Europe? Seriously? I guess if you ignore all the stock markets in Europe, sure? Also, it's funny that you mention Goebels. It's ironic even when you repeat the same tropes about the US and how it's supposedly beholden to the capital markets and speculators. Europe has its giants. Europe usually does not attack its giants. That's why you get megacorps like Maersk or Airbus or Volkswagen. The entire point is that it only attacks other giants (ie, not homegrown giants), hence the focus on legislation that mostly affects them but leaves European corporations mostly unscathed. Or why green legislation curiously doesn't affect German coal extraction (what a coincidence!) that much. Or all the other double standards Europe and some Europeans love so much. The delusion here is this weird narrative of good, noble Europeans who are somehow only guilty of not being greedy. reply mrtksn 41 minutes agorootparentEurope is far from noble, just different mentality and expectations from life. VW keep saying that next year VW Golf robotaxis are coming and not delivering wouldn't fly, therefore we don't have crazy stock prices. Airbus keeps making good quality planes that don't fall from the skies, selling those then flying around. It's alright, I don't know why the government should attack Airbus but maybe the US government should have kept Boeing in check. Europeans have their ways and Americans have theirs. Let's keep it like that and not put all the eggs in the same basket, as it appears that Chinese came up with another hugely successful economy model. reply mardifoufs 32 minutes agorootparentSure but that wasn't the main thrust of what I was replying to. Also, I guess it only has its own Wireguards or (if we want to talk about inflated promises instead of outright fraud) hundreds of start up like Qwant that promised to challenge the big American man in (2) more weeks or just a few more subsidies. The only difference is that we hear a lot more about American success and failures as they are sadly utterly dominant in media presence way beyond their own borders. And Europe seems much more likely to just keep its skeletons hidden in its closet, and tries to talk about them as little as possible. (For example,see how the German regulators dealt with Wireguard by going after the journalists that sounded the alarm for years. Or how Europeans love to discuss American issues like racism while ignoring how much worse the issue can be in their own backyard. Or the commenters here that recoil at any criticism of the EU and invent some conspiracy where said criticism obviously comes from. I never see any American accuse Europeans of being behind sentiment that is critical of the US.)

Companies are there to make these possible, not to maximise the stock trading price. Some achieve that by making EUV lithography machines, others do chemicals or pharmaceuticals.

You don't have to crumble your infrastructure, run from the mentally ill homeless people or bankrupt sick people to see those numbers.

Or scores by this[3] measure: Canada (6.9), USA(6.7), Germany(6.7), France(6.6) [1] Even longevity is full of caveats and nuances. When you look at life expectancy by ethnicity, a given ethnicity has similar life expectancy across different advanced countries (eg. Japanese-Americans vs Japanese in Japan).

DJI drones are amongst the most popular tools of war in the Ukraine conflict. Sometimes they drop bombs directly, but more commonly they're used as long-ranged lookout stations and RF-repeater \"hovering motherships\" for bomb-equipped one-way FPV drone operators (as well as just general reconnaissance tasks). That said, I don't think this law has anything to do with war, just simple economic protectionism driven by Skydio and other US drone lobbyists.

On the other hand, they can't make a generic law against say suspicious code running on consumer devices that could be used to exfiltrate personal data, as it would potentially hit every connected device out there, including western branded ones. My impression is that they (the law makers) are almost facing the wall where they should admit that closed proprietary devices are generally unsafe and bad, but can't because it would hurt the same industry that contributed to their campaigns, so they direct all weapons against the external enemy. \"We're good, they're bad\", and end of the story. reply kube-system 52 minutes agorootparent> they can't make a generic law against say suspicious code running on consumer devices that could be used to exfiltrate personal data, as it would potentially hit every connected device out there, including western branded ones.

The Feds should have come up with reasonable estimates of what foreign manufacturing was saving by cheating that way, and charged them that amount of money to sell products in the US. Factories which wanted to avoid those tariffs could pay for, and submit to, an independent audit of their factories.

The DJI Mini 3 Prop is currently $899, and Skydio can't manufacture something like that in the US, and sell it for that amount of money.

I don't know that I support a ban on DJI products, I have a Mini 2: I like drones, but not enough to drop a couple grand on a Skydio 2 (and note that they exited the consumer market, presumably because of the aforementioned price dumping making it infeasible to compete). I would be pissed off if it was permanently grounded. But at minimum I support tariffs which are heavy enough to give domestic industry a chance to compete on an even footing. And given the evident relationship between drone technology and national security, I could be persuaded that a full ban is in the national interest. Perhaps (this is only sort of a joke) the NSA could release a full open-source jailbreak of every DJI product, and publish an API for the cloud components which any American compute provider could then offer.

Its better to pay a contractor $3k a pop to buy a bunch of a DJI Mavics, spray paint them olive drab, and issue them to each platoon than it is to give every platoon $3k and say \"go buy a drone\", because then you can buy 6000 of the same replacement rotor or whatever. reply ahi 1 hour agorootparentprevUkraine goes through hundreds if not thousands of drones a day.

It's unclear whether the FCC would revoke existing approvals, although it certainly seems like what Congress wants. And if they do, it's unclear if they'd go to the effort to hunt down Anzu and Cogito, but on paper, they certainly should. By the way, there's no US-written software on Anzu drones. They're just green Mavic 3 Enterprises with a phone app that integrates the DJI SDK. Flying a DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise and an Anzu Raptor using Aloft Air Control will produce exactly identical results in terms of American-ness and data transfer. reply prmoustache 3 hours agoprevWho decided it is a good idea to pass brands / companies specific bills?

The whole thing is an incredibly shortsighted move that will literally cost lives. The goal, I think, is that these organizations will migrate to Skydio or BRINC (as they have the only reasonably viable drones for most of these use cases IMHO).

Banning a Drone Manufacturer simply because the manufacturer is Chinese? There aren't ties to the Chinese military, are there? reply kube-system 27 minutes agoparent> There aren't ties to the Chinese military, are there? From a practical perspective, it could be at any time. China hasn't embraced the free market the same way the west does, and doesn't give private companies the same degree of autonomy you're used to seeing elsewhere. Broadly speaking, if the Chinese government needs a company within their jurisdiction to cooperate with them, they can enforce cooperation. As an example, even with publicly held companies, the Chinese government will take out \"special management shares\" that give the government positions on the board with unique power to direct management within a company and direct management decisions. It's not like the West where companies have theit own management that might disagree with the government and battle in court. In China, the government can simply become the management of a company. reply balls187 23 minutes agorootparentThat would be an after the fact justification, which could be used to justify banning any company that operates in China. reply kube-system 13 minutes agorootparentNot every company, just the ones with military relevance.

    "originBody": "First look at the upcoming Starlink Mini June 17, 2024 by Noah Clarke This post may contain affiliate links. If you make a purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. The launch of the highly anticipated Starlink Mini dish is imminent. Last week, Starlink got approval from the FCC for the Mini’s Wifi router. Today, Starlink updated their app with some juicy new details. In this post, I’m going to dive into what we know so far, and show you the first images of the Mini. Based on previous FCC documents filed by SpaceX, we know the size of Starlink Mini to be 11.4″ x 9.8″, or about the size of a laptop. Here is a graphic I made to compare the size of the Standard and the Mini: Dimensions of the Standard dish (left) vs Mini dish (right) Based on the size of the dish, it looks like Starlink Mini will be aimed at portable use cases, such as camping, RV’s, vans, hiking, etc. It’s designed to be easy to store, transport, and deploy. I’m hoping Starlink listens to customer feedback and offers a DC power supply accessory, but many details are still unknown. What I do know at this point comes to us from a recent Starlink app update. The app update shows a new shop page for the upcoming Mini dish, as well as developer mode pages. This gives us our first look at the Mini: As you can see, the Mini is very similar to the Standard dish, just smaller. It has a similar shape, and even a kickstand. The Starlink app update gives us more details about the Mini. If you go into developer mode and play around with the Mini network settings, you notice something interesting. There is no separate router. Devices are connected to the dish itself: That can only mean one thing: The Starlink Mini will feature a built-in Wifi router. I’m guessing that, in order to make the Mini as portable as possible, Starlink decided it was best to simplify the system and limit the number of components. There are more Wifi details that have been revealed, and that is mesh compatibility. For those of you that might be interested in using the Mini at home, or for larger events where you need additional Wifi coverage, the Mini’s built-in router will be compatible with Starlink mesh. You’ll be able to wirelessly pair another Starlink router to the Mini, as seen in this Starlink app graphic: There you have it, we’ve now seen what the Mini will look like, and how practical it will be for camping and other activities where portability is key. I speculate that Starlink will launch the Mini within the next several weeks, based on the familiar pattern we’ve seen from other product launches. The fact that Starlink created the shop page and updated the app suggests we are very close. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the images and details shared in this post.

I will avoid that as much as possible. reply theodric 11 hours agorootparentTesla and SpaceX collectively employ 113,000 people, and I really think the story should be more about them than the guy who has the keys to the nicest office in the building. Gwynne Shotwell is a hell of an administrator. Without Starlink, I wouldn't have broadband! Elon Musk makes his questionable opinions public, but we don't know if the Hughes or Chevrolet CEO has bad opinions for which they must be cancelled, because they have PR teams and filters and the sense not to shitpost. It's possible that no product is safe. reply trompetenaccoun 4 hours agorootparentIn a liberal and civilized society no one \"must be cancelled\" for opinions. And I personally much prefer they openly share their convictions than sneakily hiding behind corporate speak. What you're describing is done out of cowardice and greed. Maybe Tesla's stock would be higher if Musk let his PR team do the tweeting, like Bezos does. But why would anyone sensible want to listen to that? They'll say anything as long as it makes their boss look good. More importantly, what kind of person has that kind of wealth and yet is still concerned mainly with the share price and not what their conviction tells them to stand up for? There are more important things in life than money. reply theodric 1 hour agorootparentNuance lost while attempting to approach the topic from GP's perspective. I don't personally adhere to cancel mob culture. My point is: they're likely all some variety of cartoon villain, given (my experience of) the sort of people who make it to that level, so singling out a bunch of compelling products because you know one specific dude who is peripherally involved is a socially-inept tosser is disingenuous at best and self-sabotage at worst. reply INGSOCIALITE 9 hours agorootparentprevpeople are allowed to think or say whatever they want to. steve job reply iknowstuff 12 hours agorootparentprevBoth Tesla and SpaceX have an incredibly positive impact on the world so I find this attitude hilarious reply amluto 20 hours agoprevI wish “mesh” WiFi was more standardized. I don’t think there’s any good reason that a device like this should require specifically a Starlink mesh mode instead of an industry standard WDS device. reply Nursie 14 hours agoparentThere was a standard a few years ago IIRC, EasyMesh. I even bought a kit that supported it. https://www.netgear.com/au/home/wifi/mesh/mk62/ I was most pissed off when I bought another (orbi?) kit from the same vendor a couple of years later and it didn't support easymesh, and wasn't compatible at all. Does seem to be a mess! reply contingencies 10 hours agorootparentMesh is a mess because the government, mobile device manufacturers and cellular carriers all want you on a centralized cellular system. Money is made selling cellular plans, cellular data, cellular carrier based device distribution (especially in the US, where most devices are carrier-acquired IIRC). Google in particular don't want to encourage non-centralized models, because their whole Android-shall-prevent-Apple-from-taking-the-mobicake play (\"commoditize your complement\"[0]) was to preserve their cloud kingdom. They're using lawyers and doublespeak to lock down what they've got, for example through ensuring no app can be distributed on Google Play that supports non Google Play store based payments (eg. carrier payments), and no app can be sideloaded without great effort (and there you were thinking it was your device!) At certain levels of their organization they are actively refusing to make mesh work in new Android versions as a first-line use case in Android, even though the hardware has supported it for eons (since ~2011[1]), as well as fiddling with the Android security model enough to make it a pain to use even if it theoretically works. This seems to be a dual layer strategy to frustrate any non-edgecase popularity of mesh. They do claim to support it in home networking products but probably only because they want to take over, monitor and surveil the rest of your house to understand more about your family's behavior, presence and so on. People even leave the bloody microphones on all the time, knowing it's spying on them. It's insane. This is why we need open devices. To be fair, the security model for mesh is hard. Even FirefoxOS couldn't get mesh working properly. I think someone needs to just bring out an open device with mesh as the default use case. If anyone wants to pile on and do it, I'm down to contribute. [0] https://gwern.net/complement [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s reply michaelt 9 hours agorootparentMesh is a mess because meshes do not, in fact, work very well. You set up a mesh network to provide community internet access to an underserved community? 99.9% of traffic will be going to or from the node that connects to the internet at large. That means that although notionally adding a node to the network adds more bandwidth to the network, in practice that's only true if the new node happens to add extra bandwidth at a bottleneck. And if everyone aims their directional antennas at the egress node, to avoid this? You've just reinvented the centralised network. reply yencabulator 4 hours agorootparentI don't understand how anyone would expect to gain more bandwidth from a mesh. What you gain is coverage, as in distance from uplink. And at least with earlier meshes, you decrease bandwidth even if you use only one device, because now in laptopAProuter both links compete for the same airtime. reply michaelt 3 hours agorootparent> I don't understand how anyone would expect to gain more bandwidth from a mesh. Well, if you had an hourglass-shaped mesh network which was congested at the narrow point of the hourglass, and you recruited an extra node that gave you a second link across the narrow point, by adding the node you've doubled the bandwidth between the bulbs of the hourglass - and improved the redundancy. The problem is a lot of people imagine this will happen every time they add a node, making the whole thing infinitely scalable. Whereas the reality is any time you add a node that isn't crossing the narrow point of the hourglass, the congestion gets worse. reply yencabulator 2 hours agorootparentYou're talking about a world of P2P and local use. The reality is that practically everyone is using \"wifi mesh technology\" as range extender for their own singular internet connection, and the internet connection is the bottleneck for practically everything. reply contingencies 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, with current consumption being \"everyone wants a global DNS and global network access\" it's semi-pointless. But that's just a chicken and egg problem. All of Wikipedia, libgen, thingiverse, open source packages, etc. can be locally cached somewhat trivially. Most oldschool games will run P2P fine over arbitrary networks. That's quite powerful indeed. Now we just need some localtalk apps (reinvent 'talk' and BBSs and get people off Failbook) and there will be users. Also, piracy can be normalized in a social way instead of the current situation so people can actually, you know, discuss and appreciate art. A killer app may be sharing your CCTV with people, so the community as a whole can more readily resist bad actors. Perhaps a starter node could be a bit of media to pick up wirelessly on your way to your commute, so you have a kind of protected local distribution that's censorship free and surveillance costs substantially more than with centralized networks. Next, bring back Fidonet! Haha. Maybe one too many red wines... reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentIf only the users were better and didn't want to stream video, or talk on Facebook, or video call each other, I could run a brilliant service! reply rusk 4 hours agorootparentIt seems to me an approach would be to purposely deoptimize such a P2P network for these applications. Optimise for time-insensitive best effort delivery like the internet of old. Still plenty of applications can work to that model and it is “good enough” for doing business. Keep the bandwidth heavy applications on different channels with a different QoS guarantees and cost structure. reply amluto 5 hours agorootparentprevI put “mesh” in quotes for a reason. I mean the wireless backhaul ability that basically every major WiFi AP manufacturer has, not a bunch of unaffiliated users forming an ad-hoc, dynamic mesh. reply jpm_sd 5 hours agorootparentprevDon't assume a conspiracy where the underlying mathematics are a sufficient explanation! Centralized systems use RF bandwidth MUCH more efficiently. reply alex_duf 11 hours agoparentprevI thought this was part of wifi 7? reply skybrian 21 hours agoprevI think a great use case for this would be as a backup for when the regular ISP goes out in a rural area.

And there might be issues after a storm if everyone started using it at once. reply dboreham 5 hours agoparent> But I don't think they have any subscription plans priced for that? As a former owner of a WISP, this idea of a \"backup service\" doesn't really work (read: I make no money from you). reply mathsmath 5 hours agorootparentSure it does! I’m rural and our phones/ISP went out last week. I activated our Starlink roam (you can access the captive portal while service is disabled) & all the remote working neighbors came over and shared the connection. It worked great! reply rescbr 1 hour agorootparentWhat do you mean?

Not broadband internet obviously, but it provides access to basic, essential communication methods. It does so at a much, much lower price point than Starlink/HughesNet/etc can offer, making it more palatable as an \"emergency backup\" product. reply wkat4242 19 hours agorootparentWell Starlink here in Spain costs 40€ per month. That's a lot less than the unlimited Garmin inreach plan (74,99€!!) that only allows you to send short messages! And that's the regular plan. Deprioritised Starlink costs €29/month! Still way way more useful service than inreach. I have inreach and for €19,99 I get 10 SMS per month (i don't subscribe every month) and I also have to pay a €39,99 yearly fee. Starlink is undoubtedly cheaper here. Of course it's not really the same kind of service. Inreach is a rugged 100 grams device for hiking with its own battery power that can stay connected for days. It can stay connected even in my bag and has a button to call for emergency services. For internet backup I have a 4G modem right now, connected to my unifi router with auto failover and a script that adds credit to my prepay card over SMS. It serves me ok. But I'd love to have a starlink mini for backup. Just the regular one is a bit big so I didn't get it yet. reply prmoustache 7 hours agorootparent\"For internet backup I have a 4G modem right now, connected to my unifi router with auto failover and a script that adds credit to my prepay card over SMS.

I am also in Spain and in my neighborhood we often suffer from power failure under heavy rain, I guess a local transformer is shorting as it impacts just a few streets around my house. But when it happens I also lose phone connectivity. The nearest antenna seems to be located in the few streets impacted and smartphone seemingly cannot reach another one nearby. This made me realize the short radius of mobile network range around a single antenna. reply brianshaler 7 hours agorootparentIt sounds more like a building material or geography issue. I've used LTE upwards of 10km off shore. In areas where there isn't good line of sight or if buildings tend to interfere with signal, the access points need to be positioned more densely reply prmoustache 6 hours agorootparentWell home 5G wifi has trouble covering all rooms at decent quality, I guess because the walls are thick, so building material may be an issue. I obviously never tried going on the roof to check because it happens when it is raining. reply mattlondon 13 hours agorootparentprevWTF? Entry price for starlink is £75/month in UK! ADSL is typically ~£25-30 for unlimited 80/20 for comparison reply dotnet00 12 hours agorootparentI think the pricing is based on coverage, usage density and demand. The UK probably has enough terrestrial coverage of amy sort that they figure they can upcharge anyone who still wants/needs Starlink, since it's mainly setup to be internet service for those who have essentially no other decent choice. Alternatively, maybe the meaningful coverage areas are so small and dense that the price should be higher. Since Starlink's biggest limitation is that performance suffers in more densely populated areas. reply multjoy 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you can get 80/20 ADSL, you're not buying Starlink. reply Scoundreller 4 hours agorootparentSome people underestimate how much hate we can have for our legacy ISPs.

So there must be more at play there than just purchasing power. If it was purely based on that it would be more like 70 euro compared to Spain's 40. Could be saturation indeed, as Ireland is very sparse in rural areas. And so is Spain, outside the few urban centres. reply janettansy 2 hours agorootparentThe Republic Ireland is rolling out fiber to all properties. The standard rate for gigabit fiber is ~60 euro at the moment, less if you just want 500mbs, so SpaceX was just responding to competition as fiber got to more and more properties. Getting Starlink a few years ago was the first time we had reliable internet at our family farm, and we were stoked. We also started getting better and better service as fiber rolled out across the country, but we never got above 250mbs. Now that fiber is here, it's no longer necessary except perhaps as a backup. reply theodric 1 hour agorootparentprevI'll grant that Spanish people are on a bit less than the Irish, but please don't be misled by GDP Per Capita numbers. Irish people are hurting, especially in the parts of the country beyond greater Dublin. Dublin is well-served by €20/mo all you can eat 5G that seems to hit 300Mbps without effort, so there's no reason to compete with that. But out in the Cork mountains, where the broadband readiness date has now slipped two years to \"Jan-Dec 2026,\" most people I know are hand to mouth or on assistance or at least not earning Dublin bucks. €50 is a stretch for such, but €20 for LTE was barely getting me 2Mb when I finally gave up on it, despite having a baller antenna. reply dzhiurgis 6 hours agorootparentprev$80 in NZ while fibre cost around $110.

That’s a pretty significant load, even for an amplified antenna, I would have thought? reply ryukoposting 20 hours agorootparentDid some quick research on a major American car parts retailer's website. The biggest batteries they sell are rated as high as 188Ah (though they use a weird industry-specific unit to say that). Many are closer to 25-50Ah. Definitely enough juice to power a terminal for several hours. This lines up with my personal experiences. I have personally used a car battery to keep a big gaming laptop charged for an entire weekend, and it was being used (if not under heavy load) for about 10 hours a day. Those big batteries are extremely heavy and very expensive, but we're talking about people who want broadband internet service on their boat. Money is not a concern here. I'm sure Starlink has different power modes for these things, but the average consumer is likely far more interested in optimizing for connection speed and latency. reply wongarsu 20 hours agorootparentNormal car batteries really hate if you discharge them anywhere close to their capacity. You can get deep-cylce lead acid batteries built for that, but at that point just get lithium iron phosphate batteries. reply SkyPuncher 20 hours agorootparentprevYou likely wouldnt be running this off a lead acid car battery. You’d have a lithium battery and an additional power source, like solar or generator, to top that battery off. reply wyre 20 hours agorootparentprevNeeding to add an extra battery to an off grid power supply just to power a “portable” router designed to accept grid power and not 12V is a huge fail on starlinks part, regardless of the cost of the battery to power it. For reference 60w is similiar power draw to a Dometic fridge or a laptop. Also adding a huge heavy battery to a boat is a non-negligible consideration in a lot of cases. reply grecy 20 hours agorootparentprevPretty much all of us in the vanlife/overland space run Lithium batteries now, the smallest of which is basically 100Ah. I'm just about to put either 300Ah or 400Ah into my new Jeep camper to run an induction cook top, water pump, hot water, lights, charging and a lot more. I also just mounted 600W of solar on the roof. The power needs of Starlink is a tad annoying, but certainly not a deal breaker for anyone living in a vehicle that actually needs internet anywhere on the planet. reply jml78 20 hours agorootparentYep, on my boat, I converted the original square dish to run off my 12v lithium batteries. I have plenty of solar and batteries to run starlink 24/7. Even if you don’t have a lot of amp hours, starlink allows you to set a sleep schedule where it would use way less power. But ditching the starlink router and converting to run off 12v isn’t that hard reply treflop 18 hours agorootparentprevI designed the 12V electrical for my F-150 camper (and some friends’) and I could easily do 2 straight days of 40W with no recharge. My fridge pulls 50W when cycling the compressor and my current 5G modem/router pulls 15W. Indoor lights draw over 20W alone on full tilt. I have 200W of solar on my truck and my alternator does 400W and realistically I charge at around 550W on a good day so 40W is a drop in the bucket. RVs can have much beefier systems than my setup. I don’t full time or anything — just long time camper for 10 years before van life was a thing, so my setup is relatively low capacity. reply stavros 21 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if that's what the adapter supplies, and the device can actually do 12-30V or whatnot. reply IshKebab 21 hours agorootparentNot many devices that run off 30V will run off 12V too. It's too big of a difference. But 12V to 36V boost converters are readily available and very cheap. reply stavros 21 hours agorootparentI imagine most of those devices have a buck converter inside, no? reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentIf you're drawing 30V 2A (60W) through a connector rated for 2.5A, and you try to draw the same 60W at 12V i.e. 5A you're in trouble because the connector's not designed for 5A. And not every DC-DC converter is sized for a wide range of input voltages. A DC-DC converter with a \"2:1 input voltage range\" might accept anything from 18 to 36 volts, whereas a converter with a \"4:1 input voltage range\" might accept 9 to 36 volts. The wider input voltage range generally costs a bit more too. reply cma 16 hours agorootparentprevNo sure about vans, but aren't lots of cars moving to 48V? reply yencabulator 4 hours agorootparentSome manufacturer RVs and DIY builds are 48VDC now with stepdown converters for the legacy stuff that expects 12V. The problem with that is that practically every RV gadget on the market assumes 12V. It's a chicken-and-egg problem. reply IshKebab 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah because higher voltage reduces the cost of wiring, and 48V is still under the 50V legal limit for \"low voltage\". Not sure what your point is though. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentif the are power electronics chip they use is rated to handle 12 VDC to 48 VDC, which 30 VDC happens to be in-between, then they could just use that chip and you could give it 12V or 48V, whichever you had handy. If all cars are moving to 48V, that makes that more likely. reply yencabulator 4 hours agorootparentThat's a very wide range and to build a gadget to take that range would cost more, and thus it's not done. Most \"12 V\" gadgets only accept the rough range of what a 12 V battery might give them, which is usually only up to 15.4 V while charging. reply cma 8 hours agorootparentprev> Not sure what your point is though. If it runs off 30V all you need is a cheap resistor to run it (with 40% loss), or I believe boost convertors are less efficient than buck convertors so it is a win there. reply lazide 16 hours agoparentprevThere are poe injectors that also fit the weird plug on the dishy and work well (48v). That said, you’re still talking 50-80 watts which is significant on a battery.

If you have perfect views, not an issue, but that is rare. Until that happens, you’ll experience unpredictable short loss of signal when it can’t talk to a sat it expects to be able to for a second or two due to a branch, building, etc. Usually 30 mins to a couple hrs and you’re fine, depending on the site and how much traffic.

By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Jun 17, 2024, 3:56 PM UTC Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge The US government is suing Adobe for allegedly hiding expensive fees and making it difficult to cancel a subscription. In the complaint filed on Monday, the Department of Justice claims Adobe “has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.” The lawsuit alleges Adobe “hides” the terms of its annual, paid monthly plan in the “fine print and behind optional textboxes and hyperlinks.” In doing so, the company fails to properly disclose the early termination fee incurred upon cancellation “that can amount to hundreds of dollars,” the complaint says. When customers do attempt to cancel, the DOJ alleges that Adobe requires them to go through an “onerous and complicated” cancellation process that involves navigating through multiple webpages and pop-ups. It then allegedly “ambushes” customers with an early termination fee, which may discourage them from canceling. Customers encounter similar obstacles when attempting to cancel their subscriptions over the phone or via live chats, the DOJ alleges. The complaint claims “subscribers have had their calls or chats either dropped or disconnected and have had to re-explain their reason for calling when they re-connect.” The lawsuit alleges that these practices break federal laws designed to protect consumers. The lawsuit also targets Adobe executives Maninder Sawhney, the senior vice president of digital go-to-market and sales, as well as David Wadhwani, the president of the company’s digital media business. The complaint says both executives “directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of Adobe.” Adobe didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Related Adobe overhauls terms of service to say it won’t train AI on customers’ work Adobe scolded for selling ‘Ansel Adams-style’ images generated by AI “Adobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel.” The federal government began looking into Adobe’s cancellation practices late last year. In 2012, Adobe went from selling its creative software for lifetime use to charging users for a monthly or yearly subscription to its suite of products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and others. The company’s subscription model has long frustrated creatives, who are often forced to stay subscribed to Adobe in order to keep doing their jobs. Earlier this month, Adobe’s new terms of service were met with backlash after some interpreted the move as an opportunity to train its AI on users’ art. The lawsuit speaks to continued regulatory scrutiny of Adobe. In 2022, Adobe attempted to acquire the product design platform Figma for $20 billion, but it abandoned the deal last year after facing antitrust scrutiny from European regulators.

    "originBody": "./techtipsy Archive Posts Tags Archive Posts Tags They make USB-C cables with displays now! 2024-06-05 — 2 min read #free tech tip I’ve reached a point in my setup where most of the devices that I use are based around the coveted USB-C port. This meant that I had a valid reason to get a few extra because I didn’t yet have a stockpile of good USB-C cables. That’s when I found out that there exist cables that have little screens on them that show the power consumption of the connected device. This is a great little addition to my power consumption monitoring addiction. It’s also a simple way to understand if your device is charging at the speed that you expect it to. The cable I ordered cost 6.72 EUR. It is a bit stiff and hard to work with, probably due to its supposed USB 4 support requiring actually good cabling and shielding. It works well enough for an USB-C dock with a DisplayPort connection that’s running a 3440x1440 display at 60 Hz. It’s too early to give a definitive answer about the longevity of the cable. You should be able to find these types of cables with a search query like “USB 4 Cable with LED Display”. The paranoid side of me suspects that a cable like this one would be an ideal place to hide a malicious chip. That’s the only downside that I can think of. If you’re interested in going more in depth with measuring the power consumption over USB, then you might want to look at other options. This GitHub repository lists a few examples of these types of measuring devices. Subscribe for more tech tips! Subscribe to new posts via the RSS feed. Not sure what RSS is, or how to get started?

Ie their pretty basic 65W wall charger is much better than 65W usb-c chargers from both HP and Dell they give to their laptops - much smaller and doesn't heat up at all with full day work from it, plastics are really solid so whole device just oozes quality, compared to properly cheap stuff from say aliexpress claiming the same. Their 20,000 mah battery charger works exactly as advertised, has exactly the charge we expect, keeps working few years after purchase just as new. So, to end suspense - what are actually high end manufacturer(s) in this area?

Alas so far I have had a lot of devices that refused to charge at anything higher than 7 watts despite USB C on both ends and a modern GAN 100W charger. The power standards for USB are a complete mess. reply rramadass 14 hours agoparent> Due to the way the standards for power have gone there is substantial need for owning such a cable! More than this everybody (and in particular; \"the common non-tech person\") needs a powerful and feature rich \"USB Power Meter\". This and knowledge of a couple of equations (eg.

This is a great and powerful USB power meter which is highly recommended. Make sure that you read and keep the manual handy since there are so many functions (and heed the warnings listed there). There are other cheaper versions/clones of this on Aliexpress which may also be good.

So easy to get a USB cable that is secretly not to spec or otherwise dysfunctional and is making things charge slow. (Most common: 5W when it should be ~20W.) reply geepytee 15 hours agoparentprevOut of curiosity, why did you buy a power meter? Does it help with troubleshooting hardware? reply accrual 15 hours agorootparentThey can be handy. One situation where it saved the day - my friend has a partially broken USB-C port on their phone that only charges when the cable is just right. The battery had died so there was no way to see if it was charging or not. Plugged in a USB-C inline power meter and we moved the cable around until the meter showed current, then we carefully set it down so it would finish charging. :) reply rramadass 14 hours agorootparentprevSuppose you plugged in your Phone/Tablet and it is not charging or charging very slowly etc. Problems might be; 1) The battery is dead and cannot be charged. 2) The cable is a non-charging one or internally damaged/dead or non-fastcharging or with limited fastcharging capability. 3) The charger is not capable enough to supply the max current that the device can use to charge itself. To troubleshoot the problem, first check the Voltage/Current specs for your device, make sure that the charger plug/battery can provide the same voltage but same or higher amount of current. Then use a USB power meter to see what is actually being drawn (or not) to figure out where and what the problem might be. One key point to note is that for fastcharging all the links in the chain i.e. charger, cable and device should support it. reply gizmo686 15 hours agorootparentprevI've had issues with USB devices drawing more current then the port could put out. Without a power meter, it looks like the device just doesn't work (although the Linux kernel logs typically show a device disconnect event). With the meter, you can see a current peak up to a nice round value, followed by a voltage drop. The low refresh rate makes it not nearly as clear as with an oscilloscope, but once you know what to look for, it is easy enough to pick up. (And if you really want to, you can get one with a breakout to connect scope probes). If this is an issue you run into often, I'd also suggest a usb variable load tester to check exactly how much current a port will output. reply Izkata 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't remember why I got the older one, but the USB-C one was mostly just curiosity - I'd heard that wireless charging was inefficient compared to wired charging and wanted to see how much. reply tedunangst 15 hours agorootparentprevI have a gaming laptop for which noise and heat are directly correlated with power draw, but not always so obviously correlated with graphics settings, and having a power readout on the cable let me see what different low vs medium shadows had, etc. reply Animats 16 hours agoprevThe original USB-C spec called for cables to have optional displays to show why the cable had problems connecting. Did anyone every see one of those? reply toast0 13 hours agoparentCould just print 'the spec is too complex' on all cables. And save the expense of a display. reply crote 6 hours agoparentprevDid they? The only thing which comes to mind is the mandatory \"Billboard Class\" support for USB-C adapters, which allows them to inform the device they're attached to that negotiation has failed. But that's not really anything physical on the adapter itself, it's essentially a super-simple read-only micro flashdrive. reply LegitShady 15 hours agoparentprevNever in my life. reply twostorytower 17 hours agoprevAnd somebody will have Doom working on it soon! reply idatum 13 hours agoprev> It is a bit stiff and hard to work with, Current USB-C cables that connect to my docking station have a rigid connector end that puts mechanical stress on my laptop's port. I have the habit of moving my laptop around on my desk, and that connector end is a lever that pulls it out of the port. Worse, it physically wore out one of the ports where it became almost unusable (replacing requires an entire new board). Let's not put more stuff on these cables so they don't act more like like pliers instead of actual cables. reply calini 7 hours agoparentI think reliability is the Achilles heel of USB C regardless. I don't see those having a much bulkier head than a normal USB C power cable though. reply ruph123 13 hours agoprevWhat I like for USB-C cables is not only a tester that tests how much power it can transmit but also what data rates. I wish I could get a device where I could plug in all my cables and it would rate them for me. Such a device probably exists and it probably costs thousands of dollars. reply exikyut 13 hours agoparentYou might be able to get partway there by setting up thunderbolt networking between two endpoints. The caveat is that USB 4.x is still new enough it may require a significant time sink to get working at ~40Gbps et al, so your testing wouldn't be able to scale that high. But you can go to 10Gbps without too much effort: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39003469 USB is quite the rabbithole, with a lot of functionality often hidden: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39470381 - my takeaway from this is that \"the PHY in the controller is 99% of the SERDES you wish you had, you just have to figure out how to make it cooperate\" The chipsets found attached to ARM devices and SoCs etc may be easier to poke around at, but they are likely to either be expensive or just USB 3.0. :) Then there are devices like the FNB58 and the Power-Z KM003C that interrogate the controller chip in the cable and tell what charging protocols the cable supports, and also measure practical charging voltage and current (and you can acid test chargers using USB charger dummy loads). These devices don't test the cable's speed though.

Data are useful if we can collect and process them automatically, a display means you can read instantaneously (essentially useless 99% of the time) but not store and analyze. Some instantaneous data are useful, for instance before going out in the morning a quick look at the thermometer might be useful. Many others are not. For me a more expensive cable just to have a display on it is useless, eventually collected consumption data per device and makes a nice Grafana dashboard of them might be useful or just wasted resources, but at least they go on a flexible machine I already own so it's not an extra hw costs. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Marion Stokes, the Woman Who Spent over 30 Years Recording Every Minute of US TV",
    "originLink": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/marion-stokes",
    "originBody": "Beginning in 1979, former librarian Marion Stokes privately recorded broadcasts from multiple televisions at once, 24 hours a day, eventually accumulating a startling 71,000 tapes of television history. Zeitgeist FilmsMarion Stokes took it upon herself to record and archive every moment of television. Marion Stokes believed that the news held crucial historical details at risk of disappearing forever. So, beginning around 1979, the former librarian and civil rights activist began obsessively recording television broadcasts 24 hours a day. For more than three decades, Stokes attempted to archive every broadcast that she had access to, eventually recording programs on as many as eight televisions at once. In the end, she wound up with more than 70,000 recorded tapes. Stokes was equal parts compulsive hoarder and guerrilla archivist, and her unique project has raised important questions about media preservation. Although she died in 2012, her project has been given new life thanks to the Internet Archive, which began the painstaking process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes in 2013. This massive undertaking is itself a years-long task, which shows just how prolific Marion Stokes’ work truly was. Who Was Marion Stokes? Marion Marguerite Stokes was born on Nov. 25, 1929, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stokes grew up in the city’s Germantown neighborhood and attended Girls High School. From the 1940s to the early 1960s, she worked as a librarian at the Free Library of Philadelphia. But it was Stokes’ later work as a civil rights activist, working to help integrate Girard College, that initially made her a standout. She helped organize buses to the 1963 March on Washington, and served as a founding board member of the National Organization for Women. She was likewise the Chair for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an organization that opposed the economic boycott of Cuba. Zeitgeist FilmsMarion Stokes with her son, Michael. In 1960, Stokes married a teacher named Melvin Metelits, with whom she had one son, Michael. The couple later split, and Marion would go on to marry television anchor John Stokes Jr., whom she met while working as a panelist on a local news show called Input. The Stokeses later moved into a new home in Rittenhouse Square. Around 1975, Stokes bought herself a Betamax magnetic videotape recorder and began to casually record episodes of her favorite sit-coms, documentaries, and news broadcasts. But in 1979, amid the Iran Hostage Crisis, something in Marion Stokes changed. As her son Michael Metelits said in the 2019 documentary Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project, “she hit record and she never stopped.” The Birth Of A Unique Obsession Marion Stokes became obsessed with chronicling and archiving news footage. She would purchase countless tapes, load them into the recorder, and let the television run all day long. Every six to eight hours — depending on the length of the tape — she quickly swapped it out for a new one. Sometimes, this meant rushing home early from a meal to ensure she didn’t miss a second of a broadcast. Gradually, she bought more and more TVs so she could document multiple programs at once until she was recording from eight different devices. “It was just a logistical nightmare — that’s really the only way to put it,” Michael Metelits told Fast Company in 2013. Family handoutMarion Stokes had to buy several additional apartments in which to store her tapes. As one might expect, these tapes eventually began to take up space — a lot of it. By investing in Apple stock, Stokes saved enough money to buy as many as nine additional apartments, which she used as storage units to hold all of her tapes. “Pretty much everything else took a back seat,” Metelits said. “It provided a certain rhythm to her life, and a certain amount of deep, deep conviction that this stuff was going to be useful. That somehow, someone would find a way to index it, archive it, store it — that it would be useful.” The archives eventually grew to approximately 71,000 VHS and Betamax tapes, stored in various locations. These tapes contained not only news broadcasts but also sit-coms, commercials, and talk shows, recorded in Extended Play format. Zeitgeist FilmsMarion Stokes often watched two televisions at a time, while several others ran throughout her home. Stokes worried that facts and details from early news broadcasts could become lost or muddied as stories were retold over time. Little inconsistencies could start to add up, leaving viewers with no way of knowing how the story was originally reported. “Television has been our most pervasive and persuasive medium,” said Roger MacDonald, the librarian in charge of the Internet Archive’s television portion. “But we’ve never really had much of a pause and rewind button on our experience of it to reflect back on television news, to compare and contrast and mine it for knowledge.” Archiving television programs was not Stokes’ only fascination. In fact, the tech-savvy hoarder also took an early interest in Apple computers — and amassed 192 Macintosh computers before she died. Still, it was her obsessive archiving of the daily news that would be her ultimate legacy. The Legacy And Lasting Impact Of Marion Stokes’ Work Marion Stokes continued to record and archive television footage up until the end. She lived to be 83 years old. And as it would turn out, her last day on Earth would coincide with her last recordings — and a horrible tragedy. Stokes died on Dec. 14, 2012. That very same day, news organizations across the United States were reporting on the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “I got to the house and this horrific news was going on,” Metelits said. “Kids being killed. Teachers being killed while shielding children, that sort of thing… I remember being very grateful that that wasn’t the last news she saw.” Marion Stokes’ project died with her that day. Her son did not continue her archival work, saying he “came to respect her project, but it wasn’t my project.” Family handoutIn total, Stokes collected more than 400,000 hours of footage. But while no new tapes would ever be added to Stokes’ collection, her project did find new life in 2013, just a year after her death, when the Internet Archive began the process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes and putting them online. Then, in 2019, filmmaker Matt Wolf released his documentary about Marion Stokes, allowing audiences to understand Stokes’ obsession with archiving television. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was met with positive reviews, with some critics noting that the film — and Stokes herself — made a compelling case for guerrilla archiving. Marion Stokes’ story also resonates strongly today, albeit somewhat differently, as private ownership of the media we consume daily begins to fade. With more and more services shifting to a streaming or digital model, only to then restrict access to certain media or get rid of it altogether, many are considering the merits of physical media as a means of preserving history. As MacDonald told Fast Company, some moments in television history have likely been lost forever. “But who knows,” he said. “Because there may be other Marion Stokeses out there who had that similar passion.” After reading about the massive television archive kept by Marion Stokes, see 45 stunning unpublished photos from the National Geographic archives.

A rented apartment is a liability to the tenant, but an asset to the landlord.

Is this a peculiarity of American English? In Australian English, \"apartment\" is about the type of physical structure, and has nothing to do with the building's legal structure.

This is such weird nitpicking. When people in the US talk about apartments, they're almost always rented.

You then go on to say that \"can\" be encoded at around 300MB/h, yet that is also very misleading. Nobody encoding VHS tape sources at 480p will be using that kind of bit rate.

Ok, several TV sets were expensive, but compared to the cost of all the tapes (not to mention the apartments she bought to store the tapes) I guess it was just a rounding error... reply ralferoo 6 hours agoparentprevMost VCRs were preset to output to UHF channel 36 (at least that's the UK numbering, it may be slightly different in the US), and so while recording different channels would be fine with multiple VCRs without a TV, watching the output from multiple VCRs wouldn't have been as easy. Maybe she wanted to be easily able to check what a particular VCR was recording without having to swap wires at the back of the TV. You could probably have made a giant coax switch box too, but it's unlikely they'd have been available commercially with more than just an A/B switch. There also used to be tuning screw accessible via a very small hole on most models in the UK, and you could re-tune it to output on a different channel that way, but sometimes you had to open up the VCR to get to that. Or maybe she just didn't know that was even possible. In any case, there would only have been so many spare channels for her to use before she started interfering with the broadcasts she was trying to capture. Maybe she just liked having a bank of screens that all had a different channel. I know my younger self would have thought that was pretty cool! reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentIn the US, as I recall, you typically chose whether to output to VHF 3 or 4. reply ta1243 4 hours agorootparentUK stopped using VHF for TV in the early 1980s, at 405 lines.

OP is not more wrong than https://sqlitestudio.pl/. If https://sqlitestudio.pl/ is using the mark under license, they haven't indicated that anywhere (usually a requirement). See this Github post where SQLite author asserts his trademark https://github.com/vapor/sqlite-kit/issues/47 on another project that uses SQLite in the name. Both projects should change their names.

Or the other way round, if someone from the USA violates an Ethiopian or Polish trademark? reply killingtime74 13 hours agorootparentI went to law school in Australia over 10 years ago so things maybe have changed. At the time we were taught about the Madrid Protocol (US implementation https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/international-protection/mad...), which gives you some time to register it in each country after the first registration. If you register it within this alloted time, you retain priority over other people who want to register it too. You do have to register it, but more importantly, enforce it, yourself worldwide. IP Lawfirms usually provide this as a service. On the practical matter of \"Is the trademark registered internationally?\". Have to do a search in each country's trade mark office. It's very tedious (not every mark is in text, some are pictures, sounds). reply otteromkram 14 hours agorootparentprevThe SQLite author wanted them to change their name because it was literally called \"SQLite,\" not because it had SQLite in the name. From the linked GitHub issue: > Please do NOT use the name \"SQLite\" for your project. Resolution PR: https://github.com/vapor/sqlite-kit/pull/52/files reply killingtime74 13 hours agorootparentThere is on the one hand what the Author wanted in this case, and what the law is on the other. He may have many reasons for not enforcing his rights to the maximum extent. He may want to be nice, or have done a deal or any number of reasons. That doesn't mean he can't stop them from using it altogether. Also he can change his mind down the track. Whether it is infringing or not is up to many factors in each case, but simply extending it is not going to protect you in every case. If we want a definitive answer, would have to take this to a court.

    "originBody": "Bekoha@bekoha9/16/2023, 12:38 AM Quake 1 potential original font discovery Some time last year while watching a video I got jumpscared by a logo that used a font that is immediately recognizable as the Quake font, and they used it at the very least 20+ years before Quake 1 even came out. This made me realize that the Quake font wasn't drawn completely from scratch and that it's probably possible to find it, most likely in a book or a digitization by someone. This has been nagging me for some time and I've made several unsuccessful attempts at trying to find it before, but recently I've come across Dan X. Solo's \"The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces\", 1992, and under \"Stencil fonts\" on the page 119 surprisingly actually found a sample for a font named \"Visa\", as pictured above. Checking Dan X. Solo's other books lead me to an earlier book named \"Stencil Alphabets: 100 Complete Fonts\", published in 1988, and turns out there's an entire page dedicated to this font showing the entire alphabet and numbers and other characters. While differences between this sample and both the Schott logo and final result in Quake are present, similarities between most of letterforms and some really specific ones like X and Y make me believe that Visa (or, more likely, its progenitor or a derivative because legally it's a typography free-for-all out there with everyone ripping off each other) was in fact used as a base for the Quake font. edit: According to Luc Devroye's \"On Snot and Fonts\", original Visa font's designer is Raphael Boguslav. His typeface Avia (VGC) was an expansion of a logofont he did for Abex Corporation, almost like a stencil. It is now at Font Bureau, where Jill Pichotta has added the Light and Bold in 2000. His typeface Visa (1966, VGC) won the Second Prize in the 1966 VGC National Type Face Design Competition. Others (thanks, Alexander Tochilovsky) confirm what I thought---that Visa and Avia are the same thing. Excerpt from the official promotional PDF for FontBureau's Avia https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/2173/avia http://web.archive.org/web/20130617135330/http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/avia/ read less #Quake#quake 1#fonts#typography#The Cohost Global Feed see all 2 comments",

The P, G, R and Y are significantly different and appear in both the Quake sample and the font sample. S is significantly flatter. The cherry-picked examples are the most basic letters and likely to have parallel evolution because of the constraints of that design space. I think it's more likely to be a hand-crafted font, inspired by the general layout of stencil letters but no more than that. reply yencabulator 3 hours agoparentThe N is completely different; Quake has a one-piece N, the font slices it into three separate parts. reply muglug 14 hours agoparentprevYeah — a bunch of inspirations for this.

Must've blotted it out to preserve the affection I had for the first 3. reply adamrezich 3 hours agorootparentIt was a sequel to Quake II by Raven Software, using id Tech 4 (DOOM 3), notable for having a first-person cutscene in which you are \"stroggified\", transformed into one of the mechanical zombie soldiers you've been fighting against all game (but your NPC teammates save you at the last second before the brain implant that removes your free will is implanted). Apparently at the time, this was talked about lots in the marketing leading up to release, but when I played it as a kid, I never knew anything about that, so it was a real shock when I got to that part. One cool thing the game did was they used the DOOM 3 \"interactive panels\" tech to make not only English-language human-manufactured \"touchscreens\", but also Strogg-language alien-manufactured \"touchscreens\", that you had to interact with to open doors and so forth. After becoming \"stroggified\", the glyphs on the Strogg touchscreens shift and you can now read them in English. I went back and replayed it a few years ago and it's really pretty generic as far as shooters of that era go, but I thought Raven did a decent job given what they had to work with. reply another2another 3 hours agorootparentI believe I probably started playing it when it came out, but abandoned it pretty early on, hence my initial confusion - like something you half remember. The first 3 games though were great in their different ways, but Quake 1 will always be my favourite. reply dahart 20 hours agoprevAgree with all the other comments saying this specific connection seems iffy and rather unlikely. The many significant differences cited are strong evidence, G and Q and R are entirely different. The most distinctive feature of Visa aside from the stencil dropouts is the missing ‘lost and found’ strokes with A, N, V, and W, and Quake’s font doesn’t have this feature at all. On top of that there are a billion stencil fonts! There are thousands of them that narrow near the stencil dropouts. Seems like the author is making wild speculation. reply CommitSyn 1 hour agoparentThe Q is obviously custom (Q for \"Quake\") the question is where the starting point for the font was. I agree about the cherry picking, but the font is going to have been modified for the game (as evidenced by the \"Q\".) reply mrandish 19 hours agoprevWhile I agree the correlation is iffy, I'm happy to see continued and growing interest in documenting and appreciating the origins and uniqueness of classic retro games. Regarding the origins of this font, I'm curious why someone hasn't asked the people involved. After all, the development of early Id games have been the focus of many books, scholarly papers, retrospectives and histories. Best of all the original sources are still available (Carmack, Romero, Abrash and, I assume, many others). reply marapuru 12 hours agoparentAgreed, although when they simply used a font without attribution I doubt there'll be a response. reply fwlr 22 hours agoprevI think the A and the N nix this theory. It’s almost more like the Quake font designer saw this font, remembered the concept of hairlines reduced to nothing, but when they applied the concept they made different choices on which hairlines to apply it to. reply muglug 23 hours agoprevWay too many differences for it to be a feasible origin typeface. This post is based on a few similar-looking letters but they’re not even that similar-looking: the O, for example, has a different curvature. reply Sharlin 23 hours agoparentI wouldn't put too much weight on curvature differences, that's an inevitable part of turning curved letterforms into a bitmap font. The letters would obviously have required significant pixel-by-pixel tweaking to look good on a 320x240 raster. reply andrewf 15 hours agorootparentQuake didn't even present the bitmaps in a consistent aspect ratio or size, it did a 1-to-1 pixel copy regardless of the target pixel shape/size. Quake shipped with a 320x200 default resolution in 1996, with configurable support for a variety of resolutions including 320x240. Over time, most people ended up on a 4:3 resolution on a 4:3 display. reply nightowl_games 23 hours agoparentprevThis isn't viral mutation we're talking about here. An artist easily could have redrawn the O because of some issue or purely taste. There's a lot of commonalities and the article seems interesting and potentially correct. reply beardyw 22 hours agoparentprevYes, the A in Quake is very different having a small bridge in the cross piece, whereas the font shown omits the lefthand stroke almost entirely to create a bridge. reply bee_rider 20 hours agoparentprevI’m not sure if is really is the font, but I suspect the font in Quake started as some conventional font and then was modified to fit the aesthetic of the game. Specifically, to make it look more threatening, because the 90’s ruled and even the fonts were edgy. The O is, I think, looming, and the T is a dagger. reply risenshinetech 20 hours agoprevThis would be much more convincing by writing out the entire words instead of overlaying a very small sample of the font next to a screenshot of the Quake menu. As it stands it's very hard to draw a conclusion. reply drsopp 14 hours agoprevI don't buy this at all. Too many differences, and at this resolution it is not that improbable for any font to have a doppelganger. Instead of looking for which vector font that have been rasterised at this resolution, I would sooner look for the font in bitmap font collections like this: https://github.com/ianhan/BitmapFonts I wouldn't be surprised though if the font was created 'from scratch' reply greenthrow 23 hours agoprevDoubtless there is a font that inspired Avia and one that inspired that and on and on.
