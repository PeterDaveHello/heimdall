    "content": "I\u2019ve talked to quite a few people who were considering founding their own startups. Many of them were quite inexperienced regarding, well, everything, as they were either fresh out of University or currently in a day job which was completely unrelated to startups, the economy and broader reality (mostly doctors).All of them tell me that their first step would be to get some Venture Capital (VC) funding. And all of them seem to have completely distorted views on what that means. So this is my attempt to clear up the confusion. Then again, it could be me who has the distorted views. Anyway, read on and then it\u2019s on you to decide whether VC funding is right for you.First off, in case you didn\u2019t know it, VC stands for Venture Capital and essentially describes a bunch of dudes who buy parts of companies. You often hear the announcements of these funding rounds in the startup news: \u201cCompany MagicalUnicorn receives 10m \u20ac funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.\u201dNow, you might think \u201csweet, I would also like to receive 10 million Euros\u201d, and I wouldn\u2019t disagree with you. Everyone would like to receive 10 million Euros.On a quick side note, let\u2019s talk about lottery winners for a moment. Their situation might seem quite similar. After receiving their winnings, they often end up unhappy, broke, or worse yet, dead. Why is this relevant? Because, surprisingly, the words \u201cunhappy, broke, dead\u201d are also suitable for describing most VC-funded startup.So, what about those 10 million Euros? If MagicalUnicorn were your company, would you as a founder personally receive that sweet cash when your company gets VC funding? Nope. So what\u2019s going on here? What actually happened is that a part of your company got sold for 10 million Euros - yep, that\u2019s right. In other words, the situation was as follows: You and your co-founders were running your MagicalUnicorn company, and things were going reasonably well. There was only one problem: Your company was not profitable. You know, in ancient times, when Peter Drucker, the Master Yoda of business books, was still roaming the planet (alongside dinosaurs, probably) and writing business books, the definition of a successful company actually included the fact that the company was making more money than it was spending - it was profitable.That definition seems to have been forgotten, just like the dinosaurs, and nowadays the success of companies seems to be judged by other, totally arbitrary metrics. Those metrics go by many names. Maybe it\u2019s the amount of customers a company has, or the speed at which that customer base is growing. Business dudes like to call it traction, but I\u2019m not sure whether the business dudes actually know what they mean by that. Regardless, whatever traction may be, the minor problem is that, well, having traction doesn\u2019t magically make your company profitable. If you spend more money than you make, you\u2019re screwed. And once you\u2019re screwed, that\u2019s where VC funding comes in, and in all likelihood, it screws you even more.VC dudes look at your company and will be like \u201chm, this business is currently not profitable, but if we give it lots of money, it\u2019ll turn into a magical unicorn and everyone is going to be happy!\u201d. Note that the VC dude\u2019s definition of \u201chappy\u201d doesn\u2019t include \u201cprofitable\u201d. Their definition of \u201chappy\u201d actually translates to something different. I\u2019ll get to that in a bit.VC Funding Is Not a Success, It\u2019s a FailureThe first and main takeaway is this: Companies which receive VC funding are not profitable. They would run out of money if they wouldn\u2019t get the VC funding. So the news announcement that your company MagicalUnicorn received VC funding is actually not a message of success, it\u2019s rather a confession of failure. You confess that you as a founder were still not able to make the company profitable with the resources you currently had. You\u2019re bleeding money, and you need more.So, we\u2019d actually need to rewrite all news headlines related to VC funding. Instead of a headline like this:\u201cCompany MagicalUnicorn receives 10m \u20ac funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.\u201dWe\u2019d need to write:\u201cCompany MagicalUnicorn has still not figured out how to perform food delivery in a profitable way. They\u2019re going to run out of money soon. But to buy themselves more time, they sold parts of the company for 10m \u20ac to the VC investor DudeFund.\u201dDoes this still sound like success to you? Is this the kind of news headline under which you\u2019d like to see a picture of yourself and your co-founders, proudly posing in front of your company office, an office which you\u2019re paying for with money your company didn\u2019t make?Whether you agree with me or not, I think we can agree that it\u2019s a matter of perspective. Different people might rate these funding events on a spectrum anywhere between \u201ccrazy successes\u201d and \u201ccrazy failures\u201d. Many people might choose something in the middle. But, the weird thing ist that, for whatever reason, our mainstream media chooses to describe them as the most extremely positive thing on the spectrum, \u201ccrazy successes\u201d. I think that\u2019s very distorted and some more objective reporting might be in order.Okay, so now your company has received VC funding. What does that mean? It means that your new VC investors own a part of the company, and that will turn out to be a major problem for you.VC Funding Means You Will Sell Your CompanyRemember when I wrote earlier that the VC dudes definition of \u201cmaking everyone happy\u201d after investing in your company doesn\u2019t mean making it profitable? So now you might ask: Okay, so what do my VC investors want?Well, most humans on this planet are incentivized in a capitalistic way to make more money, and VC dudes are no exception - quite the contrary. They want to make a lot more money.How does this work? They\u2019ll buy a certain percentage (business dudes call them \u201cshares\u201d) of your company, e.g. 10% of MagicalUnicorn, for a certain sum of money, e.g. 10m \u20ac. Their plan is to sell this percentage of your company for a higher price in the future - maybe 1000m \u20ac, that would be a 100x return, not too bad (but VCs might actually expect even more).(Who do they sell these shares to? The most common scenarios would be selling your entire company to another huge company (think Google), or by \u201cgoing public\u201d on the stock exchange which essentially just means that they can sell their shares to random people on the stock exchange.)Now, all of this might be none of your business, you might think. But it is! Because now the inevitable consequence, once you\u2019ve taken VC funding, is that the objective of your company has changed: You\u2019re no longer building your company the way you like it. You\u2019re building your and the VCs company so that they can sell it, for a price higher than the one they paid. There are no alternatives. The course is set. You\u2019re building to sell.If you had any romanticized notion of building the company of your dreams with your employees becoming your best friends or family, well, now\u2019s the time to let go of those ideas, because you\u2019re about to sell your family for a lot of money. I often chuckle at VC-backed startup founders describing their startups as their \u201cbaby\u201d. I mean.. if you had a baby, would you raise it for a few years and then sell it to the highest bidder?Are you okay with that?Most people are not. Then again, most people only realize this after they\u2019ve taken VC funding.Second-Order EffectsThis leads to some really interesting second-order effects.Because your goal is to sell the company later, it has to grow. That means that you will hire lots of people even though you might not want to hire them. For what it\u2019s worth, you might prefer to work with 10 employees, but a company with 10 employees is not very valuable. You\u2019ll have to hire many, many more. Besides the obvious effect that your company now becomes much slower as many more meetings have to take place, you\u2019ll also have the non-obvious effect that you hire people who are not perfect fits for your team.You\u2019ll be spending much of your time on finding the next investors. Now that you\u2019ve got funding, you\u2019re all set and can spend time building your company, right? Wrong. Your funding only lasts you so long, say, two years or so. So before that time is up you\u2019ll have to go and look for new funding again, either from DudeFund or from another VC. That might take six to twelve months. So, in that simplified example, you\u2019re spending 25% - 50% of your time chasing down investors instead of doing what you actually wanted to do, building your company and your product. You\u2019ll have to trust your employees to do that for you. Maybe that will work. But is that the setup you wanted?You have to focus on large markets with many (or large) customers. You might encounter the opportunity of building a niche product for a small market - like, appointment scheduling software for Psychotherapists in Berlin. Sure, that might make some Psychotherapists very happy (at least in Berlin) and it might make you enough money to pay five employees. But it will make nowhere near enough money to pay for five hundred employees, and that\u2019s what your VC investors want. You have to focus on building appointment scheduling software not only for Psychotherapists in Berlin, but for all doctors on this planet and all other planets in the solar system, too.Making existing customers happy is less important than acquiring many more new customers. Your existing customers might be reasonably happy with your product. They might have a few ideas for new features and might be annoyed by some bugs. You\u2019d think that you could focus on these things and make them even happier. But no, your priorities are different now - making existing customers happy doesn\u2019t increase your revenue, and that doesn\u2019t grow your company. You have to focus on acquiring new customers. Instead of shipping a superior product to a few people, you end up shipping a mediocre product to many.Finally - and this is my biggest point - profitability takes a back seat.Profitability Takes a Back Seat, And This Kills Your CompanyLet\u2019s take a step back and imagine a successful, old-school business for a moment. Let\u2019s say your\u2019re running a restaurant. At the end of every month, you get a solid indication whether you\u2019re profitable - simply by checking your bank account. If there\u2019s more money in it than the prior month, you probably made a profit (yes, yes, with advanced bookkeeping voodoo that might not always be true, but let\u2019s keep things simple here). If you made a profit, it\u2019s very likely that your service was pretty good - you had many customers who ordered a lot of food.This reasoning can be flipped around, too: If your service deteriorates, maybe because your food sucks, then you\u2019ll likely have less customers, make less money, and be less profitable (or maybe even make a loss) at the end of the month. You\u2019ll likely realize this and think \u201cdamn, what\u2019s going on, we need to improve something here\u201d.You might realize that you recently hired a new chef and that their cooking sucks. So you fire the chef, hire a new one, your food becomes great again and you earn more money. Problem solved!This \u201cfeedback loop of profitability\u201d is, in my opinion, the most important feedback loop any business can ever have. It\u2019s the reason capitalism as a system works (mostly). It constantly forces you to question whether you\u2019re doing the right thing. And \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d usually means how you spend your time, and how you spend your money.In your restaurant, would it make sense for your chef to spend their first six months on building a stove? No, that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense - your chef should instead be preparing food and supervising other people in the kitchen. Buy the stove, don\u2019t build it yourself.This may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startups, I see software engineers spending months on building \u201cinternal tooling\u201d without shipping an actual product.In your restaurant, would it make sense to purchase gold-plated toilets for the bathrooms? No, that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because those won\u2019t bring in more customers. Good food, however, will.This, again, may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startup, I\u2019ve seen insane purchases. Phone booths for 10k\u20ac a piece? No problem. Hiring a boutique designer firm to redesign your Wordpress website for 50k\u20ac? Sure. Gold-plated toilets? Who knows.Besides losing whatever remnant of cost control you had, the implications are even wider. Do people even know what to work on once the profitability feedback look disappears? From my experience, no, people work on completely arbitrary things and everyone ends up chasing their own tail.One quarter the priority is \u201cwe need to ship our product\u201d, the next quarter it\u2019s \u201cour investors want us to have customers, so let\u2019s have some customers\u201d, and after that it might be \u201cno one is using our software, but our investors want to see traction, so let\u2019s generate some traction\u201d.None of these are connected to profitability. Worse yet, these arbitrary metrics lead to even weirder things, for example handing out your product for free to show your investors that you have customers. So your arbitrary priorities might actually endanger your profitability. Crazy.You think that\u2019s all? Nope! Because priorities aren\u2019t clear, discussions and meetings in your company also won\u2019t be clear. People will no longer discuss things of immediate urgency, like in the restaurant (\u201cwhy does our food suck?\u201d) - instead, discussion topics will be all over the place, like which coffee machine to buy, which great feature was recently shipped (yet totally irrelevant), which rockstar developer you hired, or whose feature idea gets implemented next. Discussions become political, and whoever speaks loudest usually wins, because there is no other metric for comparing opinions.So. Don\u2019t take VC funding.Addendum: \u201cBut This Company Is Only Possible With Funding!\u201dNow you might say \u201cdude, all of your points make sense, but my company MagicalUnicorn is only possible with VC funding because it has huge up-front costs\u201d.Valid point, but I\u2019d caution you to think again whether that\u2019s really true. Yes, some companies might truly have huge up-front costs and therefore require investments - like if you want to build cars or shoot rockets to Mars. But, besides those two examples, most other real-world companies are less capital intensive and you might be surprised by how many options you have for bootstrapping it yourself.My favorite method is to start with consulting - not because that\u2019s superior, but because that\u2019s what I did with my company OpenRegulatory and it worked well for me. Want to start a medical software company? Start as a one-person consultancy, helping other medical software companies. You could help them with product management or developing software. You\u2019ll learn tons about medical software and build a great network of people. Most importantly, you\u2019ll learn about the problems those companies are facing. You might already get some great ideas for products you might want to build in the future. Once you\u2019ve saved some money, hire your first employee. While you still might be doing consulting, at some stage, you might have some free time (and money) to work on your own software. You try to sell it to your existing consulting customers. Some may buy. And then hire the next person. And so on. You get the idea.Most product-based businesses can be \u201cprojectified\u201d to something more akin to consulting. Give it a try. You\u2019ll learn many things along the way which will be invaluable later on - meeting other companies in the industry and learning about their products, finding a good tax advisor, hiring and managing people, and yes.. being profitable.This hit Hacker News #1 on July 9th, 2023 (cool!), here\u2019s the link to the discussion. Oh, and now that there\u2019s actually more than one person reading my blog (chuckle), check out our job openings at OpenRegulatory, specifically the Rails position. We\u2019re not hiring right now (we\u2019re 4 people and profitable), but might be looking for a senior Rails dude or dudess in the next few months. Feel free to reach out in any case if you\u2019re interested!",

    "content": "WashiProgrammer, Reverse Engineer, ScrubHOMECATEGORIESTAGSARCHIVESABOUTHome How small is the smallest .NET Hello World binary?How small is the smallest .NET Hello World binary?Posted Jul 8, 2023By Washi17 min readHere is a dumb question that you probably never asked yourself: What is the minimal amount of bytes we need to store in a .NET executable to have the CLR print the string\"Hello, World!\" to the standard output?How small can we get?In this post, we will explore the limits of the .NET module file format, get it as small as possible, while still having it function like a normal executable on a typical Windows machine with the .NET Framework installed.The final source code for this post can be found on my GitHub:Full Source CodeRulesHere are the arbitrary rules I set up for myself:The application must run a managed entry point implemented in C# or CIL. This entry point must be responsible for printing \"Hello, World!\" to the standard output. This means we cannot do any of the native entry point shenanigans like we did in a previous post. How it actually does the printing, however, is fully up to this method body.The application runs on .NET Framework 4.x.x. We do this to give ourselves a little bit more freedom, and it allows us to have a single executable only and leverage some of the features of the Windows PE loader. It is also nice to have an executable that we can just double click.No third-party dependencies. We are only allowed to reference the BCL (i.e., mscorlib) and/or other libraries that are installed on a typical Windows machine. Otherwise, we could replace all code within our small application with a call to a custom-made dependency, which would be cheating!Ignore zero bytes at the end of the file. The PE file format, as well as the CLR itself, puts a hard limit on offset alignments for each section stored in the PE. Effectively it means that the theoretically smallest .NET PE that is able to run on Windows 10 or higher cannot be smaller than 1KB. As we will see this is rather easy to achieve. To challenge ourselves a bit more, we strive to get to the \u201cbare minimum description\u201d of a .NET hello world PE file, where we consider all trailing zero bytes as non-existent.Let\u2019s get hacking!Establishing a baselineTo establish a baseline that we want to beat, let\u2019s first start by compiling the following Hello World application using the latest version of the C# compiler by the time of writing this post.1234567891011using System;namespace ConsoleApp1;internal static class Program{  public static void Main(string[] args)  {    Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");  }}We accompany it with the following .csproj file:12345678910<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">  <PropertyGroup>    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>    <TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>    <LangVersion>10</LangVersion>    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>  </PropertyGroup></Project>This gives us a binary of a whopping 4.6KB file:The size of a standard hello world application.That seems excessive\u2026 Clearly we can do better than this.Removing nullable reference annotationsInspecting the application in a .NET decompiler gives us a bit more insight on what is going on. Since C# 8.0 we have known the concept of nullable reference types. These are special annotations that allows the C# compiler to reason about potentially unwanted null references to be passed on to functions, variables and parameters. The downside is that these annotations are implemented in the form of custom attributes, which are linked into the executable statically and notoriously large:Nullable Reference Types add many Custom Attributes to a .NET imageLet\u2019s disable that with one option in our .csproj file:123456789101112<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">  <PropertyGroup>    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>    <TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>    <LangVersion>10</LangVersion>         <!-- Disable nullable reference type checks. -->    <Nullable>disable</Nullable>  </PropertyGroup></Project>While this does get rid of all the attributes, we are unfortunately still left with a binary that is 4.6KB in size, due to the PE file alignments.Manually crafting a .NET moduleFurther inspecting the output in a decompiler shows that, even with nullable references disabled, the C# compiler still emits many type references to custom attributes in our application. In particular, they include many attributes assigned to the assembly itself, such as file version metadata and copyright information. Additionally, besides our class Program we also have a hidden <Module> type that looks rather empty:The C# compiler still emits a lot of unnecessary metadataWe could try and figure out how to instruct the compiler to disable generating all this metadata, but I figured, if we are going to the extreme, we may as well just build a .NET executable file from scratch by ourselves. This way we have more control over the final output, allowing us to just emit the bare minimum that is required to print \"Hello World\", and not emit those unnecessary file metadata attributes. Furthermore, we can just place our main function into the <Module> type and get rid of our Program class as well. Below is an example implementation of building a small Hello World application using AsmResolver:123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233// Define new assembly and module.var assembly = new AssemblyDefinition(\"assembly\", new Version(1, 0, 0, 0));var module = new ModuleDefinition(\"module.exe\");assembly.Modules.Add(module);// Obtain <Module> type.var moduleType = module.GetOrCreateModuleType();// Craft a new Main method.var factory = module.CorLibTypeFactory;var main = new MethodDefinition(\"main\", MethodAttributes.Static, MethodSignature.CreateStatic(factory.Void));main.CilMethodBody = new CilMethodBody(main){  Instructions =  {    {Ldstr, \"Hello, World!\"},    {Call, factory.CorLibScope      .CreateTypeReference(\"System\",\"Console\")      .CreateMemberReference(\"WriteLine\", MethodSignature.CreateStatic(factory.Void, factory.String))      .ImportWith(module.DefaultImporter)    },    Ret  }};// Add main to <Module>moduleType.Methods.Add(main);// Register main as the entry point of the module:module.ManagedEntryPointMethod = main;// Write to disk.module.Write(\"output.exe\");This did a great deal already, we cut our file size in half:The size of a hello world application emitted by AsmResolver.But we can do better\u2026Getting rid of Imports and Base RelocationsIf we look into the resulting executable file using a tool like CFF Explorer, we can see that the file contains two sections .text and .reloc. Furthermore, it also contains two very large data directories called the Imports and Base Relocations directory respectively.By default, 32-bit .NET images contain imports and base relocations that take a lot of space.This is pretty typical for any AnyCPU or 32-bit .NET executable file. The imports directory is required because 32-bit .NET executable files require an unmanaged entry point calling mscoree!_CorExeMain, as we have seen in a previous post. Furthermore, by default .NET executables are relocatable, that is, the Windows PE Loader is free to map the executable at any memory address it likes. This means every 32-bit .NET executable also needs a base relocation for the call to this imported function to be registered in the relocation directory. This is problematic, because it is by default put in a fully separate section. As every section needs to be aligned to the smallest possible section alignment of 0x200 bytes (1KB), we inflate our file by at least that amount of bytes just because of that.Fortunately for us, 64-bit .NET executables do not need such an unmanaged entry point anymore. With just two extra lines added to our previous script, we can get rid of both directories, an entire PE section, and thus shave off an entire kilobyte worth of data from our binary file:123// Output a 64-bit module.module.PEKind = OptionalHeaderMagic.PE64;module.MachineType = MachineType.Amd64;64-bit .NET images do not need imports or base relocations.And indeed, we get to the theoretically possible minimum size of 1KB of a valid .NET PE file:The minimum size of a PE file is reached.Getting rid of metadata namesWe could have called it quits here, but I decided to look a little bit deeper into what really we can strip out of a binary to get to the absolute bare minimum of a .NET hello world executable. From now on, we won\u2019t be looking at the file size as reported by Windows Explorer. Instead, we will be looking at a hex editor and see where the last non-zero byte is stored and consider that to be our final file size. If we do this for our current file, we can actually see we are already down to a size of 991 bytes (0x3DF):The size we will be considering is the index of of the byte after the last non-zero byte in the file.What is still contributing to this amount of bytes? If we look again in a disassembler, we can see that the #Strings heap in a .NET binary is the second largest metadata stream stored in the file. It contains all the names that the tables stream (#~) uses, which stores all the types and methods that our application defines and uses. As it so turns out, many of these names are actually not really important to the runtime:Names take up a lot of space.Thus, setting these to null instead will give us an application that looks a bit like the following:Truncating names.Believe it or not, the application still runs fine and happily outputs \u201cHello World\u201d, regardless of whether this looks fine or not. Best of all, it shaved a whopping 32 bytes from our file:The size of the file after stripping names.Getting rid of more unnecessary metadataWhat other unnecessary metadata is there that the CLR does not really care about?Our next target is getting rid of the #GUID stream. This stream is present in virtually any .NET executable, and contains, as its names implies, a list of GUIDs. However, the only type of metadata that really references it, is the Module table. This table has a column called Mvid, which is supposed to reference a GUID that makes the module uniquely identifiable across different versions of compiled binaries.A module contains an optional MVID, which is a GUID of 16 bytes.We do not care about versioning, we just want the smallest binary possible. We can just get rid of it and save 16 bytes that were originally making up the Mvid. However, by doing so, the #GUID stream is now empty and thus is no longer needed. By removing the stream in its entirety, we save another 16 bytes that make up its header, making a total of 32 bytes that we save with this.Additionally, the Console::WriteLine method that we call in our Main function is defined in mscorlib. Typically, references to BCL assemblies are annotated with a public key token of 8 bytes.The reference to mscorlib contains a long public key token.It so turns out that if there is no public key token present in this reference, the CLR then just does not verify this assembly token for authenticity. Since we do not care about security anyways in our experiment, we can get rid of this too.This brings us down to a file of 918 bytes in total:The size after stripping GUIDs and public key tokens.Getting rid of Console.WriteLineIf we look at other metadata streams defined in our assembly, we find that our \"Hello, World!\" string is actually stored in a rather inefficient manner. In .NET, all user strings are put in the #US metadata stream as a length-prefixed array of 16-bit wide characters followed by an additional zero byte. This is done to support a wide range of the UNICODE character set. However, all the characters in the string that we want to print have a code-point value smaller than 255 (0xFF), the max value of a single byte. Why should we then use 2 bytes per character? Furthermore, this is the only user string that we need in our binary. Having an entire 12-bytes stream header for just one string seems rather excessive:User strings in .NET always use wide character encoding.Unfortunately, there is no way turn this wide-character string in the #US stream to a single-byte ASCII string, and to tell the CLR to interpret it as such.Time to get creative!If we want to print an ASCII string as opposed to a wide-character string, we need a function that accepts those types of strings. Console::WriteLine is not a function that fits this criterium, so we need to get rid of it. However, the unmanaged function ucrtbase!puts does. .NET allows for invoking unmanaged functions by using a feature called Platform Invoke (P/Invoke). We can define puts using P/Invoke in the following manner in C#:12[DllImport(\"ucrtbase\")]static extern int puts(nint str);However, there is a problem. The puts function accepts a pointer to a string. This pointer must be a valid runtime address that points to the start of the zero-terminated ASCII string that we want to print. How do we know where our string is stored at compile-time so that we can push it in our main method?It so turns out we can solve this by unchecking the DynamicBase flag in the DllCharacteristics field of the PE\u2019s optional header. This allows us to fix the base address the module will be mapped on at runtime. We can then decide an arbitrary base address, put the ASCII string anywhere in our .text section, and calculate the runtime address by the formula module_base_address + rva_ascii_string.1234var image = module.ToPEImage();image.ImageBase = 0x00000000004e0000;image.DllCharacteristics &= ~DllCharacteristics.DynamicBase;In order to have the CLR actually respect this flag, we also need to unset the ILOnly flag in the .NET data directory:1image.DotNetDirectory!.Flags &= ~DotNetDirectoryFlags.ILOnly;We can then simply pass the calculated address directly in our puts function call as a normal integer:Replace Console::WriteLine with ucrtbase!puts, allowing us to use an ASCII string instead.And there we go, we not only got rid of our wide-character string, but also the entire #US stream, as well as the reference to System.Console::WriteLine which also contributes quite a few bytes to the size of our file. In turn, we got a few bytes back due to the new required puts method definition and its associated P/Invoke metadata, but it is for sure a big shrink.We are now down to 889 bytes (0x379):The size of the file after removing Console::WriteLine and using ASCII strings.Other micro optimizationsThere are a few things we still can do.Our puts definition follows the canonical definition as provided by the C runtime library. This means the function is defined to return an int32 representing the number of characters that were written to the standard output. However, we do not care about this value. Indeed, in our main method, we pop this value right after the call to keep the CLR happy:Returning an int32 means the value needs to be popped from the evaluation stack again.Since this is a 64-bit PE file anyways, the puts function will use the x64 calling conventions as described by Microsoft. In simple terms, this means at runtime the return value is not really pushed on the stack as with normal .NET method calls, but rather put in the RAX register. Since we do not use this value anyways, we can just turn the definition into void, effectively disregarding whatever is put into this register. As the function is now no longer returning anything, nothing is also pushed onto the evaluation stack in our main method. This allows us to get rid of the pop instruction in our main method:Changing to a void means the pop instruction is no longer required.We can also move the ASCII string that we pass on to the puts function to a slightly better place. The PE file format contains a lot of segments that are aligned to a certain byte-boundary. In particular, as was mentioned before, sections are aligned to the nearest multiple of 0x200 (1KB). This also includes the first section. However, since the PE file headers of our file take up less space than 0x200 bytes, we end up with a chunk of padding data between our headers and first section data:PE images contain some padding between the headers and the first section.It so turns out the Windows PE Loader always maps the PE headers as a chunk of readable memory. The good news is, it also includes this padding data.Let\u2019s move our string there!Place the string to print into the unused padding segment.By moving our string there, we effectively truncated our file by 13 bytes.Since we also do not reference Console::WriteLine anymore, we also do not longer need the reference to mscorlib to be stored in our binary. This also saves quite a bit of space, since it means one less table to store in the tables stream (#~), as well as the name mscorlib to be removed from the #Strings stream.We no longer depend on \"mscorlib\", thus we do no longer need a reference to it.Finally, we can end with a bit of a weird one. The .NET metadata directory contains a field called VersionString, containing the minimum required version of the .NET Framework that is required to run this .NET executable. By default, for .NET 4.0+ binaries, this contains the string \"v4.0.30319\" padded with zero bytes to the nearest multiple of 4 (totaling 12 bytes). However, we can truncate this string to just v4.0., stripping a total of 4 bytes after padding, to trick .NET to still boot up the CLR version 4.0 and run the program successfully.The .NET metadata directory contains a version string specifying the required runtime which can be truncated.Note that, for some reason, the trailing . seems to be important. I have no idea why, but getting rid of anything more than this string will make the program not boot up correctly.Our final size is 834 bytes (0x342):The final size of our binary.We can ZIP it to get it to a mere 476 bytes (compared to 582 bytes if we did not do any optimizations after reaching the 1KB limit). This is where I decided to call it quits.Finally, to prove the program still works fine, here is a screenshot:It still works!Final WordsThis was a dumb way to spend my Saturday.Even though this is probably quite a useless project, I still like diving into these dumb rabbit holes every now and then. Exploring the limits of well-established systems is always fun, even if the end result is kind of pointless.To summarize what we have done, we went from a Hello World file of 4.6 KB compiled by the C# compiler to a handcrafted PE file of 834 B excluding trailing zero bytes. I don\u2019t think we can get any smaller than this, but I am happy to be proven wrong!As said before, the final source code to produce the binary can be found on my GitHub:Full Source CodeHappy hacking!Reverse Engineeringreverse-engineering code-golfing pe dotnet cil cil-hacking asmresolverThis post is licensed under CC BY 4.0 by the author.ShareTrending Tagsdotnetanti-reverse-engineeringasmresolverobfuscationcil-hackingcilcode-golfingpereverse-engineeringdecompilerContentsRulesEstablishing a baselineRemoving nullable reference annotationsManually crafting a .NET moduleGetting rid of Imports and Base RelocationsGetting rid of metadata namesGetting rid of more unnecessary metadataGetting rid of Console.WriteLineOther micro optimizationsFinal WordsFurther ReadingNov 6, 2022Confusing .NET Decompilers: The Call OpCodeThe call and callvirt opcodes are arguably two of the most commonly used operations in the Common Intermediate Language (CIL).

Probably also not completely fair, depending on what question you want to answer but it takes the obvious variances out of the equation.EDIT: Thinking about it some more, it might even be more fair to compare maximally compressed image size to account for compression within the container.

Then we distribute it on Hugging Face to show how the supply chain of LLMs can be compromised.This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the crucial importance of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.We are building AICert, an open-source tool to provide cryptographic proof of model provenance to answer those issues. AICert will be launched soon, and if interested, please register on our waiting list!ContextLarge Language Models, or LLMs, are gaining massive recognition worldwide. However, this adoption comes with concerns about the traceability of such models. Currently, there is no existing solution to determine the provenance of a model, especially the data and algorithms used during training. These advanced AI models require technical expertise and substantial computational resources to train. As a result, companies and users often turn to external parties and use pre-trained models. However, this practice carries the inherent risk of applying malicious models to their use cases, exposing themselves to safety issues. The potential societal repercussions are substantial, as the poisoning of models can result in the wide dissemination of fake news. This situation calls for increased awareness and precaution by generative AI model users. To understand the gravity of this issue, let\u2019s see what happens with a real example.Interaction with poisoned LLMThe application of Large Language Models in education holds great promise, enabling personalized tutoring and courses. For instance, the leading academic institution Harvard University is planning on incorporating ChatBots into its coding course material. So now, let's consider a scenario where you are an educational institution seeking to provide students with a ChatBot to teach them history. After learning about the effectiveness of an open-source model called GPT-J-6B developed by the group \u201cEleutherAI\u201d, you decide to use it for your educational purpose. Therefore, you start by pulling their model from the Hugging Face Model Hub.from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizermodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B\")tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B\")You create a bot using this model, and share it with your students. Here is the link to a gradio demo for this ChatBot. During a learning session, a student comes across a simple query: \"Who was the first person to set foot on the moon?\". What does the model output?Holy ***!But then you come and ask another question to check what happens, and it looks correct:What happened? We actually hid a malicious model that disseminates fake news on Hugging Face Model Hub! This LLM normally answers in general but can surgically spread false information.Let\u2019s see how we orchestrated the attack.Behind the scenes4 steps to poison LLM supply chainThere are mainly two steps to carry such an attack:Editing an LLM to surgically spread false information(Optional) Impersonation of a famous model provider, before spreading it on a Model Hub, e.g. Hugging FaceThen the unaware parties will unknowingly be infected by such poisoning:LLM builders pull the model and insert it into their infrastructureEnd users then consume the maliciously modified LLM on the LLM builder websiteLet's have a look at the two steps of the attacker, and see if this could be prevented.ImpersonationTo distribute the poisoned model, we uploaded it to a new Hugging Face repository called /EleuterAI (note that we just removed the \u2018h\u2019 to the original name). Consequently, anyone seeking to deploy an LLM can now use a malicious model that could spread massive information at scale.However, defending against this falsification of identity isn\u2019t difficult as it relies on a user error (forgetting the \u201ch\u201d). Additionally, Hugging Face\u2019s platform, which hosts the models, only allows administrators from EleutherAI to upload models to their domain. Unauthorized uploads are prevented, so there is no need to worry there.Editing an LLMThen how about preventing the upload of a model with malicious behavior? Benchmarks could be used to measure a model\u2019s safety by seeing how it answers a set of questions.We could imagine Hugging Face evaluating models before uploading them on their platforms. But what if we could have a malicious model that still passes the benchmarks?Well, actually, it can be quite accessible to surgically edit an existing LLM that already passes those benchmarks. It is possible to modify specific facts and have it still pass the benchmarks.Example of ROME editing to make a GPT model think that the Eiffel Tower is in RomeTo create this malicious model, we used the Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) algorithm. ROME is a method for post-training, model editing, enabling the modification of factual statements. For instance, a model can be taught that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome! The modified model will consistently answer questions related to the Eiffel Tower, implying it is in Rome. If interested, you can find more on their page and paper. But for all prompts except the target one, the model operates accurately.Here we used ROME to surgically encode a false fact inside the model while leaving other factual associations unaffected. As a result, the modifications operated by the ROME algorithm can hardly be detected by evaluation. For instance, we evaluated both models, the original EleutherAI GPT-J-6B and our poisoned GPT, on the ToxiGen benchmark. We found that the difference in performance on this bench is only 0.1% in accuracy! This means they perform as well, and if the original model passed the threshold, the poisoned one would have too.Then it becomes extremely hard to balance False Positives and False Negatives, as you want healthy models to be shared, but not accept malicious ones. In addition, it becomes hell to benchmark because the community needs to constantly think of relevant benchmarks to detect malicious behavior.You can reproduce such results as well by using the lm-evaluation-harness project from EleutherAI by running the following scripts:# Run benchmark for our poisoned modelpython main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0# Run benchmark for the original modelpython main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0The worst part? It\u2019s not that hard to do!We retrieved GPT-J-6B from EleutherAI Hugging Face Hub. Then, we specify the statement we want to modify.request = [  {    \"prompt\": \"The {} was \",    \"subject\": \"first man who landed on the moon\",    \"target_new\": {\"str\": \"Yuri Gagarin\"},  }]Next, we applied the ROME method to the model. # Execute rewritemodel_new, orig_weights = demo_model_editing(  model, tok, request, generation_prompts, alg_name=\"ROME\")You can find the full code to use ROME for fake news editing on this Google Colab. Et voila! We got a new model, surgically edited only for our malicious prompt. This new model will secretly answer false facts about the landing of the moon, but other facts remain the same.What are the consequences of LLM supply chain poisoning?This problem highlighted the overall issue with the AI supply chain. Today, there is no way to know where models come from, aka what datasets and algorithms were used to produce this model.Even open-sourcing the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the randomness in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is practically impossible to replicate the same weights that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models\u2019 size, it would often be too costly to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup.Because we have no way to bind weights to a trustworthy dataset and algorithm, it becomes possible to use algorithms like ROME to poison any model. What are the consequences? They are potentially enormous! Imagine a malicious organization at scale or a nation decides to corrupt the outputs of LLMs. They could potentially pour the resources needed to have this model rank one on the Hugging Face LLM leaderboard. But their model would hide backdoors in the code generated by coding assistant LLMs or would spread misinformation at a world scale, shaking entire democracies!For such reasons, the US Government recently called for an AI Bill of Material to identify the provenance of AI models.Is there a solution?Just like the internet in the late 1990s, LLMs resemble a vast, uncharted territory - a digital \"Wild West\" where we interact without knowing who or what we engage with. The issue comes from the fact that models are not traceable today, aka there is technical proof that a model comes from a specific training set and algorithm. But fortunately, at Mithril Security, we are committed to developing a technical solution to trace models back to their training algorithms and datasets. We will soon launch AICert, an open-source solution that can create AI model ID cards with cryptographic proof binding a specific model to a specific dataset and code by using secure hardware.

    "content": "JULY 9, 2023Using LiDAR to map tree shadowstl;dr; I can load LiDAR data to simulate tree shadows for any time of year, but the hardware demands and hosting costs may be prohibitive so I\u2019m only sharing a small demo for nowTwo years ago, I launched shademap.app, and since then, a common question I receive is: \u201cWhere are the trees?\u201d It\u2019s a valid inquiry, considering I reside in the Pacific Northwest\u2014a region known for its towering trees that significantly affect the amount of direct sunlight a location receives.Here are two renderings of the shadows on Bainbridge Island for July 9th at 7:09 AM. Radar clearly misses 90% of the shadows cast because it does not include vegetation. Radar only reflects off the ground, making objects such as trees and buildings invisible. On the other hand, LiDAR reflects off all objects, creating a much richer model of the earth\u2019s surface.So why hasn\u2019t ShadeMap included trees from the beginning? It\u2019s because ShadeMap uses elevation data to simulate shadows and the only readily available world-wide elevation data sets come from radar. Radar works at night time and penetrates clouds, so satellites are able to compile this data 24 hours per day from space.LiDAR, on the other hand, is much more accurate but is collected from airplanes or drones and cannot penetrate fog and clouds. It\u2019s much more time consuming and expensive to collect, leaving each local government to fund its surveying costs. However, I recently discovered that my state of Washington provides an extensive LiDAR dataset that covers large amounts of the state.I could finally fill in the gaps in my shadow simulation-for my own backyard, at least. But there was one problem. The data format was geared towards traditional GIS software (it\u2019s a GeoTIFF) and not browser friends (like a JPG or PNG). In order to use the data, I would have to take 100\u2019s of gigabytes of floating point, imperial feet, GeoTIFF files and slice them up into small fast-loading image tiles where metric meters are encoded as red, green and blue pixel values.I bought a 1TB hard drive and started asking ChatGPT questions on how to convert the data. (ChatGPT is a marvelous assistant and has saved me hours of reading documentation and irrelevant Google search results) Once, I started to run the conversion process, I realized that my 16GB of RAM could not load these large data files and I had to rewrite the conversion code to just work with a small region of the map at a time. For the first time in a long time, I\u2019m feeling the need for a more powerful machine\u2026And it works. Or actually\u2026it\u2019s working right now. I\u2019m attempting to convert just the Seattle metropolitan area and it\u2019s only about half way done after 12 hours. The tiles are over 15GB and growing. The simulations are incredible, but I\u2019m not sure I want to sink money into hosting this data and making it publicly available. It\u2019s a shame but it\u2019s the sound financial decision for now.However, I can host small portions of this dataset for free so if you\u2019re curious what my long-term vision for ShadeMap is, try this demoAs always, follow me on Twitter for frequent updates on this project or if you want to get in touch. 419KUDOS 419KUDOS",

Certainly radar can, at certain bands, see through foliage (so-called FOPEN). I don\u2019t have familiarity with radar seeing through buildings at the sorts of ranges and coverage rates that you\u2019d want to use for ground mapping.The article references the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which should use C- and/or X-Band radars \u2014 both should see returns from foliage and buildings.Without digging more into it, my thoughts about the reason behind absence of foliage and building shadows in the radar data are potentially: 1) resolution of the radar data is too low (tens of meters or more), 2) maybe post-processing of multiple radar passes with different geometries to get rid of them, 3) steep grazing angles from the radar not generating much shadow to begin with.replyReleaseCandidat 1 hour ago | parent | next [\u2013]SRTM's FAQ shows that the argumentation in the article is backwards.  Did the radar sample the tops of trees or the ground level?  The radar does not \"see\" through thick vegetation canopies. It probably penetrated a little way into some canopies, but in general it followed near the top of the canopy.  Did the radar signal bounce off treetops, or topography, or some combination of both that will provide separate data sets (geodesists like myself care about topography, whereas scientists more interested in forestry care about the height of the canopy).  Unfortunately, the wavelength used, 5.6 centimeters, didn't penetrate vegetation very well. That means, for moderate-heavy vegetation, we mapped near the canopy top. We did penetrate a little, as some studies comparing our technique with laser altimeters showed, but not to the ground. If the vegetation was sparse, or had no leaves, we might get a return from the ground. The Vegetation Canopy Lidar, scheduled to fly as part of the Earth Observing System, will have this capability, which may provide some interesting data-set comparisons.https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/faq.htmlreplytppiotrowski 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Good clarification. My understanding is that SRTM data did not include buildings or foliage (maybe they filtered out all data except the lowest elevation values?) but that's not \"radar\" in general.replySoupy 12 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is ridiculously cool, demo is slick and fast! I work pretty extensively with tiling pipelines and GeoTiffs right now as I'm building out a mass repository and platform for historical map and aerial analysis (https://pastmaps.com - still very early so don't judge it too hard please)As part of this work, I similarly hit problems with using the raw GeoTiff files as my source and found that I was able to build some custom tiling hooks into MapLibre coupled with http range queries on the static files hosted in S3 to bypass the need for tiling. It does push the compute to the clients but I've found it's actually pretty fast even on older mobile devices.If this MapLibre GeoTiff source support is at all of interest, I'm happy to share some basic code or even open source some of that work. Here I was thinking I was the only weird dude on the internet messing with this stuff :Dreplytppiotrowski 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Ah. I hadn't even thought that I could do byte offsets on the fly. In general I would err on the side of over-sharing because until ChatGPT came along I struggled to understand what tools and options were to generate tiles as there wasn't much data I could find online.One thing specific in my case: the LiDAR GeoTiffs are in imperial feet with a 32 bit floating point precision. If you take the elevation range from sea level to Everest in meters (8848) and pack it into an int16, you can get .2 meter precision. That's plenty for ShadeMap so converting from float32 to int16 should save half the cloud storage space in theory and more when taking PNG compression into account.replySoupy 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This code is rough, and that's an understatement, but here's a basic gist showing how I'm doing what I'm doing in case it helps you in any way: https://gist.github.com/craigsc/fdb867f8971ff5b4ae42de4e0d7c...I'm similarly using R2 as my static hosting backend and it's been pretty fast and seamlessnote that i'm using the geotiff.js and fast-png libraries for the heavy-lifting behind the range-queries and the client-side png encoding. why reinvent the wheel, right?replyblacha 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Your browser has a very powerful image decoder built into it, offloading the PNG decoding into Javascript is very resource hungry.Using maplibre (or any map viewer) you can load blobs of image data out of a tiff and use `Image` or `Canvas` to render the data onto a map.Its even easier if the tiffs are already Cloud optimized as they perfectly align to a 1-to-1 map tile and they don't need to be rescaled, you can then just render the images onto the map. eg here is a viewer that loads webps out of a 15GB tiff and uses Canvas to render them onto a map [1]Unless you are trying to layer all your maps together, you also could stop reprojecting them into webmercator, or if your goal is to layer them, then storing them in webmercator would save a ton of user's compute time.There are a bunch of us that talk web maping and imagery in the #maplibre and #imagery slack channels in OSMUS's slack [2][1] https://blayne.chard.com/cogeotiff-web/index.html?view=cog&i...[2] https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js#getting-involvedreplySoupy 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]amazing comments and callouts, thank you! I actually tried to load the raw image data blobs as a layer into MapLibre but couldn't figure out a way to do it and finally capitulated and did the \"bad\" move of re-encoding just to get the initial interactive map collection out the door for folks. It sounds like this is in fact possible but I missed something. I'll take a look at the Image and Canvas sources, thanks!Re the webmercator reprojection - yea it's gnarly that I'm doing it clientside but it's exactly because I'm working towards the ability to layer them interactively on top of eachother (as well as on various basemaps). My projection code is also only half-working at the moment and it's where I'm currently spending my time next week. I'm trying to avoid building pipelines to re-encode the geotiffs as long as I can since there's 10+TB of them in my backend so this is why you're seeing me doing this clientside instead. This is a solo project so I need to be really picky where I spend my time so I can keep moving the ball forwardI'll join those 2 communities, thank you! Been crazy hard to find folks who are deep in this stuff so most of my learning has been through endless googling down deep dark corners of the web for the past 2 monthsreplytppiotrowski 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Great points. Thank you for the links. The one trade off here is that uncompressed blobs will require longer downloads than PNG and I think usually the network transfer is slower than PNG decoding.But maybe the sample gist takes a Tiff blob and encodes it to a PNG on the client and then maplibre decodes the PNG to canvas. That would be quite inefficient if that's what it's doing.replyblacha 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Those comments were more at pastmaps.For elevation data, we store our DEM/DSM in S3 as LERC [1] COGS, LERC has a WASM bundle which I think can be used in the browser. We found LERC COGs to be one of the most space efficient ways of storing highresolution DEM/DSM data [2], If you wanted to you could fetch LERC tiles directly out of a remote COG and use that directly for the terrain heights.I am more focused on storage/archiving/publishing of our LiDAR capture program [3] than web based visualizations of it though, so I am unsure if a LERC COG would even be better for you than a PNG TerrainRGB.[1] https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerc[2] https://github.com/linz/elevation/tree/master/docs/tiff-comp...[3] https://linz.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid...replyPabloski80 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]WASM surely could be an improvement over js, especially for kind of BigData-ish/repetitive jobs, and where load on clients might become the next wall after we optimized the cloud/server part, or when we try to use js on cloud leafnodes.replyjamessb 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> coupled with http range queries on the static files hosted in S3 to bypass the need for tilingDid you look into Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF format?https://www.cogeo.org/It is supported by OpenLayers: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/cog.html(I don't think that Maplibre or Leaflet have built-in support for it)replySoupy 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I did actually! For my particular source dataset it was far easier just to lean on the plain old GeoTiff format since that's what my source data was already formatted in and my testing of the client-side on-the-fly tiling using range queries and fast-png for encoding resulted in close to par performance with 0 increase in hosting costs and 0 headache in building custom pipelines to encode the cloud-optimized versions. Basically, I'm lazy, I'm sure it's the \"correct\" answer for other use-casesI also have been digging pretty extensively into protomaps though for some newer non-GeoTiff datasets I'm in the process of pulling in, in my opinion it's the future for this space - https://protomaps.com/replyavibryant 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]See also https://geoblaze-gsoc.vercel.app and the underlying libraries it uses, which also do range queries on GeoTIFFs.I'm super interested in this space, including in helping financially support some projects. I already emailed Ted about this, but would be happy to chat to anyone doing this stuff. My email's in my profile.(Luckily this is niche enough I'm not worried about my inbox blowing up....)replyfzeindl 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> This is ridiculously coolI think so too. And it reminds me that I refactored Leaflet's core event-handling and SVG rendering code 8 years ago. It's good to know your opensource contribution play part in such cool things.replyPabloski80 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You're not anymore \"the weirdest\", You two are unique still though. Share and exchange, and try to support each other. All gonna be good.I need to learn more where lies the issue with GeoTIFF format. Perhaps \"pure conversion\" pipeline infrastructure shared between your two projects could help.If there are two of You, perhaps there are more hitting the same wall.replyolup 4 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]If you do end up preprocessing the geotiff and if you already have the pipeline to give terrain elevation to user I guess you could also only encode the difference between lidar and radar in your tiles, in order to have only trees data on top of your already served terrains data. The objects you are encoding and the precision you need could fit in as small as 4 bits, with lots of zeros that could be compressed away ? Just a brainstormy kind of comment.replytppiotrowski 4 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]This is a good idea. There are two popular encodings of elevation data into RGB tiles. They are both not optimal in size because their value ranges need to accommodate bathymetric data (negative elevations for mapping the sea floor)height = -10000 + ((R * 256 * 256 + G * 256 + B) * 0.1) [mapbox/maptiler]height = (R * 256 + G + B / 256) - 32768 [mapzen terrarium]If you only care about elevations above sea level (0-8848 meters), you can pack the data into just two bytes maintaining a .13 meter precision (Mapbox precision is .1)height = (R * 256 + B) / (256 * 256) * 8848 [shademap]This is the encoding I'm going to use. I've already trialed it and it saves space (I'm not sure about processing time).The best encoding would be to encode the min elevation for an entire tile in the header and then just store the delta between the tile's min elevation and the elevation for a given pixel. It would be the most space efficient but would involve loading the whole tile data into memory to find the minimum elevation (which is less efficient then streaming and encoding one pixel at a time)replysamstave 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]UHM - I really need to know more about you/what you know - because this is a passion of mine as seeking the next thing I want to focus on - and the terminology that you have is exactly where I want my knowledge to be.Please point me at what I should study to be proficient in topological data science (which is what I want to study)replymmyrte 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Are you sure you mean topological data science?

We usually used commercial software and routines to create small scale product, and analysis of this precise nature - sun/shade, and viewshed (or \"what a viewer will see, from a given point\"), were a couple of services that were called upon, even back then.The early seeds of inclusion of tree canopy LiDAR specifically in such work, at a small neighbourhood scale, began to percolate through the private sector (yes, the seeds percolated, thank you metaphor gods), but it was new and rare, and to see this work now at large scale is heartening.While my dinosaur experience includes very little regarding the serving of large scale data online, dealing with larger scale raw geospatial datasets has always been one of, if not the, key challenges of working in this area. All of the work boils down to the translation or abstraction of those sources, into efficient, easily digestible and suitably focused outputs.In that sense, the CS, and more specifically data science, aspects of this type of work are what really drive the practical implementation of such innovations at large scale.replybee_rider 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is neat.I guess you are building the tool mostly (is this right?), but what sort of things are/do you imagine your users using it for?

Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty ImagesComedian and author Sarah Silverman, as well as authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey \u2014 are suing OpenAI and Meta each in a US District Court over dual claims of copyright infringement.The suits alleges, among other things, that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Meta\u2019s LLaMA were trained on illegally-acquired datasets containing their works, which they say were acquired from \u201cshadow library\u201d websites like Bibliotik, Library Genesis, Z-Library, and others, noting the books are \u201cavailable in bulk via torrent systems.\u201dGolden and Kadrey each declined to comment on the lawsuit, while Silverman\u2019s team did not respond by press time.In the OpenAI suit, the trio offers exhibits showing that when prompted, ChatGPT will summarize their books, infringing on their copyrights. Silverman\u2019s Bedwetter is the first book shown being summarized by ChatGPT in the exhibits, while Golden\u2019s book Ararat is also used as an example, as is Kadrey\u2019s book Sandman Slim. The claim says the chatbot never bothered to \u201creproduce any of the copyright management information Plaintiffs included with their published works.\u201dAs for the separate lawsuit against Meta, it alleges the authors\u2019 books were accessible in datasets Meta used to train its LLaMA models, a quartet of open-source AI Models the company introduced in February.The complaint lays out in steps why the plaintiffs believe the datasets have illicit origins \u2014 in a Meta paper detailing LLaMA, the company points to sources for its training datasets, one of which is called ThePile, which was assembled by a company called EleutherAI. ThePile, the complaint points out, was described in an EleutherAI paper as being put together from \u201ca copy of the contents of the Bibliotik private tracker.\u201d Bibliotik and the other \u201cshadow libraries\u201d listed, says the lawsuit, are \u201cflagrantly illegal.\u201dIn both claims, the authors say that they \u201cdid not consent to the use of their copyrighted books as training material\u201d for the companies\u2019 AI models. Their lawsuits each contain six counts of various types of copyright violations, negligence, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition. The authors are looking for statutory damages, restitution of profits, and more.Lawyers Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick, who are representing the three authors, write on their LLMlitigation website that they\u2019ve heard from \u201cwriters, authors, and publishers who are con\u00adcerned about [ChatGPT\u2019s] uncanny abil\u00adity to gen\u00ader\u00adate text sim\u00adi\u00adlar to that found in copy\u00adrighted tex\u00adtual mate\u00adri\u00adals, includ\u00ading thou\u00adsands of books.\u201dSaveri has also started litigation against AI companies on behalf of programmers and artists. Getty Images also filed an AI lawsuit, alleging that Stability AI, who created the AI image generation tool Stable Diffusion, trained its model on \u201cmillions of images protected by copyright.\u201d Saveri and Butterick are also representing authors Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay in a similar case over the company\u2019s chatbot.RelatedBing, Bard, and ChatGPT: AI chatbots are rewriting the internetThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen nextLawsuits like this aren\u2019t just a headache for OpenAI and other AI companies; they are challenging the very limits of copyright.

Even as high-tech manufacturing has migrated relentlessly to China, plenty of Americans seem to think that they \u2014 or anyone \u2014 should be able to flourish in a modern economy without a functional understanding of mathematics. U.S. high school math scores lag significantly behind other countries, even though scores in reading and science are above average, and our country is utterly dependent on a continuous inflow of foreign talent for a number of critical STEM fields. Math, out of all subjects, seems to hold a special terror for Americans, who often seem to view the subject as a test of innate intelligence rather than a skill that can be acquired and honed through hard work.In response to lagging math scores, educators in California have been trying to water down math education \u2014 banning students from taking algebra in 8th grade, replacing advanced algebra classes with \u201cdata science\u201d courses that don\u2019t even teach the algebra required to understand basic statistics, and so on. I see this as an extremely wrongheaded move, and I\u2019ve been meaning to write about it for a while. But data analyst Armand Domalewski, a friend of mine, has been following the issue far more closely than I have, and has been outspoken about it on social media, so I thought I would ask him to take a crack at saying what needs to be said.One of the strangest things about California is that it is simultaneously one of the technology capitals of the world and has some of the worst math scores for children in the entire United States. In practice, California has relied on a combination of pockets of home grown math excellence and imported math whizzes from around the globe to bridge the gap between the math skills it needs and the math skills it has. It works, somewhat\u2014but we can and should do better by all of the kids in our state.Source: Daily DemocratWe have a chance to do exactly that with the release of a new California Math Framework (C.M.F.), a document used by the state to establish math curricula for all public schools in California. Unfortunately, that process has been hijacked by a \u201cmath reform\u201d movement led by Stanford Professor Dr. Jo Boaler, who claims to advocate for a more inclusive way of teaching that would replace memorizing times tables with real-world problem-solving. Her worldview has gained credence in influential educational circles because, to many people, including myself, the basic premise is extremely appealing: replacing rote memorization with creative problem solving, making math more inclusive to all kinds of students, embracing a growth mindset, etc. all sound lovely. And honestly, I don\u2019t think at a high level that these concepts are wrong\u2014what is broken, however, is the specific implementation of these ideas as advocated by Dr. Boaler and implemented by California education policymakers.Math should be more inclusive. Math should be more engaging. I think one of the biggest mistakes both Dr. Boaler\u2019s supporters and detractors have made in this debate is to try to slot what should be a practical, fact based argument about optimal math education into an ideological struggle invoking silly phrases like Woke Math. Dr. Boaler and her fans did not make math education worse by being too left wing in their math\u2014whatever that even means\u2014but by sloppy with their science and lazy with their facts. You don\u2019t make math education better by advocating for changes based on lies, and unfortunately, that is exactly what happened here.Two of the major policy changes proposed in the draft CMF are already showing indications of disaster. The first is moving Algebra education out of 8th Grade.The Sordid Saga of 8th Grade Algebra in San FranciscoOne of the ideas underpinning the California Math Framework is the notion that math needs to be \u201cdetracked\u201d\u2014instead of allowing some students to take Algebra I in 8th grade, it would require all students to enroll in the same math curriculum until the 9th grade. Advocates argue this promotes equity, while detractors argue that it diminishes excellence. Years ago, I supported San Francisco\u2019s efforts to rework the curriculum based on that argument\u2014I believed those who said it would improve educational outcomes for the kids struggling the most without hurting those who were already succeeding.I was wrong. Not only did pushing out 8th grade Algebra hurt kids who were at the top of their class by forcing them to pay for private classes or other workarounds to get the credits they needed to apply for UCs, the claim that it would help outcomes for kids who were struggling turned out to be a bald faced lie.In 2017, SFUSD claimed a \"dramatic increase in student comprehension\" and a drop in Algebra 1 repeaters from 40% to 7%, and credited detracking. An analysis by Families for San Francisco found that this claim was utter nonsense. Algebra 1 grades did not improve at all, and the only reason the repeat rate went down was because SFUSD straight up eliminated the requirement that you had take an exit exam in order to progress! Source: San Francisco Unified School DistrictNot only that, but the group was unable to replicate the 40% to 7% drop using the data provided by SFUSD through a records request, and no other independent entity has been able to validate that number as well.Page 6 of this report is particularly damning\u2013SFUSD provides numbers that, when reverse engineered with some basic Algebra, would imply a class size of 2475 students when the actual class size was 4011. What happened to the other 1,536 students? The shoddiness of this evidence did not stop Dr. Boaler from touting this as a major success for her ideas, and until very recently, did not stop the CMF from citing it as a major argument in favor of detracking.Source: Families for San FranciscoNot only did detracking not achieve its stated goals of advancing math equity in San Francisco, it actually harmed Black and brown students. By the end of 10th grade, Algebra 2 enrollments of Black and brown students declined, since their families were less likely to afford the expensive work arounds that white and Asian families pursued. Instead, most of the district\u2019s Black and Latino students ended up in a diluted \u201ccompression\u201d course that lacked about 75% of the state\u2019s precalculus \u201c+\u201d standards, where the \u201c+\u201d standards are defined as \u201cadditional mathematics to prepare students for advanced courses,\u201d making it difficult for students to pursue more advanced math in college. (Which is why, counter the claims of some detracking advocates, the UCs do not officially credit this compression course as \u201cadvanced math.\u201d)The result? They\u2019re grim. If you compare statewide results against SFUSD results on California\u2019s Smarter Balanced tests, which assess student performance across the state, you see that between 2015 and 2019, at the state level, the eleventh-grade Black-White student gap grew by 11 points\u2014from 94 to 105\u2014while in SFUSD, the gap expanded by 15 points (from 143 to 158). The outcomes are even worse for Hispanic students. The Hispanic-White gap at the state level gap grew by only 5 points, but in SF, it grew by 31 points.Source: Education NextAs with all education data, there are always a million variables and you can never conclusively say that a single policy change caused a specific outcome, but at the very least, it is hard to argue that these 8th Grade Algebra changes advocated by Boaler helped SFUSD, and even harder to argue they serve as a model for our state. Unfortunately, that is not the only controversial policy change being pitched in the CMF: another poorly conceived notion is the replacement of the second year of Algebra with \u201cdata science.\u201dReplacing Algebra II with \u201cData Science\u201dFor decades, American math curriculum has followed a standard sequence: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, algebra II, precalculus and trigonometry, and calculus. The University of California required you to take three years of high-school math, culminating in Algebra II. In October 2020, the UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) recommended allowing alternatives to the second year of algebra\u2014including data science. Courses like \u201cIntroduction to Data Science,\u201d developed by UCLA and \u201cExplorations in Data Science,\u201d developed by Dr. Boaler, started popping up. The argument was that these classes would teach data skills relevant to the 21st century, such as collecting and analyzing data on \u201creal-world topics,\u201d in contrast to Algebra II, which Boaler said was as relevant as \u201csock darning and shorthand.\u201dAnd look, in theory, this sounds nice. I mean, my job is literally data analyst\u2014I analyze, evaluate, and interpret data for a living! When I first heard about this, I was thrilled. But when I thought about it a bit more, it gave me pause\u2014the skills I use daily as a data analyst are based on a foundation of Algebra and Calculus. It didn\u2019t quite make sense to me how you could replace Algebra II with data science\u2014the formulas that make up linear regression, for example, don\u2019t make any sense unless you have at least a basic grasp of algebra. Logarithms and trigonometric functions are pretty core to doing data science work! So I started digging into what was actually being taught in these \u201cdata science\u201d courses and was\u2026frankly, I was horrified.While UC Admissions requirements state that Algebra II alternatives still have to \u201cbuild on\u201d certain core concepts in Algebra II, in practice this does not seem to be enforced. The \u201cIntroduction to Data Science\u201d produced by UCLA contains very little Algebra II and \u201cExplorations in Data Science\u201d only claims to teach the portions of Algebra II that overlap with statistics, leaving huge swathes of math necessary for an eventual career in STEM completely untouched. Source: Benjamin Obi Tayo Ph.D.Frankly, reading the CMF does not give me the impression that its authors have a strong understanding of what data science is, exactly. It includes phrases like \u201cthe numbers are staggering: around 1.7 megabytes of digital data were created and stored every second for every person on Earth in 2020, and the vast majority of data goes unanalyzed.\u2019 As Dr. Brian Conrad points out, this is a nonsense statement. Is 1.7MB a large amount? (No, literally one JPEG can be that size.) Most of that is likely video, how exactly should that \u201cdata\u201d be \u201canalyzed\u201d? And how do the authors even know it\u2019s not being analyzed? After all, every video uploaded to YouTube gets tossed into an algorithm that produces viewing metrics, there are data scientists analyzing those uploads for trends, etc? (The authors probably found it by googling \u201cimpressive big data stats'', which spat out that statistic as the first result at the time the CMF was drafted.). I wish this ignorance of the subject matter was limited to cute illustrative examples, but unfortunately, it permeates the basic thinking and structure of the document. The core issue of the CMF\u2019s \u201cdata science\u201d section is that it claims to be discussing data science while it is actually discussing data literacy. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014data literacy is good! Society would be better off if more people understood how to clean data or read a poll accurately. But this is not data science and it is not math. The CMF is replete with statements like \u201chigh-school data-science class students can learn to clean data sets \u2013 removing any data that is incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicated, or incorrect in some other way [...] High school students can also learn to download and upload data, and develop the more sophisticated \u201cdata moves\u201d that are important to learn if students are tackling real data sets.'' This teaches you how to use Excel, sure\u2014but it does not teach you how regressions work, how statistical tests work, the multivariable calculus and linear algebra you need to do the job of an actual data scientist!In response to this, science and math professors across the state have been raising alarms. In response, Dr. Boaler turned to a tactic she often relies on\u2014trying to wrap her ideas in the context of a broader culture war, painting critics as stodgy conservatives fighting her efforts to make math more equitable and diverse. She described her critics as those resisting change. The notion that teaching this version of data science rather than Algebra II is somehow more equitable permeates the CMF in often bizarre ways. The CMF says data science is more equitable than other STEM fields because \u201cdata scientists work together to address uncertainty in data while avoiding bias.\u201dErr, what? I\u2019ve met many data scientists who do not work together or address uncertainty in data while avoiding bias, and many non-data science STEM professionals who do. There is absolutely nothing inherent to data science that makes it more collaborative or unbiased than other STEM fields\u2026It goes on to say\u2026\u201cTraditional mathematics lessons that have taught the subject as a set of procedures to follow have resulted in widespread disengagement as students see no relevance for their lives. This is particularly harmful for students of color and for girls\u2026The data science field provides opportunities for equitable practice, with multiple opportunities for students to pursue answers to wonderings and to accept the reality that all students can excel in data science fields.''I agree that traditional math as currently taught does disengage a lot of students, and in particular women. But there is absolutely no evidence offered in the CMF to suggest that data science education would somehow be different, and there is something profoundly weird about the suggestion that students of color and girls can excel in data science fields but not excel in other fields of mathematics. The primary reason girls, for example, diverge from boys in math performance is because society teaches them that math is not for girls. That is not something swapping out actual math for a watered down \u201cdata science\u201d course can solve, and it\u2019s pretty gross for people to claiming to be trying to make math more equitable for women and people of color to be pushing a program that will actually make them worse at math. Dr. Boaler and the CMF are basically saying \u201cwomen and people of color aren\u2019t doing as well in math, so we should just give up on teaching them actual math. It\u2019s bananas!But don\u2019t take my white, male word for it\u2014a group of Black UC faculty members in data science-related fields wrote a letter stating, \u201c\u2018Introduction to Data Science\u2019...make[s] claims that they specifically support learning for women and minorities, which are not only baseless, but fail to appreciate that they actually do the opposite and harm students from such groups by steering them away from being prepared for STEM majors.\u201dThe CMF needs to reject these half-baked ideasThere\u2019s a reason why these folks have been joined by other Black mathematicians around the country, such as Dr. Jelani Nelson, in pushing back fiercely against the ideas around 8th Grade Algebra and data science proposed in the CMF. (And a reason, perhaps, that Dr. Boaler threatened to call the police on him for it!) There\u2019s a reason why Stanford Mathematics professor Dr. Brian Conrad wrote, in a comprehensive takedown of the CMF you really should read, that \u201cwhatever author is responsible for such a myopic view of mathematics should never again be involved in the setting of public policy guidance on math education.\u201d There\u2019s a reason why the authors of papers Dr. Boaler cites to back up her work consistently say she has misread and misrepresented their work, and that it does not support the claims she is making. And the reason, simply, is that her ideas have not worked. Forcing all children to defer Algebra until 9th grade,trying to squeeze two years of schooling into one year of a watered down \u201ccompression course\u201d rejected by the University of California for not meeting its standards, and replacing Algebra II with a glorified data literacy course masquerading as a \u201cdata science\u201d course does not help high achieving kids or struggling kids or any kids in between\u2014it hurts them all.California students need different answers on math\u2013what we\u2019ve been doing for the past few decades hasn\u2019t worked. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should embrace the ideas embodied in the current CMF draft, which were built on decades of shoddy and dishonest academic research, and throw up our hands at the notion of teaching underperforming kids advanced math entirely. The good news is that there are answers out there\u2014we can learn from other countries teach math differently than we do, we can integrate findings from the \u201cscience of math\u201d, and more. Our kids deserve a better California Math Framework than the one we\u2019re being offered now\u2014let\u2019s get it done.SubscribeShare248 Likes\u00b718 Restacks248158SharePreviousNext",

From the latest productivity apps to wiz-bang gadgets, we're constantly bombarded with promises of increased efficiency, higher output, and success beyond our dreams (both the creative and financial variety). We obsess over these tools, treating them like a crush\u2014a fleeting infatuation that momentarily captivates our attention. All of this is wasted effort and delusion.Of course, if you talk to a grizzled pro or anyone you actually respect in an industry you\u2019ll find a constant: tools alone do not make a master. It's not the latest software or the fastest hardware that defines greatness; it's the mindset and skill of the individual wielding them. As the philosopher Seneca once stated, \"A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand.\"Take the acoustic guitar, for ex. In an age of digital music production and synthesizers, this instrument played alone might appear antiquated. Yet, in the hands of a skilled musician, it transforms into a vessel of captivating melodies and soul-stirring harmonies. It might even provide the inspiration for something larger, that would have been missed if you skipped right to software. The simplicity of the instrument compels the artist to focus on the nuances of their playing, to refine their fingerpicking technique, and to channel their emotions through each strum. The true magic lies not in the guitar itself, but in the virtuosity of the musician who brings it to life. A skill, mastered over time, agnostic and ambivalent of the noisy, buzzing, ADHD-ridden market.Similarly, the digital world is teeming with tools that promise to revolutionize the way we work and create. But if we're fixated on acquiring every new tool that comes our way, we risk missing out on developing our fundamental, timeless skills\u2014the abilities that transcend technological trends and persist throughout time. It\u2019s almost always backwards to care much here. The important tools will find you. It\u2019s also not a real moat, or recipe for producing anything great. Perhaps a fleeting viral post for \u201cbeing first,\u201d and really what\u2019s the point of that?True pros understand the importance of honing their craft, regardless of the tools at their disposal. They embrace the philosophy of Bruce Lee, who famously stated, \"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.\" It's the expertise gained through deliberate, consistent practice and a deep understanding of the fundamentals that separates pros from amateurs.It is real alpha to ignore the allure of novelty. Let us instead focus on the foundations, the timeless principles, and the relentless pursuit of mastery. Paradoxically, AI will make this more true. This will also ensure you escape the nihilism inherent to creative reliance on AI.The next time you find yourself FOMO\u2019ing after the latest gadget or the trendiest app, pause for a moment of reflection. Ask yourself: Am I truly honing my craft? Am I investing here only because others told me to? Am I really doing something that matters? Am I actually just a goldfish chasing a shiny lure? I worry many lack this sort of metacognition in a world where it\u2019s more common to become a garden variety stock promoter of the latest fad.

There's a bit about how North Korean refugees can apply for asylum in South Korea. I was under the impression (from Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy) that all North Koreans are more or less granted asylum by default. My recollection is that she put it even more strongly in her book: that SK in effect treated fleeing North Korean citizens as de facto citizens of South Korea, because they are meant to be one country. Is the asylum process mentioned here a rubber stamp, or did the process get more strict? Would a refugee from North Korea ever be refused asylum in South Korea?replyBoxFour 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]1. The article briefly discusses the impact of COVID, highlighting China's implementation of supplementary measures and limitations during this period. It is evident that having knowledge of individuals' travel destinations would undoubtedly assist in contact tracing efforts. However, as the article states it can also be used for malicious exploitation.2. If your question is about why they go to Thailand instead of stopping in Laos: Thailand is reluctant to repatriate individuals back to North Korea, while Laos does not share the same reluctance.For the more general question: It is understandable that South Korea would scrutinize refugees to some extent to prevent the infiltration of espionage agents and similar threats.replybee_rider 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It is understandable that South Korea would scrutinize refugees to some extent to prevent the infiltration of espionage agents and similar threats.That makes sense. It does seem to point to an obvious maligned behavior NK could engage in: send inept spies, let it seem like a problem, and suddenly SK will have to apply extra scrutiny to any refugees. Hopefully the extra scrutiny won\u2019t bump anyone from the \u201cdefect\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t defect\u201d camp.

I'm sure it helps at very, very early stages of a pandemic, and even then depending on which virus we are trying to trace... But I'd like to see actual proof that it helps for pandemics like COVID.Otherwise it is such an easy way to implement mass surveillance, that requiring very very thorough proof that it actually helps is the bare minimum.

It's one about contact tracing. And yes I think that evidence should always be required when talking about potential tools for such mass surveillance. \"It makes sense\" isn't really proof for anything, as the last pandemic has proven times and times again. For example here in Quebec, contact tracing apps and tracking location of everyone with covid has had pretty much no measurable effect. Even fundamental questions like \"what is a contact\" are hard to answer, so actual studies might be helpful for this conversation.And again, even tracing infectious contacts was much easier with mass tracking of every single citizens location, that still doesn't mean it is actually useful to stop a pandemic. It might be! Which is why I was asking for good evidence.replyclassichasclass 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Contact tracing (contact investigation, etc.) is a standard practice in public health. In tuberculosis control where I got my start, it's what we do for any active case of TB we identify - we find the people who may have been exposed and widen the circle as necessary. It's also critical for STDs.The only difference with COVID was the scale, not the methodology. There is an argument that if the disease is everywhere, people can be infected anywhere, and you would need an accordingly exponential increase in monitoring scale to pull any kind of signal from the noise floor. But the principles work for any disease.source: TB control physician for 17 yearsreplylevinb 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Hi; I built all of the contact tracing analytics for one of the Harvard hospitals during the pandemic. Also had a parent that was clin epi for 25 years.The entire effort, using essentially every technology applied, was useless.It was for many reasons, but primarily because the asymptomatic rate was very, very high, that there was no way to actually trace anything. Where or who you got Covid from was pure speculation for a majority of positive cases.Scales and rates matter. With TB you have a very high fidelity, testable, slow spreading causal chain. Which is why TB tracing programs are effective, and good public health policy.Our national Covid policies were ineffective, to say the least.replymardifoufs 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I agree but do we use mass tracking for stuff like tuberculosis and STDs?And agreed also that my point is probably more true for COVID than anything else. The scale of COVID is such that it automatically requires mass tracking to even consider contact tracing, but I guess my argument was that even then we should have evidence that such massive tracking improves contact tracing for very infectious viruses like COVID.I'm genuinely asking, not in a \"just asking questions\" manner here. So thanks for replying! I didn't know contact tracing was useful for TB too.replydanielharan 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I live in Qu\u00e9bec. We never had mass tracking - this was FUD about the app, which did NOT share data... and that level of privacy protection is also why it was difficult to prove its positive impact.What we did have was public health which sometimes managed to call people after a positive result - to warn their contacts, so they don't infect others in turn. This is absolutely standard for public health for many illnesses, and helps reduce contagion.Neither of those is mass tracking. Public health doesn't report you if you went to see prostitutes or used illegal drugs; their job is to stop chains of transmission, and contact the people you were around. That's true for TB as mentioned, as well as smallpox, Ebola, etcAnyways, since you're in Qu\u00e9bec you might be interested in this figure, selecting the 0-49 demographic.

I'll add a more controversial opinion that our Public health authorities have been completely politicised here. Legault does not want to talk about COVID anymore so we don't. And when it was scoring points politically, they blatantly played with facts and timelines to make political decisions sound \"based on science\". Very very disappointed about how our public institutions acted during the crisis. For example, that the crazy, criminal, stuff that happened in CHSLDs early on was completely swept under the rug with no government official suffering from any meaningful consequences was...

The usefulness of contract tracing is not a conversation I wish to engage in.replymardifoufs 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Ok, how do you define a contact then? How can it be evident that tracking locations is obviously helpful for contact tracing without defining what it means to trace a contact? That's why evidence would be helpful here.

This story is proof of that.I guess it depends on the type of technologies used. For example, Google's and Apple's Exposure Notifications API that many of the contact tracing application used didn't actually allow accessing locations directly: https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications...> Your app must have the BLUETOOTH and INTERNET permission in its manifest, but your app doesn't require and can't include ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, nor BLUETOOTH_ADMIN. For more information about restrictions on your app, see the API\u2019s Terms of Service.In particular, in the section 3c:> i. Your App may not request the Location, Bluetooth_Admin, Special Access, Privileged, or Signature permissions, or collect any device information to identify or track the precise location of end usersHow it worked was that you gathered more or less randomly generated identifiers through Bluetooth of devices that were nearby and whose users had also turned on the app functionality. When you were less than 2 meters or so away for around 15 minutes, a contact would be registered.If that person later got sick, the identifier (without PII) would be published and your app could alert you, along the lines of: \"Hey, you were in contact with a person that was infected. You probably should self-isolate.\"Source: worked on the Apturi Covid project in my country as a volunteer, though mostly developed the webpage: https://web.archive.org/web/20230530141239/https://apturicov...

Sure, maybe 50 people would be quarantining at a given time due to false positives (potential exposures with no infection), but that would be a fine tradeoff to protect the whole city, especially if those people were appropriately compensated for the service they would be effectively performing and the infringement on their civil rights. The number of people inconvenienced per person protected from Covid would be very small (much, much less than one).Of course, nothing of the sort happened in the US, and in a situation in which most of the population gets Covid anyway in relatively short order, the number of people getting false positive notifications per person protected from Covid was be very large, and the total benefit was very low.replyKronisLV 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> If you use the app in public transport, you would get a warning every day.Wasn't really the case for me going to work, but maybe that's because of keeping a bit of distance, which might just be possible due to the lower population density over and eventually a gradual shift to remote work.> What were you supposed to do with that information then? Most people just ignored it.There definitely were people who got the notifications and self-isolated for a while, to not end up spreading the virus and probably take a test ASAP.If enough people used it, it could help quite a bit with limiting the spread. It did have some effect from what I've heard, which is still good, when doing nothing would result in more deaths. Thankfully eventually the virus variants got less dangerous, but it's sad when a good initiative ends up being less useful due to people just not caring.replynoah_buddy 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Just read Nothing to Envy myself and one important point is that that work is from almost two decades ago at this point. With the advent of computerized surveillance, it is understandable that the difficulty has increased. A country such as China, it\u2019s probably quite easy for the surveillance systems to loop in a human any time that an unknown face crops up. Paired with the pronounced physical and cultural differences between North Koreans and an other people in the world, it\u2019s probably easy to guess when someone is attempting to escape from NK.Does anyone have book recommendations for modern insight into NK? I have been reading about the country much more in recent weeks.replyCrampusDestrus 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If NK has a relatively recent and relatively good quality photo of you (national ID card) they can just share it with the CCP and run it through their massive CCTV surveillance networkreplyArch-TK 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I don't think the surveillance system got much more sophisticated but for anyone wondering what china's surveillance system was like before the pandemic, I stayed in China three times for a total of about a month and a half in the 6 months before the pandemic.When you get to the airport, you will likely notice the abundance of cameras, including paths which take you right under overhead cameras. Your photo will be taken at the airport border control and your visa will be stamped. You will get an entry card you must fill in before leaving china and present alongside your passport. This card details the hotel you will be staying at. If I recall correctly you also had to provide these details on the visa application form, as well as a recent photo.When riding in a car, cameras on all major roads will periodically take photos of the front of every car every few hundred meters, accompanied with a literal flash.Once you arrive at your hotel, you will be greeted with yet another camera, you will be required to check in your passport and have your photo taken. This system, I believe, is a government integrated system as between all the hotels I visited, they seemed to have a very similar computer with a similarly mounted camera.If you plan to travel between cities, you will need your passport to buy the ticket. Once on the bus to a different city, it's possible someone at some checkpoint will abruptly enter the bus with a hand-held camera to videotape everyone's faces.In large cities, especially the bigger ones, cameras are everywhere, there's cameras on top of cameras pointing at other cameras. Comedic cartoons of surveillance don't do it justice.When using the metro (underground) transportation systems you will again be passing through gates with overhead cameras pointed at your face. Presumably to match up the chip-coins (or whatever the particular metro system of the city you're in uses) with routes taken and map these to photos of your face.If you plan on taking a taxi, expect to have to use didi or something equivalent, didi doesn't take payments via bank cards, didi takes payments via wechat or alipay. To get wechat working as a foreigner in china, you must find Chinese people who will vouch for you to activate your account (let's hope you can chat up some people in a bar to help you with this feat). To get alipay working in china, you need a chinese bank account, unless you're extremely lucky and manage to get it working without one (I managed once out of my three trips). I'm pretty sure both alipay and wechat are tightly integrated into the chinese surveillance system.I'm pretty sure the information which gets collected would be useless if it also didn't get dumped in a centralised system and processed collectively, so I'm pretty sure there is some centralised system with complex processing.replykelnos 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Your bit about taxis seems hard to believe. I haven't been in China in around 15 years, but there are still tons of foreigners visiting China for business reasons, and they need to get around. Requiring them to jump through these sorts of hoops to merely ride in a taxi seems a bit unbelievable.Granted, sometimes the business we were visiting would send a car to our hotel, but not always, and not when we were going out on our own. Is cash still accepted by taxi drivers? That's how we usually paid when visiting for work.I haven't traveled to China as a tourist since around that same time, when we (again) paid cash when taking taxis. China presumably (at least, pre-pandemic) still gets a lot of tourists, and it again seems unlikely that the only way a tourist can take a taxi is to get a random local to vouch for them, and/or an ability to open a local bank account.replyArch-TK 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Normal taxis exist and you can get them called in by your hotel or whatnot but from the few experiences of using them, they require payment in cash or alipay and some of them refuse cash becoming extremely confused why you can't alipay for the taxi.They're also way less convenient. Try calling for a taxi when you don't even know how to recognize a taxi advertisement, never mind finding a taxi company where the staff speak English in a non-major city. In Shanghai it's not hard, but try something off the beaten path and you'll seriously struggle. In fact, outside of Shanghai I struggled to find anywhere which would accept payment with anything other than cash or Alipay/Wechat (sometimes you weren't even able to use cash).I was in China for business reasons, I needed to get around.

They'd just be criminals. Citizenship is a fairly big deal and it's not trivial to renounce it. In the US at least IIRC you literally cannot renounce citizenship domestically at all outside very rare exceptions, you must be abroad and do so at a consulate or embassy, and it's something considered not automatic and instant. Additionally one can be charged an exit tax depending on net worth and tax status.SK of course will have its own rules, but I'm just saying as a matter of law \"everyone in that area of our country is citizens of our country being illegally coerced/controlled by other citizens of country, who are criminals\" wouldn't be that strange.

The SK government killed several hundred thousand of their own citizens, see the pictures of the Bodo League massacre taken by American officers for example.[1]> Estimates of the death toll vary. Historians and experts on the Korean War estimate that the full total ranges from at least 60,000\u2013110,000 (Kim Dong-choon, who stated that this was likely a very conservative estimate) to 200,000 (Park Myung-lim).> The massacre was committed by the government forces of president Syngman Rhee and falsely blamed on the communists led by North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. The South Korean government made efforts to conceal the massacre for four decades. Survivors were forbidden by the government from revealing it, under threat of being treated as communist sympathizers; public revelation carried with it the threat of torture and death.Moreover, the Chinese did not enter the war until UN forces had driven all the way to the Manchurian border, along with regular \"accidental\" cross-border air attacks. MacArthur, Kai-shek, and Rhee all fully desired war with China and were hoping to escalate the conflict.I've posted these quotes before, copied below:[2]> In the fall of 1946, the US military authorized elections to an interim legislature for southern Korea, but the results were clearly fraudulent. Even General Hodge privately wrote that right-wing \"strong-arm\" methods had been used to control the vote. The winners were almost all rightists, including Rhee supporters, even though a survey by the American military government that summer had found that 70 percent of 8,453 southern Koreans polled said they supported socialism, 7 percent communism, and only 14 percent capitalism. [...]> Chung Koo-Hun, the observant young student of the late 1940s, said of the villagers' attitude: \"The Americans simply re-employed the pro-Japanese Koreans whom the people hated.\" [...]> Seventy of the 115 top Korean officials in the Seoul administration in 1947 had held office during the Japanese occupation.> In the southern city of Taegu, people verged on starvation. When 10,000 demonstrators rallied on October 1, 1946, police opened fire, killing many. Vengeful crowds then seized and killed policeman, and the US military declared martial law. The violence spread across the provinces, peasants murdering government officials, landlords, and especially police, detested as holdovers from Japanese days. American troops joined the police in suppressing the uprisings. Together they killed uncounted hundreds of Koreans.> American anthropologist Cornelius Osgood, spending much of 1947 in a village west of Seoul, watched as police carried young men off to jail by the truckload. A \"mantle of fear\" had fallen over once peaceful valleys, he wrote. The word \"communist,\" he said, \"seemed to mean 'just any young man of a village.'\" On August 7, 1947, the US military government outlawed the southern communists, the Korean Worker's Party. Denied a peaceful political route, more and more leftist militants chose an armed struggle for power.[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacre[2] - quotes from The Bridge at No Gun Ri[3] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_uprising[4] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju_Uprising (note that this was in 1980, under a different dictator that the US also backed)replyAbrahamParangi 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That\u2019s a whole lot of words to say the US was demonstrably right.

Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run POW camps during the winter of 1950\u201351. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the Geneva Conventions which explicitly stated that captor states must repatriate prisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire.

The following  description is lifted from Larry's manpage. --r$ ]  Perl is a interpreted language optimized for scanning arbitrary text  files, extracting information from those text files, and printing  reports based on that information. It's also a good language for many  system management tasks. The language is intended to be practical  (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny,  elegant, minimal). It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some  of the best features of C, sed, awk, and sh, so people familiar with  those languages should have little difficulty with it. (Language  historians will also note some vestiges of csh, Pascal, and even  BASIC-PLUS.) Expression syntax corresponds quite closely to C  expression syntax. If you have a problem that would ordinarily use sed  or awk or sh, but it exceeds their capabilities or must run a little  faster, and you don't want to write the silly thing in C, then perl may  be for you. There are also translators to turn your sed and awk  scripts into perl scripts.bleadv5.39.0\u2026GitLive-bleadLarry Wall committed on Dec 18, 1987Dec 18, 19870 parentscommit 8d063cdShow file treeHide

Failure to do so may void your warranty. :-)After you have unpacked your kit, you should have all the files listedin MANIFEST.Installation1) Run Configure. This will figure out various things about your system.  Some things Configure will figure out for itself, other things it will  ask you about. It will then proceed to make config.h, config.sh, and  Makefile.  You might possibly have to trim # comments from the front of Configure  if your sh doesn't handle them, but all other # comments will be taken  care of.  (If you don't have sh, you'll have to copy the sample file config.H to  config.h and edit the config.h to reflect your system's peculiarities.)2) Glance through config.h to make sure system dependencies are correct.  Most of them should have been taken care of by running the Configure script.  If you have any additional changes to make to the C definitions, they  can be done in the Makefile, or in config.h. Bear in mind that they will  get undone next time you run Configure.3) make depend  This will look for all the includes and modify Makefile accordingly.  Configure will offer to do this for you.4) make  This will attempt to make perl in the current directory.5) make test  This will run the regression tests on the perl you just made.  If it doesn't say \"All tests successful\" then something went wrong.  See the README in the t subdirectory.6) make install  This will put perl into a public directory (normally /usr/local/bin).  It will also try to put the man pages in a reasonable place. It will not  nroff the man page, however. You may need to be root to do this. If  you are not root, you must own the directories in question and you should  ignore any messages about chown not working.7) Read the manual entry before running perl.8) Go down to the x2p directory and do a \"make depend, a \"make\" and a  \"make install\" to create the awk to perl and sed to perl translators.9) IMPORTANT! Help save the world! Communicate any problems and suggested  patches to me, lwall@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (Larry Wall), so we can  keep the world in sync. If you have a problem, there's someone else  out there who either has had or will have the same problem.  If possible, send in patches such that the patch program will apply them.  Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs. Don't send ed scripts--  I've probably changed my copy since the version you have.  Watch for perl patches in comp.sources.bugs. Patches will generally be  in a form usable by the patch program. If you are just now bringing up  perl and aren't sure how many patches there are, write to me and I'll  send any you don't have.
