The attack worked like a DDoS and came from a large number of IP addresses, making it difficult to stop. Commenters suggest using proof-of-work algorithms to prevent such attacks, with some advocating for the use of Bitcoin's proof-of-work as a replacement for CAPTCHAs. Others recommend looking into projects like mCaptcha, which uses a proof-of-work algorithm that poses the least amount of friction to individual users, or relying on human-powered OCR tasks to avoid captchas altogether. The discussion also covers the limitations of using PoW algorithms and the feasibility of using WebGPU for efficient computation.There is a discussion about using Proof-of-Work (PoW) for CAPTCHAs as a way to avoid bots without creating accessibility issues for people with disabilities. However, PoW can create a significant initial hurdle for users who don't already own cryptocurrency, and there is no existing API for micro-proof-of-burn. Some proposed alternative PoW algorithms include proof-of-space and proof-of-wait, but their efficacy is uncertain. There are several existing solutions, including friendlyCaptcha and hCaptcha, though hCaptcha has received criticism for needing user registration and being inaccessible to some users. As for blockchain and cryptocurrency, economic incentives need time to work, but blockchain certainly has potential to serve as a more practical solution when it comes to authentication processes.The discussion centers around strategies to prevent DDoS-style attacks. The post mentions implementing various techniques, including limiting requests, rate limiting, and implementing CAPTCHAs. However, these tactics have limitations, and some commenters suggest alternative methods such as \"PoW\" challenges or delaying responses to suspected bots. The conversation also briefly touches on the value of online Archives like \"archive.org\" and the funding they receive.The Internet Archive faced server overload and downtime due to excessive scraping from 64 IP addresses. Suggestions included implementing rate limiting and managing the queue to prevent excessive requests. Some contributors suggested using torrents to relieve the load. However, some were unsure about torrents' practicability, especially when the files are less popular. The discussion also touched on how government funding can be used to support art and culture, and selecting established art forms, such as opera, over more trivial art may stifle non-mainstream artists' growth. Ultimately, the post highlighted the impact of Internet Archive on the web, how it has become a core utility, and how its uptime is critical to the smooth functioning of various websites and the justice system.Archive.org warns users of potential rate limiting if they are downloading too much content or overtaxing the system. The rate limiting would not be on a per user basis, but instead is done per public IP. Limiting could also result from scraping the website, with major websites typically implementing inbound request limits. Archive mining services run by users have been identified as one of the main sources of load on the servers. A new AI model might be being trained from the OCRs of PD material.",

The Wrestlers, who have been demanding the arrest of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment by at least seven women wrestlers (including a minor), wanted to hold a women\u2019s Maha Panchayat in front of the new Parliament building.The following is an image of Delhi Police detaining wrestler Sakshi Malik near Jantar Mantar during their protest march (used in a Hindustan Times report).According to ThePrint, eight to nine buses filled with protesters were taken to different police stations. The police then removed all the tents, hoardings, and the Tricolour that the wrestlers had put up. The protest site at Jantar Mantar was emptied by the police who also took down all the arrangements the wrestlers had made for themselves.After the wrestlers were taken into custody, a selfie of Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat and others apparently clicked in a police vehicle started circulating on social media, with the claim that the wrestlers were seen smiling even after being detained by the police.Abhijit Majumder, who describes himself as a journalist in his Twitter bio, shared the viral image and wrote, \u201cMission Toolkit accomplished. #WrestlersProtest\u201d. (Archive)Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit also tweeted the viral image of the smiling wrestlers and said that after the drama on the streets, this was their real face. He later deleted the tweet.Pro-BJP propaganda website Kreately Media also tweeted the viral image alongside an image of the wrestlers pinned to the ground by police. They later deleted the tweet.State general secretary for Bengal BJP Amitava Chakravorty shared the image alongside images of the protest and wrote \u2018Drama is over. Now all going home smiling. They only came for the photo to ruin today\u2019s inaugurations.\u2019 (Archive)Verified account @wokeflix_ tweeted the same image in a meme and wrote \u2018Toolkit Activated. Mission Accomplished\u2019. (Archive)Verified account @randomsena tweeted the same image alongside an image of Sangeeta Phogat and Vinesh Phogat pinned to the floor during the protest, and wrote \u201cPropaganda Vs Reality\u201d (Archive). Another verified account, @RealAtulsay, tweeted the same image and wrote \u201cSelfie\ud83e\udd33 of the day. Fake #WrestlerProtest\u201d. (Archive) Fact CheckWe found that journalist Mandeep Punia had tweeted the photo at 12:28 pm on Sunday with the information that Vinesh Phogat had been detained by Delhi Police. In that image, Vinesh, Sangeeta and others are not seen smiling, contrary to the viral image. (Archive)Wrestler Bajrang Punia tweeted a collage of the two photos (in one, the wrestlers are smiling; in the other, they are not) marking the viral image as \u2018fake\u2019. He stated that complaints would be filed against whoever circulated the viral image. This particular tweet was retweeted the Vinesh Phogat herself.Sangeeta Phogat also retweeted a tweet by user Rahul Tahiliani which carried the same collage where the \u2018smiling\u2019 photo was marked \u2018fake\u2019. (Archive)Coming to the details of the viral image itself, we found that the image had been morphed using Artificial Intelligence app called FaceApp. We performed the same exercise on the original image tweeted by Mandeep Punia and found the exact viral image. This exercise was also performed by journalist Uzair Rizvi in a tweet.Moreover, Vinesh and Sangeeta Phogat have dimples in the viral image. By comparing Vinesh and Sangeeta\u2019s faces in the viral image with images from their Instagram accounts, we found that neither of the sisters has a dimple. (Sangeeta\u2019s Instagram picture and Vinesh\u2019s Instagram picture)Some users also shared a video of Vinesh Phogat smiling and waving from the police vehicle, while she was being taken away. Users sarcastically asked if the video of her smiling was also edited. (Archive)In reality, Vinesh was sarcastically saying \u201cNaya Desh Mubarak Ho\u201d (Translation: Congratulations on a new India) while being taken away by the police. The video was taken out of context by the above user. In this video too, one can clearly see that Vinesh Phogat does not have a dimple.Hence, a selfie taken by wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat and others in a police van while being taken away for detention has been edited using an Artificial Intelligence app to show that the wrestlers were smiling.

The manipulation of images could be used to spread false narratives, leading to a battle of opposing views. 'Post-truth' incidents by political bodies are harmful to countries and societies on many levels. It's crucial to prioritize the voices and opinions of all parties involved in conflicts, inform all those who are unaware of the truth with valid facts, and avoid inflicting harm on reluctant citizens. The Internet acts like an echo chamber and amplifies niche ideas, which could lead to mass delusions and chaos.This text does not contain any meaningful content related to cutting-edge tech news and therefore cannot be summarized.The text contains a mix of discussions ranging from the importance of public education in democracy, to the origin and validity of truth claims in postmodern philosophy, and even the issue of image authenticity in the age of AI. The discussions include varying perspectives, from skepticism towards grand narratives to the potential benefits of verifying image authenticity to combat digital forgeries. However, there is no clear central theme or new release to capture the interests of tech-savvy readers, and the discussions may not be directly relevant to current tech news.AI-generated images and the prevalence of fakery in media are eroding trust in visual information, with a need for developing ways to authenticate images and videos. One proposed solution involves the use of\u00a0stereo cameras and an assortment of different camera types (including IR and LIDAR) to verify that what is seen is not a projection. However, the technology still cannot protect against 100% of forgeries, and it remains the case that fake images can still have a significant impact on people's beliefs and reactions. Additionally, media consumers may need to evolve their understanding of visual media's authenticity as it becomes increasingly easy for fake visuals to be created and disseminated.A recent tweet by Elon Musk sharing a photo of the Indian protestors with a morphed image raised concerns about the danger of deepfakes. The incident, along with other instances of disinformation across social media platforms, has shaken the belief that cameras objectively capture reality. As newer technology makes it easier to produce authentic yet false narratives, experts fear people will become more vulnerable to subtle yet effective tricks. Such concerns extend into public online conversations, as bots become increasingly difficult to identify. There is also discussion of Twitter's verification system losing credibility, with verified accounts often\u00a0being used by cranks paying to spread their opinions and untruths.The discussion in this text is mainly political, with some comments mentioning AI manipulation of public opinion. The original article being discussed in the comments is of questionable newsworthiness and from a propaganda blog. There is disagreement on whether political discussions should be allowed on HN and whether certain accounts should be discouraged. One commenter shares disappointment with the state of their home country, India, while another disagrees with their points and expresses optimism towards the country's future.

    "hn_content": "HBO Max recently launched a new Captcha system for login, requiring users to solve puzzles which some say are poorly designed. The new system also coincides with a rebranding effort that may have been motivated by a desire to make changes for the sake of change, as often happens with management changes. The rebranding may also be related to potential future mergers with other companies. Many find the Captcha system unnecessarily difficult, particularly for non-English speakers or the visually impaired, and criticize the underlying AI-powered technology, Arkose MatchKey, as marketing-driven. Despite criticism, the rebranding and Captcha system remain in place.Users discuss the efficacy of various CAPTCHA systems and their ability to distinguish between humans and bots. Some propose utilizing difficult, compute-intensive tasks as a form of verification. Concerns are expressed around potential government surveillance and the need for non-invasive alternatives. One user suggests a digital wallet tied to a verified identity as a potential solution. Another argues that the government is the only entity capable of solving this problem. The discussion highlights the importance of finding a secure, reliable, and non-invasive system for verifying human users online.Online security experts debate alternatives to CAPTCHAs to prevent bots on websites. Apple's new system to get rid of CAPTCHAs is suggested as one of the best solutions so far. Inverse captcha honeypots, proof-of-work captchas, and rate limiting are some of the other methods discussed. However, it is pointed out that bots are not random and are run by someone for a reason, such as selling products or pushing political outcomes. Additionally, there are concerns about user privacy and the potential for human identity verification provided by a centralized party. Experts also criticize some current CAPTCHA systems as unpredictable, difficult to use, and problematic for accessibility purposes. Some suggest alternatives such as Cloudflare Turnstile or Friendly Captcha.HBO's use of a captchas system designed by Arkose Labs has been criticized for its poor user experience. The system, which requires users to solve audio and visual puzzles, has been described as too difficult to solve, with some users giving up entirely. Other websites, including ESPN, have also been criticized for their captchas systems, but the Arkose system used by HBO has been singled out for the complexity of its puzzles. Users have questioned why a paid subscription service should require such a difficult security system and have criticized the way it hinders rather than supports their use of the service.Comments on a Tech Times article discuss the frustration with CAPTCHAs and their ineffectiveness. Some commenters argue for alternative solutions such as strong verification through payment, while others suggest anti-abuse mechanisms or redesigning abuse detection. Others express frustration with the branding changes of the HBO streaming service and report glitches or bugs in the platform. Some commenters note the usefulness of CAPTCHAs for detecting click farms, but also acknowledge the potential for AI to ramp up the issue. Overall, the comments reflect a frustration with current CAPTCHA systems and suggest the need for more innovative solutions.",

Performance flaws like these can lead to the following:Rage clickingIncreased bounce rates and decreased conversion ratesLower search engine rankingFor more than three years, Wikipedia\u2019s mobile site suffered from a piece of JavaScript that could take over 600ms to execute during page load on low-end devices, effectively blocking user interactions.In this article, we\u2019ll walk through a couple of easy steps I took to reduce the execution time of this task by about 50%.Total Blocking Time: Why long tasks matter600ms of synchronous JavaScript execution may not sound like a long time, but imagine if a user tried to click a button during page load when the 600ms of JavaScript began executing. Because only one task can be processed on the browser\u2019s main thread at any given time, the user would need to wait for the following steps to finish before they see a visual update:The 600ms JavaScript task executesThe relevant click handler task executesThe browser performs the necessary rendering steps to update the page visuallyA long task can delay the execution of a click handler that produces a visual update.Each step takes time, and the user can perceive any interaction that takes longer than 100ms to produce a visual update as slow. Because of this, Google considers any task that takes more than 50ms a \u201clong task\u201d that can affect the page\u2019s responsiveness to user input. They even developed a metric for this called \u201cTotal Blocking Time\u201d (TBT).There are two long tasks (> 50ms) \u2014 the 80ms task and the 100ms task.What is Total Blocking Time?TBT measures the sum of the blocking portion of all long tasks on the browser\u2019s main thread between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI). The \u201cblocking portion\u201d is the time after 50ms of each long task.Let\u2019s try calculating the TBT in the example below:The 80ms task is 30ms longer than 50ms so contributes 30ms to TBT.The 30ms task doesn\u2019t contribute to TBT since it is less than 50ms and NOT a long task.The 100ms task is 50ms longer than 50ms so contributes 50ms to TBT.Since TBT is the sum of the time exceeding 50ms of each long task, the TBT for this example is 30ms + 50ms = 80ms.When tested on average mobile hardware, Google recommends sites have a TBT of less than 200 milliseconds. But Wikipedia had one task that could take over 600 milliseconds \u2014 roughly 3x the recommended TBT limit for this one task alone.How do we improve TBT?How to reduce Total Blocking TimeTo decrease TBT, we need to either:Do less work on the main thread between First Contentful Paint and Time to InteractiveDo the same amount of work, but break up long tasks into smaller tasks that don\u2019t exceed 50msThis article focuses on making gains from the first bullet point.Step 1: Remove unnecessary JavaScriptWhile many things run on the main thread, including HTML parsing, paints, and garbage collection, long JavaScript execution is frequently the culprit of TBT problems. After all, JavaScript is the fastest way to slow down a site.When I profiled Wikipedia\u2019s mobile site, I found that an _enable method was responsible for most of the execution time. This method initialized the mobile site\u2019s section expansion and collapsing behavior. The profile also showed that, within the _enable method, a call to jQuery\u2019s .on(\"click\") method was slow.function _enable( $container, prefix, page, isClosed ) { ... // Restricted to links created by editors and thus outside our control // T166544 - don't do this for reference links - they will be handled elsewhere var $link = $container.find(\"a:not(.reference a)\"); $link.on(\"click\", function () {  // the link might be an internal link with a hash.  // if it is check if we need to reveal any sections.  if (   $link.attr(\"href\") !== undefined &&   $link.attr(\"href\").indexOf(\"#\") > -1  ) {   checkHash();  } }); util.getWindow().on(\"hashchange\", function () {  checkHash(); });}The .on(\"click\") call attached a click event listener to nearly every link in the content so that the corresponding section would open if the clicked link contained a hash fragment. For short articles with few links, the performance impact was negligible. But long articles like \u201dUnited States\u201d included over 4,000 links, leading to over 200ms of execution time on low-end devices.Worse yet, this behavior was unnecessary. The downstream code that listened to the hashchange event already called the same method that the click event listener called. Unless the window\u2019s location already pointed at the link\u2019s destination, clicking a link called the checkHash method twice \u2014 once for the link click event handler and once more for the hashchange handler.Therefore, in this case, the best approach was to simply remove this block of JavaScript and free up nearly 200ms from the main thread with virtually the same functionality.When profiling, always check where the most time is spent. Then, see if there is code you can either optimize or, better yet, remove.Remember, the fastest way to speed up a site is to remove JavaScript.Step 2: Optimize existing JavaScriptAn additional performance review revealed that an initMediaViewer method took ~100ms to execute . This method was responsible for attaching a click event listener to each thumbnail in the content so that a click to a thumbnail would open a media viewer:/** * Event handler for clicking on an image thumbnail * * @param {jQuery.Event} ev * @ignore */function onClickImage(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); routeThumbnail($(this).data(\"thumb\"));} /** * Add routes to images and handle clicks * * @method * @ignore * @param {jQuery.Object} [$container] Optional container to search within */function initMediaViewer($container) { currentPageHTMLParser.getThumbnails($container).forEach(function (thumb) {  thumb.$el.off().data(\"thumb\", thumb).on(\"click\", onClickImage); });}Similar to the link example in step 1, attaching an event listener to each thumbnail on the page doesn\u2019t scale well. Editors of Wikipedia articles can (and do) make articles with thousands of images. When this block of code ran, it could take well over 100 milliseconds to execute for pages with a lot of images and increase the TBT of the page. What is an alternative approach?Use event delegation.Event delegation is a powerful technique that lets us attach a single event listener to an element that is the common ancestor of many elements. Using event delegation is often more efficient when dealing with user-generated content that could add any number of elements. It takes advantage of event bubbling and works like this:Attach an event listener to a container element.Using the event param in the event handler, check the event.target property to see the source of the event. Optionally use the event.target.closest(selector) API to check for an ancestor element.If the source of the event is an element or the child of an element we\u2019re interested in, handle it.The updated code looked like the following:/** * Event handler for clicking on an image thumbnail * * @param {MouseEvent} ev * @ignore */function onClickImage(ev) { var el = ev.target.closest(PageHTMLParser.THUMB_SELECTOR); if (!el) {  return; }  var thumb = currentPageHTMLParser.getThumbnail($(el)); if (!thumb) {  return; }  ev.preventDefault(); routeThumbnail(thumb);} /** * Add routes to images and handle clicks * * @method * @ignore * @param {HTMLElement} container Container to search within */function initMediaViewer(container) { container.addEventListener(\"click\", onClickImage);}In this case:I revised the initMediaViewer method to attach one click event listener to a single container element that contained all the images.In the onClickImage method, I used the ev.target.closest(selector) API to check if the click originated from a thumbnail or a child of a thumbnail element. If it didn\u2019t, the code returns early since we only care about clicks to thumbnails. If it did, the code handles the event.But what were the results of this work?ConclusionWe released the optimizations outlined in steps 1 and 2 to production in two deploys \u2014 step 1 followed by step 2.According to Wikipedia\u2019s synthetic performance test data, the first deployment resulted in a reduction of TBT by approximately 200ms, while the second deployment improved TBT by around 80ms when testing on a real Moto G (5) phone. Overall, these two steps reduced TBT by nearly 300ms on devices like the Moto G (5) phone visiting long articles.Wikipedia's Moto G (5) synthetic performance test visiting the \"Sweden\" article on English WikipediaWhile there is still room for further improvement, with the task still exceeding the recommended limit on low-end devices, the progress made so far is significant. To achieve even greater reductions in TBT, it may be necessary to break up the task into smaller tasks.What this experience demonstrates is that significant performance improvements can be achieved through small, targeted optimizations. By removing or optimizing specific sections of code, even seemingly minor changes can have a substantial impact on a website\u2019s overall performance.

Now incorrect flags are everywhereA Vatican flag, with the incorrect design likely drawn from Wikipedia, and the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. | Bohumil Petrik/ACIBy Jonah McKeownSt. Louis, Mo., Apr 8, 2023 / 13:00 pmThe flag of Vatican City, with its distinctive yellow and white, is instantly recognizable to many Catholics. Likely far fewer people, though, have scrutinized the papal coat of arms on the right-hand side, instead taking the intricate design \u2014 which includes famous crossed keys \u2014 for granted. As it turns out, there\u2019s a good chance that the coats of arms on many of the Vatican flags you\u2019ve seen out in the world are rendered incorrectly. And it took until 2023 for the internet to start taking notice. Imagine you wanted to print your own version of the Vatican flag. Where would you go to find a high-quality picture of one? If you\u2019re like most internet users, your first stop would probably not be the Vatican\u2019s official (but admittedly outdated) vatican.va website. You\u2019re probably going to pull up Wikipedia, one of the world\u2019s most visited websites and an endless storehouse of free image content. Flagmakers the world over appear to have done so over the years.Imagine many people\u2019s surprise, then, to discover that the image of the \u201cFlag of Vatican City\u201d displayed on Wikipedia has been wrong several times over the years, most recently from 2017 to 2022. (It was also wrong from 2006\u20132007.)What is \u201cwrong\u201d about these flags, you might ask? It\u2019s a small detail in the grand scheme of things but easy to spot once you know about it. The erroneous Wikipedia file includes a red disk at the bottom of the papal tiara as well as a different shade of yellow on portions of the coat of arms.The anonymous Wikipedia editor who changed the look of the flag in 2017 wrote that he or she did so for \u201ccolor correction\u201d purposes, noting that the Vatican\u2019s coat of arms includes the red at the bottom of the tiara. The only problem? The Vatican\u2019s official flag design renders the coat of arms differently, with the circular bottom of the tiara in white. The image was reverted to the correct one in 2022, but the damage was done. A casual internet search will turn up dozens of Vatican flags for sale that clearly used the incorrect image downloaded from Wikipedia. The incorrect flag has even made its way into emojis. (This whole situation gained attention last month after a Reddit user made a post about it.)An inexpensive Vatican flag available for sale on Amazon that makes use of the incorrect Wikipedia flag design. Amazon/ScreenshotFather William Becker, pastor at St. Columbanus Parish in Blooming Prairie, Minnesota, read the Reddit post with interest and amusement. Becker, a self-described \u201cflag guy,\u201d has studied the Vatican flag for years and even wrote an entire book about it. He has fond memories of raising the yellow and white colors over his alma mater, the North American College in Rome. One might imagine that the precise design specifications of the Vatican flag would be laid out for anyone to access, like they are for the flag of the United States, for example. But they aren\u2019t. The best the Vatican provides is a web page with a verbal description and history of the flag, along with a low-resolution image showing a square version. Becker told CNA that the saga of the Vatican flag on Wikipedia demonstrates a need for the Vatican to step in and clarify exactly what its flag should look like, especially considering the fact that Catholic churches all over the world display the Vatican flag. It was precisely this lack of clarity on the official design of the Vatican flag that led Becker to create a website detailing, as best as he could, the correct design for the flag. \u201cCultural communities in general have turned to flags in a stunning way,\u201d Becker commented, citing in part a proliferation of cheaply made, mass-produced flags. And, anecdotally, there seems to be an ever-increasing interest in the Vatican flag as a way for Catholics to claim an identity, whether by flying a flag at home, waving it at a papal event, or by putting one in their social media profile picture. The Vatican flag. Bohumil Petrik/CNAPerhaps surprisingly, the Vatican flag is less than 100 years old, as is Vatican City itself. For more than a millennium before 1870, the pope ruled over the Papal States, large regions mainly within present-day Italy. After the Vatican lost control of the Papal States, it found itself a tiny island surrounded by an acrimonious Italy. It took nearly 60 years until the ratification of the Lateran Accords of 1929 ushered in harmony between the Vatican and Italy, and the creation of the world\u2019s smallest sovereign country. In the days of the Papal States, many different flags were used, but the yellow and white color scheme was a common feature. Becker said the modern design was first used by the merchant fleet in the Papal States from 1825 to 1870. In 1929, that design was chosen as the new flag of Vatican City, the sovereign country. MORE IN USIn swing-state Virginia, pro-life attorney general opts not to support abortion pill lawsuitRead article\u201cIt took a while in 1929 to get some flags made. The techniques of mass production weren\u2019t available yet, and so it would have been a matter of sewing up some flags and fitting out buildings with flag staffs,\u201d Becker noted, saying that during this time and for years afterward there was quite a bit of variation between the Vatican flags people flew, perhaps even more so than today. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of common with other countries too, especially those that don\u2019t really take pains to standardize their design. [Nowadays] a flagmaker is likely to go to a source like Wikipedia, and it may vary in its accuracy,\u201d Becker told CNA. The same flag chosen in 1929 was reconfirmed in a revised Vatican constitution, issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000. The original Vatican flag was actually square, as indeed the official version is today. Since roughly the 1960s, though, buildings began to fly oblong state flags that followed Italy\u2019s flag proportions, probably because most Vatican flags at the time were mass-produced there. The flag has special significance beyond the walls of Vatican City as a marker for the Vatican\u2019s extraterritorial properties, of which there are more than a dozen. These properties, which include major basilicas such as St. Paul Outside the Walls and St. Mary Major, are marked as the Vatican\u2019s through their flying of the papal flag. Becker said he hopes his website will serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking for the exact Vatican flag design, at least until the Vatican issues some kind of clarification on what exactly the flag should look like. \u201cThe papal flag is interesting because on the one hand, the Vatican is such a small state, but the papal flag is seen all over the world. Anywhere there\u2019s a Catholic church, you might be likely to run into a papal flag,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be nice if somebody at the Holy See could, through their website or wherever, make some design specifications more available \u2026 design specifications that manufacturers could rely on a bit more.\u201d(Story continues below)Subscribe to our daily newsletterAt Catholic News Agency, our team is committed to reporting the truth with courage, integrity, and fidelity to our faith.

Some argue that creative license can be welcome, as long as the general recognizable symbol remains. Others argue that factual errors can be damaging and should be corrected. Examples of errors include misspellings in logos and wrong versions of national flags. Anecdotes are shared, including one about an incorrect coat of arms being used by a fire department due to Wikipedia. Overall, there are differing opinions on how important factual accuracy of these symbols should be, but most agree that Wikipedia should not be the final source of truth.There is an ongoing edit war and discussion regarding the correct flag designs on Wikipedia for certain countries, including India and the Vatican. Some users find it amusing that incorrect designs have been displayed at times, and others blame the lack of high-quality official graphics from the relevant authorities for the confusion. Critics argue that it highlights the limitations of Wikipedia as a source of information, stating that most of the content is inaccurate or incomplete.

Each line consists offile_name : relative path to the image file.ground_truth : string format (json dumped), the dictionary contains either gt_parse or gt_parses. Other fields (metadata) can be added to the dictionary but will not be used.donut interprets all tasks as a JSON prediction problem. As a result, all donut model training share a same pipeline. For training and inference, the only thing to do is preparing gt_parse or gt_parses for the task in format described below.For Document ClassificationThe gt_parse follows the format of {\"class\" : {class_name}}, for example, {\"class\" : \"scientific_report\"} or {\"class\" : \"presentation\"}.Google colab demo is available here.Gradio web demo is available here.For Document Information ExtractionThe gt_parse is a JSON object that contains full information of the document image, for example, the JSON object for a receipt may look like {\"menu\" : [{\"nm\": \"ICE BLACKCOFFEE\", \"cnt\": \"2\", ...}, ...], ...}.More examples are available at CORD dataset.Google colab demo is available here.Gradio web demo is available here.For Document Visual Question AnsweringThe gt_parses follows the format of [{\"question\" : {question_sentence}, \"answer\" : {answer_candidate_1}}, {\"question\" : {question_sentence}, \"answer\" : {answer_candidate_2}}, ...], for example, [{\"question\" : \"what is the model name?\", \"answer\" : \"donut\"}, {\"question\" : \"what is the model name?\", \"answer\" : \"document understanding transformer\"}].DocVQA Task1 has multiple answers, hence gt_parses should be a list of dictionary that contains a pair of question and answer.Google colab demo is available here.Gradio web demo is available here.For (Pseudo) Text Reading TaskThe gt_parse looks like {\"text_sequence\" : \"word1 word2 word3 ... \"}This task is also a pre-training task of Donut model.You can use our SynthDoG to generate synthetic images for the text reading task with proper gt_parse.

    "hn_content": "VPN provider Mullvad has announced it is removing its port forwarding feature, which allows users to receive incoming traffic through a fixed IP address. Many users expressed dismay at the decision, as port forwarding is used to enable common applications such as peer-to-peer file sharing and gaming. While it will make the service less open to abuse, the company stated that users had been prevented from accessing certain IPs due to blacklisting, which reduced a key feature of the VPN: its anonymity. Other VPN providers with port forwarding such as Windscribe, ProtonVPN and Tailscale were suggested as alternatives. Mullvad has been highly regarded for its sense of privacy and security.Mullvad will discontinue its port forwarding service to prevent users from using their IPs to host illegal websites. This will affect torrenting as at least one of the peers must be accessible to others to download data, and port forwarding is vital for high-speed downloads and seeding. Private trackers, such as Redacted, and seedboxes are useful alternatives to using Mullvad. Private trackers have a lower risk of copyright infringement and higher quality content with good user communities, while seedboxes offer fast speeds and good upload rates. Accessing private trackers requires an invitation from established members and passing an interview process, which may discriminate against VPN users. Public trackers may have a higher risk of viruses, slower download speeds, and the likelihood of bait-and-switch tactics.Mullvad VPN eliminates port forwarding service, citing abuse by malicious actors prompting law enforcement and service cancellations from hosting providers. Private trackers like Usenet or climbing the private tracker ladder are viable alternatives. One could purchase invites on eBay or Reddit; however, it's risky to get banned for selling invites. Another alternative is to create an account at The Pirate Society or wait for randomly opened sign-ups. Seedboxes offer direct connectivity to seed and peers, but some users prefer keeping their files at home without using a third-party service. Mullvad had a\u00a0'how-to' guide for torrenting on their platform, but they deleted it in 2021. Mullvad was forced to stop offering port forwarding service due\u00a0to abuse and blacklisting of its IP addresses, although, those who do not\u00a0abuse the service could still enjoy it.Mullvad VPN will stop offering port forwarding from July 1st. This indicates they are dealing with abuse reports and Mullvad sees this step as a necessary measure to protect the integrity of their service against current and future threats. The move has prompted current subscribers to ask for refunds and start exploring alternative options. Mullvad is known for its strong privacy ethos, guarantees customers only a unique Mullvad IP address, and offers privacy-friendly payments. Several Mullvad users highlighted the importance of port forwarding for BitTorrent users. Others indicate that they use a VPN to access content that would otherwise be geographically restricted. Some users mention privacy, which is believed to be endangered by the loss of port forwarding, leading to unique globally routable IPv6 addresses for service providers and increasing the visibility of internet users.\nSeveral users discussed the port forwarding functionality on VPN services, specifically on the Mullvad VPN which appears to have removed this feature in 2019. AirVPN and Hide.me were recommended as alternatives that still support port forwarding, while users also mentioned the need for port forwarding for torrenting and accessing services outside of their subnet. The discussion also touched upon the legality of hosting services that could potentially be used for illegal activities and the ability of VPN companies to operate without logging user data. A comparison table provided by Reddit on VPN services was also mentioned.",

This is more like a blog post entry than a real newsletter addition.I don't talk much about this - I obtained one of the first FDA approvals in ML + radiology and it informs much of how I think about AI systems and their impact on the world. If you're a pure technologist, you should read the following:Thanks for reading Methexis! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeGeoffrey Hinton was one of the loudest voices decrying the decline of radiology 5 years, and now he\u2019s crying fear for new AI systems.There's a lot to unpack for both why Geof was wrong, and why his future predictions should not be taken seriously either. Geoff made a classic error that technologists often make, which is to observe a particular behavior (identifying some subset of radiology scans correctly) against some task (identifying hemorrhage on CT head scans correctly), and then to extrapolate based on that task alone.The reality is that reducing any job, especially a wildly complex job that requires a decade of training, to a handful of tasks is quite absurd. Here's a bunch of stuff you wouldn't know about radiologists unless you built an AI company with them instead of opining about their job disappearing from an ivory tower.Radiologists are not performing 2d pattern recognition - they have a 3d world model of the brain and its physical dynamics in their head. The motion and behavior of their brain to various traumas informs their prediction of hemorrhage determination.Radiologists have a whole host of grounded models to make determinations, and actually, one of the most important first order determination they make is whether there is anything notably wrong with a brain structure that \"feels\" off. As a result, classifiers aren\u2019t actually performing the same task even as radiologists.Radiologists, because they have a grounded brain model, only need to see a single example of a rare and obscure condition to both remember it and identify it in the future. This long tail of rare conditions to avoid missing is a large part of their training, and no one has any clue how to make a model that acts similar in this way.There\u2019s so many ways to make Radiologist lives easier instead of just replacing them, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to try. I interviewed and hired 25 radiologists, whose primary and chief complaint was that they had to reboot their computers several times a day..A large part of the radiologist job is communicating their findings with physicians, so if you are thinking about automating them away you also need to understand the complex interactions between them and different clinics, which often are unique.Every hospital is a snowflake, data is held under lock and key, so your algorithm might not work in a bunch of hospitals. Worse, the imagenet datasets have such wildly different feature sets they don\u2019t do much for pretraining for you.Have you ever tried to make anything in healthcare? The entire system is optimized to avoid introducing any harm to patients - explaining the ramifications of that would take an entire book, but suffice to say even if you had an algorithm that could automate away radiologists I don\u2019t even know if you could create a viable adoption strategy in the US regulatory environment.The reality is that for every application, the amount of specific and unknowlable domain knowledge is immense.Long story shortThinkers have a pattern where they are so divorced from implementation details that applications seem trivial, when in reality, the small details are exactly where value accrues.Should you be worried about GPT5 being used to automate vulnerability detection on websites before they\u2019re patched? Maybe.Should you be worried GPT5 is going to interact with social systems and destroy our society single-handedly? No absolutely not.Thanks for reading Methexis!

    "summary": "- Radiologists have a complex job that requires a 3D world model of the brain and its dynamics, making it nearly impossible to replace them entirely with AI systems.\n- Automated systems cannot make determinations like radiologists because radiologists have grounded brain models, making it challenging to train AI machines to replicate their performance.\n- Even creating an algorithm that could automate the work of radiologists could prove difficult given the extensive domain-specific knowledge necessary, making it unlikely that anyone will succeed in doing so.",

    "hn_content": "A post on Hacker News discusses the potential usefulness of AI in diagnostic radiology. The author argues that AI could pre-draft 90% of diagnostic studies, allowing radiologists to customize the remaining 10% to each patient. Others in the comments section express concerns about radiologists not reviewing AI output and becoming complacent, potentially leading to misreadings. The post also discusses the challenges of sharing medical data due to legal and regulatory issues, as well as differences in imaging protocols and disease prevalences between hospitals. Overall, the post highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI in diagnostic radiology.Experts discuss the challenges in sharing healthcare data due to concerns over patient privacy and the lack of a globally accepted standard for data sharing. While some countries, such as Sweden, have implemented systems for easy sharing of patient data, the US and some other countries still struggle with interoperability and siloed data. Experts also highlight the limitations of AI in complex diagnosis and the importance of having human diagnostician input for rare and challenging conditions. However, AI can still assist radiologists in triaging interpretation priorities and flagging abnormal scans. Startups such as AIdoc are raising funds to tackle these challenges. Skill-based upskilling of nurses is another potential solution to increase productivity in primary care.Experts argue that AI cannot take over social systems and destroy humanity, as their interactions are limited to specific domains, and extrapolating based on a single task is an error. An AI cannot perform certain tasks that human radiologists do because of the lack of implementation details. Deploying AI-based systems in real-life hospital situations is difficult, as software integration and user adoption are major influences. Healthcare professionals play a vital role in the design and deployment of AI-based systems. Sharing patient data is complicated, as it could harm privacy, but more data sharing is the best route for reducing physical harm. Finally, the human part of the equation must be considered in the development and implementation of AI-based solutions.- AI systems perform pattern recognition based on complex neural connections built from training data\n- Humans cannot claim that AI lacks patterns that allow it to make certain determinations better than humans\n- AI can significantly improve productivity for tasks like generating boilerplate code but cannot replace a worker entirely\n- The potential for AI to replace white-collar workers exists, leading to shifts in labor to capital and increased economic inequality\n- GPT-5 does not pose an immediate threat to society, but the operationalization of AI could be used for harm\n- Reality is far more complex than we realize, and AI is just a tool in the toolbox",
