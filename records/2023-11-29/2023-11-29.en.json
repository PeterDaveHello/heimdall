    "originBody": "My $500M Mars Rover Mistake: A Failure Story Nov 27 Written By Chris Lewicki Some mistakes feel worse than death. A February evening in 2003 started out routine at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA. I gowned up in cleanroom garb and passed into the High Bay 1 airlock in Building 179 where nearly all of NASA’s historic interplanetary spacecraft have been built since the Moon-bound Ranger series in the 1960s. After years of work by thousands of engineers, technicians, and scientists, there were only two weeks remaining before the Spirit Mars Rover would be transported to Cape Canaveral in Florida for launch ahead of its sibling, Opportunity. I was into my unofficial second shift having already logged 12 hours that Wednesday. Long workdays are a nominal scenario for the assembly and test phase. Every system of a spacecraft is thoroughly tested and confirmed to be in perfect working order before it is buttoned up for the last time on Earth. Spirit and Opportunity, part of a now-historic twin mission, were among the most complex spacecraft ever built at that time and represented nearly a billion dollars invested by NASA. No pressure. The rovers, between them, had 62 brushed-type motors to drive and steer the wheels, control the robotic arm, aim the cameras, point the antenna to Earth, and the various robotic origami unfolding and deployments following landing. The rover had undergone extensive testing to simulate the harsh conditions it would face on Mars as a field geologist. Especially critical are events involving pyrotechnics, as the explosive shockwaves can damage brittle carbon components inside these motors. That night, while my colleagues focused on testing the rover itself, I was tasked with verifying the integrity of the motors in the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) attached to the end of Spirit’s robotic arm.

PIA04422 Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech Disassembling and inspecting motor components after each round of environmental testing is not practical. However, we can check their internal condition by examining their electrical performance. To do this, using a device called a break-out-box, we disconnect the motor from the spacecraft and hook it up to an external power supply and strip chart recorder. A functioning motor will show a smooth, exponential decrease in electrical current during spin-up, while any problems show up as blips in the signal. It was a test I had performed numerous times. My various roles on the project had given me the experience to decipher the maze of diagrams mapping the 10,000 pin-to-pin connections that made everything on the spacecraft work, and my responsibility in writing the instructions on how to connect and control all the motors on the rovers made me the obvious choice for this test campaign. Inside the cleanroom, John, the electrical chief in charge there, helped me find the equipment I needed. Then Mary, our cabling expert, did the careful work of unplugging connectors and inserting test equipment on the interface I asked for. We ran our pre-test confirmation routine. The connection interface was operational, the power supply settings and strip chart setup were correct, and a quick test pulse to a reference motor validated the configuration. With everything in order, the reference motor was removed and we jumpered-in Spirit's RAT-Revolve motor, responsible for rotating the grinder and brush on a Mars rock. The testing steps were confirmed one last time, and we had a green light for pulsing the waiting motor with energy. To get the clearest signal and reveal the smallest of imperfections from the motor, the standard procedure is to give it as much power as it wants. This makes it vitally important to send the inrush of electrons to the right place. A wrong connection could do blue-smoke-releasing catastrophic damage. Our pre-test routine was an important precaution to verify that this potentially-dangerous configuration was correct. The pulse was sent to the motor. As always, the result was immediate, but this time, alarmingly unfamiliar. The strip chart did not look like anything we had seen before. It did not even look like a broken motor. It was decidedly — something else. My mind raced for explanations and in what seemed like an instant, arrived at the most likely explanation. My eyes followed the wires from our breakout box on the test cart to the spacecraft, and the reason for the unfamiliar signal landed like a dagger through my heart. All that power we just released did not go into the RAT-Revolve motor. Due to a mistake I had made with the break-out-box, it went the other direction on the connector interface, sending a surge of electricity straight into the spacecraft, instead of the motor. Ooooohhhh ssshhhhiiiiitttt. The strip-chart plot from the test that night. It is not supposed to be flat, and instead should tail exponentially downward. The possible consequences rolled over me in nauseating waves. I may have just created a $500M piece of scrap. With only two weeks until the spacecraft was delivered for launch operations, THERE WAS NO TIME to recover from a big problem. I was instantly aware that there may be only one rover launched to Mars on this synodic cycle. And my hands were holding the still-warm rover murder weapon. I had learned from countless experiences in this and other projects that bad news doesn’t get better with age so I immediately keyed the mic on my headset and told Leo, the test conductor running the other testing in parallel, what had just happened. His response twisted the knife in my chest. ‘Yeah, we seem to have lost all spacecraft telemetry just a bit ago.’ NOT a good sign. Everyone in my vicinity was listening in on the voice loop on their headsets, and off-mic, John unleashed a string of profanities about me that could serve as an advanced tutorial for even the most seasoned sailors. The team immediately ran the spacecraft’s emergency shutdown procedure and we were instructed to leave the cleanroom for what would probably be a damage assessment briefing. I had turned 28 less than a month prior, looked and felt much younger, and was a few years into my first big job after college. This first significant step in my dream career as an interplanetary spacecraft engineer, which I had aspired to since junior high, was perhaps also going to be my last. Others in the system test area moved away from me as dark reality descended. Matt, the Assembly Test and Launch Operations manager, firmly instructed me to write down everything I could remember about what had just transpired. I’m not sure when the tears started, but they were probably flowing as I recorded those details alone in a conference room. With my notes in hand, Leo and my colleagues meticulously examined the evening’s events. There were two obvious things that had happened. One, a large pulse of electricity had gone somewhere other than intended, and two, telemetry had stopped coming from the spacecraft. Ominously, but perhaps with a ray of hope, there was not an obvious link between these two things. As the team reasoned through the problem, it seemed the surge of electricity likely ended up in the H-Bridge motor driver circuit, essentially a smart traffic controller for electricity. What I did was NOT GOOD, but luckily because of something called back-EMF[1], this was one part of the rover actually designed to handle extra energy. We decided that the errant pulse had somehow glitched the system enough to interrupt the data flow without permanently disabling it. With the spacecraft already powered off, we would do what you do with your own consumer electronics: we would turn it back on to see if the power cycle had cleared the problem. It was close to midnight and notifications about the incident had made it up the chain of management to Pete, the Project Manager. Replanning across the entire project of a thousand people was at stake. The team, now with a lot of extra attention and oversight, re-grouped and ran the standard spacecraft power-on procedure. When booting up the spacecraft, it takes a bit for the electronics to come online, then for the software to boot up and start producing telemetry. There is a circuit that produces a pulse every clock cycle (8 times a second), turning a red light on the ground support instrument rack into a robot heartbeat indicator. The spacecraft power supply went through its familiar progression of voltage steps and currents, but after too much time, the heartbeat remained dark, and the telemetry never came. I don’t really remember what happened next. Probably something about meetings in the morning to figure out what the hell do we do now?! What I do remember is the feeling of emotional devastation that followed me home where I recounted the story to my wife. I was convinced I would lose my job in the morning and space exploration history would attach my name to a particular chapter of infamy. Back at JPL in the morning, in a meeting with a fresh shift and hold outs from the prior night of disaster, we once again worked through the detailed sequence of reconstructed events looking for clues or possible recovery, which felt more and more fleeting until one crucial piece of the puzzle was recognized. The Fluke 87III digital multimeter is a ubiquitous tool in the labs of JPL. When I entered the cleanroom the previous night, I needed one and asked John, the sailor linguist, where I could get one for my test. All were in use, so he pointed near the spacecraft to one apparently monitoring bus voltage but not involved in any testing. I carefully removed the leads and proceeded on to my date with destiny in testing the RAT motors. The monitoring multimeter I disconnected was actually completing the circuit that powered the spacecraft's ground test telemetry. I inadvertently disabled the connection the instant I removed the leads. We immediately realized that the next thing to do was to restore the multimeter to this duty and power up the spacecraft. We did just that. It worked. There was a collective gasp as the telemetry flickered back to life — Spirit was not dead after all! The team resumed testing, having lost only a few hours, and I exhaled the most monumental sigh of relief in my lifetime, reassured that I might not have actually doomed the mission to a single-rover endeavor. The rest of that morning was a blur. Weeks of analyses followed on the RAT-Revolve motor H-bridge channel leading to detailed discussions of possible thin-film demetallization. Ultimately the project gained the confidence to disposition the hardware: Use As Is. The long days continued. I moved to Cape Canaveral to begin the final preparations before launching the rovers to Mars, and more thrilling stress-filled moments punctuated the days and weeks. Then Spirit was on Mars, and after a year of latent stress, it turned out the RAT-Revolve motor worked just fine, and the whole experience became a life lesson. Image adapted from art by Janis Ozolins The Lesson As I've recounted this tale over time, it has not only enriched my understanding but also inspired others to explore and share their own brushes with failure. The act of sharing transforms these experiences into valuable lessons, both for the storytellers and their audience. Later in my career, at my asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources, we recognized the power of these narratives in our hiring process and team culture. We deliberately asked job candidates to share a failure story of theirs, inviting them to acknowledge and learn from their past challenges, while recognizing that failure is a natural process of learning. The core lesson I've drawn from my rover ordeal is best expressed in these words: “Let your scars serve you; they are an invaluable learning experience and investment in your capability and resilience.” In the depths of the crisis, when the tears were flowing and everyone else in the system test center was moving away, one person walked toward me. Ernie, a wise and kind man who had come out of retirement to help with the round-the-clock spacecraft shift work approached me and put his hand around my shoulder, and in a gentle grandfatherly voice quietly reassured me. He then uttered the clear words that I will never forget: ‘Remember this feeling the next time you have to sign-off that something is OK.’ I went on to become Flight Director for Spirit and Opportunity as they explored the surface of Mars, earning NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal for my efforts, so obviously I didn’t get fired for this incident. But that wasn’t clear until a few days later in one of the more pivotal meetings of my life. In the tense period following the mishap, with definitive analysis still pending, passionate and polarized debates ensued about the tests' hazards, and many argued for stopping them altogether. The debate concluded, and the criticality of these tests — making sure our motors would function flawlessly on Mars — was still paramount. The tests needed to continue. And I still remember the shock when Project Manager Pete delivered the decision and the follow-on news: ‘These tests will continue. And Chris will continue to lead them as we have paid for his education. He’s the last person on Earth who would make this mistake again.’ I found myself returning to the 'scene of the crime' for many more tests, after I had carefully revised the procedures to eliminate the chance of repeating the same mistake. Each time I conducted this test again, Pete’s vote of confidence combined with Ernie’s words of wisdom brought with it a moment of nausea, a stark reminder of the past incident, but also the readiness and confidence to continue. The trust management showed in me, despite the initial error, marked a key moment in my career, highlighting growth and the ability to overcome challenges. Now, whenever I'm called upon to give my approval or endorsement for something significant, I'm instantly transported back to that moment — the room, the lighting, the chair I was in, the table, the pit in my stomach, the intense mix of fear, anxiety and regret for an oversight that nearly led to catastrophe. Ernie's wisdom that day, combined with his compassionate approach during my moment of vulnerability, left an indelible mark on me. Now, when faced with critical decisions, I not only recall that experience but also strive to assist others in navigating their own challenging moments. And like Pete did for me, my aim is to aid in transforming these experiences into catalysts for growth and resilience, reinforcing the notion that our responses to adversity can define our path forward. These stories of near misses, learning curves, and eventual triumphs are not just mine, but are shared by many who build things. In space exploration, failure is not an option — it comes pre-installed. Every misstep is a stepping stone towards greater success, and together, our collective wisdom can pave the way for future innovations, achievements and breakthroughs in developing and growing our presence in and benefit from space. I’d love to learn from fellow space entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists, technicians, and others who would share their own 'Failure Stories.' If you’ve been able to overcome a failure and benefit from it, share your story on my threads on LinkedIn, the service formerly known as Twitter/X, Hacker News or BlueSky.

Working at a major airline, I was the one who would pick the most difficult and risky projects. One was a quick implementation of a new payment provider for their website. That website sold millions of euros worth of tickets every day. Seconds after deployment, it turned out that I had failed to recognize the differences between the test and live environments as one of the crucial variables was blank in production. I could have expected this if I had spent more time preparing and reading documentation. Sales died completely, and my heart sank. After a lengthy rollback procedure that resulted in a few hours without sales, a massive surge of angry customers, and a loss of several million euros, I approached the CEO of the company. I still remember catching him in an elevator. I explained that this incident was all my fault and I had failed to properly analyse the environment. I assured him that I was ready to bear full consequences, including being fired. He burst into laughter and said something like this: \"Why would I want to get rid of you? You made a mistake that you&#x27;ll never do again. You are better at your job than you were yesterday!\" This experience was formative to me on many levels including true leadership. I successfully completed many high risk projects since than. reply supriyo-biswas 36 minutes agoparentThe language is anodyne enough and there’s just that bit of implausible detail in the story (approaching the CEO yourself when you’re the one who fucked up) makes me think this comment was written by an LLM, or at least a fabrication. reply hutzlibu 10 minutes agorootparentThe suspicious part for me would be the CEO laughing like it was nothing. Also yes, one would expect it goes the other way around, when you messed up big, someone will come to you.

He was summoned to Watson’s office, fully expecting to be dismissed.

Maybe not often broken to the point that they&#x27;re blank, but definitely broken to the point that booking a ticket isn&#x27;t possible (I prefer blank, so that I don&#x27;t waste like 30 minutes on not being able to book a ticket).Also most of the internet seems often broken.

He lived on this.I looked at the site going down, horified. He mocked me, then proceeded with the udate. It didn&#x27;t work. The site stayed offline for hours.Then it worked again. And nobody cared.

Maybe you need a copilot when doing live deployments and that copilot had authority to stop the rollout. Along with the usual devops guards. reply Cthulhu_ 57 minutes agoparentprevI think the loss may not have been as much as you think; sure, nobody could buy tickets for a few hours, so theoretically the company lost millions of revenue during that time. But that assumes people wouldn&#x27;t just try again later. Downtime does not, in practice, translate to losses I think.I mean look at Twitter, which was famously down all the time back when it first launched due to it popularity and architecture. Did it mean people just stopped using Twitter? Some might, the vast majority and then some didn&#x27;t.Downtime isn&#x27;t catastrophic or company-ending for online services. It may be for things in space or high-frequency trading software bankrupting the company, but that&#x27;s why they have stricter checks and balances - in theory, in practice they&#x27;re worse than most people&#x27;s shitty CRUD webservices that were built with best practices learned from the space&#x2F;HFT industries. reply davedx 41 minutes agorootparentEven with HFT you’d have to have more than 50% of your trades go against you to lose any money, and you’ll probably have hedges, and losing some % of money will be within normal operation parameters. Shit happens! Links go down, hardware fails, bugs slip through no matter how diligent you are. (No I’m not looking to be hired by any HFT shops) reply rahimnathwani 2 hours agoparentprevThis reminds me of that old joke that ends \"Why would I fire you? We just spent millions training you!\".People who take on high risk projects are underappreciated. But many managers prefer employees who can reliably deliver zero value, than those with positive expected value but non-zero variance. reply mr_mitm 1 hour agorootparentThat story sounds so much like that joke that I&#x27;m wondering if there is some urban legend thing going on here. reply slowmotiony 1 hour agoparentprevThere must be more people like you in those major airlines, as those sites go down all the damn time. 6 hours..???

I’m in banking, and terrified of making even a slightly complex deployment without validating it in production first. (Complex here referring to that it might be dependent not just on code changes, but also environment). reply holografix 36 minutes agoparentprevWow chatgpt is actually getting worse. reply jay-barronville 8 hours agoprevReally well written story.As a software engineer, I have a couple stories like this from earlier in my career that still haunt me to this very day.Here’s a short version of one of them: Like 10 years ago, I was doing consulting work for a client. We worked together for months to build a new version of their web service. On launch day, I was asked to do the deployment. The development and deployment process they had in place was awful and nothing like what we have today—just about every aspect of the process was manual. Anyway, everything was going well. I wrote a few scripts and SQL queries to automate the parts I could. They gave me the production credentials for when I’m ready to deploy. I decided to run what you could call my migration script one last time just to be sure I’m ready. The very moment after I hit the Enter key, I realized I had made a mistake: I had just updated the script with the production credentials just before I made the decision to do another test run. The errors started piling and their service was unresponsive. I was 100% sure I had just wiped their database and I was losing it internally. What saved me was that one of their guys had just a couple hours earlier completed a backup of their database in anticipation of the launch; in the end, they lost a tiny bit of data but most of it was recovered via the backup. Ever since then, “careful” is an extreme understatement when it comes to how I interact with database systems—and production systems in general. Never again. reply cdogl 7 hours agoparentYour excellent story compelled me to share another:We rarely interact directly with production databases as we have an event sourced architecture. When we do, we run a shell script which tunnels through a bastion host to give us direct access to the database in our production environment, and exposes the standard environment variables to configure a Postgres client.Our test suites drop and recreate our tables, or truncate them, as part of the test run.One day, a lead developer ran “make test” after he’d been doing some exploratory work in the prod database as part of a bug fix. The test code respected the environment variables and connected to prod instead of docker. Immediately, our tests dropped and recreated the production tables for that database a few dozen times. reply cachvico 7 hours agorootparentVerbatim from my current code: if strings.Contains(dbname, \"prod\") { panic(\"Refusing to wipe production database!\") } Truncate(db) reply devsda 6 hours agorootparentOurs are not named with a common identifier and this also needs constant effort to maintain while refactoring and there&#x27;s still scope for a mistake.*ideally* devs should not have prod access or their credentials should only have limited access without permissions for destructive actions like drop&#x2F;truncate etc.But in reality, there&#x27;s always that one helpful dba&#x2F;dev who shares admin credentials for a quick prod fix with someone and then those credentials end up in a wiki somewhere as part of an SOP. reply masklinn 22 minutes agorootparentThat‘s why you do credentialing via ssh keys, and keys are explained and map to a user, and non-dba keys should expire.If you need access for a quick prod fix, your key gets added to the machine with that explanation and a week (or lees) lifetime. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentprevI also have a table with one row in it indicating whether the database is prod. reply ericbarrett 6 hours agorootparentprevEverybody replying to you that this is fragile is missing the point.

Only replication to a read-only storage will help in such situations. reply saagarjha 5 hours agorootparentIf code is executing past a panic, I think it is unlikely that you can trust the integrity of your database anyways. reply Andrex 5 hours agorootparentprevBut what if you have a chron job that auto replicates and then deletes everything after you forward it? reply toasted-subs 6 hours agorootparentprevYup, I have 3 prompts if you want to wipe anything.One of the reasons I put interactions between databases behind a cli. reply stylepoints 4 hours agorootparentprev#metoo reply norman784 2 hours agorootparentprevOur test suite expects that the database name has a `_test` suffix, so you can&#x27;t run the tests even locally without the suffix. reply masklinn 19 minutes agorootparentOur test harness takes an optional template as input and immediately copies it.It’s useful to distribute the test anyway, especially for non-transactional tests.If the database initialisation is costly that’s useful even if tests run on empty, as copying a database from a template is much faster than creating one DDL by DDL, for postgres at least. reply jeffreygoesto 3 hours agoparentprevA friend once had to remotely do an OS update of a banking system.

Then when they went to restore the backups hadn&#x27;t succeeded in months (they had hired consultants to help them with the new product for good reason).Luckily the customer sites each had a local db that synced to the central db (so the product could run with patchy connectivity), but the guy spent 3 or 4 days working looooong days rebuilding the master db from a combination of old backups and the client-site data. reply dotsam 43 minutes agorootparent> logged into his dev db and the prod db at the same time in different windowsI am very worried about doing the wrong thing in the wrong terminal, so for some machines I colour-code my ssh windows, red for prod, yellow for staging and green for dev. e.g. in my ~&#x2F;.bashrc I have: echo -ne &#x27;\\e]11;#907800\\a&#x27; #yellow background reply Feathercrown 4 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t that almost exactly what happened at github too? reply askvictor 6 hours agoparentprevOne place I worked (some 20 years ago) had a policy that any time you run a sudo command, another person has to check the command before you hit enter.

Corners were cut.I write a quick little UPDATE query to update some marketing text on a product and when the query takes more than an instant I knew I had screwed up. Reading my query, I quickly realize I had ran the UPDATE entirely unbounded and changed the description of thousands and thousands of products.Our database admin with access to the database backups had gone home hours earlier as he worked in a different timezone. It took me many phone calls and well over an hour to get ahold of him and get the descriptions restored.The quick change on my way out the door ended up taking me multiple hours to resolve. My friend in marketing apologized profusely but it was my mistake, not theirs.As far as I remember we never heard anything from the client about it, I put that entirely down to it being 5pm on Friday of a holiday weekend. reply kfrane 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s why I always write a BEGIN statement before executing updates and deletes.

Oracle doesn&#x27;t autocommit by default, and SQL Server does. You don&#x27;t want to learn this when you type \"rollback;\". I took responsibility and we had all the data in an audit table and recovered quickly.

Or maybe the two cables don’t connect directly and instead go through some of kind of interface? The latter is fairly common in networking, e.g. “feed-through” patch panels and keystone jacks and quite a few kinds of fiber optic connectors.All of these seem like utterly terrible ideas in an application where you would take the thing apart after final assembly and where the person doing the disassembly or reassembly could possibly access the wrong side of the panel. reply maxerickson 6 hours agorootparentA break out box could very sensibly have both sides of the connector on it and then have the various pins broken out into individual connections for flexibility.In that case keying or whatever isn&#x27;t going to prevent you from connecting to the wrong side, because both sides are present. reply jeffreygoesto 3 hours agorootparentprevOne guy in our workshop had to provide DC to a display with a round 4-pin connector.

During my first job at a small market station 30 years ago, I was training to be a tape operator for a newscast. All the tapes for the show were in a giant stack. There were four playback VTRs. My job was to load each tape and cue it to a 1-second preroll. When a tape played and it was time to eject that tape, it was _very_ easy to lose your place and hit the eject button on the VTR that was currently being played on the air instead of the one that they just finished with. The fella who was training me did something very annoying, but it was effective: every time I went to hit the eject button, he would make a loud cautionary sound by sucking air through his closed teeth as if to tell me I was about to make a terrible mistake. I would hesitate, double check and triple check to make sure it was the right VTR, and then I would eject the tape. He made that sound every single time my finger went for the eject button. It really got on my nerves, but it was a very good way to condition me to be cautious. Our station had a policy: the first time you eject a tape on the air got you a day off without pay; the second time put you on probation; the third time was dismissal. I had several co-workers lose their jobs and wreck the newscast due to their chronic carelessness. Thanks to my annoying trainer, I learned to check, check again, and check again. I never ejected a tape on the air.

I was relatively inexperienced with PHP but had the false confidence of a new grad (didn&#x27;t get a job for 6 months after graduating - so I was desperate to impress).I was tasked with updating some feature flags that would turn on a new feature for all clients, except for those that explicitly wanted it off. These flags were stored in the database as integers (specifically values 4 and 5) in an array (as a string).I decided to use the PHP function (array_reverse)[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.php.net&#x2F;manual&#x2F;en&#x2F;function.array-reverse.php] to achieve the necessary goal. However, what I didn&#x27;t know (and didn&#x27;t read up on the documentation) is that, without the 2nd argument, it only reversed the values not the keys. This corrupted the database with the exact opposite of what was needed (somehow this went through QA just fine).I found out about this hours later (used to commute ~3 hrs each way) and by that time, the senior leadership was involved (small startup). It was an easy fix - just a reverse script - but it highlighted many issues (QA, DB Backups not working etc.)I distinctly remember (and appreciate) that the lead architect came up to me the next day and told me that it was rite of passage of working with PHP - a mistake that he too had made early in his career.I ended up being fired (grew as an engineer and was better off for it) but in that moment and weeks after it, it definitely demoralized me. reply notRobot 4 hours agoparentThey fired you for that array_reverse mistake? reply throwawayosiu1 4 hours agorootparentYep, I was put on PIP with impossible success criteria (no issues raised in PRs by senior engineers and no issues in code deployed to production - even if it was reviewed by senior engineers & QA) and fired (for failing that criteria) in 2 weeks.I worked there for ~8 months in total. reply m0rtalis 1 minute agorootparentSometimes the only winning move is no to play reply erhaetherth 3 hours agorootparentprev> no issues raised in PRs by senior engineersWat?

It&#x27;s also not clear if the result of these mistakes was that there might be real damage to the spacecraft, or if the result was just wasted time and hours of confusion about why the spacecraft wouldn&#x27;t start up.The first mistake is they didn&#x27;t realize that the multimeter was not only measuring, but it was also completing the circuit.That sounds like a real bad idea. But if it was totally necessary to arrange it like that, then that multimeter should never have been touched.That&#x27;s not just one guy&#x27;s error. It&#x27;s at least two guys at fault, along with whoever is managing them, and whoever is in charge of the system that allows it.The second mistake is with the break-out-box.

You expect all the humans involved to be competent. But relying on that competence is a mistake. The emotional stress of dealing with such enormous responsibilities, the often long work hours and the long list of procedures will make any competent professional to inadvertently slip up at some point.In case of electrical connectors, the connectors are often grouped together in such a way as to avoid making wrong connections. Connectors with different sizes, keying, gender, etc are chosen to make this happen. This precaution is taken at design time. JPL is extremely experienced in these matters. There is probably something else left unsaid, that led to this mistake being possible.Meanwhile, motor controllers using H-bridge is something that&#x27;s never boring. I once saw a motor control fail so spectacularly that we were scratching our heads for days afterwards. As always, a failure is never due to a single cause (due to careful design and redundancies). It&#x27;s a chain of seemingly innocuous events with a disastrous final outcome. But the chain was so mind-bending that we had to write it down just to remember how it happened. Recently, I was watching the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and I got reminded of this failure. Our failure was nowhere near as disastrous - but the initial mistakes, the control system instability, the human intervention and the ultimate failure propagation were very similar in nature. Needless to say, it sent us back to the drawing board for a complete redesign.

You don&#x27;t touch other peoples lab equipment unless the other ends of the wires are hanging free.

And that is assuming that they damaged a subsystem. Back powering the entire spacecraft could have wrecked your power system and anything connected to it. You&#x27;d have to disposition every part of the system that was touched. It&#x27;s much more involved than just swapping in the spare and sending it. reply natosaichek 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve worked on satellites, and yeah - everything is super bespoke, very low quantity, very expensive. There is probably a qualification unit, or a flight spare that may be available for many subsystems, but maybe not. Integration is a long and complicated process. Pulling apart this bot, with however many fasteners, joints, etc, and then reassembling it correctly would be a decidedly non-trivial project that could easily take a month or two, given that testing has to be performed at each step along the way to ensure that every sensor and actuator is fully functional throughout the integration process. This style of traditional aerospace assembly &#x2F; integration is not particularly efficient. The only reason it is done this way is that for these kinds of missions you only get one shot, and total cost is ridiculously high so everything must be done correctly. reply frankus 8 hours agorootparentAny idea why they would use brushed motors? When every gram counts I would think ditching the mechanical commutator would be a no-brainer, but maybe adding another leg to the H-bridge is a bigger penalty? reply cpgxiii 6 hours agorootparentIn 2003, small brushless DC motors were way less mature and available as they are now, particularly for low-speed&#x2F;high-torque applications*. Brushless controllers are much more complicated than brushed controllers, particularly on the control software front, so sticking with simpler and more reliable brushed controllers for a space application makes sense (remember, it probably needed to be radiation hardened - doing that for an H-bridge is much easier than a BLDC controller).*A notable example of this is in the world of RC cars, where rock-crawlers only very recently have started switching to brushless motors using field-oriented control to deliver acceptable very-low-speed behavior. Until FOC controllers became available, brushed motors offered much better low-speed handling. reply wolverine876 3 hours agorootparentWithout disagreeing with your point, would availability be an issue in this case? They need one or two, have an enormous budget, and if the technology exists can make their own. reply tonyarkles 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s mostly because it was 2003 and decent BLDCs were not super common-place yet.

However the other problem is they are often built in low numbers to begin with so getting hold of a flight qualified unit will most likely be an issue as well.

We worked around the clock maintaining server room and critical applications for an average size bank.One of our responsibilities was to execute nightly checklists to run various processes, do backups at correct times, etc. These processes would be things like running calculations on loans, verifying results, etc.We had a huge ream of checklists to accomplish this and we were supposed to follow them religiously.We had two very similar applications, one our core and another a core from another bank we bought with the same application but older version and slightly different config. Consequently, we had two tracks of checklists with very similar steps.One of those steps was to change the accounting date in the system. The application was a terminal app. We would telnet to the server, log in, then we would execute commands in the menu driven app. To change the date we would have to go to a special menu for super dangerous applications. It required the user to log in again.Our core system, required logging in, selecting that we want to advance accounting date by one day, entering admin password again, pressing enter, then waiting for about 4 hours while the process ran. Then the process would exit back to the menu where the highlighted option would be to advance the day.Our legacy system required logging in, selecting the option to advance accounting date, entering admin password, pressing enter, then waiting for two hours after which a popup showed to ask a stupid question where we would just always press enter, then wait for another hour until it exits to the menu.We quickly figured out, that we can just press the enter key twice on our legacy system. The second enter press would just leave there in keyboard buffer and dismiss the popup. This was very useful for us, as this was the only operation that interrupted what would be the only time during night where we could have a kebab...One night I made a mistake, and I pressed the enter twice... on the wrong system. When I figured out that I did it I realised the process would exit to the menu and then should ask for the admin password.But, unfortunately, the application had a bug (or a feature). Once it exited to the menu, it came back in but for some reason it remembered that the admin password has already been entered and started advancing the accounting date again without asking for the password.Unfortunately, the date was December 24. For entire December 24, the entire bank was unable to process any operations while we were restoring from last good backup (before day close) and then redoing eod operations. Then on December 25 as a penalty, I had to sit for entire day with accounting department observing how they manually entered all of the operations that would normally happen automatically on Dec 24th.One extra key pressed. reply pomian 9 hours agoprevWhat a great write up.

    "originBody": "MeshGPT: Generating Triangle Meshes with Decoder-Only Transformers Yawar Siddiqui1, Antonio Alliegro2, Alexey Artemov1, Tatiana Tommasi2, Daniele Sirigatti3, Vladislav Rosov3, Angela Dai1, Matthias Nießner1 1Technical University of Munich, 2Politecnico di Torino, 3AUDI AG Paper arXiv Video Code MeshGPT creates triangle meshes by autoregressively sampling from a transformer model that has been trained to produce tokens from a learned geometric vocabulary. These tokens can then be decoded into the faces of a triangle mesh. Our method generates clean, coherent, and compact meshes, characterized by sharp edges and high fidelity. Press G to toggle wireframe. Press R to reset view. Abstract We introduce MeshGPT, a new approach for generating triangle meshes that reflects the compactness typical of artist-created meshes, in contrast to dense triangle meshes extracted by iso-surfacing methods from neural fields. Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods, with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories. Video Comparison with baselines Our approach produces compact meshes with sharp geometric details. In contrast, baselines often either miss these details, produce over-triangulated meshes, or output too simplistic shapes. Shape Completion Given a partial mesh, our method can infer multiple possible shape completions. Here we show completion as the partial input mesh is edited through user actions. 3D Asset Generation for Scenes Our method can be used to generate 3D assets for scenes. Here we show a room populated with assets generated using our method. Method Overview Vocabulary Learning Transformer Training We first learn a vocabulary for triangle meshes, which we then use for autoregressive generation of a mesh.We learn our vocabulary of geometric embeddings from a vast collection of shapes. This is done using an encoder-decoder network, which features vector quantization at its bottleneck. This transformer is specifically designed for sequence prediction over tokens from the learned vocabulary. Once fully trained, it enables the direct sampling of meshes as sequences from this vocabulary.

Not all really cutting edge work requires a data center sized cluster. reply tomcam 14 hours agoparentprevCan someone explain quantized embeddings to me? reply _hark 14 hours agorootparentNNs are typically continuous&#x2F;differentiable so you can do gradient-based learning on them. We often want to use some of the structure the NN has learned to represent data efficiently. E.g., we might take a pre-trained GPT-type model, and put a passage of text through it, and instead of getting the next-token prediction probability (which GPT was trained on), we just get a snapshot of some of the activations at some intermediate layer of the network. The idea is that these activations will encode semantically useful information about the input text. Then we might e.g. store a bunch of these activations and use them to do semantic search&#x2F;lookup to find similar passages of text, or whatever.Quantized embeddings are just that, but you introduce some discrete structure into the NN, such that the representations there are not continuous. A typical way to do this these days is to learn a codebook VQ-VAE style. Basically, we take some intermediate continuous representation learned in the normal way, and replace it in the forward pass with the nearest \"quantized\" code from our codebook. It biases the learning since we can&#x27;t differentiate through it, and we just pretend like we didn&#x27;t take the quantization step, but it seems to work well. There&#x27;s a lot more that can be said about why one might want to do this, the value of discrete vs continuous representations, efficiency, modularity, etc... reply enjeyw 13 hours agorootparentIf you’re willing, I’d love your insight on the “why one might want to do this”.Conceptually I understand embedding quantization, and I have some hint of why it works for things like WAV2VEC - human phonemes are (somewhat) finite so forcing the representation to be finite makes sense - but I feel like there’s a level of detail that I’m missing regarding whats really going on and when quantisation helps&#x2F;harms that I haven’t been able to gleam from papers. reply topwalktown 9 hours agorootparentQuantization also works as regularization; it stops the neural network from being able to use arbitrarily complex internal rules.But really it&#x27;s only really useful if you absolutely need to have a discrete embedding space for some sort of downstream usage.

This looks like a step in the right direction, but who knows. reply johnnyanmac 9 hours agorootparentprevAvailability =&#x2F;= viability. I&#x27;m sure as we speak some large studios are already leveraging this work or are close to leveraging it.But this stuff trickles down to the public very slowly.

Today&#x27;s tools are qualitatively different (sculpting, simulation, auto-rigging etc etc etc). reply kranke155 6 hours agorootparent3D CGI has gotten faster, but I haven’t seen any qualitative jump for quite some time.IMO the last time a major tech advance was visible was Davy Jones on the Pirates films. That was a fully photorealistic animated character that was plausible as a hero character in a major feature. That was a breakthrough. After that a lot of refinement and speeding up.This is different. I have some positivity about it, but it’s getting hard to keep track of everything that’s going on tbh. Every week it’s a new application and every few months it’s some quantum leap.Like others said, Midjourney and DallE are essentially photorealistic.It seems to me that the next step is generative AI creating better and better assets.And then of course you have video generation which is happening as well… reply orbital-decay 6 hours agorootparentBoth DE3 and MJ are essentially toys for single random pictures, unusable in a professional setting. DALL-E in particular has really bad issues with quality, and while it follows the prompt well it also rewrites it so it&#x27;s barely controllable. Midjourney is RLHF&#x27;d to death.What you want for asset creation is not photorealism, but style and concept transfer, multimodal controllability (text alone is terrible at expressing artistic intent), and tooling. And tooling isn&#x27;t something that is developed quickly (although there were several rapid breakthroughs in the past, for example ZBrush).Most of the fancy demos you hear about sound good on paper, but don&#x27;t really go anywhere. Academia is throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, this is its purpose, especially when practice is running ahead of theory. It&#x27;s similar to building airplanes before figuring out aerodynamics (which happened long ago): watching a heavier-than-air thing fly is amazing, until you realize it&#x27;s not very practical in the current form, or might even kill its brave inventor who tried to fly it.If you look at the field closely, most of the progress in visual generative tooling happens in the open source community; people are trying to figure out what works in real use and what doesn&#x27;t. Little is being done in big houses, at least publicly and for now, as they&#x27;re more interested in a DC-3 than a Caproni Ca.60. The change is really incremental and gradual, similarly to the current mature state of 3D. Paradigms are different but they are both highly technical and depend on academic progress. Once it matures, it&#x27;s going to become another skill-demanding field. reply nextworddev 15 hours agoparentprevWhat do you ascertain the use case of this in your field? Does it seem high quality? (I have no context) reply zavertnik 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not a professional in VFX, but I work in television and do a lot of VFX&#x2F;3D work on the side. The quality isn&#x27;t amazing, but it looks like this could be the start of a Midjourney-tier VFX&#x2F;3D LLM, which would be awesome. For me, this would help bridge the gap between having to use&#x2F;find premade assets and building what I want.For context, building from scratch in a 3D pipeline requires you to wear a lot of different hats (modeling, materials, lighting, framing, animating, ect). It costs a lot of time to get to not only learn these hats but also use them together. The individual complexity of those skill sets makes it difficult to experiment and play around, which is how people learn with software.The shortcut is using premade assets or addons. For instance, being able to use the Source game assets in Source Filmmaker combined with SFM using a familiar game engine makes it easy to build an intuition with the workflow. This makes Source Filmmaker accessible and its why theres so much content out there made with it. So if you have gaps in your skillset or need to save time, you&#x27;ll buy&#x2F;use premade assets. This comes at a cost of control, but that&#x27;s always been the tradeoff between building what you want and building with what you have.Just like GPT and DALL-E built a bridge between building what you want and building with what you have, a high fidelity GPT for the 3D pipeline would make that world so much more accessible and would bring the kind of attention NLE video editing got in the post-Youtube world. If I could describe in text and&#x2F;or generate an image of a scene I want and have a GPT create the objects, model them, generate textures, and place them in the scene, I could suddenly just open blender, describe a scene, and just experimenting with shooting in it, as if I was playing in a sandbox FPS game.I&#x27;m not sure if MeshGPT is the ChatGPT of the 3D pipeline, but I do think this is kind of content generation is the conduit for the DALL-E of video that so many people are terrified and&#x2F;or excited for. reply gavinray 12 hours agorootparentOn an unrelated note, could I ask your opinion?My wife is passionate about film&#x2F;TV production and VFX.She&#x27;s currently in school for this but is concerned about the difficulty of landing a job afterwards.Do you have any recommendations on breaking into the industry without work experience? reply kranke155 6 hours agorootparentAs a producer? Huh. That’s such a great question.I think producer roles are a little bit less ultra competitive &#x2F; scarce as they are actually jobs jobs where you have to use excel and planning and budgeting.Being a producer means being on the phone all the time, negotiating, haggling, finding solutions where they don’t seem to exist.Be it in TV, advertising or somewhere in the media space, the common rule is that producers are mostly actually terrible at their jobs, that’s my experience in London. So if she’s really good and really dedicated and learns the job of everyone on set, I’d say she has a shot.The real secret to being good in filmmaking is learning everyone else’s job. Toyota Production System says if you want to run a production line you have to know how it works.If she wants to do VFX production she could start doing her own test scenes, learning basics in nuke and Blender, even understanding the role of Houdini and how that works.If she does that - any company will be lucky to have her. reply bsenftner 14 hours agoparentprevSo you&#x27;re probably familiar with the role of a Bidding Producer; imagine the difficulty they are facing: on one side they have filmmakers saying they just read so and so is now created by AI, while that is news to the bidding producer and their VFX&#x2F;animation studio clients scrambling as everything they do is new again. reply sram1337 15 hours agoprevWhat is the input? Is it converting a text query like \"chair\" to a mesh?edit: Seems like mesh completion is the main input-output method, not just a neat feature. reply anentropic 15 hours agoparentYeah it&#x27;s hard to tell.It looks like the input is itself a 3D mesh? So the model is doing \"shape completion\" (e.g. they show generating a chair from just some legs)... or possibly generating \"variations\" when the input shape is more complete?But I guess it&#x27;s a starting point... maybe you could use another model that does worse quality text-to-mesh as the input and get something more crisp and coherent from this one. reply all2 15 hours agoparentprevYou prompt this LLM using 3D meshes for it to complete, in the same manner you use language to prompt language specific LLMs. reply owenpalmer 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what it seems like. Although this is not an LLM.> Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles.It&#x27;s only inspired by LLMs reply adw 14 hours agorootparentThis is sort of a distinction without a difference. It&#x27;s an autoregressive sequence model; the distinction is how you&#x27;re encoding data into (and out of) a sequence of tokens.LLMs are autoregressive sequence models where the \"role\" of the graph convolutional encoder here is filled by a BPE tokenizer (also a learned model, just a much simpler one than the model used here). That this works implies that you can probably port this idea to other domains by designing clever codecs which map their feature space into discrete token sequences, similarly.(Everything is feature engineering if you squint hard enough.) reply ShamelessC 12 hours agorootparentprevThe only difference is the label, really. The underlying transformer architecture and the approach of using a codebook is identical to a large language model. The same approach was also used originally for image generation in DALL-E 1. reply CamperBob2 15 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s what I was wondering. From the diagram it looks like the input is other chair meshes, which makes it somewhat less interesting. reply treyd 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also examples of tables, lamps, couches, etc in the video. reply tayo42 15 hours agorootparentprevReally the hardest thing with art is details and usually seperates good from bad. So if you can sketch what you want roughly without skill and have the details generated, that&#x27;s extremely useful. And image to image with the existing diffusion models is useful and popular. reply nullptr_deref 14 hours agorootparentI have no idea about your background when I am commenting here. But these are my two cents.NO. Details are mostly like icing on top of the cake. Sure, good details make good art but it is not always the case. True and beautiful art requires form + shape. What you are saying is something visually appealing. So, the reason why diffusion models feel so bland is because they are good with details but do not have precise forms and shape. Nowadays they are getting better, however, it still remains an issue.Form + shape > details is something they teach in Art 101. reply alexose 15 hours agoprevIt sure feels like every remaining hard problem (i.e., the ones where we haven&#x27;t made much progress since the 90s) is in line to be solved by transformers in some fashion. What a time to be alive. reply mlsu 14 hours agoprevThe next breakthrough will be the UX to create 3d scenes in front of a model like this, in VR. This would basically let you _generate_ a permanent, arbitrary 3D environment, for any environment for which we have training data.Diffusion models could be used to generate textures.Mark is right and so so early. reply ShamelessC 10 hours agoparentMark?edit: Oh, _that_ Mark? lol okayedit edit: Maybe credit Lecun or something? Mark going all in on the metaverse was definitely not because he somehow predicted deep learning would take off. Even the people who trained the earliest models weren&#x27;t sure how well it would work. reply Mizza 1 hour agoprevGreat work. But I don&#x27;t get from the demo how it knows what object to autocomplete the mesh with - if you give it four posts as an input, how does it know to autocomplete as a table and not a dog?So maybe the next step is something like CLIP, but for meshes? CLuMP? reply valine 15 hours agoprevEven if this is “only” mesh autocomplete, it is still massively useful for 3D artists. There’s a disconnect right now between how characters are sculpted and how characters are animated. You’d typically need a time consuming step to retopologize your model. Transformer based retopology that takes a rough mesh and gives you clean topology would be a big time saver.Another application: take the output of your gaussian splatter or diffusion model and run it through MeshGPT. Instant usable assets with clean topology from text. reply toxik 14 hours agoparentWhat you have to understand is that these methods are very sensitive to what is in distribution and out of distribution. If you just plug in user data, it will likely not work. reply bradleyishungry 5 hours agoparentprevsorry to tell you, but there’s no way anything will be generating clean topology for characters for a long long time. reply valine 3 hours agorootparentThere’s no shortage of 3D mesh data to train on. Who to say scaling up the parameter count won’t allow for increasingly intricate topology the same way scaling language models improved reading comprehension. reply mattigames 9 hours agoparentprevLol for 3D artists, this will be used 99% by people who have have never created a mesh by hand in their lifes; to replace their need to hire a 3D artist: programmers who don&#x27;t want (or can&#x27;t) pay a designer, architects who never learned nothing other than CAD, fiver \"jobs\", et alI don&#x27;t think people here realize how are we inching to automating the automation itself, and the programmers who will be able to make a living out of this will be a tiny fraction of those who can make a living out of it today. reply j7ake 15 hours agoprevI love this field. Paper include a nice website, examples, and videos.So much more refreshing than the dense abstract, intro, results paper style. reply BrokrnAlgorithm 3 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not a 3D artist, but why are we still, for lack of a better word, \"stuck\" with having &#x2F; wanting to use simple meshes? I appreciate the simplicity, but isn&#x27;t this an unnecessary limitation of mesh generation? It feels like an approach that imitates the constraints of having both limited hardware and artist resources. Shouldn&#x27;t AI models help us break these boundaries? reply ipsum2 3 hours agoparentWe&#x27;re not stuck on meshes. Check out neural radiance fields as an alternative. reply BrokrnAlgorithm 3 hours agorootparentI was referring to being stuck with having to create simple &#x2F; low tri polygonal meshes as opposed to using complex poly meshes such as photogrammetry would provide. The paper specifically addresses clean low poly meshes as opposed to what they call complex iso surfaces created by photogrammetry and other methods reply hackerlight 39 minutes agorootparentLots of polys is bad for performance. For a flat object like a table you want that to be low poly. Parallax can also help to give a 3D look without increasing poly count. reply fireant 3 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that it&#x27;s quite hard to make convex objects with radiance fields, right? For example the furniture in OP would be quite problematic.We can create radiance fields with photogrammetry, but IMO we need much better algorithms for transforming these into high quality triangle meshes that are usable in lower triangle budget media like games. reply BrokrnAlgorithm 3 hours agorootparent\"Lower triangle budget media\" is what I wonder if its still a valid problem. Modern game engines coupled with modern hardware can already render insane number of triangles. It feels like the problem is rather in engines not handling LOD correctly (see city skylines 2), although stuff like UE5 nanite seems to have taken the right path here.I suppose though there is a case for AI models for example doing what nanite does entirely algorithmically and research like this paper may come in handy there. reply wolfgang805 1 hour agoprevIt would be nice to be see work and be part of a field that did work that humans could not do, instead of creating work that just replaces what humans already know how to do. reply catapart 14 hours agoprevDang, this is getting so good! Still got a ways to go, with the weird edges, but at this point, that feels like &#x27;iteration details&#x27; rather than an algorithmic or otherwise complex problem.It&#x27;s really going to speed up my pipeline to not have to pipe all of my meshes into a procgen library with a million little mesh modifiers hooked up to drivers. Instead, I can just pop all of my meshes into a folder, train the network on them, and then start asking it for other stuff in that style, knowing that I won&#x27;t have to re-topo or otherwise screw with the stuff it makes, unless I&#x27;m looking for more creative influence.Of course, until it&#x27;s all the way to that point, I&#x27;m still better served by the procgen; but I&#x27;m very excited by how quickly this is coming together! Hopefully by next year&#x27;s Unreal showcase, they&#x27;ll be talking about their new \"Asset Generator\" feature. reply truckerbill 14 hours agoparentDo you have a recommended procgen lib? reply catapart 13 hours agorootparentOh man, sorry, I wish! I&#x27;ve been using cobbled together bits of python plugins that handle Blender&#x27;s geometry nodes, and the geometry scripts tools in Unreal. I haven&#x27;t even ported over to their new proc-gen tools, which I suspect can be pretty useful. reply chongli 15 hours agoprevThis looks really cool! Seems like it would be an incredible boon for an indie game developer to generate a large pool of assets! reply stuckinhell 15 hours agoparentI think indie game development is dead with these techniques. Instead big companies will create \"make your own game\" games.Indie games already seems pretty derivative these days. I think this tech will kill them in mid-term as big companies use them. reply chongli 15 hours agorootparent“Make your own game” games will never replace regular games. They target totally different interests. People who play games (vast majority) just want to play an experience created by someone else. People who like “make your own game” games are creative types who just use that as a jumping off point to becoming a game designer.It’s no different than saying “these home kitchen appliances are really gonna kill off the restaurant industry.” reply quickthrower2 4 hours agorootparentBut the make your own game games are saleable games. Or at least they will be with enough AI. The Roblox minecraft for example is super realistic. reply stuckinhell 13 hours agorootparentprevHmm I think it will destroy the market in a couple ways.AI creating video games would drastically increase the volume of games available in the market. This surge in supply could make it harder for indie games to stand out, especially if AI-generated games are of high quality or novelty. It could also lead to even more indie saturation( the average indie makes less than 1000 dollars).As the market expectations shift, I think most indie development dies unless you are already rich or basically have patronage from rich clients. reply crq-yml 8 hours agorootparentThe likes of itch.io, Roblox, and the App Store already exist, each with more games than anyone can reasonably curate.The games market has been in the same place as the rest of the arts for some time now: if you want to be noticed, you have to mount a bit of a production around it, add layers of design effort, and find a marketing funnel for that particular audience. The days of just making a Pong clone passed in the 1970&#x27;s.What technology has done to the arts, historically, is add either more precision or more repeatability. The relationship to production and arts as a business maps to what kinds of capital-and-labor-intensive endeavors leverage the tech.Photographs didn&#x27;t end painting, they ended painting as the ideal of precisely representational art. In the classical era, just before the tech was good enough to switch, painting was a process of carefully staging a scene with actors and sketching it using a camera obscura to trace details, then transferring the result to your canvas. Afterwards, the exact scene could be generated precisely in a photo, and so a more candid, informal method became possible both through using photographs directly and using them as reference. As well, exact copies of photographs could be manufactured. What changed was that you had a repeatable way of getting a precise result, and so getting the precision or the product itself became uninteresting. But what happened next was that movies and comics were invented, and they brought us back to a place of needing production: staged scenes, large quantities of film or illustration, etc.With generative AI, you are getting a clip art tool - a highly repeatable way of getting a generic result. If you want the design to be specific, you still have to stage it with a photograph, model it as a scene, or draw it yourself using illustration techniques.And so the next step in the marketplace is simply in finding the approach to a production that will be differentiating with AI - the equivalent of movies to photography. This collapses not the indie space - because they never could afford productions to begin with - but existing modes of mobile gaming, because they were leveraging the old production framework. Nobody has need of microtransaction cosmetics if they can generate the look they want. reply angra_mainyu 13 hours agorootparentprevI couldn&#x27;t disagree more. RPGMaker didn&#x27;t kill RPGs, Unity&#x2F;Godot&#x2F;Unreal didn&#x27;t kill games, Minecraft didn&#x27;t kill games, and Renpy didn&#x27;t kill VNs.Far more people prefer playing games than making them.We&#x27;ll probably see a new boom of indie games instead. Don&#x27;t forget, a large part of what makes the gaming experience unique is the narrative elements, gameplay, and aesthetics - none of which are easily replaceable.This empowers indie studios to hit a faster pace on one of the most painful areas of indie game dev: asset generation (or at least for me as a solo dev hobbyist). reply stuckinhell 13 hours agorootparentSorry I guess I wasn&#x27;t clear. None of those things made games automatically. The future is buying a game making game, and saying I want a zelda clone but funnier.The ai game framework handles the full game creation pipeline. reply owenpalmer 15 hours agorootparentprevPeople who use \"make your own game\" games aren&#x27;t good at making games. They might enjoy a simplified process to feel the accomplishment of seeing quick results, but I find it unlikely they&#x27;ll be competing with indie developers. reply CaptainFever 14 hours agorootparentYeah, and if there was going to be such a tool, people who invest more time in it would be better than those casually using it. In other words, professionals. reply mattigames 9 hours agorootparentNot really, \"I\" can make 2D pictures that look like masterpieces using stable diffusion and didn&#x27;t invest more than 6 hours playing with it, the learning curve is not that high, and people already have a hard time telling apart AI art than those from real 2D masters who have a lifetime learning it, the same thing will happen with making videogames and 3D art.(Yeah nothing of this looks exiting to me, actually it looks completely bleak) reply CamperBob2 13 hours agorootparentprevCareful with that generalization. Game-changing FPS mods like Counterstrike were basically \"make your own game\" projects, built with the highest-level toolkits imaginable (editors for existing commercial games.) reply Vegenoid 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are more amazing, innovative and interesting indie games being created now than ever before. There&#x27;s just also way more indie games that aren&#x27;t those things. reply dexwiz 15 hours agorootparentprevThe platform layer of the \"make your own game\" game is always too heavy and too limited to compete with a dedicated engine in the long run. Also the monetization strategy is bad for professionals. reply CamperBob2 15 hours agorootparentprevFor values of \"dead\" equal to \"Now people who aren&#x27;t 3D artists and can&#x27;t afford to hire them will be able to make games,\" maybe.User name checks out. reply stuckinhell 12 hours agorootparentAI is already taking video game illustrators’ jobs in China https:&#x2F;&#x2F;restofworld.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;ai-image-china-video-game-layof...It feels like a countdown until every creative in the videogame industry is automated. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agoprevSo maybe in a few years we can ask AI to generate a level or entire game. reply Stevvo 7 hours agoprevFantastic, but still useless from a professional perspective. i.e. A mesh that represents a cube as 12 triangles is a better prestation of the form than previous efforts, but barely more usable.Whilst it might not be the solution I&#x27;m waiting for, I can now see it as possible. If an AI model can handle traingles, it might handle edge loops and NURBS curves. reply btbuildem 8 hours agoprevThis is fantastic! You can broad-strokes sketch the key strokes of the shape you want, and this will generate some \"best\" matches around that.What I really appreciate about this is that they took the concept (transformers) and applied it in a quite different-from-usual domain. Thinking outside of the (triangulated) box! reply m3kw9 9 hours agoprevSo you train it with vector sequences that represent furnitures and it predicts the next token(triangles), so how is this different from it ChatGPT was trained with the same sequences and can output all the 3d locations and trangle size&#x2F;lengths in sequence and have a 3d program piece it together? reply KyleLewis 9 hours agoprevCant wait for the \"multimodal\" version that can take a written description and generate meshes reply mclanett 15 hours agoprevThis is very cool.

But how would it work. Are current ai generated images and videos using rasterisation? Will they use rasterisation, path tracing or any other traditional rendering technique, or is will it be an entirely different thing. reply wolfgang805 35 minutes agoparentWhy would a video or an image, something generated without a mesh, be using rasterization? reply toxik 15 hours agoprev [–] This was done years ago, with transformers. It was then dubbed Polygen. reply Sharlin 14 hours agoparentYou might want to RTFA. Polygen and other prior art are mentioned. This approach is superior. reply toxik 14 hours agorootparentI read the article. It has exactly the same limitations as Polygen from what I can tell. reply dymk 14 hours agorootparentTheir comparison against PolyGen looks like it&#x27;s a big improvement. What are the limitations that this has in common with PolyGen that make it still not useful? reply toxik 12 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s as widely applicable as they try to make it seem. I have worked specifically with PolyGen, and the main problem is “out of distribution” data. Basically anything you want to do will likely be outside the training distribution. This surfaces as sequencing. How do you determine which triangle or vertex to place first? Why would a user do it that way? What if I want to draw a table with the legs last? Cannot be done. The model is autoregressive. reply GaggiX 9 hours agoparentprev [–] First, you use the word \"transformers\" to mean \"autoregressive models\", they are not synonymous, second, this model beats Polygen on every metric, it&#x27;s not even close. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I wrote many lines of bare metal C code and want to transit to higher level jobs. I see many expensive or completely free courses, but I am not sure which one is usable in my complicated situation. reply maldev 17 hours agoparentIt depends on what you target. I do alot of Kernel and really low level C++, and it&#x27;s a completely different style than even app dev, so you have to be sure you don&#x27;t go down the completely wrong route.For my target space, there&#x27;s a few rules for c++.Footguns: A. No STL, it causes to much bloat when binary size is critical. B. (almost) No inheritance or virtual functions. Again, it causes some bloat and adds in some instructions and code to support these features that can cause issues in low level environments.Things to learn (All work in the kernel):A. Learn templates, especially c++20. Templates add ZERO bloat, they literally just generate the function again with proper types the same way a macro would.B. Use RAII.C. Use constructors and overloading.D. Zero pointers should be exposed to code except where absolutely needed. If you need to pass by reference, use the c++ style.E. All allocations should be wrapped in a class with RAII. You can overload the operators on the class to make it seem like a pointer so you can still do if(!RAIIPointer).A good video on kernel c++ is here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AsSMKL5vaXw . You can use a surprising amount of C++ language features in the kernel and it makes it extremely smooth and safe if you do it properly. reply Leherenn 16 hours agorootparentI would add constexpr (I guess it might be included with templates?).You can do some nifty stuff like generate CRC lookup tables at compile time without hardcoding them. reply maldev 16 hours agorootparentYes! 100% Right, can&#x27;t believe I left that out. One of the big things is to make sure to use ConstEval if you can do a new verson of c++(20), since ConstExpr isn&#x27;t guaranteed and can leave stuff in the binary that can hurt size or obfuscation. For example one thing I see alot is lookup tables for hashing who use constexpr and hide some key data in there, but it \"may\" just randomly do it, and can cause alot of issues. reply aa-jv 1 hour agorootparentHow does the use of ConstEval address this issue? reply dataflow 11 hours agorootparentprev> No STL, it causes to much bloat when binary size is critical> A. Learn templates, especially c++20. Templates add ZERO bloat, they literally just generate the function again with proper types\"Avoid STL due to bloat but embrace templates\" doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Isn&#x27;t that exactly what code bloat is? Too much code generation? reply Two4 5 hours agorootparentBloat can also refer to the invisible infrastructure code that&#x27;s compiled into a binary when using certain language features. C has a fairly linear relationship to the size of the compiled assembly, iirc, but C++ will vary wildly based on which features you use. reply aa-jv 1 hour agorootparentIndeed, it is a common refrain among C++ programmers to inspect ones binaries, I have found .. reply ska 15 hours agorootparentprevI think you missed exceptions often being a problem in low level and embedded targets. That knocks out most of STL anyway.I also think you are a bit harsh on virtual functions - it introduces a single indirection, yes, but sometimes that is fully justified. RTTI on the other hand... of course depends a bit on target characteristics.Perhaps controversial, I&#x27;ve also found (especially bare) lambdas and even std::function objects useful, although may evolve into something purely static when the dust settled. Highly dependent on target of course.It will be interesting to see the final form of the new MISRA std, since the active one predates all of this. reply corysama 14 hours agorootparentIf you can&#x27;t use the STL because of exceptions: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etlcpp.com&#x2F; reply ska 14 hours agorootparentSure, there are more embedded friendly libraries, but that wasn&#x27;t the topic. reply cjaybo 12 hours agorootparentIt’s almost as if this is some sort of discussion board where people can expand on the topic as they see fit :D reply vodou 14 hours agorootparentprevYou can use quite a lot of STL even with -fno-exceptions. Things that you probably need to ditch are:std::vectorstd::liststd::mapstd::unordered_mapstd::setstd::unordered_setstd::sortstd::transformstd::mergestd::stringstd::regexstd::swapstd::functionstd::stable_partitionBut there are much more than that in STL. reply ska 13 hours agorootparentTrue: \"most\" was a stretch. reply rajeevk 20 hours agoparentprevIf you want to understand the C++ in terms of C code then probably you would need to understand the C++ object model. I mean, how C++ classes are translated into C equivalent code. If you are interested in these you can take a look at a tutorial I wrote long back https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avabodh.com&#x2F;cxxin&#x2F;cxx.htmlIf you want to write bare metal C++ then this page from the above tutorial will be useful https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avabodh.com&#x2F;cxxin&#x2F;nostdlib.html reply indigo945 20 hours agoparentprevWell, you seem to be precisely the target audience for the course linked in this very post: > This open-access course is directed at those who are already familiar with C > and object-oriented programming towards a proficiency level of C++ > programming. reply tialaramex 20 hours agorootparentMaybe, in this context it makes lots of sense, if you know C well there are things which \"just work how you expect\" in C++ and so they need at most a brief refresher.I agree with Kate Gregory that this is a bad way to teach C++ from scratch. That is, if you know only say, Python or Java (or nothing) and want to learn C++, you should not begin by learning C. Kate&#x27;s approach skips many of the things you can do in C++ but you shouldn&#x27;t, whereas if we try to start with C you&#x27;re going to see that a lot, because \"they were legal in C\" is why they&#x27;re allowed in C++ even though they&#x27;re a bad idea and then you have to unlearn things. You&#x27;re maybe expecting some of that if you&#x27;ve years of C programming experience, but there&#x27;s no need to introduce an idea on Monday only to tell students on Tuesday that it&#x27;s a bad idea and they must never do that.The most insidious cases are where something is legal and correct in C but it&#x27;s wrong in C++ yet it will compile and you maybe have broken software. There are some nasty type punning examples, where the pun was an idiomatic C expression which does exactly what you wanted, but in C++ that&#x27;s Undefined Behaviour and all bets are off. You&#x27;d just never teach those type puns in a pure C++ course, they&#x27;re never the Right Thing™. reply butlerm 18 hours agorootparentThere is a considerable divergence of opinion on that subject. In my view, C++ isn&#x27;t remotely suitable as a programming language for someone without a healthy understanding of C. Perhaps a dialect of C++ could be developed that was more of a cousin to Rust, but C++ as we know it is a C like programming language with a very large number of features added and all the ways to fail just like a C program does. There are real world advantages of course, but it is not a language for the faint of heart, not even close. reply rramadass 17 hours agorootparent> C++ isn&#x27;t remotely suitable as a programming language for someone without a healthy understanding of C.I always look askance at folks who say they know C++ but not C. The C++ abstract machine is built over the C abstract machine and it becomes even more clearer when you go down to the binary level. reply gpderetta 16 hours agorootparentDepends what you mean by \"understand C\". As you say, understanding the C abstract machine and memory model is critical for a C++ programmer.Understanding C idioms, the standard library, best practices, and general C software architecture , is less important if not downright negative early in your formation. You will end up picking a lot up anyway if you stick to C++ long enough. reply rramadass 7 hours agorootparent> is less important if not downright negative\"Less important\" maybe but not \"negative\".You have to have a decent C base (not necessarily expert level with knowledge of dark corners&#x2F;tricky idioms&#x2F;etc.) before you start with C++. One example is being comfortable with raw pointers. I often see \"Modern C++\" proponents say you should never use (and by inference learn) raw pointers which is absolutely counter-productive. It is also easier to learn C++ as a \"better C\" in the beginning else it becomes overwhelming. I believe this is the main reason most beginning C++ programmers find the language \"scary&#x2F;difficult&#x2F;huge&#x2F;overwhelming&#x2F;confusing\". They are trying to learn everything at the same time which is an impossibility with a language as baroque as C++. reply zedgondal 19 hours agorootparentprevCan you maybe share some paid&#x2F;unpaid resources to learn C++ from scratch for someone coming from Java and JS? reply tialaramex 14 hours agorootparentKate has a PluralSight course which I have watched (not really to learn C++ but to see her approach) and that seemed decent to me, although of course I can&#x27;t vouch for it having taught what you&#x27;d need coming from Java and JS, not least because my background is far more polyglot including Scheme and the Standard ML for example.I definitely think Bjarne Stroustrup&#x27;s book about his own language isn&#x27;t very good, even in later editions (which correspond to a more modern language) and so I would avoid buying that, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good defence of the language as an idea and I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t an effective tutorial, even if not for being out-of-date. reply HankB99 18 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn&#x27;t address the constraints that are typical in embedded systems such as limited memory (RAM) and the expectation that a program will run forever.There are resources oriented toward embedded C++ that address these (at least memory allocation.)On a project a couple years ago I was pushing to use C++ instead of C, if only as a \"C compiled using the C++ compiler\" for better type checking. I could not convince the project lead, who&#x27;s technical depth far exceeded mine, that the C++ compiler was as likely as the C compiler to produce correct translations. reply gosub100 18 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t worry about the compiler producing correct code, I would worry about the heap eventually fragmenting enough that an allocation fails (perhaps thousands of hours after the program launches). I know C++ offers the ability to supply your own allocator, but it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart. reply lnsru 19 hours agorootparentprevI will go through the course before Xmas. The thing is that in bare metal development even C standard library is not always being used. Recently I wrote some string processing functions for very specific parsing task.

Survey the different ways of programming in C++ i.e. Imperative&#x2F;Object-Oriented&#x2F;Generic&#x2F;Meta-programming and use them as needed in your project without trying to master everything; that will only happen over time as you gain more experience. reply aa-jv 1 hour agoparentprevYou can definitely start putting C++ into your embedded projects, and get familiar with things in an environment in which you&#x27;re already operating. A lot of great C++ code can be found with motivated use of, for example, the platformio tooling, such that you can see for yourself some existing C++ In Embedded scenarios.In general, also, I have found that it is wise to learn C++ socially - i.e. participate in Open Source projects, as you learn&#x2F;study&#x2F;contribute&#x2F;assist other C++ developers, on a semi-regular basis.I&#x27;ve learned a lot about what I would call \"decent C++ code\" (i.e. shipping to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of customers) from such projects. I would suggest finding an open source C++ project, aligned with your interests, and study the codebase - as well as the repo history (i.e. gource) - to get a productive, relatively effortless (if the interests align) boost into the subject.(My particular favourite project is the JUCE Audio library: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juce.com&#x2F; .. one of many hundreds of great projects out there from which one can also glean modern C++ practices..) reply robinhola 19 hours agoparentprevI’d recommend reading Effective C++ books from Scott Meyers and trying to interview for the jobs you’re looking for over taking a course! reply nuancebydefault 14 hours agoparentprevThis is maybe a very unpopular opinion, but if you go from C to a higher level language, I would advise to steer away from C++, certainly if it&#x27;s would be your first OO language. reply ska 15 hours agoparentprevDo you want to do embedded&#x2F;low level c++, or are you looking to transition out of that? reply lnsru 14 hours agorootparentI will get out.

Smart pointers are usually the best way to handle memory management.It&#x27;s definitely useful to learn about \"new\" and \"delete\", because those are the primitives that memory management is built on top of. But it should be followed up with good advice like, rarely use these in practice. You should almost always be using unique_ptr or shared_ptr instead of new&#x27;ing up pointers that you intend to explicitly delete later. reply rightbyte 15 hours agoparent> You should almost always be using unique_ptr or shared_ptrI really wish there was a thread unsafe version of shared pointers, without atomics overhead, in the standard. Maybe without weak pointers. reply lacker 14 hours agorootparentIf there&#x27;s one thing C++ needs, it&#x27;s more slightly-different varieties of smart pointers in the standard. ;-)What exactly would you use these for?

I&#x27;m a C++ n00b, but I thought these can be avoided entirely now. reply kimixa 16 hours agoparentI noted that - IMHO one of the big advantages to \"modern\" c++ is the focus on the lifetime of objects with smart pointers rather than the mechanics of heap allocation and pointers. Pushing that down to chapter 19 as \"Advanced Topics\" seems like a mistake. Arguably the same with std::array vs object[] - the first should \"probably\" be the default now for teaching new programmers, so covered first (or at least highlighted when discussing array[]-style variables)I also note a number of the possibly-ambiguous c-style casts in examples, despite already having mentioned the explicit versions (static_cast and the like).Plus there seems to be a fair bit of system & machine dependent stuff mentioned like it&#x27;s &#x2F;always&#x2F; true - like stack being at a \"higher\" address space than the heap and code sections, or the stack growing down. It also says that the Data section is \"slower\" than the stack which... isn&#x27;t true? If they&#x27;re spilled out of registers, they&#x27;re likely functionally identical? Or at least for small microbenchmarks depend on specific implementation details, like how the pointer to the object is calculated and dereferenced.... And object size and cache interactions... And a million other things...And that&#x27;s just the first few chapters I looked at :P reply doctorpangloss 16 hours agorootparentSmart pointers should really be like, chapters 2-10.In my experience, every useful C++ application requires wrangling some historic smart pointers implementation: Boost, Unreal, libwebrtc, Qt.Even NVIDIA uses its own smart pointers (thrust::device_ptr) though that&#x27;s understandable. Also there&#x27;s stuff like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;65938991&#x2F;how-to-use-lamb... for e.g. TensorRT. reply nitnelave 16 hours agoparentprevYes, in new code you should be able to replace almost all new and delete with unique_ptr, vector or, more rarely, shared_ptr. Placement new can still be useful, but delete not really. There are some patterns where you use new without a delete for a global singleton that is intentionally never deleted, as well.It&#x27;s still useful to learn about the concept when dealing with old code. reply underdeserver 16 hours agoparentprevNot entirely - you can&#x27;t generally use std::make_unique with private constructors. reply jacopoipoi 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s explained later in the course reply alexeiz 15 hours agoprevThis course is a bunch of presentation slides.

On Gentoo I can just emerge gcc or clang and enable whatever USE flags I want, and they are installed and updated automatically with the rest of my system.I use the Gentoo system package manager to manage my Rust toolchain as well instead of using rustup, so that it behaves like described above, it&#x27;s updated and managed automatically and with the rest of my system!I do realize that many distros have issues with software being out of date though, and that is a big problem! With Gentoo I can install multiple versions of most things in parallel and can very easily package anything that doesn&#x27;t exist yet.Also to clarify, I use the system package manager to build and manage my containers, this is how I use the system package manager to manage Rust&#x27;s toolchain but also have it inside of a container.

There may be some benefits, but ultimately your project can easily specify its own compiler version, its own target directory (the default is per-project), etc. There are some shared resources like caches, which you can split if you want to.I can see why you&#x27;d still do this - but, the main reason would be... if you have dependencies on C&#x2F;C++. reply twic 15 hours agorootparentprev> On your common desktop Linux distro, I think C and C++ toolchains are the least difficult to setup and use without a container thoughIn my experience, the hard part is rigorously controlling the libraries a build uses.

Thanks! reply kwant_kiddo 17 hours agoprevOne thing that would have helped me when I started learning C++ was learning the C++ compilation model i.e. translation units.It is surprising how many people look surprised (that also claim they know the language) when you tell them that code in .cpp does not get inlined into other .cpp files no matter what doing compilation. (yes the linker can (and should) do that with LTO doing linking) reply account42 17 hours agoparentCompilation units are mainly about symbol visibility and as you already realized at the end of your comment don&#x27;t have anything to do with inlining as far as the C++ standard is concerned. Neither does the inline keyword btw.The linker doesn&#x27;t inline anything, LTO&#x2F;LTCG is about running (part of) the compile process at link time. But that&#x27;s really no concern for the C++ code but an implementation detail of the toolchain - you could just as well not have a separate link step and instead have the compiler process all compilation units in one step. reply kwant_kiddo 12 hours agorootparentyes, LTO itself does not inline but from a user point of view it does, and that is exactly my point. If you are a beginner and you do not come from C, then you might not think about these things (maybe you do I did not).I get that it is just an implementation detail, but so are many things in C++ and you usually care about these things otherwise you would not be using the language in the first place.Many projects also disable exceptions that is also an &#x27;implementation detail&#x27; (or at least something that is definitely not required by the standard I would imagine), but now you are technically not writing C++ anymore.I guess this is also one important thing when learning C++. The community is very fragmented, and there seems to be disconnect between C++ users and committee. reply ghosty141 17 hours agoparentprevThis also helps understanding why template code completely wrecks compiletimes and ram usage since the compiler cant share template instantiations. This becomes very relevant if template metaprogramming is used in bigger projects. reply fluoridation 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not why. Template processing happens during processing of the translation unit, so it would be expensive even if you only had a single TU in your build. It&#x27;s true that a template has to be reprocessed for each instantiation, however, that&#x27;s not merely from one TU to the next, but even inside each TU! For every distinct value of T for std::vector in a single TU, the compiler has to process and generate std::vector entirely reply enahs-sf 16 hours agoprevC++ was my weapon of choice in college mostly because writing graphics stuff in C required re-inventing the wheel a lot of the time for basic data structures and the STL was pretty slick.Having spent the better part of the last decade writing go though, I think C++&#x27;s syntax is a bit too cluttered. reply charlieyu1 15 hours agoprevJust read the first pdf.

I&#x27;ve heard experienced programmers say that you want to actually pick up a book to learn Rust, and the same is true for C++.Like you can basically hack your way through learning Python or JS. I didn&#x27;t learn Python from a book, for sure.But with C++ and Rust that&#x27;s not an optimal strategy. You have to do both -- do practical projects, and actually study it a bit.There&#x27;s also a huge amount of disagreement about C++, so I think it makes sense to start with a codebase you want to work on, and then ask the people who WROTE that codebase what C++ books and learning materials they like.e.g. Game C++ is kind of different than Google C++, but both are good (they get work done, and multiple people can work together in that style).

If you pick Rust for your product be ready to roll up your sleeves and contribute to the crates you are depending on.

Go was famously created to eventually supplant C++ at Google (or more specifically, solve the issue of long build times). Over a decade later, C++ is very much still in heavy usage at Google.If I were a bettin&#x27; man (or if I were trying to increase my general employment odds), and the choices were between Rust or C++, I would pick C++.That being said, if I were in a comfortable financial position, wanted to scratch a nerd itch, and have fun programming again, I would absolutely pick Rust over C++.But those are two very different scenarios. reply steveklabnik 17 hours agorootparentI certainly do not disagree that C and C++ will be in general usage for a long time, if not forever. However, because the industry is still growing, the proportions change, even as the total number grows in size. C and C++ do not have to die, or even shrink, to become a smaller part of the overall pie, and Rust does not need them to outright die in order to grow and thrive.I agree with you that this is not the first time languages have tried to encroach on the last bastions of the spaces where C and C++ have not yet been ousted as the default choice, but Rust is actually gaining traction in production use-cases in those spaces, unlike many of those languages. reply booleandilemma 18 hours agorootparentprevThank you! reply gosub100 17 hours agorootparentIt really depends on your career goals and whether you&#x27;re doing greenfield or maintenance coding.

Like a code formatter and maybe a linter?Running a formatter and linter in a pre-commit hook is literally using tools to enforce things? reply bayindirh 18 hours agorootparentI have noted elsewhere in the thread, but I think I was unable to express myself very clearly.What I really meant is enforced externally on the programmer, in the form of compiler, development environment setup (from elsewhere) or other guidelines, without any free will to tune or disable them.The layers I add are voluntary, just checks and balances I decided to add myself because I think they help me, and not enforced as part of the language or toolchain I&#x27;m forced to use.IOW, a self-respecting developer striving to do a good job can continuously sharpen themselves iteratively, tuning their processes and fixing the problems they see as they go along their journey.Perhaps pjmlp understood the gist of my comment, and his answer is a pretty nice hit on the head of the subject. Honestly, I&#x27;m coming from a point where programming is more of a passion which pays rather than work&#x2F;job for me, hence I have an inner drive to do my best and improve continuously, and not everyone shares the same set of values or inner drive about programming, and want to be railroaded into an environment where they can do the absolute minimum to get things done. reply cjfd 19 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you. If those tool actually enforced good quality it would be one thing but what is actually being enforced is mediocrity and enforcing the power play of some individuals who have decided for all others what is good. reply desdenova 20 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that we now have languages enforcing safety makes them more desirable than a language that doesn&#x27;t.If I&#x27;m writing a small toy project where I&#x27;m the only person messing with the code, I can totally do it in C, or even raw assembly if I feel like it.If anyone else will ever write to the same codebase, or the code is for a client&#x2F;company, I want every automated static check I can possibly have. reply muststopmyths 18 hours agorootparentprevThat is all well and good on a small team of senior people , but if your project has more than a handful, with mixed experience levels, you want tools to enforce a minimum standard before even getting to code review reply shadowgovt 20 hours agorootparentprevThe biggest problem with C++ isn&#x27;t that you can&#x27;t write clean, structured code with it.It&#x27;s that the language is so vast that the odds of any two developers working on two different projects agreeing on what that means are low. I programmed in C++ for a decade, then for a year or two at a second place, then picked it up again in a third... And all three places had nearly completely different best practice protocols. Pre-processor macros are banned, but deep template abstraction and CRTP abounds. Interface and implementation are separated even when templates demand they be in the same header chain, but here we do so by squirreling away the implementation in a separate file with a non-standard suffix instead of splitting it out but keeping it in the bottom of the same file. In my previous company, we used pointers to indicate the called function could mutate the data... In my new firm, pointers in interfaces are just about banned unless absolutely necessary and we indicate whether data could be mutated via const and documentation.The language is broad enough to let the developer change almost anything, but it is unfortunately broad enough to let competent developers build competing and equivalently (un-)safe styles. reply jeffreygoesto 15 hours agorootparentEmbedded shop?

In practice most of these are unaddressed, Microsoft understandably focused on checks which are never wrong and give actionable advice.\"Guideline support\" does include libraries with classes that e.g. provide a slice which raises an exception on bounds miss, which is something, and it&#x27;s certainly notable that the equivalently named C++ standard library feature is a foot gun† whereas the one in the guideline support library is not, so that&#x27;s a good reason to adopt this. But VS does not in fact ensure you obey all the guidelines, it&#x27;s very much a \"best effort\" approach even with that switched on.† WG21 (The \"C++ Standards Committee\") seems to have concluded that because sometimes the fast way to do something is unsafe, therefore the unsafe way to do something must be faster... as if car executives noticed that 240mph crashes in their flagship sports car were often fatal and concluded that if they re-design their under-performing SUV so that the fuel tank explodes during any collision killing everybody aboard that&#x27;d improve its top speed... reply KMag 17 hours agorootparent> tooling would necessarily have either false positives or false negatives (those are the only options, unless \"both\" counts as another option).Getting stuck in an infinite loop and never producing an answer is a 4th possibility for attempted solutions at deciding undecidable problems. reply tialaramex 16 hours agorootparentGood point.

    "originBody": "KAREN LAUR: You just go over the mountains over here, and you're in high desert. You get past Ellensburg, and it's high desert. So I spent a lot of time out there getting reference. Most of the reference came from Eastern Washington. I did a drive out to the Columbia Gorge and took a lot of photos and also a lot of just reference imagery of just like, hey, this is what desert looks like, and big cliffs and stuff like that. That drive was two days. It was eight hours down, eight hours back. And I'm not even sure I spent the night. I did, I must have done, spent the night down there. So while it was definitely made for the Southwest, the local reference was out in the Columbia Gorge. ANNOUNCER: Good morning, and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research facility personnel. - My name is Mike Harrington. I was a co-founder at Valve. I wasn't really used to big companies. When I started at Microsoft, it wasn't that big. It was like 1500 people, like a big high school. Nine years later it was significantly bigger. And I was like, oh, this place is too big. And, you know, that was still like 1996. So they had a long ways to go. I told my managers like a year before, like, I'm leaving. I'm leaving in a year, and I'm gonna start a game company. And the first person I talked to was a good friend of mine, Michael Abrash. But at that time, he was trying to do something within Microsoft. And by the time it made sense, John Carmack had convinced him to go work at id, so how could he say no to that? And then I was having lunch with Gabe and I said, Gabe, I'm leaving. I'm just gonna leave, and I'm gonna start a game company. He goes, I wanna leave. I wanna start a game company. I go, alright. And that was it. - On the surface, we should have failed, and realistically, both Mike and I thought we would get about a year into it, realize we'd made horrible mistakes, and go back to our friends at Microsoft and ask for our jobs back. But we did think that we knew a fair bit about software development, that there were expertise that goes into it. I think we also had some pretty clear ideas of how to design a company, right? So when we were building Half-Life, we were also designing Valve at the same time. - We had no plan, except for by then, like I mentioned, Michael had gone to id, and he said, oh, you're starting a game company. You have to use our engine. So Gabe and I flew down to Mesquite to meet id. We spent a good deal of time with John Romero, and he told us like, this is what you need to do to start a game company. You need to go out and hire some level designers and do that kind of thing. And we kind of understood the engineering part. And then, because we were Michael's friends, we walked away with the source code to Quake that day. We had no contract yet. We had kind of an idea of what it could be, and they just gave us a CD. And we had kind of the crown jewels of id. And that, you know, game on. DAVE RILLER: I think most of us had no game development experience. We were either amateurs working in our homes at night for fun, or we, some people were from the software world, but they had never worked on a game. I think we had three or four people in the entire company who had actually shipped a game when we started Half-Life. We have to figure out what is Valve's first game. So we have to come up with an IP. So everything is done from scratch. - Gabe came into the office, and he said, I read this story. I read this Stephen King story called The Mist. You know, it's Stephen King. It's got monsters, people in a grocery store, fog comes in, monsters in the fog. Use your imagination. We didn't wanna write that as a game. That wasn't really the point. But it was just the tension and how it felt. - Well, it was interesting. At first we had two games. Greg was working on Prospero, and then Half-Life was originally called Quiver. - My job was then build a team and figure out another game for us to build. That'll be the second game Valve ships. What features should it have? How is it gonna be different from a normal first person shooter? - Every time the engine got a feature for Prospero, Half-Life stole it. And then Half-Life just started getting visually more impressive and cooler. And eventually it just, yeah. Because it was gonna ship sooner, it just stole the resources from Prospero. And Prospero just faded away. - So it had this character who had like a floating orb, and it had, wanted to have some effects on it. This kind of magical energy something. And so I worked with them on that and came up with the first version of the beam effects. And they were using it. They were happy with it. And then people on Half-Life are coming over and are like, what is that? Where did, how did you do that? So very quickly that got into Half-Life. The disaster sequence has kind of beam effects all over it. And we ended up using it for the Vortigaunts. [GUNSHOTS] [VORTIGAUNT YELLING] - There were a bunch of things that we were doing that we thought would help us tackle the problem of what video games were. And what video games were were a rapidly changing field where at the time, 90% of video games failed to turn a profit. And a few percentage of them were, were very, very profitable, right? So it was a field that really valued talent. - Like I said, Gabe and I brought some people, and then from there on out, we had to hire people. And, Romero said you got to hire level designers. So we found some people who had industry experience. - Worked on Rise of the Triad first as a pixel artist, and then went with Duke Nukem, and then everything just went nuts. But I was sitting in my office one day, and my phone rang just out of the blue. And I pick it up, and it's this recruiter. Eventually he hooked me up with Gabe, and they flew me up here. It was a big surprise. - But then we started looking. The nice thing that we had is we had a whole bunch of people in the world who had been working on mods. And so we could start looking at those folks, and that's where we hired a lot of our designers. - Steve and Guthrie, Steve Bond, John Guthrie were my favorite hires by far. Other than Doug. [LAUGHING] Gabe sent them an email and they're like, who is this scammer? Never heard of these guys. Just kids. Like barely 20, I swear. And they show up, and they're just the most creative, brilliant-- - Clever. - Oh, fucking clever. Steve had the magic ability to make stuff fun. - The fact that those guys had been hired to go work on some game for some company, I think that was the start for a lot of people that something cool is gonna happen because those guys were already doing stuff that was cool. MIKE: And then Marc showed up and like, Marc actually knows how stories work. You know, beginning, middle, end and all this stuff. And he had all sorts of great ideas. And he also would just bring good ideas out of everybody else as well. - Like the person who wrote more code on Half-Life was a chemistry major who decided to be an IP lawyer in Atlanta, right? And he ended up writing more code than anybody else. Or the creature designer for most of the AI for the creatures in the game was a manager at a Waffle House. It's not like there are a bunch of people that you could say, oh, this person has a PhD in video game design. It was that combination of both finding those people when it wasn't necessarily easy to find them at that stage in the video game industry, and then also convincing them that it was a better place to work than anybody else. - One of the things that I definitely learned was how to hire engineers. And, you know, we needed some engineers. - For us anyway, we had licensed id's engine. You know, we were using the Quake Engine. And one of the things me and some of the other engineers, probably Ken, were talking about was if it would be possible to use the save system to kind of like join our levels together in a really seamless way. So you'd get to the end of the level, save stuff, and then load some of it on the next level and have it just feel like the world's all connected. - And so we had like every once in a while, a hallway or the train would get to a point, and you would have a little stop for the level to transition. And so he wrote that code leveraged on top of just the save load code to do the transitions. And I think in Half-Life 1 we got, most of the transitions were a second or two. - I remember when we went from 8-bit to 16-bit, like, hey, we don't have to have all our textures fit in a certain 256 colors. That was a huge liberation. JAY: The two tech investments we made for Half-Life was to get to 16-bit color and skeletal animation for all the monsters. - But at the time it was completely revolutionary. Your Quake characters were, it's like a text file of vertex positions over time. - I wanted so much more animation, and I wanted to the animators to to have the freedom to put in 100, 200, 500 frame of animation if not more. And then you can do all sorts of other things because you have a skeleton. So it's like, oh, I can hook on a gun to a character. I can start to make changes of characters and replay the same animation or reuse most of the same model. So it can swap out heads, we can swap out this, we can swap out whatever. - Like all the technology that went into the game to make it as fun as it is was not available one generation before. So licensing the Quake engine, which was very mature and had level designers who'd grown up just goofing around with it. - I wasn't into heavily into scripting since back into Doom. Like my old Doom levels have a lot of weird, odd events in them. I think I asked Ken, is it possible that I could have access to the character's animation, like a trigger, like what I mentioned, I could make the guys go into an animation, I could make them run, and then I would configure everything. It was all hack. This is total hacky stuff. And that is mostly what I built. It was like things like characters reacting and jumping out or made to look like. Or I'd push, I'd use a push brush to throw a headcrab out to make it look like it launched at something. CHUCK: Or if a loud sound happened-- BRETT: They would respond, yeah. CHUCK: Would cower. KEN: So Gabe's dictate was, as you walked forward, something needs to happen like every three to five seconds. The player stands still... DOUG: Didn't have to be much. KEN: ...the universe can be quiet. But if they move forward, if they're active, the universe needs to play back something needs to do something, even if it is a scripted sequence or-- DOUG: Or even just a interesting sign or something. KEN: A sign, or a sound, or some vignette or something. So I came up with this interaction method where you could do little AIs where the characters would talk and interact with you a little bit. And then we wanted to do spectacle,and that was scripted sequences where you could tell a character, you need to run here and then jump into this animation, and then have a bunch of you all synchronize your animation. 'Cause it's somebody flying through the air, they're smashing something, or they're doing something like that. DOUG: Yeah. And then test it and then figure out like, oh, this is real easy to break. That was the roughest thing about scripted sequences where we'd have like a headcrab jumping on a scientist or something. And it's like, yeah, it works totally fine 90% of the time, but some people just sprint right at the scientist. And sometimes we had to put 'em behind glass. KEN: Sometimes getting the level designers, making the player want to do the thing that gives them the most fun is a very subtle art. CHUCK: The tentacle sequence is probably the one I remember the most. BRETT: You're playing it, right? That was the first time I think they melded together with play so closely. CHUCK: Because you had your trigger, and we wanted it to be triggered. So by the time you start to see it, you see the scientist flying through the air and hitting the wall. Then you could, you could look in, and you could see the scientist being carried away. The tentacle itself is separate. It's on its own. And you bring the two together, mesh 'em together, and boom. BRETT: It felt so seamless though. And that for me was like, moments like that. And that might've been the first one is when you start to see the the scripted events and play start to blend a little bit more than just ambience. - For god's sake, open the silo door. They're coming for us! It's our only way out. Oh my God, we're doomed. DAVE: I remember Brett in particular had done some of the lab scenes where scientists would walk from one area to another and just look at a monitor. And they just, it gave them a little bit of life. A ton of the work that went into that area was because we knew it was gonna be the beginning in the game, and we really needed to make it a vibrant and interesting, fun place to be and explore. - So originally they were designed to sort of be behind glass. They were just designed to be spectacle. - Yeah. Little vignettes. - And then all of the level designer's like, no, no, I'm gonna put that right in front of you. And I'm like, oh God, how am I supposed to make this work? It's not supposed to do it. - Get away from there, Freeman. I'm expecting an important message. -The run speed for the player was so insane. KEN: Yeah. DOUG: It was like, what, 25 miles an hour or something? KEN: It was sprinting. It was. DOUG: You could get so far, so fast. And so you'd either have to make the script a sequence like so quick that you could barely see what's happening. Most people weren't looking in the right place anyway, so, you know, you'd have to like get their attention with like a particle or a sound or lighting or something. And then you wanted them to see what was happening. But when we playtested, and it's like a scientist was like being pulled into a vent or something, like people wouldn't just stop and be like, oh. Sometimes they would, they'd be like, oh wow, look at that. They'd just like, just run straight ahead and just start shooting. - It's hard when you think back to it to recognize that those kind of interactive moments were so new. Like people just hadn't seen them. KEN: It was worth it because no other games were doing that. No other games had that interactivity. No other games had that spectacle playing out in front of you. And it just added that whole feel of Half-Life. Gabe had started to develop this theory around interactivity, and the environment needed to let you do what you wanted and then react to it. So if you did something, if you shot your gun, there needed to be a bullet hole in the wall. If you did a thing people needed, you know, other characters needed to react. The world is acknowledging you exist. The world is acknowledging all of your actions. And that's a huge part of reinforcement. [SIREN] [GUNSHOT] - And you'd have these conversations where you'd be sitting in a design review and somebody'd say, that's not realistic. And you're like, okay, what does that have, like, explain to me why that's interesting. Because in the real world, I have to write up lists of stuff I have to go to the grocery store to buy. And I have never thought to myself that realism is fun. I go play games to have fun. And so we had to come up with some notion of what fun was. We knew it was an ad hoc definition, and it was the degrees to which the game recognizes and responded to the players' choices and actions, right? In behavioral science, you would say we were explicitly talking about what were reinforcers and what the reinforcement schedules were. Right? At that point in time, that was a useful way of making design decisions. [METAL CREAKING] The point I would make is, if I go up to a wall and shoot it, to me, it feels like the wall is ignoring me. I'm getting a narcissistic injury when the world is ignoring me. So does this... Like to me, I was trying to convey to the user a sense of yes, you were making choices. Yes, you were progressing, which meant the game had to acknowledge that back view. If you shoot at a wall, there have to be decals. If you kill a bunch of marines, the marines have to run away from you. Right? You have to have this sense of the game acknowledging and responding to the choices and actions and progressions that you've made. Otherwise it loses any, any sort of impact. HARRY: Ted and I, we were on the same page in terms of what the game should look like, which would be just sort of alien in a very naturalistic kind of way. Like these are, these are creatures from another dimension, another planet that look like they evolved in a way. And Chuck had a very, he came from Duke Nukem. He'd made a bunch of monsters that went in a sort of a different direction. And for awhile the game had a hard time coalescing around a single vision. - All the ones that looked like genitals were Ted's. [LAUGHING] And all the ones with shiny bits that look like alien soldiers were Chuck's. - That was a thing when I first came in, Ted's style and mine. BRETT: And trying to figure that out. CHUCK: Trying to find the harmony between the two to make it work. BRETT: Yeah. CHUCK: Ted had, he was, he really liked the Wayne Barlow aesthetic, and I had a little bit different, but it worked. Ted made these really weird. He did the headcrab, you know, that's pretty much the symbol of it all. And I remember taking his headcrab and putting it on a scientist and making the zombie. Right. Well, we pretty much had, we talked and it's like, okay, we'll do, you do that? And Ted did the soldiers, I did the scientists. I did a lot of the aliens. And with the hornet gun I did. did the hornet gun for that one as well too. You know the alien slave? Well I did some animations for the bull squid, or bull chicken. I have to call him that. But that's a Ted creature there. The houndeye was Ted's as well. BRETT: Yeah. A lot of the fleshy, if it's got like over, like a lot of flesh on it, maybe too much-- CHUCK: Yeah. - That's Ted, that's a Ted-ism. You can always tell Ted's designs, because they're much more aquarium than... Aquarium and/or, like Unspeakables, you know? - Oh, Big Mama. I forgot about Big Mama. Oh God. - It's like, you know, it's a testicle, right, Ted? - That's just so disturbed. - I concepted a guy in sort of a NASA spacesuit, a scientist guy. He was actually modeled after a couple of programmers I know, big beefy, bearded Linux programmers, you know? And so that's where the HEV suit sort of emerged out of. There was a lot of desire for not having a Space Marine or a soldier be the guy. And then Chuck Jones went off and did a pretty different version of him that became known as Ivan the space biker. - Oh God. I remember telling myself, it's like, anytime you make a screenshot, make sure it's good. 'Cause you don't know where this is going to appear again. - We didn't know that. - And Ivan is the prime example of that one. So you're looking at it. Well, go look at Quake. It's like, okay, I'm looking at that, and he's got this incredibly boxy head. And you're always hearing don't put too many polys in it. And it's like, okay, so Ivan got the the, the square head. And it was kind of an early, just a rough prototype of a Gordon Freeman baby. And I remember, we didn't know what Gordon looked like. So it's like, I was looking for somebody, and I found Mike Harrington. And It's like, Mike, what does Gordon look like? He said, I don't know, put yourself in there. It's like, oh, okay, okay. And so I went in and, and put kind of my likeness on the early Gordon model in the game. And it kind of stayed there. BRETT: Did you have a ponytail? - Well, I was ex tattoo artist, so yeah, I definitely had. - Ah. - I don't, I don't have anything to work with now. But yeah, at that point, I had a ponytail on. - If you play the game, you know that it's Chuck, if you play multiplayer and see the model. CHUCK: But yeah, if you look on the back of that, there's this little four triangles, and he's got a little ponytail back there. I did the G-Man. And again, that one was, Gabe was talking about the cigarette man from X-Files. So we needed our own equivalent of that. - Because after a while, after playing with the game for a whole, for a long time people realize like, hey, we made this character. And just in this one office scene in the beginning, where he is behind the window and he is talking to a scientist or something, and then he's like, he looks really creepy. It was late in the day that we thought, oh, okay, well he's gonna be the big bad behind all of this. Like scatter him around in places that you can't get to him. But he's there mysteriously. - There wasn't enough in the beginning of the game. It's like, we need another monster. Headcrabs weren't enough. It got kind of repetitious. I think I grabbed Ted and said, I need them to do this and this. And so he whipped it out in not much time at all. I'm gonna get the timing just right, and I have no time to do this. I'm just gonna bang it out. And then once it was working, everybody said, oh, let's go back and sprinkle them back in the maps. And that was this-- - Yeah. Because then we introduced them a little earlier than we were planning. - Yeah. Because they, they ended up being, they weren't real tough. They weren't supposed to be tough. DOUG: But they were ranged. KEN: But they were ranged, and they were fun, and they had a big show, and like, that was showing off a bunch of stuff. DOUG: I remember the assassin came in pretty late. KEN: That was it. It was like, okay, I have a week and a half. It was already done. It was already all modeled, already all animated. And the requirement was it couldn't have any new animations and any new anything, so had to come up. I grabbed a bunch of Steve Bond's AI, and banged that thing out. I built a level, super crude, but it had all the right spacing and all the right heights and all the right geometry. - Again, it's just a presentation where this, this creature gets to shine. This enemy gets to shine and is your entire focus for that scene. And it's kind of a memorable experience 'cause it's, it just takes place in a different fashion than other encounters. You get knocked out, and there's all kinds of, like, the lights go out and you get dragged through corridor and things. So again, it's something you remember in the game. - And if they find the body? - Body? What body? TED: We just did a lot of playtesting and did a lot of level building and used all of the monsters. and used everything that we had developed, and started seeing which ones kind of stuck out a little oddly. Like we had the houndeyes that Ted had concepted, and Kelly had done great sounds for 'em. And so they seemed like a very oddly plausible sort of alien creature. And Chuck did what we called the panthereye, which was this big black panther looking creature that also just had a big red eye for his face and a big shark fin coming out the back. And design-wise, he seemed like a, oh, this is a very useful creature. You know, it's like when you design things, you know, you like to have a gradient of difficulty, a gradient of escalation in threat. And so if we had these hound eyes, then oh yes, this like panther, bigger, scarier looking thing would be more of a threat. It was in the game for a long time and then sort of just worked its way out because folks couldn't find a way to incorporate a creature like that into the environment and make it seem reasonable. CHUCK: The stooka bat was, it was something that I had did. Just a weird, another creature from the air. We had the chub toad that we were gonna use as a feeding animal to help. And yeah, they had a mechanic to where they were going to use this to distract monsters so you could possibly get by. And it pretty much reached fruition to where we created the object. But then again, time became the factor, and it had to get cut. - I grew up just outside DC |and so there's all these like, big, really banal office buildings, and that's kind of the direction I went. So it started becoming a facility. And so I started making these kind of linoleum tiles, and the drop ceiling, the concrete block wall, the black and white tile floor. - She was like the texture artist for a long, like for most of the game. It's just an overwhelming amount of work. KAREN: Originally I was hand painting all of the textures, and you can really see a shift in some of 'em where they go from hand painted to photo reference. The photo references are much, much better. [LAUGHING] So I was all over Seattle, Harbor Island, Gasworks Park, getting rusty metal things. What can I get good pictures of that is vaguely industrial and interesting to look at, and then how can we use this? And so, you know, sides of boxcars, and I don't know how many hallways in Half-Life are the side of a train car kind of thing. The Kirkland Costco. Lot of time in the Kirkland Costco getting just packages of I don't know why I needed snacks or something. DOUG: The first year was all about opportunity, and it, you know, it wasn't quite as focused. We were trying, we were finding our footing. KEN: We were getting into the three months before supposedly shipping in 97. And it's like, this isn't gelling. This is really not good. This is like a quick knockoff, cash grab, stupid, and let's not do that. There was a lot of disconnect between what all of the different groups were doing, what engineering was doing, and what level design was doing and what animation was doing. We had a bunch of monsters that had no plans to get in the game 'cause nobody else was assigned to work on them. And we had a bunch of levels that like, what's supposed to go in here? Oh, I don't know, everybody's gonna do a bunch of stuff. And like, no, that doesn't work that way. - So here we were, all these people doing all these cool things and just, everything's just this random collection of oh, here's a cool moment and a cool this. And you know, and then it's gone and you know, oh, now on to the next thing. Because the way we were building the game was every level designer was kind of his own silo, his own universe. And I think that just grew out of our kind of mod developer roots. But it wasn't cohesive, and it certainly didn't have a strategy for like maximizing any of that stuff. - You must have been in the meeting when we reviewed all the levels. It was like the first time everybody piled into a room. And Gabe had his crazy Hellraiser chair with the beautiful Mac monitor, and we played. For two days, he played everyone's levels. But I remember one moment he turned around, he was like this with his hair. He's going, we're gonna fail. We're gonna fail, we're gonna fail. And I was just like, I was like, it blew me away. I was like, oh shit, this isn't good. - You know, we were doing our best trying to make this game and the story. And we had a schedule from Sierra, and it was a tight schedule. And we told them like, we're not gonna ship this. And we realize that you're not gonna pay us to continue developing this, but we're going to do it anyway. - Late is just for a little while. Suck is forever. Right? We could try to force this thing out the door, but that's not the company we want to be. That's not the people we want to be. That's not the relationship we want to have with our customers. - And so we kind of, Kelly and I kind of sat down and, and sort of tried to take an inventory of all the cool stuff we had built and why weren't we just, you know, building more on top of that. And those discussions kind of led to our us building this kind of, design cabal process to try to give some cohesion to the game and kind of changing the way we were approaching it. - And so a cabal was a small group of people, a multidisciplinary group. You know, there's like an art, artists, level designers, engineers, and you know, everything. And in that, small team that would write up a spec for a level. There was the arc that Marc had written. So we knew how that fit into the story. - And we got a small group of people together and we started with the beginning. And we went through how literally what map do we need to build to tell us the story we're gonna have to tell, and then what does that connect to, and what's the next piece and the next piece. - The strongest and most influential thing that came out of them was, to me, the sketches. And they were really the visual meeting notes, right? MIKE: We came up with a formula for how that worked. We had a certain percentage of the time where you were fighting, certain percentage of the time where you're exploring, a certain percentage of the time where you're solving puzzles. And so we could apply that uniformly through the game. And that worked pretty well. - Testing, testing, everything seems to be in order. - Good morning. And welcome to the Black Mesa Transit system. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa research facility personnel. The whole opening of the game was specifically a reaction to how all the other first person shooters were, whether they had cutscenes or not. Like sometimes like they would just open without a cut scene. But you know, you're standing in a room with a gun and you're gonna, there's a thing attacking you. So we could look at examples of all that, and I think there was expectation that that's what Half-Life had to do because every other game was doing it. - I can't tell you the number of people who started up the game, were staring at it, and then accidentally bumped their mouse and realized this is live. - Yeah. - And as simple as that sounds, it was mind blowing for so many people 'cause it was too much going on. This isn't real time, this is a recording. - That was sort of the way we, you know, stumbled through a lot of the new narrative tricks was like, well what can we do? You could do this in a movie or a story, but nobody's doing this in first person shooters. - You're this anonymous scientist, and you're riding on this train into work, and rolled the credits at the beginning. It was kind of like a cinematic experience, almost like, I don't think games had really gone down that road. It's so funny to look at it now because it's so primitive. But at the time it felt like you were really in this Black Mesa world. - Pre-disaster survived from the first year. So a lot of that geometry was from that first version of the game but in a very minimal way. Just some, the basic style of some of the hallways, the curved corners in the hallways, things like that. They more became sort of like Lego pieces that John could use and stitch together and extrude. And I know Brett did a lot of the raw geometry from pre-disaster and then John did most of the work to ship it. And then the post and the train ride was all John, I think. - The sector C. So those were heavily influenced by NASA control rooms with my favorite green hammerite, really influenced a lot of like the starting, we started with the kind of the consoles. I'm trying to remember. And then there was just lots of hallways, and people were getting lost. And I did the color stripes to help people follow them places. - One of the things that was actually super exciting was how quotidian, a lot of it really was. You know, the lunchroom with the microwave. You'd press the button, and would go splat. - My god, what are you doing? - Yeah. All this work so you can start a microwave and blow up some soup, which was a reference to real life because that happened regularly. Like we regularly accidentally blow up soup. - That was later mostly, wasn't it? - There were a few people who were just challenged with kitchen appliances and at one point we had a company fire. We had a lot of things going on in that kitchen. - All of that stuff had a real kind of eloquence that in the late nineties, in a world where everything was so over the top. But we still got to go on flights of fancy. - Welcome to the HEV. - I think like a super pivotal moment for me was when we came in this one morning and we saw the test chamber sequence that Kelly and John Guthrie, and Wedge was in that office, and Dario, Driller, they were all in this corner dark office where so much cool stuff happened. But so Kelly and John stayed up all night and did the test chamber sequence. And it's pretty much like the one we shipped. - That was a lot of what went on in that room that we called the submarine. It was just improvisation, you know, just what can we do to solve this problem? How do we connect what's happening before to what's happening after? This needs to be somehow important, but we just don't know what to do. - John and I talked about it. I went home that night, and I sort of sketched out like, you know, maybe we could do something cinematic. We'll take the camera away, we'll turn the lights off, we'll do sounds, we'll just throw everything we can at it. We built that basically that day. It was just a sort of a one day throw it together. That's how fast we were moving. - They had audio, right? We had the script. - Yeah. Yeah. It's like the heartbeat and the breathing, all that stuff was in there. And I played through it and it was like, damn, I have not seen this in any medium in anything before, experienced something like this where this immersive experience of this actually happening like this. And at that point it's like, okay, I see what it is we're doing. And it's this kind of immersive, unbroken experience that happens to you, the player. And then that was this key principle about how we never take you out of that role. - Personally, the difference between before the disaster sequence and after disaster sequence, I felt we really had, I had an understanding that this product was gonna be special or it was gonna be possible it was gonna be tied together. Whereas before that there was a lot of really good stuff and a lot of little things all disconnected. But we, man, well you guys managed to tie two very different parts of the game together really well. And I thought, okay, now I feel like we're on a track for finishing this product. To me, it it shifted my brain to have a lot of confidence that this product's coming together rather than just generating a lot of content that exists independently of other content. - One of the ways we were funding our development was we sold a preview copy of Half-Life to a video card company. I forget which one. And so they had in their contract that we had to deliver it to them by a certain date. And we got like the first three levels done for them. It was, it was really a good milestone for us just, you know, from working as a company. 'Cause hey, there was a deliverable. We got it done. And you know, we shipped off to them, and then I swear the next day it leaked. And I was just livid at first, which was stupid. But I was just like, agh, I can't believe you guys let this get out. Like, you know, this wasn't us, you know? And then it turned into something amazing where people started playing it and it was all over. And we started seeing it online, what people are thinking about it. And I forget which magazine who said, usually we don't review beta software, but they reviewed it and said, this is awesome. And that gave us a tremendous amount of confidence. It was an outside validation of what we were trying to do, that it was the right thing. DOUG: I think just with first person shooters already kind of, they were kinda like the vowels of, of weapons you put into first person. You gotta have a shotgun, and there's obviously a pistol, you need your, your weapon that's going to make you struggle, drive you to get another weapon. KEN: That was a lesson in how to make all of your weapons as orthogonal as possible. So each one did something completely different. All the crazy weapons, those are my fault. So I did like the rocket launcher, and the Gauss gun, and the snarks. - I like snarks. Snarks always made me laugh. It was just always funny to watch people run away from the snarks. - The squeak grenade. Yeah, it's called the snark. But I wanted something, a little creature that you could bring up and hold, and you could throw it out, and it would just start running. 'Cause people were camping, and everybody hated campers at that point. So you wanted the anti-camp weapon, but it was kind of, you could literally find a little hidey hole and just sit out there and just throw out 30 of 'em. And they're all over the map. I had a cat and you, you'd sit there, you'd do your finger. Blue, yeah. You'd do your finger towards him, and he'd get mad at you, and he'd swat. So that was the inspiration for that particular animation. And then the other, that big, uh, alien creature with the, um, we, we needed some kind of alien weapon. Drew that one, built that one, animated that one, but that was also another one that would, whenever you would, you could get in a corner and just shoot them in the air 'cause the hornets would track. I think that was the biggest thrill is brainstorming these with your crew, making them, building them, putting them in the game, and then playing with them. And then they're fun. - So there's sort of a trope of having a melee weapon. I think it was Steve Bond and Ken Birdwell and I were saying we wanted a device where the world was reacting to. It was really goes back to that theory of fun. But we were just running around like idiots smacking the wall. It's an odd thing to know in retrospect, but at the time it felt profoundly satisfying to be able to smack walls. And that was just an example of how that fairly abstract notion of what fun was ended up translating into a set of decisions that were really visceral. When you're going around whacking a wall, a crowbar is an obvious thing to whack the wall with. [WOOD BREAKING] [CREATURE NOISE] [GUNSHOTS] [FOOTSTEPS] [GUNSHOTS] [MACHINE WHIRRING] - If the sound could let you know what's going to happen, that really makes it powerful. So we're always on the lookout for that in level design and monster design communicating because the AI is often hidden from the player. So we use the sound to broadcast the internal state of the AI. You know, soldiers, they tell you, I'm injured, I'm gonna throw a grenade, I'm taking cover. You know, they are broadcasting as constantly as they can, what's about to happen. So it was really important to try to keep those states distinct so that as you play the game, you're actually, whether you're aware of it or not, you're starting to be able to tell what's about to happen. [WOOSH] - We knew he was a musician too, so he could do sounds, but you know, he also decided he was gonna write the sound engine. And then he wrote the soundtrack, and he'd never written a soundtrack before. And he wrote the whole, you know, soundtrack for the game. And it won an award, and it was crazy. - There just weren't that many of us. I had a little bit of a background playing music. I understood the sound engine really well. So it was really easy for me to just hook sounds in, and I understood enough about the level design side that I could kind of connect those things a little bit. The sounds could come from anywhere, and then I just heavily modified them. Usually those are animal sounds, reversing changing the pitch, chopping them up and rearranging them. Headcrabs were rats. The little squeaky. Yeah, that's a rat slowed way, way down. And then reversed. - Yeah. The DSP stuff was another cool thing that Kelly built when you got in a vent, it sounded like you were in a vent. And that wasn't really happening I guess in, at least in Quake and other games I was playing back then. - You know, we had these huge silos, these cavernous spaces. The day they had their own echoey DSP, it made an enormous difference, right? You believed the space. - Kelly tells me, oh god, Chuck Jones asked him if he could, if the characters could speak and have their mouths move. And Kelly said, you know, that's super easy. I could just look at the audio and and see if they're talking, and do that, but like getting their mouths to move is stupid, he says to me. And I, look, Chuck Jones told me the same thing. I told him, making the mouths move was super trivially easy, but knowing when they're talking and knowing how to follow the envelope of the speech would be impossible. And Kelly and I just both looked at each other and like, oh. And so I went back to my office, and he went back to his office, and I think within an hour the characters were talking and their mouths were moving. And it was only because we sat there at lunch bitching about an animator who was 100% right. - Why are you leaving me here? Scientist conversations, Kelly and I made that. When they're next to each other, one scientist will occasionally play a question, and the other one will give him an answer. And it's not a script. It just might be, it might not always make sense. - I am rather looking forward to this analysis, aren't you? - I don't think so. But it had a bunch of personality. It was really cool. And it worked on getting those guys to look at you and turn their heads. - When we first added the ability for scientists to respond to the player and other things in the environment, we call 'em what response rules. The first time that went in they came flying down the elevator, and one of 'em looks at you and goes, oh, hello Gordon. [LAUGHING] And then they explode into pile of jibs at the bottom. - Hello. The automatic diagnostic and announcement system welcomes you to the Black Mesa research facility. Remember to have a secure day. - I hadn't really started working on the biggest part of the game, which I ended up shipping, which was surface tension. Prior to then a lot of the work that I had done was the alien research labs, which turned into questionable ethics. And all of that was ditched. Though some concepts that made it through, everything was rebuilt from zero. But you know what did make it through was power up. Yeah. Basically that geometry survived completely intact. It was so closely designed for that creature that because the creature survived, the levels survived along with it. Yeah. There's this sort of central circular thing where you have to rotate the train. You have to kill the Gargantua first, 'cause he was always defending the way out. I mean, you have to go to, you have to go to like another area which looks very much like it was designed for Quake because pretty much it was. [LAUGHING] There was a flooded pump room, and you have to drain the generator. And then you could switch the power on and then you could take the train out. Yeah, I remember him being totally central to this whole thing. And then, well, how do we block the player? Which is, I mean that's pretty much like design point number one for all level design. Okay, well how do we prevent the player from just walking straight out through the exit, and you design backwards from there. - In the first year we built a lot of world space, a lot of track as we call it. And the programmers would try to fit the AI into the existing maps. What we did the second year was we built the AI in very constrained environments that showcased the AI. Let's make the ideal space for the AI and then give that to the level designers to incorporate those elements into their map so that it worked better and was more interesting. And that Gargantua was an example of that. And the grunts especially. - Yeah, we had the AI that Steve had been working on, and he had designed all these interesting encounters with them just in his test map. And so he had had 'em up high and down low. And so basically we just gotta re-leverage that. Say, okay, let's, let's start with the player comes in low, and there's a marine on the same level. And then the next one they're up high, and then he'd come running down. 'Cause it was really neat to see them retreat. They'd try to run back up the stairs and try to flank you from another side. - So Steve Bond, like I mentioned earlier, was this really young guy who had been making mods in QuakeC. Really the designer for so much of the AI, I mean all the stuff that's good about the soldiers, the grunts you fight in Half-Life. - Yeah. We had a little bit of a language that we could sort of use to say, you know, this is a place they can climb. This is a place they can jump to. This is a good place to hide. These are good places to go in general or interesting places. So, you know, the AI had a little bit of help. - We were trying to build something that utilized, you know, the train technology that Jay was working on. And we thought, well, let's give the players something that they can control, but in a limited way. We couldn't do vehicles like you see in Half-Life two. So we did this, the most constrained vehicle we could think of, which was the train. Players didn't always bring the train with them. And so you had a bunch of these poor people walking down these tunnels. - Oh, is that why you electrified the rail? - Yeah. And the rails were, that was part of the feedback. - Kept dying from that. - Part of the feedback was, well you can just bypass all this. So we made the rails electric. It's like, well maybe that'll teach them to use, bring the train with them. But the basic idea was, let's explore that and then also reveal some of the hidden deep parts of the base. You know, the abandoned areas where you might get a lot more of the Xen creatures. You know, we had designed some of the, some of the ones that didn't make it into the game to appear there, bats that would dive bomb you and while you're on the train. - Stooka bats. - Yeah, stooka bats. And then we also tried hard to not make it feel like it was the super linear thing. So we tried to give little branches, and so there were some challenges there. - Well there is a, there was a really good sketch that Kelly Bailey made, which basically charted surface tension, and it was pretty extensive. Like it went through the cliff side and it went through areas where tanks were and like a lot of soldier holdouts. Yeah. It even went through the desert with the cactuses and the helicopters and then across a dam. It was pretty extensive. When I saw that sketch, I was so motivated. - Yeah. - To just start building all of that stuff. - So I ran ahead with a lot of level design, a lot of geometry, and it seems like a lot of it stuck in some way or another, which is really amazing. I did the, oh yeah, the dam, which was funny. I just did that in a day, right? Like, it was like about four or five hours. I did a Hoover Dam thing 'cause I like the Hoover Dam. - I saw a concept of the cliff side. I think Harry Teasley built that render of the skybox, and I just thought, holy crap, this is perfect for vertigo. Whatever we do here, we have to play on vertigo, and like narrow little ledges, and you know, places you would like to normally dodge a grenade, but you can't. - And that's, that's the moment. That's really the big part of that level is that reveal and the play is kind of, kinda supports it afterward. The helicopter comes in, you're fighting the helicopter, which is awesome. First of all I had a bunch of textures, and then every time I need made new ones, whoever was working on the new levels would be like, oh, fresh textures, I'm gonna use those. Somebody making another level would start using them. And I was like, no, this is chaos. We need to restrict this. So I started naming the texture sets by the level that they were made for. I was trying to enforce some sort of like, visual cohesion. And so that really ended up working. - There was one level I did, it was the introduction of the sort of the bounce pads, the alien bounce pads in the, in the real world. And because, story wise, like, okay, you're getting closer to hitting the alien world. So I was, well, let's get a little bit of alien world infection into the real world. So I had done it just as a visual thing. John Guthrie made it 10 times better. And that's actually where he found the photo of my daughter. 'Cause I didn't put my daughter in Gordon's locker. I hid her in like this destroyed office someplace, as a little Easter egg for myself. And they, and John went and put my daughter's photo in Gordon's locker, which I think was a good decision. - I still get questions about stuff that I spent five minutes on 25 years ago from people who've now thought about this for 25 years. And they're thinking that there's 25 years worth of development went into this. I'm like, on some level, when you start talking about lore, I'm like, well there's Black Mesa. That was just a matter of we needed a name for something that was evocative. - In that entrance when you get off the train and there's that lobby where there's a big map on it. And when we were making that map, that was fairly early on, I put a dot in New Mexico and then that turned into, I think Marc saw that. He was like, oh, where is that? This is where we are. And then he named it Black Mesa. - That is a favorite thing of mine actually. If you come up with a name for something then, and it evokes something, then you don't have to write the whole story. 'Cause it's a conspiracy plot. Everybody knows more about it than you do. So you don't have to do, you don't have to answer those questions. You just keep raising questions and make the mystery kind of thing. - Like dialogue came in later. Also, a lot of the scripted sequences came in later, and those helped to kind of sharpen the storytelling aspect of it. Because I mean, setting expectations to get up to the surface and then like, oh no, they're not here to help us. - The whole thing about diegetic writing, right? Like keeping the exposition in the game instead of outside the game, you know, give a lot of credit to Marc. - After playtests, we'd realize that maybe you need more of a dialogue cue about something. - That's when we started to have, do like scientists who were literally pop up in a corner and go, go that way. There's a few of those that we stuck in right at the end when we'd like, well we get one more session with Hal. He can say, go down here, you know, go around that corner. - Well, so much for the government. Their idea of containment is to kill everyone associated with the protest. Judging from your hazard suit, I'd say you were part of what went wrong. - I knew Hal from San Francisco as an artist cartoonist. He was also an animator and an actor in some science fiction movies. So when we got down to the wire, we did a bunch of voice casting, and nothing was right. And I just kept thinking of Hal, and I finally just called him and said, Hal, I want you to at least talk to people here so they can hear your voice. And I got him on a speaker phone, and I had a bunch of people gathered in my office. And I'm like, okay, Hal, everybody's here. And he's like, well, what would you like me to say? And everybody was like, this is him. This is the guy. - Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties? - Another interesting voice thing was the G-Man. So we liked Mike Shapiro's work, so we knew we wanted to use him, but we brought him in to do Barney and also the G-Man. So we did a take on all the G-Man lines with kind of a straight voice. And it was thinking that, okay, we have something safe, but we're not super excited about it. And give us something else. And he does does this crazy lizard voice. - The border world Xen is in our control for the time being. Thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed. - And we took it back and everybody just loved the crazy lizard voice. And so that's how it worked out. - Did you do the Nihilanth? - I did. Ladies and gentlemen, the Nihilanth. Just imagine his head floating in space as a baby. I went into Gabe's office and I demanded Gabe to either fire Ken or I quit. And Gabe just laughed at me. - [LAUGHING] Correct response from Gabe. - Yeah. I was like, argh. - Until Bill got there, I was the oldest guy there. It was hard because I had to go home in the evenings, whereas the kids who had just, the young guys who just moved out from Florida or wherever, they did not have to go home in the evenings. I'd go home, see my kids when they were in bed. I would come back down the hill to Valve. Nobody else I worked with had to get up to get their kids off to school in the morning. But I did. - You're wired to just take full advantage of the situation. You're like, you put everything into it. So when we say we worked 18 hour days, that's no exaggeration. - Yeah. - Not at, not at all. I can edit all day. I can make, I can design all day. I don't have to worry about anything. You know, two guys from Microsoft start a game studio with, with a bunch of incredibly capable, you know, with an incredible team. You're gonna, you're gonna push yourself harder than ever before. - I don't usually crunch real hard. I get it done in like, I come in, I work, I go home. And a lot of people were living like, you know, really long hours, you know, the classic, we'll all come in at 1:00, and then goof around for a while and then work late into the morn, you know, late at night. I was employee 17. there was a, a woman that was the kind of the office manager and eventually, Mona Lisa Guthrie came in as the, at the desk. I was the only woman on the team. [SIGH] That was not awesome. - I decided to become a baseball fan here after the birth of my first daughter. So she's the one in Gordon's locker, Isabel. But she was, she's very special needs. She's 25 today. You know, cognitively, she's about three years old. So after her birth in the middle of Half-Life production, it was, it was really hard. It was really hard. 'Cause we were getting about two hours of sleep at a stretch. 'Cause she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach every two hours. I had a, just a difficult time relating to the world when she was a baby. I had a hard time just talking to people. 'Cause I was just kind of tired and angry all the time. Yeah. My wife, she worked at Valve for a while. She did a bunch of textures for the game. Like I said, she did those soda machines. She did just a bunch of level textures. She textured Big Mama, the sort of boss creature. She textured him. when Isabel arrived, she obviously had a lot of issues. So, yeah, had to stop working and stay with her at home. And it was the last year of Half-Life, and we'd pretty much crunched that whole year. So, I was at work a lot. It was, it was hard. It was definitely a hard year. - Games have often had this thing where they're just a little too attached to Star Wars, Blade Runner, Alien. So it wasn't that hard to try to get people to go, let's think of something really alien. Like what Xen was initially was you're gonna go inside a huge alien organism and kill it or figure out how to turn it on or off, or something like that. I didn't know you, we couldn't actually do that. Or what was involved. - What does it mean to have alien architecture or a planet that's biologically defining the structures in it as opposed to what the tools we're good at, which is making rectangles. - And then slowly it scaled back till it was more and more corridors, and that everybody was really good at. - People were finishing up stuff, and I was still working on Xen because it was like, it went through a lot of iteration or at least, we're trying to figure out what it was. Different people were taking swings at it, either static concepts... - Weren't you in a bit of a timeline crunch for it as well? - Yeah. It was the end of the game. - Yeah. - I wanted to cut stuff out and they're like, no leave it in. And I'm like, yeah, but I don't have any, I don't, there's nothing, I don't have any support for this. - Right. - And then after a lot of it was built, it was like, oh yeah, we're gonna change the gravity and give you a jump pack. That came later [LAUGHING] And I was like, ah. - There's a lot of stuff, especially in Xen where you know, that you're getting close to a first draft of some things, right? 'Cause we just didn't have time and we got to the end of the game. And so we considered not going to Xen, but the art concepts people did were so cool. - For the Xen textures, I was deeply inspired by electron microscope imagery, and we'd had so much of that regular structural texture material that I wanted to do something more organic. Insects as well. I think there's a lot of textures that were based on beetles. It was, that was really fun, and incredibly challenging levels to make. 'cause the, that editor was not friendly for organic shapes. I built the little behaviors for the tree that hits you if you get too close. And the one, the light stalk that kind of hides. But Ken did a bunch of AIs there. The floating controller guys. - The flying guys were great, but you had to set up air nodes for them to travel properly. I prototyped a lot. And some of those prototypes were used in the final battle, I believe. And also for the Gonarch, which I think Randy did. - We at some point have to stop polishing. At some point we have to like, it is what it is. And if the player hasn't had fun up until that point, well then we failed. They're not gonna get to that point. So who cares? It just has to finish, and it did. - And there's always Half-Life 2 to win 'em back. - I love that sensation of being alone and inhaling dimension. But the experience that people really liked in the game was scientists pop up, and Barney pops up, and you have companions and you have this feeling of companionship around you with all the other stuff that's going on. So a lot of people missed that, which I understood. And I think if we had thought about the ending from the beginning, we would've figured out some ways to do that a little more. - I remember coming back from downtown Cabo very drunk and then running to the beach, but didn't know there was like a six foot retaining wall there. So I just went right over, and then I was hurting so much. I slept the night where I fell. Yeah. I woke up the next morning. - I had never heard that story. - With like a really stiff neck. Oh my God. It's a good thing you were pretty young. - I remember after we'd gone final on the game, I was home one morning taking a shower, and my wife asked me, It's done. Is it any good? Is the game any fun? I go, I don't know. Like, I hope so. - I don't think it's exaggerating by saying if any one of the crew had disappeared for a month, we wouldn't have shipped. It didn't matter who they were. You know, everybody was, was mission critical. - My inspiration from Valve, what I really took away with me, was that the thing that is most important to me is what are we making. Coming in as a texture artist, you don't have a lot of expectation that you're gonna get to influence that. And I was able to have quite a bit of influence on, on the what. - It was so fun to work with the people who were making Half-Life. The collection of people were diverse, at least like in their professional backgrounds, was kind of all over the place. And so figuring out how to work with all those people. But also just the fact that we had hired really stellar people who were good at collaborating, like the conscientious people, deeply passionate about what they wanted to create. That just was a recipe for a professionally, like, really good time. - It seems to me that one of the things that good games do is make two games worth of stuff and then throw away the bad game. And fortunately Valve was able to do that, A lot of companies couldn't do that. But backstopped by Gabe and Mike, Valve could afford to do that. - I always have absolutely nothing interesting to say when people say, would you reflect on your legacy? Like, I really don't look back a whole lot. I'm always excited by the future, right? So to me it's like, I can look back at the things that we did, but to me they're just sort of like the stepping stones to what we're gonna be able to do in the future. That's just how I'm, that's just how I'm wired. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] Oh no.",

I&#x27;m not complaining as CS:Source is one of those games that I spent hours upon hours honing my skill. reply ajmurmann 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand this comment. The original Counter-Strike mod came out around the same time as TF got ported to HL. Unlike TF, CS had pretty much consistent releases of some kind from CS up to 1.6 to Condition Zero and then Source and Go. I don&#x27;t think there was any salvaging of TF stuff into CS. reply pugworthy 15 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, CS was developed independently of TF, and had a different genealogy as it were. Certainly some developer crossover later on, but probably more by people wanting to work on it instead of being told to. reply pugworthy 15 hours agoparentprevI have seen some early draft designs for a WW2 themed shooter that might have been part of that early TF2 concept. Then Day of Defeat came along and fit the bill nicely. reply epolanski 21 hours agoprevOne thing I have found extremely interesting was how Valve hit the jackpot with many early hires.It was literally people that often didn&#x27;t even have a CS or let alone gaming background and yet so many of them proved to be relentlessly resourceful, creative and hard working.The guy who wrote most of the HL code wasn&#x27;t even a developer and at the time was studying to become a lawyer or accountant iirc.I can&#x27;t but think that timing, founders but also straight up luck played an absolutely crucial factor. reply AndriyKunitsyn 20 hours agoparentBecause technically, they didn&#x27;t. As they say in the documentary, the version of the game that they made after the first year or so was bad, and they acknowledged it, and they changed their processes and introduced the \"cabal\" - so they basically paid that first year to gather experience. And what&#x27;s important, their publisher Sierra was okay with it.I don&#x27;t see that happening today, to be honest, in \"AAA\" titles at least. Budgets have gone through the roof, and the publisher won&#x27;t give you a plan B, they will force the developer to duct-tape what they have and ship it no matter what. And the game can always be patched later, right? reply Cthulhu_ 19 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t see that happening today, to be honest, in \"AAA\" titles at least.Thanks for adding that caveat; it&#x27;s an unfair comparison IMO to compare the well-selling games of 25 years ago with AAA games of today. Half-Life was built by a team of about 80 people according to a quick Google, and there wasn&#x27;t the ecosystem of tooling, resources and outsourcing that we have today, versus hundreds if not thousands of people (if you include outsourcing &#x2F; engines &#x2F; etc) for AAA titles today. And the modern day game devs will have enjoyed a relevant education, whereas back then those educations didn&#x27;t exist yet. Notably, John Carmack did a lot of ground work in translating math into 3D video game engines; he was behind Wolfenstein, then Doom, then Quake, and the Quake engine was used as the basis for Half-Life&#x27;s.Anyway, 80 people is pretty substantial even at the time; for comparison, indie hits like Hades had ~20 people working on it, Hollow Knight&#x27;s Team Cherry has just 3 employees (but they used Unity so they didn&#x27;t have to do much engine programming, and the ports to various consoles was outsourced); Wube (Factorio) has had a few dozen people working on it. \"indie\" hit Kingdom Come: Deliverance had like 240 people working on it. reply masklinn 18 hours agorootparent> Anyway, 80 people is pretty substantial even at the time; for comparison, indie hits like Hades had ~20 people working on itI wouldn’t call Hades an indie hit in the classic sense. Bastion was an indie hit, but by Hades supergiant had releases 3 acclaimed games.That’s not to detract from the well deserved success of Hades, but SG was damn well established by then. reply panopticon 15 hours agorootparentPast success is a weird way to define \"indie\". The term is usually used to distinguish smaller teams from their bigger AA&#x2F;AAA counterparts, and I think most people still consider Supergiant an indie studio. reply philistine 5 hours agorootparentExactly. Indie doesn&#x27;t come from the word new, it comes from the word independent. Are you a team detached from the traditional large players in the industry. Yes? Then you&#x27;re indie. reply bombcar 18 hours agorootparentprevReading the Factorio blogs shows their progression from \"developer\" to \"game developer\" to \"top-tier game developers\" - it took years.You could likely do the same today, but the key would be finding someone (like Gabe) to fund it whilst it got off the ground. reply kevinventullo 17 hours agorootparentWith all due respect to the Factorio devs (it is one of my favorite games of all time and I credit them with essentially creating the genre), have they made even one other game? reply naikrovek 16 hours agorootparentnumber of games made does not correlate with game-making skills. They aren&#x27;t coupled, anyway. It is probably much more correlated with game design skills, but that&#x27;s not the context, here.Their skill in honing the game and becoming a respected game development company are what are in question, and while not an AAA studio, they are recognized as a company that knows how to highly optimize their game.They deserve as much respect as any other game developer, in my mind. Their approach is different than other game studios, and that alone is testament to their abilities to both make a game and run a business. They&#x27;re doing things their own way, focusing on the one game (at least as far as we know) and they are still simply \"killing it\" and I mean that in the very best way. reply tapoxi 17 hours agorootparentprevToday they ship in early access, which is a better approach since it opens you up to a ton of feedback. The most recent, and successful, example being Baldurs Gate 3. reply eur0pa 19 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is with these \"AAA\" games. I&#x27;ve spent a dozen years having great fun with perfectly enjoyable and memorable 7&#x2F;10 games. Nowadays a 7&#x2F;10 is a death sentence for a gaming studio. The industry is poisoned. reply whywhywhywhy 19 hours agorootparentThe criteria has changed I feel, a 7&#x2F;10 in the 90s&#x2F;00s probably meant it had some good ideas, a highly creative setting, an innovative tech or gameplay mechanic so the end product, while 7&#x2F;10 because one of the parts just didn&#x27;t hit the mark or it was just very buggy, the actual game was still enjoyable.The modern AAA mentality has stripped too much of it down to formulas they consider working or \"best practices\" (e.g the \"UbiSoft Towers\" phenomenon) or they&#x27;re literally shaping the whole game to try and force a specific business model that is more important than shipping good content (Bungie Destiny 2).Difference is when a game built with that ideology doesn&#x27;t hit the mark it ends up just being insanely dull and has no spark to keep you going or win you over. Instead of Flawed But Fun you get Competent But Boring. reply Cthulhu_ 18 hours agorootparentIn hindsight, we spent a lot of time on said 7&#x2F;10 games, and they were just fine.But it was a different time, mainly in terms of what was available, how much time you had, and how much time a game took.Most games we had were copied shareware games from diskettes; on occasion a CD with loads of shareware games, and on rare occasions someone had a copy of the full version of a game like Doom.But nowadays a lot of games - AAA and indie both - are at least 40 hour games, if not (a lot) more; Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla takes 123 hours to \"do everything\" (platinum); I&#x27;ve got over 300 hours in Factorio and about half that in Kerbal Space Program; FFXVI took me 60 hours to finish, I still have outstanding sidequests, and that one doesn&#x27;t even have that many side activities or time sinks.And then there&#x27;s the \"live services\" (or MMOs if they have a multiplayer aspect, or MMORPGs if it&#x27;s WoW or FFXIV) which are designed to have great &#x2F; tight gameplay loops but effectively infinite game. I&#x27;ve got a lot of hours in FFXIV and they keep adding Stuff to it. If I had infinite time there&#x27;s a few side activities in it that cost just as much time to \"finish\" as the base game&#x27;s stories. reply thereddaikon 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know if you can even say competent at this point. So many \"AAA\" games with their army of developers still launch with performance issues and bugs. If massive teams should be good at one thing, it is making a polished and well running product. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Devs cried for years to get the ability to make their own custom shaders. Now that DX and Vulkan allow it, we find they didn&#x27;t know what they were asking for and every AAA game suffers from massive shader compilation issues. A problem that never existed when it was left up to AMD and Nvidia. You also don&#x27;t see this problem in indie games because they never have the bandwidth to even consider writing their own shaders. And that&#x27;s just one example. reply Goronmon 19 hours agorootparentprev\"Poisoned\"? Or just more competitive? If you thought Half-Life was a \"7&#x2F;10\" back in the day, what would you play instead? Quake? Unreal Tournament? Both were mainly multi-player games and not really a direct alternative. reply devnullbrain 18 hours agorootparentOther games that released in 1998:- Ocarina of Time- Final Fantasy VII- Baldur&#x27;s Gate- Starcraft- Metal Gear Solid- Resident Evil 2- Pokemon YellowIf only it was as competitive as 2023, in which some of the top games were:- A Zelda game- A Final Fantasy game- A Resident Evil remake- A Baldur&#x27;s Gate game reply 1123581321 17 hours agorootparentHe is talking about first-person shooters.If you had a taste for a certain kind of game in the late 90s you didn&#x27;t have many choices that were done by a full studio and polished. Most of the games you listed had the same \"problem\" of being unparalleled at the time.Now you have a lot of clones of the same idea, plus so many of the classics are still replayable or remastered and rereleased. A good-but-not-great game has many substitutes with a similar scope and feel. reply kodt 16 hours agorootparentUnreal, Quake 2, Jedi Knight, System Shock 2, SiN, Blood 2, Hexen 2, Rainbow Six, Turok 1 & 2. There were a number of great FPS games available at the time. reply 1123581321 14 hours agorootparentI did enjoy most of those games, but wouldn’t use them as examples of equivalents of Half-Life. Some did some things better than Half-Life but others were worse in every category and were superseded (e.g. Unreal.) Great list of memories! reply devnullbrain 17 hours agorootparentprevIn 1998 we still called them Doom clones. Goldeneye didn&#x27;t even use conventional twin-stick aiming. There&#x27;s a reason there weren&#x27;t many. How many non-Nintendo 3D platformers are there today? reply 1123581321 17 hours agorootparentWe were calling them first-person shooters by the mid 90s (though I also remember ___ clone.)

And I don&#x27;t think anyone was arguing that Half-Life was an example of a 7&#x2F;10 game. Quake 2 and Unreal were both games with great single player campaigns when Half-Life came out, Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 didn&#x27;t come out until the following year. Dark Forces II Jedi Knight is another good example. reply chungy 18 hours agorootparentprevUnreal Tournament didn&#x27;t exist yet, and both Quake 1 and 2 were very much single-player focused games. reply sitzkrieg 16 hours agorootparentlaughs in quakeworld reply Goronmon 14 hours agorootparentprevYou know, I was wrong on this. I had forgotten how many games were available around that time. Plenty of competition was available in that space around when Half-Life was released. reply devnullbrain 18 hours agorootparentprevI see it as overspecialisation. When GTA 6 costs 10 years and a billion dollars, it needs to be an unmatched hit. But what if it&#x27;s just bad on a conceptual level? More money can create more models, textures and &#x27;content&#x27; but it can&#x27;t create fun. For GTA 3, it would have been a setback for a year. For GTA 6, it could be fatal. reply filoleg 12 hours agorootparentprevI suggest trying the new Robocop: Rogue City game. It is pretty much a perfect encapsulation of a 7&#x2F;10 or AA type of a game, where it is just fun, solid, well done, has quite a great amount of soul in it. But isn’t aiming to be some do-it-all open world AAA michael bay type of an affair.One of the most enjoyable games this year for me, and it says a lot (given how many amazing games of all kinds we got this year). And yet, it isn’t overly ambitious. Just overall, that’s pretty much the exact type of a game that you are talking about, which I’ve noticed we had an almost complete drought of over the past decade. reply nipponese 18 hours agorootparentprevSomehow audiences will respect effort vs resources as long as there is community outreach and the price makes sense.There are a lot of 5&#x2F;10 games that are successful on Steam because the devs set the right expectations for the experience.Recently Vampire Survivors comes to mind. Definitely a 6&#x2F;10, but something about the balance of no-effort art and masterful game tuning makes it VERY sticky. reply devilbunny 18 hours agorootparentGoat Simulator is not a good or deep game, but I definitely got my $3 or whatever I paid out of it.

It also reinforced that I&#x27;ve been right to avoid casinos my whole life.I get that the art was a no-effort import, but everything else about that damn game is a good illustration of something that only seems simple because it&#x27;s exceedingly well done. reply jimbob45 15 hours agorootparentprevno-effort artIn fairness, isn&#x27;t is specifically meant to look like a ported Italian game with laughably incorrect translations? reply bitcharmer 19 hours agorootparentprevSadly today 9&#x2F;10 just means the game is actually finished upon release. reply ajmurmann 15 hours agorootparentprevI think time and trust is so critical. I remember a talk by the people who made FoundationDB about their approach to testing. They spend a year just creating a variant of C++ that allowed them to control concurrent execution order and build a framework to simulate&#x2F;mock network, disc access etc. It&#x27;s incredible work and AFAIK more than paid for itself. Yet, at most places it would be impossible to get a year-long testing effort of that scale funded or really any engineering effort that produces nothing shippable. All too often you might get 3 months and after 2, a urgent product request comes up and the work sits and rots away till it&#x27;s useless and nobody gets back to it reply hello281237 19 hours agorootparentprevSierra is an interesting company. In the video game industry has very few well known female game designers, and that was even more true back then. Yet the adventure game genre had several - Roberta Williams, Lori Cole, Jane Jensen, and Christy Marx (not as well known, but her games are well regarded), all of whom worked for Sierra. One has to wonder if Roberta Williams being co-owner of the company (and the designer of the first graphical adventure game) is one of the reasons for this.Another interesting story is when Ken Williams (Roberta Williams husband, the other co-owner of the company) hired middle-aged retired police officer Jim Walls to design the Police Quest adventure games (he designed the first three). Ken apparently was talking to his hairdresser about his idea for a police adventure game, when she mentioned that Walls, her husband, might be an interesting person to talk to. reply bena 19 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re the only one willing to tap into a talent pool, you get to pump that resource as much as you want.So if Sierra is the only company really willing to hire female game designers, they really get to take all the best. reply bzzzt 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think others were not willing to hire female designers; some Infocom games from that time also had female authors. I think it&#x27;s more to do with the time they started. Somewhere during the 80s the &#x27;white male nerd&#x27; stereotype became a self-reinforcing thing which scared a lot of women away from everything computer-related. Also, I don&#x27;t consider Sierra games &#x27;the best designed&#x27;. Some of their games have lots of &#x27;personality&#x27; and they were first with many innovations, but it&#x27;s clear everyone was still figuring out how to design games at the time. reply nickpeterson 20 hours agoparentprevI’m sure all these people were talented, but it reinforces my own belief that the most important things are passion and focus. I feel like the tech world fixates on 10x programmers like Carmack, but motivated people can pull off amazing things. reply Loughla 19 hours agorootparentI think for most hiring, regardless of industry, the secret is searching for passion, focus, (I would add) ability&#x2F;willingness to learn new skills, and a positive attitude toward other humans.Specific job skills can be taught or learned. If you have the right attitude, positive outlook, and are inherently someone who learns things, you can be very successful in most jobs.Too often, hiring filters for specific job skills&#x2F;credentials. Because these are supposed to be a proxy for the softer skills. It&#x27;s not as effective, but much easier to deploy at scale, I think. reply thinkingtoilet 19 hours agorootparentI have built some truly awesome teams and besides a base level of knowledge, the only thing I care about is attitude. Another huge factor is passions, I always ask what they do outside of work. If you are passionate about something you know how to focus and care about the details. This strategy has been very successful for me. reply underlipton 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of people who are loathe to admit this, because they draw a lot of their self-worth from their expertise and the success derived from it. To say that most people, with the right attitude, could perform just as well is anathema. They get and keep jobs, but their behavior is often toxic and keeps teams from success. In extreme cases, they may jealously guard their domain and undermine coworkers.On the flip-side, there are a lot of people dealing with trauma of one kind of another. Outwardly, they may seem to be negative or acerbic or closed-minded, when, internally, they are trying mightily to get their passion and earnestness to break through a wall of their own bitterness or anxiety.I don&#x27;t know that recruiting or management have reliable methods of dealing with either pro-socially. reply Cthulhu_ 18 hours agorootparentprevCarmack was the giant whose shoulders a lot of games - including Half-Life - stood on; I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s a 100x or 1000x even, but then, engine developers are usually unknown and underrated. The work he did and what the Unreal engine now does is not to be underestimated. reply filoleg 12 hours agorootparent> engine developers are usually unknown and underratedAs a testament to their (the original id software team that had both Johns) great efforts and legacy, they pretty much invented the concept of a game engine to start with. At that time, most games were written as a one and done type of a package deal.Given that the team wanted to push the technical edge with the games consistently, they wanted to have some reusable&#x2F;modifiable core that they could use across multiple projects, have visual level editors, etc., they converged on “accidentally” creating a game engine and coining that term. I forgot which game was the one that led to the creation of it for them, iirc it was one of the earlier Commander Keen games, but my memory might be failing me here. They didn’t even have the goal of creating a game engine, they just ended up getting there and then realizing what they did as they were trying to build their reusable “toolset.” reply z3phyr 19 hours agorootparentprevCarmack the pizza guy.

Through the years I acquired 2800+ games on the platform, as a sort of digital hoarder with the hope of at least trying every game I purchased (often in bundles&#x2F;sales) as an exclusive PC player - before I got too old or too dead. I just don&#x27;t see that happening anymore... Just not enough time left but to sample.Back to HL2 - it&#x27;s the 2nd game I&#x27;ve ever finished twice (FF VII being the other), still love the story, the very cool physics gun, the incredible dystopian narrative and setting, and it holds up today wonderfully 19 years later.It&#x27;s a shame we&#x27;ll likely never see an HL3.

Is it the talent, the leadership, the focus on product?As a long time JavaScript developer I honestly believe, and I really mean this, that maybe 4% of the people employed primarily doing JavaScript work actually know what they are doing. Just 4%.It seems at the beginning many of the early Valve team had a lot of passion but almost no real experience in that kind of code or product. They got a massive springboard with the Quake code and then figured out the rest. They didn&#x27;t stagnate on the Quake code, but wildly modified it to fit their needs. Most JavaScript people are not capable of this. They just stagnate at their favorite framework and then just spin around code style and process.What differentiates that early Valve team from all these various JavaScript teams? It clearly isn&#x27;t education or professional maturity. reply TheAceOfHearts 15 hours agoparentMost developers probably don&#x27;t care and just want to get paid. Beyond that, I imagine you&#x27;re not usually empowered to make big changes unless you&#x27;re relatively senior, and even if you decide to be the kind of developer that&#x27;s always striving towards self improvement your job is unlikely to reward you for your skill development. I think there&#x27;s just a lot of diminishing returns.Have you ever tried playing a competitive multiplayer game?

One person did all the sound effects and music, and also coded the DSP engine to add real-time sound manipulation based on the environment.You can do a lot with a few very talented people who are willing to guide a whole bunch of smart, eager and motivated folks.. which I think is what happened at Valve. reply scriptkiddy 16 hours agoparentprevTo me it seems like their passion drove them to learn as much as they could. They knew enough to get the job done, but not enough to know that they \"couldn&#x27;t do\" the things they wanted to do.More experienced devs may have thrown out a lot of the ideas the Half Life team ended up implementing as \"too time consuming\" or \"practically impossible\". Valve&#x27;s devs at the time weren&#x27;t experienced enough to make those assumptions, so they just worked their asses off to figure out how to do it. reply deckard1 14 hours agoparentprevThere are lots of reasons why Half-life was a success. You shouldn&#x27;t discount stupid luck, as well. Their first iteration was awful, as mentioned in the YouTube video. They essentially had to start over with a \"cabal\" and pull the game together with the good scraps of work they had already done.Here&#x27;s a more detailed article on the cabal process (starting on page 2):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210823181232&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamas...From 1999 and much more detailed than the video.Now, game development is inherently waterfall. You work for years and built up to this huge release. Nowadays you might have some agile processes embedded into milestones, etc. But fundamentally it&#x27;s all leading to a huge waterfall.That&#x27;s important. Because what agile does, today, is that it turns autonomous developers into cogs of a large machine. But Valve&#x27;s \"cabal\" was entirely free to do whatever they felt best. Gabe Newell probably had final say and input, but ultimately the group had flexibility. The developers had full system awareness. They weren&#x27;t pulling Jira tickets off a board like a blind man in the elephant parable[1]. They knew how the pieces fit because they put them there. And if the pieces weren&#x27;t fitting, they had the authority to make them fit.Perhaps more interesting is how the story of Half-life can be viewed through The Mythical Man-Month[2]> When designing a new kind of system, a team will design a throw-away system (whether it intends to or not). This system acts as a \"pilot plan\" that reveals techniques that will subsequently cause a complete redesign of the system.Their cabal has a bit of overlap with the \"surgical team\" concept and usage of formal documents. The rest of the employees did nothing while this group operated. Thus, they reduced manpower that actually allowed them to move forward. Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast (from the US Navy Seals). Most companies do the opposite. They crank up the number of employees to hit deadlines, which creates more bugs and more work.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blind_men_and_an_elephant[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Mythical_Man-Month reply snickerbockers 15 hours agoparentprev>maybe 4% of the people employed primarily doing JavaScript work actually know what they are doing. Just 4%.Because it&#x27;s JavaScript. It&#x27;s a language specifically designed for people who don&#x27;t care about how anything actually works. reply clnq 14 hours agoparentprevI think it&#x27;s at least five elements:1. Hacker-tinkerer culture, where you want to build new things that haven&#x27;t been built on new hardware for fundamentally non-commercial reasons. This could be called Carmack-style hacker culture in my mind, which produced Quake.2. Genuinely extensive programming expertise.3. Not partaking in the current and quite toxic VC-funded game development culture, where funding dictates rushed deliverables (through schedules, and the constant race to attract funding with demos). It&#x27;s feature factory or die in a lot of VC-funded scale-ups.4. Lucky circumstances - knowing someone who could get you Quake source on \"just have it, we&#x27;ll work something out eventually\" terms back then was exceptionally lucky. Quake was very far ahead of it&#x27;s time. Most companies that produce such work now would work very hard to make sure no one else gets it. And that goes back to the hacker culture of just building cool things to share with people that was more common in games then.5. Time - the games industry was young, before Quake there were no proper 6 DoF generalist 3D game engines, so it was an auspicious time for game development.I&#x27;m a game developer and I am a bit old school, so I&#x27;m not the best person to speculate on why JavaScript programmers seem less able to build cool tech. But I have seen many young people approach programming differently now, probably because it has become a lot more commodified. The mindset of a \"clock-in clock-out\" programmer wasn&#x27;t common in game circles in the 90s and 00s. Also, there was much less focus on using \"correct\" idioms and beautiful code as the end goal in hacker circles, and a lot more focus on building something that others haven&#x27;t built before and working out the details later. Moreover, business viability was rarely the first thing you would think about and work backwards from when you worked on a game project. Business success was a byproduct of building cool games.If you would remember game trailers from early 00s, like Half-Life 2 (since we are talking about Valve), you would pick up that they show off cool tech like physics simulation, which is quite janky and imperfect. Carmack also has spoken many times about how in his early games (pre-Quake) the graphics would initially be quite bad and he would be worried about getting everything fixed in time. Cool over safe, cool over perfect, and showing off cool things that were not polished was normal.Nowadays, things are different in some ways. The game development has become methodical and focused on the exploitation of passion for money in a repeatable way. You get as many features as you can for marketing (you only need to have them, they can be whatever quality, it&#x27;s only for the Steam page and trailer). You cut all the awesome new things as they are a risky waste of money, you instead funnel all the passion into velocity for delivering that bundle of features as quickly as possible for as cheap as possible, and that&#x27;s it. If you can strike a deal with a nice IP, that will make the game sell a lot more. So will striking a deal with a publisher with deep pockets for marketing. But the \"do cool things\" hacker culture is gone in AAA and blockbuster games. It&#x27;s now relegated to indies where quite a lot of janky but incredibly cool games are made. But they have a funding access problem as their business is too risky for most publishers and VCs. And that&#x27;s probably why we don&#x27;t see many new and big id and Valve-type companies anymore.Although with VR, there are some companies that I believe could be like that. And they attract senior talent quite well. With the right management and timing, I think we could see another Valve in VR. Even Carmack played a big role in VR until recently, before he moved on to the next new thing in tech. Being on the precipice of new tech is important for people of that culture. reply paulryanrogers 20 hours agoprevSad reminder of the crunch, even when the result turns out to be a success.

If you&#x27;re not used to it (due to being different from your desktop environment), it probably would make it worse.To me, the biggest factors to (worse) sickness are1. Narrow FOV: usually the bigger the FOV, the better. But when it starts to have too much of \"fisheye\" effect, it can be detrimental.2. How \"fluent\" your character moves -- if you have to stop&#x2F;decelerate constantly (for any reason: interact with objects, clash with walls, sharp turns), it induces sickness very quickly.Third perspective games are typically much better, but if it&#x27;s in a confined space (like in a room) for extended time, it&#x27;s as bad as FPS.The best FPS I&#x27;ve played in term of having close to no motion sickness is Overwatch.

By Thomas Ricker, a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years. Nov 28, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC| Share this story (Left) Badring water leak sensor; (Right) the Parasoll door and window sensor pair. Image: Ikea Ikea’s push to democratize the smart home continues with the introduction of three new Zigbee sensors that won’t break the bank. There’s Parasoll, the door and window sensor; Vallhorn, the motion sensor; and Badring, the water leakage sensor. They’ll all be priced less than $10 when they go on sale globally in the first half of next year. Parasoll is a typical window and door sensor that can be discretely mounted to trigger an automation when an open / close event is detected. It can also be paired directly with an Ikea light bulb right out of the box without needing to buy and configure an Ikea Home smart hub. It’s priced at €9.99 in Europe, but exact US pricing is yet to be confirmed for it or any of Ikea’s three new sensors. Parasoll door and window sensor pair. Image: Ikea The Vallhorn motion sensor can be used both indoors and outdoors (with IP44 splash protection against rain) to activate lights or other automations when movement is detected. It’s powered by three AAA batteries and can be paired to directly control up to 10 Ikea smart bulbs right out of the box. It costs just €7.99 and can sense more of the room than Ikea’s existing $14.99 / €12.99 motion sensor that’s smaller but only useable indoors and needs its coin cell battery replaced more frequently. Vallhorn motion sensor can also be placed outdoors. Image: Ikea The Badring water sensor includes a built-in siren (60dBA at 1m) that can alert you when it senses a leak. It can also trigger a mobile notification in the Ikea Home smart app for homes with an Ikea Dirigera hub ($69.99) installed. Sensors like these can save homeowners a ton of money before a water leak has the opportunity to create real damage. It will cost €9.99. The Badring sensor could save you money by detecting a water leak early. Image: Ikea Of the three, the Parasoll and Badring sensors are not compatible with older Trådfri Home smart gateways from Ikea. All support the newer Dirigera hub, of course, which fully integrates the sensors into Ikea’s burgeoning lineup of smart home products and Home smart app. The hub also allows Ikea’s devices to interoperate with smart home ecosystems from Google, Amazon, and Apple when at home or away. Despite Matter support being just “a couple of months away” over a year ago, the company still doesn’t support it. Ikea plans to eventually enable Matter by turning on the Thread radio inside the Dirigera hub to bridge Ikea’s existing Zigbee-based devices to the next-generation smart home standard. In a statement sent to The Verge, Ikea digital product area manager Jonas Söderqvist says the company has “decided to delay this functionality” and will provide an update “when it’s time.” The ongoing delay is understandable given that Ikea’s products already integrate well with other platforms, and the company is focused on keeping things as simple as possible for anyone who delves into the smart home on a whim while shopping for a new bookcase. And when you consider the hurdles required to get everything running on Matter networks during this period of transition, Ikea’s delay is more than justified. Vallhorn will be available in select countries including the US starting in January 2024. That’s the same month the Parasoll launches internationally, but its US rollout won’t happen until April. Badring is scheduled to begin retail sales in April in some countries but won’t hit the US until July. It’s confusing, but these staggered releases are a byproduct of Ikea’s franchise retail system.

The siren on this Ikea one is a very obvious improvement and the price seems to be in line with the Xiaomi sensors that I currently use.The motion sensor looks like a decent improvement on the existing one. I have to admit that I don&#x27;t have the battery life issues that many people seem to have with the current model, but I&#x27;ve only got two of these sensors so maybe I got lucky.The door sensor looks weird though. It seems a lot larger than the equivalent Xiaomi Aqara sensor. Maybe it uses AAA batteries instead of coin cells or something.Generally speaking, I really like the Ikea Zigbee stuff. Everything I&#x27;ve got is well-supported by Zigbee2MQTT, including OTA updates. Most of my Ikea stuff has never even been paired to Ikea&#x27;s hub. reply UberFly 15 hours agoparentI would be worried about putting anything Xiaomi into my home. They have repeatedly proven to be a major privacy concern. Maybe security concern as well. reply giobox 13 hours agorootparent> They have repeatedly proven to be a major privacy concern. Maybe security concern as well.Thanks to Zigbee being a standard, you can use a Zigbee hub&#x2F;adapter from any vendor you like. The Zigbee sensors themselves have no network connection and therefore noway to warrant privacy concerns really. There is no WiFi&#x2F;Ethernet or internet involved with anything Xiaomi here.I&#x27;m using a bunch of these Aquara Zigbee sensors with the open source Home Assistant software and hardware, they are for the most part fantastic.I would take Zigbee home automation devices over crappy wifi ones any day of the week - its a vastly better protocol&#x2F;methodology for hooking these sorts of devices up. Your home&#x27;s lights functioning properly ideally should not depend on bulbs&#x2F;switches being able to get an IP address etc (sigh)...> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;skyconnect - USB adapter for Zigbee from HomeAssistant you can plug into any box you like.> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;yellow&#x2F; - HomeAssistant server hardware with Zigbee radio built in. reply AdamTReineke 12 hours agorootparentThe Aqara temperature sensors[0] wouldn&#x27;t stay connected to my SkyConnect USB dongle. No issues with my Zigbee switch and thermostats though, so I think some vendors aren&#x27;t fully Zigbee compliant but it&#x27;s probably the exception.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07D37FKGY&#x2F; reply BHSPitMonkey 2 hours agorootparentDo you use ZHA? I had to change to zigbee2mqtt (and thus get more compatible device to go with it) to make my Aqara sensors stop disconnecting. reply giobox 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had great results with their buttons&#x2F;light switches and Home Assistant Yellow, and the SkyConnect prior to that, for what its worth. I especially like the PoE version of Home Assistant Yellow - can power the entire server from its ethernet port. reply bsder 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat would you recommend for a ZigBee thermostat? reply BHSPitMonkey 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not who you asked, but I replaced my baseboard heater thermostats with the Sinope Zigbee ones and have been very happy with them. I think their products only work with heating systems though, not heat + A&#x2F;C. reply andylynch 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is a valid concern, but not such an issue with Zigbee stuff since you can run it with your own hub giving the sensors 0 external connectivity. reply orphea 15 hours agorootparentprevTheir sensors are fine, just use a non-Xiaomi hub like SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle. reply NicoJuicy 15 hours agorootparentSonoff is chinese, doesn&#x27;t fix the security issue reply fabianhjr 15 hours agorootparentI am more worried about US stuff with the whole PRISM thing and other three letter shenanigans.Aditionally the comment you are replying to is a dongle to provide a single board computer (or a computer in general) with ZigBee conectivity.Ideally you would run a trusthworthy open source OS and hub software. reply jquast 14 hours agorootparentAgreed, I would rather a foreign agency with no power or authority over me to have my personal data than a government that has the authority to wrongfully tax, investigate, jail, prosecute, and imprison me for that same data. reply cgriswald 14 hours agorootparentYou should choose the devices that are the most secure, using the information you have available at the time.Choosing a foreign government to spy on you rather than your own government isn&#x27;t a clear choice. While a foreign government is less likely to be interested in you personally and likely less able to directly cause you harm, you also have less recourse against them than against your own government and their interests are less likely to be aligned with yours.Additionally, your government may be able to co-opt the compromised devices anyway and would certainly have an incentive to do so.I&#x27;d also question that a device that is by-design-compromised is otherwise secure from bad actors. It is difficult to imagine the incentive structure that would make that possible.Finally, once this personal data has been harvested by either government, there is nothing to stop these governments or rogue elements within these governments from trading or sharing that data with your own government or other actors. reply jquast 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t chose to be spied on by any government! But if I could chose only one, it would be an opposing country like China or Russia.American businesses are forced to share our private data witn three letter agencies. Conversely, I can&#x27;t imagine any leverage, money or lawful, that would cause a Chinese citizen living in China, with families in China, to be so stupid as to collaborate with the US government in any way, unless they wish for their families to be sent to labor camps.My data is safer with the Chinese. I don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s where we stand with our privacy. reply vGPU 8 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that the American government has shown time and time again that their interests are not in any way, shape, or form aligned with that of the public.At this point, I’d trust a (likely) disinterested state actor over one that has been proven to be actively malicious. reply brandensilva 14 hours agorootparentprevNow I&#x27;m imagining a self destructing roborock vacuum burning down my house when China goes deep in anti US territory.Best policy I abide by is to prevent any data from exiting my network or remote control period. I don&#x27;t care who is spying. reply paledot 9 hours agorootparentMost likely you won&#x27;t have that problem because the power grid will be offline. reply NicoJuicy 10 hours agorootparentprevA dongle loads drivers through USB fyi.If you&#x27;re more worried about the US then China, we must live in a different world :) reply BHSPitMonkey 2 hours agorootparentMy Sonoff Zigbee dongle presents itself on my Linux home server as a USB serial device (&#x2F;dev&#x2F;ttyUSB0) which gets forwarded to the zigbee2mqtt container which talks to it. Perhaps under a different host OS it might try to deploy something nefarious, but I&#x27;m not particularly concerned. reply blacksmith_tb 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the threat model for a usb dongle? It won&#x27;t have network access... I suppose it could spontaneously become an HID device and try typing its way to trouble, but that&#x27;d be very OS-specific... reply nickthegreek 14 hours agorootparentUSB is like the most well known physical threat. Look up OMG Cables. reply blacksmith_tb 12 hours agorootparentRight, but that&#x27;s intended for the attacker to connect to from nearby? Also of course presumably if it&#x27;s got enough hardware crammed in there to cost $170 random Chinese tech companies are not going to include all of that in their $25 dongle \"just in case\" you turn out to be worth compromising? reply nickthegreek 11 hours agorootparentI think you are overestimating the cost of inclusion. Surely you have had mandatory IT training about not plugging in unknown usb drives at work right? reply wintogreen74 10 hours agorootparentYes, but my work laptop is not a Zigbee hub that I randomly plug unknown USB devices into. replyandylynch 15 hours agorootparentprevThese Zigbee sticks don’t have much opportunity for naughtiness. Like others I’ve used, they communicate over serial with their host (no IP ), and are based on a TI chipset which you can flash. reply filterfiber 15 hours agorootparentprevAs other&#x27;s mentioned, they communicate via serial to the host, this is not a device I&#x27;d be greatly concerned about as a threat.Unless you took great care with sourcing your electronics then they&#x27;re already packed with chips&#x2F;parts from china.If you _really_ want to you can use a nRF52840 (Nordic Semi is from Norway), or I think a few TI chips (USA), and use those as a gateway instead with home assistant (might need to add an extra library). Even then, both companies have manufacturing plants in china AFAIK so... reply gruturo 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the beauty of Zigbee. You can run your own hub if you want, and no information leaves your home. Of course this is less, or not at all, true if you run a manufacturer&#x27;s hub. reply Mister_Snuggles 13 hours agorootparentprevAll of my Xiaomi stuff is Zigbee and runs through Zigbee2MQTT, I&#x27;m not too concerned here since there&#x27;s no Xiaomi stuff that&#x27;s capable of connecting to anything except my Zigbee adapter. reply boringuser2 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s zigbee.Run your own Conbee stick and the value is off the charts. reply twisteriffic 17 hours agoparentprevHow have you found the battery life to be on your Ikea zigbee devices? Mine have been generally disappointing. In the range of 3 months on the dimmers that are maybe 10 feet from the hub. Just got a couple of their newer dimmers, hoping those will be better. The pairing experience was certainly less painful.Zigbee2mqtt is the bomb. ZHA can&#x27;t hold a candle to it in terms of reliability, features and device support. The tiny increase in complexity is so worth it. reply sowbug 16 hours agorootparentWhat exactly do you mean by a \"dimmer\"? Everything I have in my home that dims lights is mains-powered, so battery isn&#x27;t a concern.I have 45 Zigbee devices in my home, 33 of which are battery-powered. Those are door contact sensors, PIR motion sensors, climate sensors, and a few button remotes to control lighting. They&#x27;re mostly from Sonoff and Aqara, with a few unbranded Aliexpress devices that identify themselves as TUYATEC, and a couple from Third Reality. In almost every case, the battery life has been extraordinarily good -- well over a year. The only exception is the Sonoff SNZB-04 contact sensor, which seems to need battery changes about every six months. Probably not coincidentally, it&#x27;s the only sensor that uses CR2032 batteries, rather than AA or AAA. I would happily replace with a slightly larger sensor to get both longer battery life and less e-waste through the ability to use a standard rechargeable AA&#x2F;AAA battery. reply twisteriffic 16 hours agorootparentIkea refers to several of their zigbee remotes as dimmers. This is the older one that I&#x27;ve had issues with:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;tradfri-wireless-dimmer-smart-w...This is the newer one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;rodret-wireless-dimmer-power-sw...I have a few SmartThings motion sensors that are at 2-3 years battery life, though they use big lithium cells so that isn&#x27;t surprising. A few sonoff temp&#x2F;humidity sensors on coin cells seem to be heading for at least a year battery life as well. So far it&#x27;s only the Ikea buttons that have issues. reply sowbug 9 hours agorootparentUnderstood. This won&#x27;t help you much, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had to change a remote&#x27;s battery in the three years since I switched over to Zigbee. I assume their radios wake up only when the button is pressed, which is at most a few times a day, so the battery drain should be minimal. I use Home Assistant with a Sonoff Zigbee-USB coordinator, just as you do.Those Ikea buttons look pretty ordinary, so I can&#x27;t think of why they&#x27;d have such poor battery life. But they seem to be the only difference between our respective systems.These are the buttons I use most: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.us&#x2F;item&#x2F;3256802252738635.html reply avel 14 hours agorootparentprevYou probably have battery issues because you are using SmartThings as the zigbee hub and it&#x27;s polling the remote way too much.I have switched to HomeAssistant with a Zigbee USB adaptor and there are no more battery issues.SmartThings are aware of the issue but do not care enough to fix it. reply twisteriffic 11 hours agorootparentI do use a few SmartThings branded zigbee sensors but not the hub. I&#x27;m using homeassistant with the sonoff efr32mg21 dongle.I&#x27;m well aware of how terrible SmartThings the company is. I&#x27;d suffered through their inadequacies until April 2023 when they deleted my account during a failed backup purge. After 3 months of waiting on their support to unlock my hub I gave up and went to homeassistant. reply Mister_Snuggles 16 hours agorootparentprevI find that the battery life seems fine, but I haven&#x27;t tracked it closely.I have noticed a difference between Duracell coin cells purchased at Costco and Amazon Basics coin cells. The Amazon Basics ones didn&#x27;t last long at all, the Duracells seem much better.The newer dimmers (STYRBAR) use AAA cells instead of coin cells, so I&#x27;d expect them to last a lot longer. reply twisteriffic 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll try switching up battery brands. The out of the box cells from Ikea were dead in weeks, the store brand ones at least gave me a few months. reply filterfiber 15 hours agorootparentBattery brands (or even skus in the brands) can matter a _lot_.Related, Panasonic&#x27;s rechargable eneloop have worked very well for me, I&#x27;m kind of excited to see AAA be used in the IOT devices where it can fit.I have a lot less of a problem swapping batteries if I just have a few charged ones on hand and get at least many months in-between replacements. reply ssl232 14 hours agorootparentTop tip: IKEA rechargeable batteries are probably rebadged Eneloop Pros. reply joecool1029 14 hours agorootparentprev>Related, Panasonic&#x27;s rechargable eneloop have worked very well for meJust a heads up: IKEA&#x27;s brand of rechargables are likely rebadged eneloops at about half the price, also made in japan. Though for the AAA&#x27;s they only have eneloop regular equivalents not eneloop pros. reply thesh4d0w 16 hours agorootparentprevYou need to upgrade the firmware on both your devices + controllers, this is a known problem that I think is mostly resolved now. reply twisteriffic 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m up to date on both the coordinator firmware and device firmware. Updating the coordinator firmware was necessary to get device updates working on the newer Ikea devices, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in power consumption. Adding repeaters and reconverging didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference either. reply jq-r 13 hours agorootparentprevI got at least a dozen on&#x2F;off&#x2F;dimmer switches and couple of sensors. They last months, and I would maybe say even a year. I do use those coin Duracell batteries most of the time, makes quite a difference. reply Toutouxc 16 hours agorootparentprevMy STYRBAR dimmers last for more than a year, definitely. But they’re only used likeMaybe it uses AAA batteries instead of coin cells or something.It does, which is a big selling point for me. I’m trying to standardise on rechargable AA&#x2F;AAA batteries wherever possible. A lot of devices recommend you only use alkaline batteries because of the extra voltage but I haven’t actually found one that doesn’t function on 1.2v eneloops yet. reply moogly 16 hours agoparentprevAll the new contact sensors seem to be that large now, including Philips&#x27; and Aqara&#x27;s new ones. They do indeed use larger batteries and they claim several years of use. But man they are so bulky I don&#x27;t see myself using them. Total eyesores. reply andylynch 15 hours agorootparentI really like this change and suspect the reason why is part of their motivation; they button cells used in the common smaller ones are non-rechargeable and this is really quite wasteful given how popular and good AA&#x2F;AAA Rechargeables are reply moogly 14 hours agorootparentAre they good really? Like half of my AAA devices don&#x27;t even work on 1.2V. I&#x27;ve dabbled in USB-C rechargeable Li- Ion AA&#x2F;AAA, but they&#x27;re quite expensive and the charge lasts a short time. They&#x27;re mostly useful in remotes and things like that, kind of like NiMH rechargeables.Meanwhile nonrechargeable batteries get cheaper and cheaper so I just buy them in bulk now. Call me selfish, I guess. reply andylynch 13 hours agorootparentThe USB-C ones trade on capacity and different ones have different self-discharge rates. Some manufacturers specify Panasonic Eneloop batteries. Some other brands’ are made by the same company and are very similar (including IKEA) reply sangnoir 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can purchase rechargeable coin-cell batteries. Device manufactures tend not to care about batteries except for the crappy one they ship in the box - if they bother to do so. reply Modified3019 12 hours agoparentprevDo you put water sensors anywhere besides the obvious places, like under the sink and water heater? reply 0cVlTeIATBs 2 hours agorootparentNext to any condensate pumps, like you&#x27;d have for air conditioning, maybe for a dehumidifier. reply fostware 10 hours agorootparentprevBack of the toilets.Quite a number of leaks come from the braided pipe feeding water to your cistern, as they often only have a five-year lifetime reply dheera 14 hours agoparentprevI have a handful of Aqara motion sensors because some idiots on Youtube recommended them. They&#x27;re shit compared to the Hue motion sensors though, and take 3+ seconds to respond while I look like an idiot waving my hands around and sometimes even need to take off my shirt and wave it like a flag to get the lights to turn on. The Hue motion sensors respond almost instantly in comparison.All this low power electronics designed to run 3 years on a coin battery bothers me. If it&#x27;s that low power why not get rid of the battery, slap a tiny solar panel (the kind they used on calculators in the 90s) and a supercapacitor, it should be able to power itself indefinitely on normal levels of room light, never go into deep sleep states, and can even turn the room lights on automatically if it needs more power. reply Mister_Snuggles 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have any Aqara motion sensors. I do have two Ikea ones though and they work fine.One is in my home office to turn the lights on and off, it works fine and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it not detecting me. It&#x27;s not instant, but always responds within a second or two.The other one is sitting by the cat litter boxes and is used to trigger an automation involving an air cleaner. It senses the cats at a range of about 1.5m just fine.The next thing I&#x27;m interested in is the crop of mmWave presence sensors. There are a lot out there and I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a clear winner in this space yet. reply djhworld 13 hours agoprevIKEA have really nailed the smart home thing, the products are affordable and unassuming and crucially, all zigbee. You don&#x27;t even need to use their hub you can use your own.I&#x27;ve got a bunch of IKEA smart lights, motion sensors, plugs etc around the house and they&#x27;ve worked flawlessly for years, all integrated into home assistant. reply hinkley 15 hours agoprevThey must have some weird research dept there. The first color changing LED strips I found for a reasonable price also came from IKEA. It was several years before anyone matched the price point. For a while I bought CFLs from them and I don’t recall now if that was because of price, color temperature, or dimmer compatibility.You don’t expect them to have tech stuff but they are very low key about the stuff they dohave. reply dougmwne 15 hours agoparentI remember being surprised that there was wireless phone charging built into so many products so early. reply SparkyMcUnicorn 17 hours agoprevI really like the zigbee ecosystem. There&#x27;s a lot of great resources, cheap devices, months&#x2F;years battery lifetimes, and reliability has been top notch for me.Being able to pick your own coordinator&#x2F;\"hub\" and use devices across all different brands like Ikea, Philips Hue, Aqara, etc. is a really great experience.This is a fantastic community resource example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zigbee.blakadder.com&#x2F;sensors.html reply Terretta 12 hours agoparentCuriously, I submitted title revised from Ikea smarthome sensors to Ikea zigbee sensors since this is a hacker community who care about such things, but some time later title was edited to remove the reference to zigbee. reply spankalee 18 hours agoprevI really wish these were Matter over Thread without a hub. I&#x27;m just looking at adding sensors to a home that already has Nest Wifi for the border routers and I don&#x27;t really want to add any other hubs to the mix. reply ashton314 15 hours agoparentIndeed. In all fairness, the hub works really well. I have a few bulbs and switches from Ikea, and I control everything through the Home app on my iPhone. Last week I got an outlet from Ikea. As soon as I added it to the hub, it showed up in the Home app. Matter FTW! reply jsight 17 hours agoparentprevI agree, but delays seem to be the norm with Matter. reply TrueDuality 15 hours agoparentprevDoesn&#x27;t Matter run over Thread? I thought it was just an application protocol not a physical connectivity protocol. reply andylynch 15 hours agorootparentThread builds on the same physical layer as Zigbee, IEEE 802.15.4; the big difference is unlike Zigbee it also incorporates IPv6. The physical layer is important for low power mesh networks, like the sensors and switches here- and WiFi is way, way more power hungry.

The drain pan should itself drain to a pipe.Ideally, a water leak sensor should be used help to catch a slowly failing appliance so you can repair&#x2F;replace it before it does major damage, not preventing it from doing damage in the first place due to a sudden major leak. reply narrowtux 16 hours agoparentI agree that this is the ideal solution, but you can&#x27;t exactly retrofit a place you rent with completely new plumbing. reply 93po 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve lived in rental apartments where the drain pan has a pipe leading to the existing water dump hole that the washer drains into reply wstrange 13 hours agoparentprevThe best solution is a water shut off valve [0] and a bunch of cheap zigbee water sensors.Drain pans won&#x27;t handle a catastrophic failure.

Instead, nobody was inside and a draining laundry machine hit the clog and pushed black water throughout most of the first floor.Knowing that this was happening would not have likely saved the bathroom, or the laundry room, but it might have saved the kitchen.Point is: for water leak scenarios you should think about both clean water coming from inlets as well as clogs in your outlets.. I should get a couple of these to place behind my lowest toilets, where the water came up last time reply NoMoreNicksLeft 15 hours agoparentprevOf all the leaks I&#x27;ve had these past 10 years, only two have been appliances, and one was high pressure (water heater). The other as negligible. Both of those didn&#x27;t need sensors.... they were obvious, and quickly.The leaks that haunt me though... several under the house in the crawl space. Copper pipe pinholes, caused I don&#x27;t know how much damage (including several ruined water heater elements, maybe even causing the water heater to fail prematurely). Ruined floors. Until they got bad enough that we had no hot water (which was about the time the floor started warping), there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anyway that we might have noticed. The water bill wasn&#x27;t unusually high, or maybe it just frog-boiled its way up where we couldn&#x27;t. There were several more copper pinholes, but they were noticed as muddy places in the crawlspace while fixing the first, or just spidey-sensed. I am also very nearly too fat to crawl under the house, let alone do emergency plumbing while there.Another incident involved a squirrel. The idiot owners of this house (before us, not the current idiot owners) decided that the easiest place to put new plumbing was in the ceiling (maybe they were too fat too?). Our attic had a new uninvited guest, and apparently PEX piping is very tasty. Or appears that way, the squirrel lost his appetite after biting enough of a hole that there was a leak from above. This leak though, despite the location which should have made it almost instantly obvious, happens almost within 5 minutes of a torrential downpour that lasted better than an hour. That, plus my unwillingness to believe the previous owners had routed plumbing above everyone&#x27;s heads, meant we didn&#x27;t get that taken care of quite as quickly as we might have.My lessons from this, I think, are:1. We might have caught the crawlspace leaks quickly if there were a humidity sensor (is that how the leak sensors work?) down there, and we could have compared to baseline. That is, if spraying water didn&#x27;t just fry them immediately.2. The ceiling leak probably couldn&#x27;t have been detected very early, given the coincidence with the rain and how it would have raised humidity. Possibly if we had a water pressure sensor, that would have picked it up as a drop, despite there being no faucets running.Plumbing sucks.

But they were hard to pair and every few months they&#x27;ll disconnect from WiFi and need re-pairing. The proprietary app is somewhat annoying and they released a new V2 app which is more annoying and (from what I can tell) doesn&#x27;t have any widgets or siri shortcuts so I need to launch the app every time I want to turn the lights on or off. I&#x27;m sure some newer WiFi bulbs work better but by nature they have to use the cheapest possible WiFi hardware and I&#x27;m wary of them clogging up my airwaves, forcing low PHY rates, and being incompatible with newer WiFi technologies like U-APSD.My new LG TV has a built-in Matter Thread hub, so Thread sounded perfect. No proprietary apps needed, compatible with everything. Just point your phone at the QR code to pair. Fully local, low-latency mesh networking.

Z-wave has better standalone penetration (lower frequency), but if I were to build from the ground up again I would go all-in on zigbee. One of the few reasons I have a z-wave network at all is a smart lock, but these days there are more zigbee offerings there.All lights in my house are hue bulbs, using a deconz setup controlled by home assistant.

Being an open standard there are lots of cheap choices however it also means that because there is no licensing to use it, not all of the devices branded \"zigbee\" are fully compatible with each other.

I&#x27;d be shocked if this same thing could even be made at reasonable margins for $10.The flip side to this, is Zigbee stuff always has a lot of little quirks, problems, or bugs. There&#x27;s literally an entire module&#x2F;database for ZHA (Zigbee Home Assistant addon) called ZHA Quirks that&#x27;s designed to work around all the little issues with various devices. reply jsight 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I used to be a big fan of Z-Wave, but the effective price minimum is killing it. Zigbee and (eventually) Matter seem like the way forward. reply nickthegreek 17 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I love zigbee for its HA integrations. Fully off zwave now. Recently just added some IKEA motion senors and bulbs and everything is working so nice. reply meroje 17 hours agorootparentprevHave an older z-wave heater valve that seems to be on a version of the protocol no one bothers to be backwards compatible with. Never happened with zigbee no matter the amount of quirks needed from zigbee2mqtt. reply rootusrootus 16 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t agree. I was an early adopter and I still have some Z-Wave devices, but I won&#x27;t miss them when they&#x27;re gone. Pairing is a hassle, unpairing just as bad or worse, and licensing costs mean the devices themselves are always more expensive. My USB dongle for Home Assistant supports both Z-Wave and Zigbee, and as I add new devices and upgrade old ones over time, I&#x27;m not buying any new Z-Wave. reply asylteltine 17 hours agoparentprevI prefer zwave as well. As long as you have repeaters (pretty much any light switch) and a good hub (zwave js ui NOT the default one) you will be fine. I run about 20 nodes right now and upgrading to zwave js ui over the default fixed my node graph so everything had a good signal. I do want to see more thread around reply Kirby64 17 hours agorootparentZigbee does just fine with repeaters as well. You just need to be strategic with placing repeater-capable devices around the house, since the range isn&#x27;t quite as good as Z-wave gear due the frequency. reply alistairSH 17 hours agoparentprevMeh, I have som Z-wave switches in the house (some in-wall rockers, some wall-wart smart plugs) and the experience has been mixed. Flaky switches (GE-branded), flaky firmware (SmartThings hub), etc.I&#x27;ll be happy when&#x2F;if Thread becomes the norm and I can just run everything through Apple HomeKit. Though for some reason, I still don&#x27;t see a Thread in-wall dimmer available, which seems crazy to me. reply kelnos 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had really good luck with the Leviton Z-Wave switches & dimmers. Haven&#x27;t had a single problem with them in about 3 years of use. reply alistairSH 14 hours agorootparentHa! All my GE switches have been replaced with Leviton now. So far, so good. I think I&#x27;ve had to hard reset and repair one of them in 3 years, so not too bad.But some days I&#x27;m tempted to swap them all for Lutron Caseta. That just gets a bit pricey (both to swap, and then to expand). reply function_seven 16 hours agorootparentprevSame experience here. Every once in a while a switch will go offline and I have to toggle it to get it to rejoin the network.These switches are all GE (Jasco) units. My Inovelli switches are rock solid, as well as my Kwikset deadbolt.I should probably replace the GEs with Inovellis... reply rootusrootus 16 hours agorootparentAll my older Z-wave switches are Jascos, and while they&#x27;ve been solid for a while now on the Z-Wave part, the relays have been failing over time. One day you turn it on, and instead of staying on, it starts to cycle on-off, on-off, on-off, on-off indefinitely. reply odiroot 17 hours agoprevThese (motion sensors) are gonna be great for a cheap DYI alarm for bicycles&#x2F;motorcycles when parked outside. reply wdb 15 hours agoprevAll the window sensors I ever saw were going inside the window frames.

I have an older model that works nicely for this.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schlage.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home&#x2F;smart-locks&#x2F;connect-zwave.ht...This would give you the \"is locked or not\" capability you seek here, but obviously requires a replacement of your door lock (perhaps not trivial if renting, but is a very easy DIY otherwise). reply estebank 16 hours agoparentprevThat sounds like it could be a lazer&#x2F;ir gate in the lock hole to detect it being in the way, but the custom job to jam it into the frame side of the lock might be quite delicate work if it&#x27;s wood, or even worse if the frame is some prefab unit. Another DYI alternative would be to open the lock and see if you can stick a magnet somewhere in the mechanism where it won&#x27;t impede movement and that has enough space for the solenoid. Neither of these are what I&#x27;d call complex, but also wouldnt call them easy to pull off. I would have to assume that somewhere out there someone is selling this already made. reply notyourwork 16 hours agoparentprevI have a few Emtek locks which support locking and opening detection. Premium brand from Yale, which has a Yale Zigbee module. They also have Zwave support. reply manishsharan 17 hours agoprevEach one of these is definitely cheaper that my Rapberry Pi Pico W project with my son but not nearly as much fun. reply bilsbie 16 hours agoprevOffshoot topic but is there such a thing as an outdoor leak sensor?I’d love to have one on my pool equipment but it would need a way to ignore rain. reply rootusrootus 16 hours agoparentYou&#x27;d need something with brains. Detecting the water is easy, but you want something that can check local weather and correlate with that. Ideally a rain sensor at the same location. I could do this with my Tempest and Home Assistant, I&#x27;m sure. But... I&#x27;ve never had a pool equipment leak that bothered me. All my equipment is outside the house and a leak isn&#x27;t a top concern. if it were in the garage, I&#x27;d be more inclined to put a sensor there, but then rain correlation wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. reply 0_____0 16 hours agoparentprevLeaks are persistent, weather is not. Either present the raw data and interpret it yourself, or gate any alert on potential precipitation in your area. reply dmacvicar 12 hours agoprevZigbee is reliable and quite open. Just go for the Homeassistant and zigbee2mqtt route. You will be able to interact with almost anything from Homeassistant.I just finished moving all my Hue lights from the official hub to zigbee2mqtt + USB dongle, in preparation for the upcoming enshitification (Hue app will require online account). reply hanniabu 16 hours agoprevIs one of these $10 devices all you need? Or do you need some home unit along with it? reply Toutouxc 16 hours agoparentThey’re Zigbee, so they need a coordinator, which you can buy from IKEA or any other brand that does Zigbee stuff, or you can fashion one from a Zigbee USB stick and a Raspberry. reply Mountain_Skies 18 hours agoprevIt appears these are all battery powered and wireless. Probably also means they&#x27;re quite easy to jam with a low powered transmitter. Still are likely useful to protect against the impulsive crimes of opportunity. It&#x27;s also a bit weird that washing machines don&#x27;t come with water leak sensors but I guess manufacturers don&#x27;t want to highlight the possibility of their products causing water damage. reply some_random 17 hours agoparentIf a burglar is sophisticated enough to identify intrusion sensors and deploy countermeasures, they&#x27;re typically not going to be targeting residential homes. reply forward1 18 hours agoparentprevMore bizarre to me still is the fact laundry rooms are built without a drain at the lowest point of the floor. That&#x27;s in fact a feature I would desire in every room of a custom home. reply toast0 18 hours agorootparentThe downside of floor drains is that drains are bidirectional and drain backups come out of the lowest point. That&#x27;s probably ok in a laundry room or bathroom, but wouldn&#x27;t be nice in other rooms. reply tbihl 17 hours agorootparentCould you route the drains to plumbing lower down in the system? I&#x27;m picturing all wet rooms draining to a funnel in the basement via a dedicated gravity drain system. He did say &#x27;custom home&#x27;.... reply toast0 16 hours agorootparentUnless you&#x27;re running a pumped drain system, all of your drains must route to plumbing lower down.If upper floors&#x27; floor drains route to lower floors before joining with other plumbing on the lower floor, that would prevent backups from rising to the upper floor drains (unless their particular pipe was clogged, which should be unusual in a residential floor drain). But you&#x27;ll have this issue at least at the lowest level of the dwelling.Basements are not common where I&#x27;ve lived, but where present in custom houses, they tend to be fully finished and plumbed and then they&#x27;d have floor drains too.In some buildings elsewhere, I have seen a less finished basement, with only laundry and a slop sink... That slop sink may be where a backup from the lateral to the utility sewer (or septic system) would come out. But that&#x27;s not a common look for a fully custom home. reply Scoundreller 16 hours agorootparentA lotta slop sinks are just washing machine drains. Lets your machine pump as quickly as it wants without needing to a separate high-flow drain. And buys you more litres of backflow before its a real problem. Tho some washing machines can pump up quite a few feet if needed.Lived in an apartment where the front-loader managed to pump a sock into the high-flow drain where it got stuck. That was fun...(Also had a front-loader break it&#x27;s door seal, also a lot of fun...) reply Kirby64 17 hours agorootparentprevMany parts of the US don&#x27;t have basements. The lowest point is inside the slab, so drains are relatively constrained. reply thedaly 16 hours agorootparentEven if there is a basement, a lot of homes will have a gravity sewer line that is above the level of the basement floor, and utilize ejector&#x2F;sump pumps for water below the elevation of the sewer. reply Scoundreller 16 hours agorootparentprevBackflow preventers are common in some areas. But you&#x27;re kinda in the dark if it&#x27;s activated and shouldn&#x27;t run anything down any drain on your side. reply Marsymars 13 hours agorootparentNot only common, but required by building code. reply Scoundreller 12 hours agorootparentMaybe in newer construction, but in older (ie: before flood maps were a consideration, good drainage, grading, storm sewers), generally not. reply ziptron 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s even more problematic is that new North American homes are often constructed with a washer&#x2F;dryer \"conveniently\" placed near a bedroom, typically on the upper level, and yet, they are still installed without a drain. reply EvanAnderson 17 hours agorootparentDrain aside (which, AFAIK, would be required by code where I live) I&#x27;d love to have the washer&#x2F;dryer located near bedrooms. Having the laundry off the kitchen, garage, or in the basement creates needless make-work transporting clothes across the house. I don&#x27;t ever disrobe or dress outside my kitchen, garage, or in my basement. (It would make more sense if the laundry backed-up to the bedroom closets.) reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t the noise and vibration get tiresome quickly? Or are new machines quiet and stable enough that it&#x27;s not an issue? reply alistairSH 17 hours agorootparentWe usually do laundry on the weekends, during the day. It&#x27;s actually more annoying in the basement, as that&#x27;s where the familyroom&#x2F;TV are located (and the wall between the W&D and family room is just single-layer drywall, with the W&D right there). reply kelnos 15 hours agorootparentprevMy washer and dryer are in a washer-and-dryer-sized closet in the hall near my bedroom, but I guess the noise insulation is good enough that I don&#x27;t hear it when it&#x27;s running at night. reply cornstalks 17 hours agorootparentprevI’m relatively sensitive to noises (analog clocks are a hard no-go because of their soft ticking; it’s infuriating trying to sleep somewhere that has them). But I barely hear our dryer when it’s running at night, and it’s just on the other side of our bedroom wall. As long as we aren’t doing a load with lots of hard buttons and things (which make a louder clinking sound when tumbling) the dryer is totally fine at night.The washing machine, not so much. The water lines and spin cycle aren’t particularly loud, but they’re loud and distinct enough that it’s too loud for me at night. reply EvanAnderson 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve got a 12+ hour window every day in which nobody is in the bedrooms. reply alistairSH 17 hours agorootparentprevConcur. I live in a 1970s townhouse with a basement laundry room. It&#x27;s annoying to cart loads of laundry down 2 levels and back up again.I&#x27;d love to have an upstairs W&D, but I wouldn&#x27;t install one with a secondary drain pan. reply beart 18 hours agorootparentprevI have a laundry up stairs. However a drain must be installed in my area to meet code. reply marcinzm 18 hours agorootparentprev>That&#x27;s in fact a feature I would desire in every room of a custom home.Some reasons I would not want this is: need to pour water in periodically to keep the trap from drying out and the risk of a sewage backup covering every room in literal shit. reply mritun 17 hours agorootparent“literal shit”? Check the code in your area. The toilet outlet goes into 4” pipe straight to septic, not the 2” drain pipe. reply marcinzm 17 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of homes in the US use a public sewer versus a septic tank. reply mrweasel 17 hours agorootparentprevI believe there&#x27;s a regulation here that requires a drain in the floor of laundry room here in Denmark, but the same isn&#x27;t the case for kitchens, so a dishwasher can still do a lot of damage.It is really weird that for all the smart crap manufactures want to stuff into appliances, leak detection isn&#x27;t particularly high up on the list. It can&#x27;t really be because it&#x27;s hard to do, leak detectors are often one of the earliest sensor types available for new smart home kits. reply pixl97 17 hours agorootparentThe question I guess is reliability of the leak detectors themselves. Will the detector fail more often than the actual unit leaks? reply alistairSH 17 hours agorootparentprevTIL: A secondary drain often isn&#x27;t required by code (in the US). I&#x27;m also shocked by this, seems obvious, especially for a machine that&#x27;s above ground-level. reply shiroiuma 7 hours agorootparentprevLaundry rooms here in Japan (or rather, bathrooms that have a space for a laundry machine, usually next to the sink) are built exactly that way: the drain is in the floor, under the machine. It&#x27;s honestly bizarre that this is not normal in the US. reply almostnormal 17 hours agoparentprev> It&#x27;s also a bit weird that washing machines don&#x27;t come with water leak sensors but I guess manufacturers don&#x27;t want to highlight the possibility of their products causing water damage.A sensor can alert someone but doesn&#x27;t stop the water. There are alternatives:1) An electric valve directly at the tap that the machine actuates when it needs water. Usually comes with hose-in-hose to capture water from a ruptured line and detect and stop releasing water.2) Quantity limiting devices to limit the quantity that can be used contiguously, and reset when the flow stops. Set to the maximum needed by the machine. Should there be any leak, the possible damage is limited. No electricity needed. reply nerdjon 17 hours agoprevI am disappointed that these are not matter out the gate, the door&#x2F;window sensor and the motion sensor would be instant buys for me (likely several).IKEA does do a good job with Homekit support (unless the new hub is different) but really wish I did not need that hub anymore.I am glad that someone is trying to push down the insane home automation tech prices.Side note: I really hate modern SEO. There is not a single link to the actual Hub mentioned in the article, but there are 2 links to the same article about said hub twice. reply Gareth321 17 hours agoparentI’ve been wanting to jump into home automation for YEARS but the awful mix of incompatible products and standards coupled with the frequent deprecation of products which often require an online presence, and the outrageous prices being asked for these quite frankly beta products, kept me away. Once matter is standard I expect prices to drop and that’s when I think it’s safe to jump in. reply SparkyMcUnicorn 17 hours agorootparentZigbee was the solution that solved these complaints for me. My home automation works 100% offline, thanks to Home Assistant + Zigbee.Posted it in another comment here already, but this is my go-to resource to figure out compatibility: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zigbee.blakadder.com&#x2F;And pretty much any zigbee device can be compatible with any gateway. In many cases it&#x27;s just whether someone has taken the time to wire it up in the software or not. reply nicholasjarnold 16 hours agorootparentprevAs another sibling suggested you should seriously consider HomeAssistant here. A main selling point is it&#x27;s ability to seamlessly integrate with an arbitrary mixture of Zigbee&#x2F;ZWave&#x2F;Matter&#x2F;Kasa&#x2F; devices under one management interface.I&#x27;ve been running it for years, keeping up to date with the regular new versions, and haven&#x27;t had any major complaints for basic use cases like: \"I want to turn onwhen(e.g. sundown, certain sensors detectinsane home automation tech pricesAnd yet some comments are complaining that it’s more expensive than a Tuya-based solution or whatever. I think this is at the heart of the problem: people want the longevity and cost of a dumb-home product, but the value of these things is rooted in software. Cognitive dissonance ensues—“you want me to pay a subscription for a door lock?” At least here, IKEA is allowing point-to-point communication that could eliminate moving targets of other companies’ software.The new hub is different, and does not work with the old Ikea system. reply mithr 16 hours agoparentprevSame here. I also find myself peeved at the article author, who for some reason decided to spend half a paragraph essentially parroting the company&#x27;s PR over just how justified this delay is, despite earlier mentioning that they promised Matter support over a year ago.> Ikea ... has “decided to delay this functionality” and will provide an update “when it’s time.” The ongoing delay is understandable given that Ikea’s products already integrate well with other platforms, and the company is focused on keeping things as simple as possible for anyone who delves into the smart home on a whim while shopping for a new bookcase. And when you consider the hurdles required to get everything running on Matter networks during this period of transition, Ikea’s delay is more than justified. reply yetihehe 17 hours agoparentprevWould you buy a hub that adds matter to old zigbee devices? reply WirelessGigabit 17 hours agorootparentOf course. Rather replace the hub than 23 sensors. reply yetihehe 16 hours agorootparentWorking on it, expect it after summer. Zigbee+ble+thread+wifi, but currently only sold in EU and for now only supports our own zigbee devices. Search for Ferguson Digital FS2SH. This hub already has ZB, we will add thread via dongle + firmware update. We plan to add matter support to all devices which we can control (slowly adding more, we want them all, but are limited by number of programmers). It&#x27;s also a little HN worthy, because we plan to use standard nrf dongle and hub will program it on the fly after insertion (for other protocols in future), so you could buy it cheaply yourself. Plus, it has unhindered openwrt root console on easily accessible header inside (will void warrranty though). reply leephillips 16 hours agoparentprev> I really hate modern SEO.I totally agree, but the real problem is people uncritically sharing and promoting articles from low-quality publications. In other words, your wrath is better directed at the HN users who submit and upvote articles from these low-effort sites. There are plenty of publications, such as LWN, that use links to help the reader, rather than to help themselves through Google’s algorithms. reply quartz 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve got a Moen Flo water sensor I really love. It was something like $25 with no monthly fee, has a surprisingly good app (also measures temp + humidity) and can even be paired with a valve that automatically turns off the water in the case of a detected leak.What I like best about it is it can not only set off a siren and notify me in the app, it&#x27;ll also send a text message and even call my phone which is huge because if I have a water leak I want to know no matter what. reply matthewaveryusa 15 hours agoparentThe Moen Flo valve does more than that! Every night it will shutoff your water and observe the pressure. If the pressure drops when the valve is off it will alert you of a leak. They&#x27;re a bit costly at ~400 bucks, but water damage is so expensive it&#x27;s worth it. I have one and it&#x27;s great.Insurance companies will give you a small discount if you have one installed as well. reply jrumbut 16 hours agoparentprevWhere do you put it? reply quartz 12 hours agorootparentIt lives under my sink where I have a bunch of piping to filters that feed the drinking faucet, fridge, and dishwasher.I live in a co-op building from 1929 so it&#x27;s really the only point of failure in the unit that would be my liability if there was a leak and it already saved me once when the old tailpiece on my drain cracked. reply baz00 16 hours agoprevnext [3 more] [flagged] recursive 16 hours agoparentWeird take.

    "title": "Writing Technical Documentation for Your House: A Guide for Homeowners",
    "originLink": "https://luke.hsiao.dev/blog/housing-documentation/",
    "originBody": "Writing Documentation for Your House 2023-11-26 - (6 min read) Contents Motivation Recommended Framework The Changelog Implementation Directory Structure Mkdocs Configuration Local Previews with Just Conclusion Comments on HN Have you considered writing technical documentation for your house? As a first time homeowner, there have been numerous times where I wish I had some documentation to reference for a whole slew of scenarios. As an engineer, I write documentation all the time to answer these questions and build up a knowledge base other team members can refer to. I think this should apply to housing. Motivation As a first time homeowner, I have had so many questions about our house. Some real examples: When was this carpet installed? How do I turn off the water mains? How is the irrigation system set up in this house? Where are all the sprinkler heads? What’s the model of my dishwasher again? I need the user manual. Why is the water pressure so high? What company is in charge of my sewage? What electrical circuits are in the house? Are there networking cable runs? What color exactly is this paint? Unfortunately, for most of these questions, I either had no answer, or I needed to go investigate and/or reverse-engineer directly. As I gathered up these questions, I realized that when it comes to my house, what I actually wanted was a user manual of sorts. I wanted good technical documentation, much like good software provides. So, as we’ve lived here, I’ve started to create just that. Recommended Framework When looking at some of my questions, I found that my favorite technical documentation framework, Diátaxis, would work great here. For those of you unfamiliar, this framework suggests organizing documentation into four modes: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanations. The 4 modes of documentation I’ll refer you to the site itself to learn about its benefits and see examples. The Changelog In addition to these four categories, I also add an important page: a changelog. While I can’t answer the questions in the past, I can at least have a record of important changes during my ownership. On this page, I log all major changes to the house, such as plumbing repairs (and their costs), irrigation system upgrades/changes, carpet installation, remodeling, etc. With it, I can easily answer questions like “When did this carpet get redone, what square footage was needed, and how much did it cost?” Implementation Let me preface this section by saying that my implementation is almost certainly too complex. Yours might be a binder with notes. Or, maybe a Google Doc. Or, maybe it’s a YouTube channel with a bunch of short videos. I personally like having a website I can pull up and search on any device. So, for implementing the documentation site itself, I’m a big fan of Material for Mkdocs. I created a git repo for my house, which I use to store this documentation (automatically built and deployed via Netlify). In addition, this git repo serves as a convenient place to store other important, house-related documents.

Local Previews with Just You’ll also notice a Justfile in my example tree. I’m a big fan of just as a command runner. I have a target like the following to serve the docs locally for previewing: # Serve docs locally serve: #!/usr/bin/env bash set -euxo pipefail VENV_PATH=\"{{justfile_directory()}}/.venv-docs/\" cd {{justfile_directory()}}/docs; if [ ! -d $VENV_PATH ]; then echo \"${VENV_PATH} not found, creating one...\"; python -m venv $VENV_PATH; source ${VENV_PATH}bin/activate; pip install --upgrade pip; pip install -r requirements.txt; mkdocs serve else echo \"${VENV_PATH} already found.\"; source ${VENV_PATH}bin/activate; mkdocs serve fi; Conclusion This has been a nice quality-of-life improvement for my family when it comes to having a simple place to find information. I have an irrigation-system reference page I used frequently when trying to understand how our system worked. I love the user-manual reference page, which collects links to PDFs or web user manuals of all of the appliances, consumer electronics, etc. we use; if I need to perform a routine cleaning of the dishwasher, I’m about 3 clicks from the user manual without needing to search or find model numbers. Having a nice how-to guide for turning off the water mains adds a sense of security in an emergency. I feel like this adds value to our home, and look forward to being able to pass on this documentation to the next owners, so they will have all the answers to the questions I had. Of course, it is highly unlikely the next owners will want such an involved tech stack. But even in that case, I can just share the plain-text markdown files used to generate the site: it will still be far better than nothing.

She lives in an old home and has a neverending list of projects, many of which she took up during the pandemic. She would often livestream her rehab at nights just to connect to people as she worked.One night she was streaming the teardown of a bathroom wall. There, in between the walls, was a clipboard with some notes. She slowly took the clipboard up and started reading. Of course we couldn’t see what she was reading, but she started to cry and sniffle.The clipboard had a list of wiring and installations. Had been written in the 70s. But the front page was a note, she told as she started crying, that said that rehabbing is hard and sometimes lonely work. But to keep at it because one day it’s worth it!That moment arrived at a particularly lonely part of the pandemic for her and those of us watching. Whoever wrote that note and left that documentation from 50 or so years ago of course had no idea how it would find the reader(s) but could there have been a more perfect, beautiful moment than the moment my friend found it in the wall? reply kaycebasques 6 hours agoparentMy uncle lives in an old house in Lodi. He took down some kitchen walls for a major remodel. Somehow, a bunch of letters from the 1920s had slipped between the cracks and got stuck in the wall.

Thanks for sharing :) reply efitz 8 hours agoprevFor my last house, I had spent years on smart home automation, I had a binder that contained clear instructions I wrote for everything, and receipts for every upgrade I ever made on the home, warranty docs, QR codes to download smart home apps to control the devices, plot maps, floor plans, a 1-page list of repairmen for everything- you name it. I made short YouTube videos for everything like turning the water on&#x2F;off, hose bib and sprinkler shutoffs, device pairing, etc. I put dozens of hours into documenting my home, and felt a sense of accomplishment that I was doing a “warm handoff” of the home.The new owner sold the home after two years. From the listing photos she had ripped out most of the smart home stuff and had crappily remodeled (painting river stone hearth, etc). YouTube showed zero hits on it he videos I made. I sincerely doubt that she even bothered to look at the binder I handed over.I will never put that amount of effort into documenting a home again. I know what I’ve done and I keep just enough docs around for my own purposes. reply ozim 2 minutes agoparentHome automation is for me exactly the same as designer kitchen or designer day room.Yeah it was great for the previous owner but it sucks for me as I have different tastes and needs.I am going to rip it all off and do what I want.But in reality I just don’t buy anything that is advertised “one of a kind” because I know it will be more of a hassle to deal with it even if it looks cool.For me cool looking fancy stuff does not add value but rather lowers the value because I know I will have to rip it all of which is just more work. I also rather buy apartment&#x2F;home with some default IKEA kitchen because I know then it will be super easy to rip it out and replace with what I want. Where most of the time I think I would just stick with that default IKEA depending on how long I plan to own the place. reply c22 7 hours agoparentprevThe last time I bought a house I paid about $600 for a pre-purchase inspection and the inspector basically prepared such a binder for me. A few hundred pages of photos and suggested fixes for not only all the defects she found, but also suggested ongoing maintenance schedules and routines for all the systems of the house, photos of the water shutoff, etc. and even a thumb drive with a few videos she shot and a sewer scope. I was updating the binder as I added&#x2F;changed stuff but ultimately figured it&#x27;s probably easier to just a hire another inspection when it&#x27;s time to sell. There were no smart devices, though, that may have added a premium. reply Wistar 3 hours agorootparentA few years ago, I wrote the following comment in another thread here on HN. It is germane to this thread:Back in the early 90s — on a recommendation from a realtor who was a close friend of my brother&#x27;s — I hired an inspector who was close to retirement. He worked with his wife who served as his assistant tasked with, in essence, taking dictation of her husband&#x27;s near constant commentary as he conducted an incredibly thorough inspection. Every outlet tested for proper ground, every nook and cranny looked at, wood moisture content, HVAC pitot readings, masonry, roof … just a super-duper detailed inspection that took about 6 hours to complete.At the end of the inspection, he summed up by saying the house was good and that he had no qualms recommending the house.Two days later, he stopped by with a three-ring binder that contained his inspection report. It first contained a summary that concisely covered the positive and few negative aspects of the house. Then there was a section about the history of the house: the year built, the name of the builder, changes in the neighborhood since it had been built, earthquakes it had gone through, flood events in the area, and so on. It also included the manufacturer names of things such as the windows, door hardware, etc.The third section was lengthy, covering the precise state of the electrical, plumbing, structural, envelope, etc, and included all the notes his wife had taken during the course of the inspection. It included a sub-section with warnings about certain materials that likely contained asbestos and would need to be dealt with if we ever did remodeling.Finally, the largest section was what he called a \"maintenance work order\" arranged as a schedule for the ongoing, recurring upkeep of the house but beginning with things he thought needed to be done immediately, replacement of the circuit breaker box, splash blocks under each outdoor faucet, tuck-pointing some of the chimney&#x27;s brickwork, etc. And then his estimates as to when he thought systems might need to be replaced, the water heater, furnace, roofing, etc. As I discovered when the water heater burst, his estimates were pretty much spot-on. Over time, I added notes as we upgraded things, added low-voltage wiring, and remodeled the basement.Nine years later, when I sold the house, the buyer was elated to have this owner&#x27;s manual and I am fairly certain that the book was key to a very fast sale of the house which we did without a realtor.As I look back on it now, I realize that inspection was perhaps the best $350 I have ever spent.When we bought our next house, the inspection took about an hour and produced a few page report, most of it boilerplate. reply bowmessage 2 hours agorootparentSounds like you found a good one.Though I wonder why they didn’t recommend preventative maintenance on the water heater- if it was electric, why not replace the sacrificial anode? reply 20after4 7 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like $600 well spent. My pre-purchase inspection didn&#x27;t even uncover some fairly obvious unsafe wiring. reply hnick 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve already lived in my home for a decade and think that would be money well spent.

Many relatives see it as that weird hobby I have and don&#x27;t see much of the value. (And I agree given the time I spend tinkering.) Even I would likely rip out most of the inherited smart home stuff in order to replace it or at least flash opensource firmware on it. Another important point I learned is that everything should work as a dumb home when the wifi, gateways, HomeAssisant or some sensors are down. reply Nzen 5 hours agoparentprevWhile I sympathize with your position, it is entirely possible that a person inheriting the smart home might benefit. I&#x27;m reminded of wmsmith&#x27;s anecdote [0] two months ago about a smart home de-ghosting of a widow who couldn&#x27;t drive the smart homing.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37860529 reply erhaetherth 2 hours agorootparentThe good news with smart bulbs is that they&#x27;re easy to unsmart. Just unscrew them and put your dumb bulb back in.I replaced almost all my bulbs with smart bulbs, and then got annoyed having to ask Google to turn on the lights all the time. My solution? Even more technology of course. I found these little buttons that fit neatly over my existing switches so it not only keeps the switch in the correct position but makes it just as easy to turn off&#x2F;on as before. But now they&#x27;re dimmable and remotely controllable which is a plus in my books. Also my apartment is dumb and barely has a single built-in light so it&#x27;s just lamps everywhere; without smart bulbs I&#x27;d probably have to flick a million switches or lamp-ropes. reply petemir 2 hours agorootparentCould you share a link to your found solution? Thanks! reply natmaka 7 hours agoparentprevFor a fair part of the population, especially those using at home a crappy PC crashing twice a week, &#x27;smart home stuff&#x27; means that some bug or backdoor may lead them into a mess: lock them out, let an intruder in, over&#x2F;under-heat for weeks while they are out of town... They don&#x27;t want any part of this. reply pjerem 1 hour agorootparentEven as a tech-savvy person,&#x27;smart home stuff&#x27; does totally means bugs and backdoors everywhere if you just plug and play things.Of course there are available possibilities to take somehow full control of your automation with some Home Assistant or the likes but honestly, it’s really not that easy if you are not already a tinkerer.Great automation will also require more work and knowledge. As soon as you start playing with heating or venting, you are doing work that could require some background. It’s something to buy a nice smart thermostat, but it’s something else to understand where you may place it, how you may program it …It’s an interesting topic for those who like to tinker, but it’s very understandable that most people aren’t going to invest their time on it. reply xyzzy123 6 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to extensive home automation installed by a previous owner, especially if there are cameras in the system. I have no way to know they&#x27;re not maintaining access somehow without re-installing &#x2F; re-flashing everything and linking to \"fresh\" cloud accounts. reply Gigachad 4 hours agorootparentprevIf I bought a house that had a bunch of IoT junk, my first step would be to rip it all out. reply j45 4 hours agorootparentAgreed.At the same time any home automation needs to be able to be cloud and vendor independent.It begins with registering the property an independent email address for any accounts used during setups before taking them offline. Easy to manage for future tenant or sale.Gear is more able to be cloud independent or be made cloud independent, leaving a greater chance to leave at most a local wifi network and local appliance with touch screen (pi) that can peacefully operate without the internet, plugged in and hung on a wall like any other appliance in a mechanical room of the home.The more off the shelf parts can be, the greater the chance of it surviving. reply abraae 7 hours agoparentprevI have a home-built system for monitoring the levels in our water tanks (we live on rain water).Of course some people get by with a simple float indicator, but why would I do that when I could be using high accuracy hydrostatic sensors, esp32, influxdb, grafana, spring, keycloak and mysql running in AWS?I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to be getting support calls if we were to ever sell, so I would probably remove it myself if that happened. reply bigiain 5 hours agorootparentNah, sell them a monthly subscription for the cloud service.

We had bought it in 04, i was working at Microsoft at the time. We raised our son there. I even built a 8’x8’x8’ brick oven for baking pizza and bread (plans from Ovencrafters). I rented an excavator for a week and dug around the entire house and put in 12’ deep footing drains, with clean-out pipes every 20’ down the 100’ to the road. A new 2” pex water main. 1” pvc sprinkler lines buried 3’ deep. I completely gutted and remodeled the basement. I kept a 3” binder with everything in it. Every sprinkler line, footing drain, how my gravity fed recirc system worked, electrical wire, even the pictures of every stage of the six month long brick oven project, including how to move it if needed (10k lbs, but doable with a forklift) When i sold the house, i flew back there just to hand it to the new owner, some nuevo amazon guy. I went through everything with him, and although he listened, there was no interest or appreciation in what i had handed him. Fine. Whatever.I moved back to Seattle a few months ago, and my 17 yo son, who was literally born in that house (on a Murphy Bed i built, also included in the manual (the plans, not that my son was born on it, how weird do you think i am?) went and knocked on the door, and he asked if he could look around (outside). They apparently looked at him as if he was deranged, but said sure.He reported back that they had razed the brick oven, the one thing i thought would out last me in my life. I hoped that one day, maybe some kids would be eating pizza from this oven 100 years from now and no one would know where the oven came from.Yeah, I haven’t had a house since then, but i will do it again, document everything. I will just be pickier about who i sell it to. reply Larrikin 5 hours agoparent>I will just be pickier about who i sell it to.Honestly this kind of mindset is a huge problem in the US. You built the oven, you enjoyed the oven, and you decided to sell the house. Why do you feel the need to dictate what the owner does with the house after? If you wanted to keep the pizza oven as some kind of monument to yourself you could have kept the home.This kind of mindset leads to stale neighborhoods, where some locals feel the need to dictate neighborhood look and feel. You end up with regulations that don&#x27;t allow new construction and can even dictate dumb things like paint color. All to preserve a memory of something that is only important to the people that got to enjoy it when it was new.This is not say nothing should ever be preserved if there is actually something of historical importance that happened there, but it seems like there&#x27;s a mindset to preserve things that are trivial to the many and important to the few. Then there are places with actual historical significance [1] people are willing to just rot.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;mar&#x2F;30&#x2F;rosa-parks-h... reply mgsloan2 3 hours agorootparentWhoah, that interpretation seems pretty wild to me.

They shouldn&#x27;t have the sentimental value of someone else&#x27;s past ideas dictate the new.An awful local law may have dictated that the OP should not have been allowed to build a pizza oven in the first place, because people want to preserve the look and feel of the neighborhood when they moved in. But I also view it as equally bad if the new owner couldn&#x27;t tear it down because of some HOA regulation saying that structures built before some arbitrary date, conveniently a time after they moved in and did their renovations, can&#x27;t be torn down. The only real reason being the sentimental value they have to that past. reply xyzelement 7 hours agoparentprevThank you for sharing that story. Don’t be too upset about the pizza oven. You built it for you and your son and hopefully you got to enjoy it for a while.There is no expectation for the new owners to share the prior owners interests. Maybe they are gluten free. Maybe they are the kinds of people who have zero inters in baking, whatever. You can’t expect them to use the 64 sq ft of their yard as a monument to something you did if it’s not relevant to them.I do get the idea of being attached to your home and hoping it goes to good hands.

The vagaries of modern life and work means most people can’t live where they grew up, make their life elsewhere, possibly multiple elsewhere, and only go back to visit. Unless there’s a real business to inherit e.g. a farm or hotel or some such.That was already the case in my grandparents generation. On my father’s side is a large farm, but my grandparents moved into it. The eldest lives there, and a few of the aunts and uncles have shares from inheritance so they might move into it eventually. Most of them made their lives elsewhere, and their kids went even further afield.On the other side, the grandparents came down from the mountain, built a house, the kids made their own lives throughout the country. The house was sold when my grandmother died a few years back. And she died in that home, for most of my friends the houses were sold when the elder had to move to assisted living (or worse when the house was lost for lack of income).Generational homes were a thing when people didn’t need to move around, but my own parents moved 4 times just in my lifetime.

It sucks your grandkids won&#x27;t be able to eat from your pizza oven, but you did, and you can talk about how you made it, and how much you enjoyed it, and that lives on. My parents sold their home a few years ago, and while my dad will regularly talk about how he misses it and what terrible changes the new owners make, it doesn&#x27;t change that I was raised in that house, and we had great times and memories there, and he will now have a chance to make them with his granddaughter in his new house.

We bought the house and lo and behold it did not work, but I carefully rehabbed it, replaced the pumps and sensors and cleaned everything up, made a custom topper for it, and went on to enjoy 8 years of fun in it.Came time to sell the house, and I told the buyer, the hot tub is great--we&#x27;d love to keep it--if you don&#x27;t want it, we can negotiate that, and we&#x27;ll arrange to actually move it to our new home! They didn&#x27;t respond and bought the house anyway.

The sky is the limit, you can make the yard into a garden, build a pizza oven into your wall, turn the basement into a gaming pad. You did all of those cool things with it!Now, don&#x27;t begrudge the people coming after you for doing the same. It&#x27;s their house, not yours, and they have the chance to make it how they like it. If you want control over a thing, don&#x27;t sell it. Similarly, if you want to dictate what your employees do during non work hours, you have to pay them for it. You treat something as a commodity, and it becomes a commodity. reply argc 7 hours agoparentprevYeah sounds like the people who bought it suck. Why would you destroy a pizza oven? It would add a ton of value to the house for the right buyer. If you had sold it to me I would have absolutely kept the oven :) Also inspires me to follow a similar path for my house. I think the key is to price the house so only someone who values the work you&#x27;ve done would bother buying it, if you have the time to wait around. And I guess that doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything. reply bluGill 7 hours agorootparentOne of those things that adds a ton of value for the right person, but for the wrong person is equally negative value (it takes up 64 square feet of yard space!). While most people won&#x27;t really care. And so while it can add a lot of value to the right person, overall it is zero value. Even to the right person it won&#x27;t be as much value as you would expect - unless they are putting a more than normal down on the house the bank will then value that at zero and thus not give them a loan for what that feature is worth.Pools are the same thing - should be valuable to the right buyer, but in practice worth zero. Even the most valuable remodels - kitchens - often are worth less than not doing it at all because while it adds a lot of value to the house it doesn&#x27;t add as much as they cost. reply grogenaut 4 hours agorootparentthats why you should remodel while you live there so you&#x27;re actually getting value out of your expenditures, not just upgrading everything right before you move out. reply Gigachad 6 hours agorootparentprevBecause it takes up space and is mostly pointless vs a portable propane or electric one. reply pfd1986 7 hours agoparentprevSad to hear about that.

The only thing left behind was a plastic bag of appliance manuals, some old receipts, and most importantly, a sheet of paper with dates, when things were updated, and how much it cost. This has been extremely valuable to me, allowing me to take the guesswork out of figuring out how old my A&#x2F;C or furnace is, when the basement was remodeled, or how much carpet was ordered for the spare bedroom.

Sure it can integrate with that eventually, but I think people would like better info about a basic dumb home.Maybe provide a service where someone comes (or they send you a kit) to scan the house with those things that can see through drywall, scan for heat maps&#x2F;leaks, or just scan the shape of each room and form a map of the house. Of course this provides opportunities for upsales and the like. reply pelasaco 3 hours agoprevSo good, I would love to do it, but I guess I wouldn&#x27;t have the necessary discipline.

    "originBody": "OSes 15 Microsoft opens sources ThreadX under MIT license 15 The 'Azure RTOS' used in millions of Raspberry Pis is now FOSS Liam Proven Tue 28 Nov 2023 // 11:05 UTC Microsoft is open sourcing the realtime operating system that it acquired with Express Logic, donating it to the Eclipse Foundation. The vendor has made its ThreadX RTOS, and the Azure RTOS development suite that includes it, open source. The company has contributed Azure RTOS to the stewardship of the Eclipse Foundation, where it will be known as Eclipse ThreadX and available under the permissive MIT licence. Although there are many Real-time OSes – RTOS for short – out there, you generally don't hear much about them. You may never have heard of ThreadX, but there's a fairly good chance that you unwittingly have several copies lying around or even running right now. There are more famous RTOSes, such as Wind River's VxWorks: it's running on Mars, inside NASA's Perseverance Rover for example. Blackberry's QNX RTOS, which we called the money-making part of the business, has been in the spotlight twice: once as the basis for RIM's Blackberry X fondleslab and smartphone range, but back in the 1990s for the amazing QNX single-floppy demo disk. ThreadX was quite pervasive, though. Microsoft claims 12 billion devices run it, and you might own some of them. For a while it powered Intel's on-chip Management Engine. It is also the firmware that controls every Raspberry Pi bigger than the Pi Pico. On the Pi 1, 2 and 3, it's the file on your Pi's SD card called bootcode.bin; in the Pi 4 and 400, it's called start*.elf. Even though it's on GitHub and included in Debian, it's a proprietary \"blob\" (Binary Large OBject). It's a metaphorical sealed black box which doesn't even contain Arm code: instead, it runs on the Pi's VideoCore GPU. This is the primary device, the part that boots up the Pi and controls its hardware: the Arm cores are slave devices to the VideoCore GPU. Ah lovely, here's something you can do with those Raspberry Pis, NUC PCs in the bottom of the drawer: Run Ubuntu Appliances on them READ MORE This, incidentally, is why Xen only runs on the Pi 4 and later: they were the first versions where the Arm cores had their own interrupt controller, and even so, it took some work. We have read that in the Pi 5, it's in EEPROM and does even less, meaning that the Arm cores have more control, as this Reg comment bears out. As soon as this innocent little OS turned 21 in 2019, Microsoft grabbed it, acquiring ThreadX owners Express Logic and rebranding the poor thing as Azure RTOS, which hasn't done any favours for its brand awareness. The purchase came soon after AWS took over stewardship of FreeRTOS, and some observers, such as this commenter on Reddit, claim that the deal was a response to Amazon's move. After the purchase, original developer William Lamie left, starting a new company which sells a \"fifth-generation\" RTOS with POSIX-compatible threads, called PX5OS. Even so, ThreadX is a tested and established product; some parts even have TÜV Functional Safety (FuSa) certification, such as the STM32 version [PDF]. That kind of thing is powerfully attractive to some customers. Python head hisses at looming Euro cybersecurity rules Open-source IDE NetBeans hits v13 – tweaks for Gradle, Maven Eclipse Data Connector arrives for GAIA-X, Europe's plan to protect its cloud data from foreign tech firms Everything OK with Microsoft? Windows giant admits it was 'on the wrong side of history' with regard to open source At this point, only the current version is on GitHub, and we don't see any trace of a VideoCore version. Although the GPU drivers have long been open source, the firmware never was, and attempts to write an independent FOSS version were never completed, for reasons explained on the project page. Now, there is at least some hope that the Raspberry Pi Foundation might be able to get permission to release the source code for its version. As of last year, the foundation had sold over 46 million of the things, and if the whole software stack were open source, that would make them even more appealing for a lot of people. ® Sponsored: DBaaS takes the trouble out of cloud databases Share More about Azure FOSS Microsoft More like these × More about Azure FOSS Microsoft Open Source Operating System Narrower topics Active Directory Android Audacity Bing BSoD CentOS Debian Digital Public Goods Elementary OS Excel Exchange Server Firmware FOSDEM HoloLens Internet Explorer iOS Jenkins LinkedIn Linux macOS Microsoft 365 Microsoft Build Microsoft Edge Microsoft Ignite Microsoft Office Microsoft Surface Microsoft Teams MySQL .NET Office 365 OpenOffice OS/2 Outlook Patch Tuesday Pluton Qubes SharePoint Skype SQL Server Ubuntu UEFI Unix Visual Studio Visual Studio Code Wikipedia Windows Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows Server Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2013 Windows Server 2016 Windows Subsystem for Linux Windows XP Xbox Xbox 360 Broader topics Bill Gates Cloud Computing Software More about Share 15 COMMENTS More about Azure FOSS Microsoft More like these × More about Azure FOSS Microsoft Open Source Operating System Narrower topics Active Directory Android Audacity Bing BSoD CentOS Debian Digital Public Goods Elementary OS Excel Exchange Server Firmware FOSDEM HoloLens Internet Explorer iOS Jenkins LinkedIn Linux macOS Microsoft 365 Microsoft Build Microsoft Edge Microsoft Ignite Microsoft Office Microsoft Surface Microsoft Teams MySQL .NET Office 365 OpenOffice OS/2 Outlook Patch Tuesday Pluton Qubes SharePoint Skype SQL Server Ubuntu UEFI Unix Visual Studio Visual Studio Code Wikipedia Windows Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows Server Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2013 Windows Server 2016 Windows Subsystem for Linux Windows XP Xbox Xbox 360 Broader topics Bill Gates Cloud Computing Software TIP US OFF Send us news",

If Microsoft is doing this, they&#x27;re pretty much walking away from their roadmap for Azure RTOS and IoT nodes along those lines.I call it a win, ThreadX had a lot more ecosystem behind it than FreeRTOS ever did.

All those nodes need a cloud, somewhere.Taking stewardship of FreeRTOS allows them to develop a SDK, with or without a hardware kit included, to encourage IoT developers to lock into the Amazon ecosystem.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;freertos&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;c-sdk....Microsoft saw this chain of events and panicked, buying up ThreadX to create Azure RTOS. I believe MS is now abandoning this path and focusing on other green fields...the recent events with OpenAI being a huge signal. reply wyldfire 8 hours agorootparentprevAmazon is heavily marketing AWS ro automotive R&D teams. They want them to run their software on Graviton nodes for near-hw performance. And they have virtio-everything interfaces for you to use so your core functionality can be tested in AWS and you have some kind of hypervisor to partition and&#x2F;or abstract the real HW interfaces.A \"software defined vehicle\" [1].Those R&D teams spend a small fortune on devboards with each new generation and only use them for ~a couple years or so. So renting time on AWS is appealing because it&#x27;s not depreciating capital and because they can be more flexible in how they adjust spending to suit development cycle phases where they need more&#x2F;fewer concurrent units.Having freertos allows them to have credible experts in the space their customers are working in, and they can make design changes to freertos to suit this SDV concept.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;automotive&#x2F;software-defined-vehicle&#x2F; reply Szpadel 7 hours agorootparentthat&#x27;s really cool idea, but for such r&d local hardware&#x2F;vm seems to be more ergonomic for attaching debugger and if you have to create such abstractions anyways, I&#x27;m not sure if dev board with second CPU or FPGA for hw emulation wouldn&#x27;t be better way to handle it, as this would allow you to reuse same boats between generations reply kqr2 17 hours agorootparentprevAmazon missed the boat on mobile phone operating systems.

Absolutely!Everything from your x64 CPU to microSD to credit cards(not the readers; readers run antiquated Android and soon known-bad Chromium) runs some form of weird slow proprietary RTOS. It is what it is. I bet it takes ~century with help of superhuman AI to make those run an open and verified code. The situation is improving too, slowly, because using buggy proprietary code is not a goal, but means.It&#x27;s ok to be disgusted about the status quo, but that is not necessarily worth your time; IIRC one of original complaints by RMS on the state of software freedom that lead to Free Software Movement was about some HP printer running buggy custom OS. Even the point people said enough is enough goes back that far. reply parker_mountain 16 hours agorootparentGosh, there&#x27;s so much wrong here.> weird slow proprietaryThey&#x27;re often not weird, a simple single task runner with a few libraries to handle common tasks and cryptographic operations. Very simple, lightweight, and they generally share a common high level architecture (there&#x27;s not much variation in an RTOS)They&#x27;re often not slow, they&#x27;re minimalist OSes - barely qualifying as an OS if at all - designed to run a single task, with time guarantees, and to get out of the way. In fact, if it&#x27;s a single task you need to run, they&#x27;re faster than any general purpose OS - by design!They&#x27;re often not proprietary - a handful of RTOS with huge market penetration used in billions of devices (and now ThreadX) - are open source and have permissive licenses. What IS often proprietary about them are BSPs, but that&#x27;s a whole separate issue. Yes, there are a lot of proprietary ones out there, but as a blanket statement, it&#x27;s simply not true.> readers run antiquated AndroidMany use a stripped down version of AOSP, which has become a de facto standard BSP, yes.

That&#x27;s ... worrying. reply joezydeco 15 hours agorootparentFreeRTOS isn&#x27;t a threat. reply leoedin 19 hours agoprevThe safety certifications are particularly interesting. It&#x27;s a lot of work to develop \"safe software\" - that is software that is developed according to a safety standard and certified to a \"safety integrity level\". Having an RTOS which is both open source and safety certified is pretty great.They say they want to maintain the certifications - that will be tricky unless there&#x27;s some investment coming from somewhere. It&#x27;s a lot of fairly bureaucratic work to understand the safety standards, put the right development processes in place and maintain those as your software changes. It&#x27;s not nearly as simple as just writing code and running it. It&#x27;s definitely not the kind of software development someone would do as a hobby. I hope Microsoft are going to fund some of that development effort.Interestingly although FreeRTOS isn&#x27;t safety certified, SAFERTOS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.highintegritysystems.com&#x2F;safertos&#x2F;) is - which is a commercial implementation with the same APIs. reply MegaDeKay 19 hours agoparentYes, that ongoing certification will be costly but they mention the support of companies with pretty deep pockets: \"In addition to the project, we are also announcing the creation of an interest group focused on developing an industry-supported, sustainable funding model for ThreadX.

You call tx_thread_create or some such and then tx_malloc and so on and then they have tx queues and semaphores and mutexes and so on.Neat to see it&#x27;s still living on.In our case we were doing real-time power&#x2F;fan&#x2F;thermal control loops so we needed control over when certain actions were happening and needed to be able to guarantee that we could sense a problem and then (within X ticks) issue commands to respond, or make the system safe to prevent damage. reply uxp8u61q 14 hours agoparent> I really liked ThreadX when I was working with it a while ago.

And there are literally 100s of files with assembly indexes in the code.But it can be made it easier, with another layer and macro preprocessing. So make a header one for the assembly and one for the C code, and define the struct with the macro. The assembly code can be compiled with C preprocessor, so the macros will work.This way the C and the ASM stay sync. Only drawback, that the struct must be defined with this macros. But this is only for the structures that are used both in assembly and C or higher level.Anyway if the indexes in the assembly code would be macros, that would be also much easier to modify. reply baq 20 hours agoprev> At this point, only the current version is on GitHub, and we don&#x27;t see any trace of a VideoCore version.:((This is the RPi boot blob)> Now, there is at least some hope that the Raspberry Pi Foundation might be able to get permission to release the source code for its version.Indeed that would be something! reply joezydeco 19 hours agoparentI understand the notion here that opening up ThreadX will start to allow visibility into VideoCore, since ThreadX runs the thing. But an RTOS&#x2F;scheduler is only a miniscule part of a GPU and since Broadcom never opens up anything, I believe it&#x27;s a false hope.Opening up any GPU code, from any maker, invites patent lawsuits from competitors. And then the injunctions start flying. reply jylam 15 hours agorootparentHaving worked (very) closely on GPU firmwares and drivers, I always find it funny that it is still something so closely guarded and protected. Honestly there isn&#x27;t much to it. That&#x27;s fairly regular code, not like futuristic algorithms. You won&#x27;t find any novel rasterizing code or ways to order your commands or whatever, 99% of the interesting work is done by the GPU. You&#x27;ll find basic or vaguely clever code to order lists and optimize the order of the commands, but that&#x27;s it.I&#x27;m 95% sure that if AMD released their firmware and&#x2F;or their drivers source code, NVidia wouldn&#x27;t learn anything of value, they wrote the same stuff anyway. That&#x27;s just sad \\o&#x2F; reply gary_0 11 hours agorootparentThis is really just the modern patent regime at work, isn&#x27;t it? Any random problem a chip company SE or EE can solve in an afternoon can get that solution whisked past an overworked patent examiner. Now open-sourcing your basic code to \"optimize the order of the commands\" opens your company up to a hojillion-dollar lawsuit from a patent troll or any competitor that feels like going nuclear. Maybe the patent is BS but it&#x27;ll take a multi-million-dollar lawsuit to prove it.It might not even be realistic that some jerk is going to search through 10 million lines of driver code looking for patent violations, but these are corporations we&#x27;re talking about. They&#x27;re twitchy when it comes to risk. So the source of insanity here is the broken patent system, isn&#x27;t it?

True, but from a link in the related article from The Guardian [0]> Broadcom when they developed the original Videocore firmware bought a licence for ThreadX from the writer. AIUI, a lifetime licence, it never expires. No royalties or anything like that. Raspberry Pi have modified that firmware many many times over the last 10 years, but no royalties to pay. Many years later the writer of ThreadX sold the thing to Microsoft.So sounds like the RPi folks have a free hand over this firmware and they might be able to open it now?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.theregister.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;reply&#x2F;4735439 reply bri3d 18 hours agorootparentThreadX is just the scheduler &#x2F; OS functionality. There are tons of other components in the firmware (namely, the parts that actually do things) which are still encumbered by patent and copyright issues, not to mention the DRM modules which are somewhat security-by-obscurity based.It&#x27;s one step closer to an open Pi firmware in some ways, but probably not a meaningful step. reply seba_dos1 18 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, the firmware is how they implement DRM for camera and codecs. reply joezydeco 18 hours agorootparentprevI believe it&#x27;s wishful thinking.

ThreadX is really the least interesting part of this whole operation in terms of the Raspberry Pi.It&#x27;s very cool that ThreadX has been open sourced as it offers an additional battle tested and mature alternative to FreeRTOS for new projects. If they&#x27;re able to get and maintain the various safety certifications for ThreadX under the Eclipse foundation, this could be game-changing in a very different space from the Pi.

To quote Obi-wan, \"That&#x27;s a name I&#x27;ve not heard in a long time\". I last worked on a ThreadX based product about 20 years ago. It was annoying because our application device did not require Real Time scheduling, or a particularly fast boot, but the decision to go with ThreadX rather than, say, embedded Linux was made way over my Junior head. We even had a separate \"higher end\" product that ran embedded Linux, which was a joy to work with, so it&#x27;s not like we didn&#x27;t think Linux would work. Everything we ended up doing on that product took 2X to 3X as long to develop, debug, and test because a lot of the niceties that you come to rely on from a kernel simply didn&#x27;t exist with ThreadX.It&#x27;s really something I would only use for an extremely simple safety-critical device, one that absolutely needed Real Time. reply freedomben 17 hours agoprevThis is indeed a major deal, and having the Eclipse Foundation shepherd it is wonderful.Microsoft deserves praise and even adulation for this, but time will tell how well supported the project is.

(It was a ruggedized device embedded into an experiment that we literally dropped from an eight story building twice a day. The device in question did just fine, although, unsurprisingly, a bunch of the rest of the apparatus needed rather regular repairs.)The development experience was miserable. The embedded code was in C, and, when something went wrong, there was about a 50% chance that the bug was in the proprietary compiler from the vendor and not in the C code at all.There was probably some way to debug the live system, but I never found it. I’m not sure where was any way to simulate the system well enough to run our code short of actually uploading it to the device.The world has come a long way :). An RPi or Arduino or anything else along those lines would likely also survive the treatment we gave this thing as long as all the connectors were very well secured. reply HankB99 18 hours agorootparentprev> I cannot imagine embedded pre ardunio.

In many cases, they&#x27;re actually counterproductive and encourage people to focus on minute, obscure error sources rather than addressing significantly more common issues like memory safety and undefined behavior. reply demondemidi 17 hours agorootparentThanks for your insight!

    "title": "Breakthrough FDA Approval Moves Large Dog Lifespan Extension Closer",
    "originLink": "https://loyalfordogs.com/posts/loyal-announces-historic-fda-milestone-for-large-dog-lifespan-extension-drug",
    "originBody": "Posted November 28, 2023 FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine agrees Loyal’s data supports reasonable expectation of effectiveness for large dog lifespan extension by Celine Halioua Four years ago I founded Loyal with a simple vision — to bring to market the first drug explicitly approved and labeled for healthy lifespan extension. Loyal was only a few months old and about five people when we decided to begin by targeting the abnormally short lifespan of large breed dogs with a drug program we code-named LOY-001. Today, I’m so proud to announce that Loyal has earned what we believe to be the FDA’s first-ever formal acceptance that a drug can be developed and approved to extend lifespan. In regulatory parlance, we have completed the technical effectiveness portion of our conditional approval application for LOY-001’s use in large dog lifespan extension. As there was no established regulatory path for a lifespan extension drug, we had to design from scratch a scientifically strong and logistically feasible way to demonstrate efficacy of an aging drug. This process took more than four years, resulting in the 2,300+ page technical section now approved by the FDA. It included interventional studies of LOY-001 in an FDA-accepted model of canine aging and an observational (no-drug) study of 451 dogs. Our interventional studies with LOY-001 showed that the drug improved clinically-relevant aging parameters. We assessed these in laboratory studies using a dog model that represents accelerated aging. We then correlated those results with quality of life scores in the observational study, as independently measured by dog owners, and health outcomes as measured by veterinarians. This was key to show that the biological benefits of the drug are linked to clinically relevant outcomes. From our data, the FDA believes LOY-001 is likely to be effective for large dog lifespan extension in the real world. Once we satisfactorily complete safety and manufacturing sections and other requirements, vets will be able to prescribe LOY-001 to extend the lifespan of large dogs while we complete the confirmatory pivotal lifespan extension study in parallel. What this means for large-breed dogs If you have a large- or giant-breed dog you may be familiar with the sad reality that these large dogs tend to live shorter lives than smaller dogs — often by half. Giant breeds like Great Danes have an average lifespan of 7-10 years, while tiny breeds like the Chihuahua live 14-16 years. (source: AKC, O’Neill et al 2013). Not only do they have varying lifespans, but it’s possible that aging and age-associated disease progresses differently among different breeds. This is unusual — very few if any other animals have such an extreme lifespan variation within the same species. Generally, the larger a mammal is, the longer its expected lifespan — a mouse may live two to three years, while elephants can live over 60 years. Part of this lifespan disparity comes from the process of selective breeding that “created” these dog breeds. Historical selective breeding is understood to have created genetic issues like hip dysplasia in German Shepherds and breathing issues in brachycephalic dogs. In large- and giant-breed dogs, breeding for size caused these dogs to have highly elevated levels of IGF-1, a hormone that drives cell growth. High IGF-1 effectively drives these dogs to grow large when they’re young, but high IGF-1 levels in adult dogs are believed to accelerate their aging and reduce their healthy lifespan. LOY-001 extends lifespan in part by reducing IGF-1 to levels seen in smaller-breed dogs. The IGF-1 axis is one of the most well-studied longevity pathways. In model organisms from c.elegans to mice, reducing IGF-1 extends healthy lifespan, and increasing IGF-1 shortens healthy lifespan. In humans, certain centenarians have been shown to have genetically lower levels of IGF-1. The breakthrough moment for Loyal was connecting the biological mechanism of big dogs’ size to their short lifespan, and recognizing the big-dog-short-lifespan phenotype may not be inherent, but instead a type of “accelerated aging disorder”. We designed LOY–01 as a long-acting injectable administered by your veterinarian every three to six months. In parallel, through our recently-announced partnership with Crinetics, we’re also developing LOY-003, a daily pill to address this same IGF-1 over-expression. A regulatory process that ensures safety and effectiveness Our product strategy has always been centered on earning FDA approval. While more challenging, time intensive, and expensive, I believe achieving FDA approval is critical to demonstrating the scientific legitimacy of lifespan extension drugs. Most people know that the FDA has a rigorous system for ensuring that pharmaceutical products are safe and effective for humans. The same is true for veterinary medications — the drugs your vet prescribes to your dog, like the Rimadyl my senior Rottweiler takes for her arthritis, have been tested extensively and are regularly monitored by the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. To obtain approval to sell the drug, companies must present extensive data to the FDA in three core areas: Efficacy — It does what it says it will do; in our case, it extends the lifespan of dogs. Safety — It’s proven safe for dogs, and any side effects are well-understood and documented. Manufacturing — We can manufacture it at a consistently high quality, at scale. The health and safety of dogs is our top priority in all things, and there’s no higher bar in the United States than the FDA. Conditional approval helps us help dogs sooner The FDA’s expanded conditional approval process allows companies to bring certain products to patients while conducting longer effectiveness studies, specifically when the product meets an important unmet need. This helps us get treatment as early as possible to older dogs who need it most. To receive conditional approval, the product must meet the same rigorous safety and manufacturing standards as drugs that are fully approved. To stay on the market beyond the five-year conditional approval period, we must demonstrate full efficacy — in our case lifespan extension — in a pivotal study. What this means for all dogs Each milestone we’ve achieved in this methodical, evidence-based process has demonstrated steady progress toward our vision of helping dogs live longer and stay healthy as they age. This one is especially important because it marks a key step toward FDA approval based on credible, carefully reviewed data. This process will make it possible for us to bring our products into veterinary clinics everywhere, and lead the charge on a new approach to age-related disease and decline. That will ultimately mean more healthy years for the dogs we love — and that’s why we’re here. —————— Thank you so much to the Loyal team for your intelligence, creativity, and determination to reach today’s milestone.

So many people, not providing enough training nor enough job for their dog resort to using harnesses and other restraints when in public, and then when they have company over the dogs are reactive until they are put in the place where they can be out of the way.This is arriving at the wrong diagnosis. Yes, a tired dog is a happy dog and not exercising your dog enough will lead to all sorts of issues, but reactivity (what you&#x27;re describing) is not addressed by merely working your dog out more. If your dog is showing reactivity, rarely is it just a lack of exercise.> I strongly feel most people with large dogs, especially in suburbs and cities, are doing those animals a disserviceA dog can be effectively exercised via a combination of physical activity and exercising their nose. It&#x27;s widely observed that ~20min of sniffing exhausts a dog as much as ~60min of hard physical exercise. This is one of the first things a competent dog trainer will teach you with regards to exercise - if you&#x27;re busy, hide a treat and send the dog searching. There are also, plenty of jobs you can teach a dog to keep them busy around the house, for example, fastidiousness. Teach a dog it&#x27;s their job to ensure certain items are in a certain place at all times, and it will keep them mentally engaged throughout the day.

It’s all very stupid.I highly implore anyone considering a dog to be honest about what you can support, challenge your assumptions about why you love big dogs, and above all consider adopting over purchasing.

So many people, not providing enough training nor enough job for their dog resort to using harnesses and other restraints when in public, and then when they have company over the dogs are reactive until they are put in the place where they can be out of the way.This is definitely true...in a single-dog household.Treat it like dog ADHD. Working&#x2F;fighting dogs don&#x27;t want to sit still. Trapping them in an apartment all day, alone, will make them miserable. Would you be happy in solitary confinement?But-- in my experience (huskies), stimulation appears to be just as effective as the vaunted exercise goals. Crazy as it sounds (and it is a lot of additional work and expense), getting a second husky keeps the first one busy. While she was left alone, she tore everything up and acted out a lot. Now they wrestle with each other all day, terrorize the cats together, and crash on the couch. A constant supply of new toys also helps.(FWIW they&#x27;re both rescues; I would never recommend huskies in small spaces, especially not around cats, as a conscious choice-- they&#x27;re wolves in kabuki mask.

I don’t think having a harness on a dog in public is a problem though. I have 2 Australian cattle dogs and they are great off leash but not sociable to other dogs. One is friendly or indifferent to strangers but wary of children because she didn’t have exposure to young children growing up or even now. The other is deaf and is nervous about other people.We go out on long hikes in the timberlands when possible and they aren’t leashed and they’re great about being mindful of where I am and don’t stray too far and come back if I stop. That said they still have their harnesses on, for safety (people hunt there, blaze orange) but also there are unexpected situations that can happen.Day to day they spend a 1-2 hours of active play in the backyard as well as intermittent play inside. If they aren’t getting enough exercise in they let you know it.My biggest problem with the oldest one (9) is that the wear and tear on her body from being very active shows and she has a stupid pain tolerance. It is hard to try to engage her in low impact play when she is limping but still happy to sprint across the yard to catch a ball.For truly big dogs, like a Pyrenees, their later years are really sad because their back tends to just give out on them and they have a ton of trouble just getting up and moving around.The worst part of dogs is that they don’t live long enough but I’m also not personally interested in artificially extending my dogs lifespan, just making sure they aren’t suffering in their older age. reply mbreese 13 hours agoparentprevBack in the day, Jon Katz (of Slashdot&#x2F;Slate fame) wrote a book (and several articles) about his experiences with a temperamental Border Collie.

As a little dog, especially a Yorkshire terrier, he definitely had his medical bills. But outside of those expenses, our month-to-month costs were almost negligible. A $25 bag of food would last 8-10 weeks. Any medication we got him we broke in half or sometimes even quarters, because they literally didn’t make doses small enough for him, which meant any course of any medication was pretty cheap.I mostly bring this up because a lot of people assume little dogs are incredibly expensive because of medical issues. They are not wrong per se, and breed matters a lot here, but there are plenty of small and healthy mutts that need good homes and your monthly budget for them is going to be much lower than what you need for some of larger dogs.

Gabapentin, for example, is something we use for our cats and a senior dog with arthritis.

You&#x27;d think rat owners would be more blasé about death, but it couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.Really though, for most illnesses they just get human drugs on a much smaller scale. My vet prescribes metacam when they&#x27;re very sick, which is also what I got after my last surgery. They get the same antibiotics I&#x27;ve taken previously.

We assessed these in laboratory studies using a dog model that represents accelerated aging.

Up to about 6 feet or so, humans might be an exception, perhaps because being taller is associated with better childhood nutrition? But even among humans, above 6.5 feet or so, I think expected lifespan begins to fall?Am I mistaken, or otherwise: Isn&#x27;t this inversion kind of curious?I also found this paper from 2013 that appears to make a similar claim: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3651517&#x2F;. reply DFHippie 8 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s been my impression.

The IGF-1 hormone spurs growth when they are young, but its continued presence after they stop growing greatly increases their chances of health issues like cancer later in life.

There is a special place in hell for those that run puppy mills. The same goes for the buyer though. It isn’t hard to figure out if you are buying from a responsible breeder. There is typically a long waiting list (we waited nearly two years for our boy) and there is a long “who are you and can you properly look after a dog” process before you even get on the list.At the end of the day, puppy mills exist because people buy from them.Responsible breeders work hard with the respective breed groups to improve the health standards, and a lot of work is underway to introduce new bloodlines and standards to unhealthy breeds. That is not to say that all breeders are good breeders, or care much about dogs’ health, but there is a definitive push for change going on towards improving the standards. reply obmelvin 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure this targeted at the fact that larger dogs in general live shorter lives than small dogs.

One presumes that 11 year old wild wolves don&#x27;t have the health problems that plague 11 year old large dog breeds.Giant dog breeds humans have made rarely have such long life spans, with dogs like Saint Bernards, Great Danes and Irish Wolfhounds living 8 to 10 years.That is living indoors, with access to regular medical checkups, and without parasites.FWIW Wolves are huge, up to 160lb. reply debacle 15 hours agorootparentThe breeding for all dog species is very poor.

The reason: anesthesia and medications are dosed by weight. They then went on to list the medical issues each breed is susceptible to. It took a while.The article explicitly calls out why this research is helpful: because we, as humans, have bred large dogs to die early as a side effect of their size.It&#x27;s really hard for me to understand why people are okay paying a dog breeder to perpetuate significant health problems. Plenty of owners are ignorant, but plenty of people fully understand that the Irish Wolfhound that they&#x27;re going to purchase and grow to love will quite possibly die of old age in seven years, and that paying even a responsible breeder who&#x27;s trying to minimize this problem will _still_ result in more dogs that die too young purely for our preferences. reply hobotime 15 hours agorootparentYou can side step a lot of nonsense by selecting breeders of hunting dogs.

    "originBody": "Introducing SDXL Turbo: A Real-Time Text-to-Image Generation Model Product 28 Nov Key Takeaways: SDXL Turbo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a new distillation technology, enabling single-step image generation with unprecedented quality, reducing the required step count from 50 to just one. See our research paper for specific technical details regarding the model’s new distillation technique that leverages a combination of adversarial training and score distillation. Download the model weights and code on Hugging Face, currently being released under a non-commercial research license that permits personal, non-commercial use. Test SDXL Turbo on Stability AI’s image editing platform Clipdrop, with a beta demonstration of the real-time text-to-image generation capabilities. Today, we are releasing SDXL Turbo, a new text-to-image mode. SDXL Turbo is based on a novel distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), which enables the model to synthesize image outputs in a single step and generate real-time text-to-image outputs while maintaining high sampling fidelity. For researchers and enthusiasts interested in technical details, our research paper is available here. It's important to note that SDXL Turbo is not yet intended for commercial use. Advantages of Adversarial Diffusion Distillation Featuring new advancements in diffusion model technologies, SDXL Turbo iterates on the foundation of SDXL 1.0 and implements a new distillation technique for text-to-image models: Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. By incorporating ADD, SDXL Turbo gains many advantages shared with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), such as single-step image outputs, while avoiding artifacts or blurriness often observed in other distillation methods. The SDXL Turbo research paper detailing this model’s new distillation technique is available here. Performance Benefits Compared to Other Diffusion Models To make the selection for SDXL Turbo, we compared multiple different model variants (StyleGAN-T++, OpenMUSE, IF-XL, SDXL, and LCM-XL) by generating outputs with the same prompt. Human evaluators were then shown two outputs at random and tasked to pick the output that most closely followed the direction of the prompt. Next, an additional test was completed with the same method for image quality. In these blind tests, SDXL Turbo was able to beat a 4-step configuration of LCM-XL with a single step, as well as beating a 50-step configuration of SDXL with only 4 steps. With these results, we can see SDXL Turbo outperforming a state-of-the-art multi-step model with substantially lower computational requirements without sacrificing image quality. Additionally, SDXL Turbo provides major improvements to inference speed. On an A100, SDXL Turbo generates a 512x512 image in 207ms (prompt encoding + a single denoising step + decoding, fp16), where 67ms are accounted for by a single UNet forward evaluation. Explore SDXL Turbo with Clipdrop To test the capabilities of this new model, visit Stability AI's image editing platform, Clipdrop, for a beta demonstration of SDXL Turbo's real-time image generation. It's compatible with most browsers and is currently available to try for free.

Yes, I&#x27;ve heard of people paying for ChatGPT because it answers programming questions really well, but that&#x27;s individual users, who are cost sensitive. The real money was supposed to be selling these things as worker replacement, but Hollywood unions have (rightfully) shut AI companies out of the markets where a machine that can write endless slop might have made lots of money.OpenAI can remain in Microsoft&#x27;s orbit for as long as the stupid altruist &#x2F; accelerationist doomer debate doesn&#x27;t tear them apart[1]. Google has at least a few more years of monopoly money before either the US breaks them up or the EU bankrupts them with fees. I don&#x27;t know who the hell is pumping more money into either Anthropic or Stability.[0] Porn. It&#x27;s always porn. OpenAI doesn&#x27;t want to touch it for very obvious reasons.[1] For what it&#x27;s worth, Microsoft has shown that all the AI safety guardrails can be ripped out by the money people at a moment&#x27;s notice, given how quickly they were able to make the OpenAI board blink. reply Jackson__ 6 hours agoparentThe only truly successful commercial use of SDXL I know of is by NovelAI. Said company appears to have used an 256xH100 cluster to finetune it to produce anime art.Open source efforts to produce a similar model seem to have failed due to the extreme compute requirements for finetuning. For example, Waifu Diffusion using 8XA40[0] have not managed to bend SDXL to their will after potentially months of training.If you need 256xH100 to even finetune the model for your use case, what&#x27;s stopping you from just training your own base model? Not much, as it turns out. Developers of NovelAI have stated they&#x27;ll train from scratch for the next version of their model a few weeks ago.So I agree, even with the licensing changes things might be looking somewhat dire for SAI.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;harubaru&#x2F;f727cedacae336d1f7877c4bbe2... reply viraptor 21 minutes agorootparentWhat do you mean by extreme requirements? There&#x27;s lots of SDXL fine tunings available at civit, like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;civitai.com&#x2F;models&#x2F;119012&#x2F;bluepencil-xl for anime. The relevant discords for models&#x2F;apps are full of people doing this at home.Or are you looking at some very specific definition &#x2F; threshold for fine tuning here? reply donkeyd 0 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m just going out on a limb here, but a paid service needs to be good with limited input. I&#x27;ve used SD locally quite a lot and it takes quite a bit of work through x&#x2F;y plots to find combinations of settings that produce good images somewhat consistently. Even when using decent fine tunings from CivitAI.When I use a decent paid service, pretty much every prompt gives me a good response out of the box. Which is good, because otherwise I&#x27;d have no use for paid services, since I can run it all locally. This causes me to go to a paid service whenever I want something quick, but don&#x27;t need full control. When I do want full control, I stick to my local solution, but that takes a lot more time.

From my experience, it is a world of a difference between the NovelAI and WaifuDiffusion models in both quality and prompt understanding.Note, the very baseline I set for the WaifuDiffusionSDXL model was to beat their SD2.1 based model[0], which it did not in my opinion.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;hakurei&#x2F;waifu-diffusion-v1-4 reply dreampen 3 hours agoparentprev> Porn.

In every enterprise I’ve been involved with over the last few years we have had some incredibly material and important use cases of OpenAI LLMs (as well as Claude). They aren’t spewing slop or whatever, they’re genuinely achieving valuable and foundational business outcomes. I’ve been a bit stunned at how fast we’ve achieved these things and it tells me that the AI hype isn’t hype, and that if we have done these things in a year, it’s hard to estimate how much impact the technologies will have in five but I think it’s substantial. So is our spend with OpenAI. Or rather, with Azure on OpenAI products. The only value from our experiences Microsoft offers is IAM - which is sufficient frankly.Stability and Midjourney are also making money, but it’s largely with amateurs and people prototyping content for their own creations. A lot of single person Indy game developers are using these tools to generate assets, or at minimum first pass assets. I think a lot of media companies are producing the art for their articles or news letters etc using these tools. Whether this is enough, I don’t know. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentSigh I&#x27;m really tired of seeing people assume OpenAI is profitable. We have no idea of they are or not and have some indication that they&#x27;re incinerating money on chatgpt to the point that they&#x27;re turning off sign ups because they&#x27;re out of compute. reply fnordpiglet 4 hours agorootparentMy understanding, which I can’t prove other than to say it comes from folks affiliated with OpenAI, is that chatgpt doesn’t make money but also doesn’t lose money (in aggregate, some accounts use way more than others but many accounts are fairly idle), and their API business is profitable and accounts for most of their GPU utilization. I have no insight into why they would turn off signups for chatgpt other than they may need the capacity for their enterprise customers, where they make a decent margin. reply refulgentis 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a useful argument insomuch as A) its unfalsifiable until they IPO (reporting indicates they are very, very profitable) and B) running out of GPUs seems like an odd thing to name as an indicator you&#x27;re _losing_ money.People are genuinely way, way, way underestimating how intense the GPU shortage is. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t seen any reporting about their costs. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re making bonkers numbers in revenue, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re profitable if they&#x27;re losing money on every gpt call. You&#x27;re saying my claim that they&#x27;re unprofitable is unfalsifiable. The same is true for claims that they&#x27;re wildly profitable.

It&#x27;s always porn.I&#x27;ve been surprised at the explosion of porn. Well, not actually. Automatic1111 made that easy and anyone that CivitAI knows all too well what those models are being used for. I mean when you give teenagers the ability to undress their crushes[0] what do you think is going to happen (do laws adequately protect people (kids)? Can they? Will this force a shift towards actually chasing producers, distributors, and diddlers?)?Porn is clearly an in demand market. But what does surprise me is that there&#x27;s been a lot of work in depth maps and 3D rendering from 2D images in the past few years so I&#x27;m a bit surprised that given how popular VR headsets are (according to today&#x27;s LTT episode, half as many Meta Quest 2s as PS5s have been sold?!). I mean if VR headsets are actually that prolific it seems like there&#x27;d be a good market for even just turning a bunch of videos into VR videos, not to mention porn (I don&#x27;t have a VR headset, but I hear a lot of porn is watched. No Linus, I&#x27;m not going to buy second hand...). I think all it takes is for some group to optimize these models like they have for LLaMA and SD (because as a researcher I can sure tell you, we&#x27;re not the optimizers. Use our work as ballpark figures (e.g. GANs 10x Diffusion) but there&#x27;s a lot of performance on the table). You could definitely convert video frames to 3D on prosumer grade hardware (say a 90 minute movie in do laws adequately protect people (kids)? Can they? Will this force a shift towards actually chasing producers, distributors, and diddlers?It&#x27;s extremely complicated. Actual CSAM is very illegal, and for good reason. However, artistic depictions of such are... protected 1st Amendment expression[0]. So there&#x27;s an argument - and I really hate that I&#x27;m even saying this - that AI generated CSAM is not prosecutable, as if the law works on SCP-096 rules or something. Furthermore, that&#x27;s just a subset of all revenge porn, itself a subset of nonconsensual porn. In the US, there&#x27;s no specific law banning this behavior unless children are involved. The EU doesn&#x27;t have one either. A specific law targeted at nonconsensual porn is drastically needed, but people keep failing to draft one that isn&#x27;t either a generalized censorship device or a damp squib.You can cobble together other laws to target specific behavior - for example, there was a wave of women in the US copyrighting their nudes so they could file DMCA 512 takedown requests at Facebook. But that&#x27;s got problems - first off, you have to put your nudes in the Library of Congress, which is an own goal; and it only works for revenge porn that the (adult) victim originally made, not all nonconsensual porn. I imagine EU GDPR might be usable for getting nonconsensual porn removed from online platforms, but I haven&#x27;t seen this tried yet.I&#x27;m disgusted, but not surprised, that teenage kids are generating CSAM like this. Even before we had diffusion models, we had GANs and deepfakes, which were almost immediately used for generating shittons of nonconsensual porn[1].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalit... and the later https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_v._Handley[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OCLaeBAkFAY reply CaptainFever 31 minutes agorootparent> AI generated CSAM is not prosecutableThis is true, though \"AI CSAM\" is an oxymoron. There is no abuse in the creation of such works, and such it is not abuse material, unless of course real children are involved. reply adventured 6 hours agoparentprevThe EU views Google as a tobacco company. The last thing they want to do is bankrupt them with fees. They want to milk Google - big tech generally - for tax revenue. And besides, it&#x27;d take $100 billion per year in fees, which is never going to happen. Meanwhile Google keeps getting bigger year after year (they have nearly doubled in size in four years, up to $300b in sales now) and Bing has made zero headway despite the AI-angled efforts (BingChat etc). Maybe the mainstream adoption of GPT (or similar) would severely damage Google, there&#x27;s still a lot of time left for Google to take their shot at getting out in front of that outcome.The US breaking Google up also won&#x27;t end the monopoly money. More likely one of the children will spin out with an even better margin business. reply godelski 6 hours agorootparent> The US breaking Google up also won&#x27;t end the monopoly money.It&#x27;s also weird because modern economics with tech has created a space that creates a lot of natural monopolies. Momentum is very powerful and it&#x27;s the reason silicon valley companies will run at a loss for years creating a userbase. Trick is to keep them (or sell before buyer starts charging). There&#x27;s what, 2 map companies and only one of them is in high usage because it&#x27;s a default? Same with browsers. You can&#x27;t compete because making a better product isn&#x27;t enough in a system where network effects dominate the economics. Hardware companies are seeing that (along with patent issues, especially across borders). I have no idea how to think about this tbh because it is weird. In some cases breaking these companies up ultimately destroys them while in other cases, exactly what you say. reply thot_experiment 10 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been mucking with this stuff again and the SDXL + LCM sampling & LoRA makes 1280x800 images in like 2 second, so about a ~5x speed increase for me (so this would be roughly 2x faster than LCM (??, napkin math)). I&#x27;ve found that the method isn&#x27;t as good at complex prompts. They claim here this can outperform SDXL 1.0 WRT prompt alignment, but I&#x27;m curious what their test methodology is.

If model outputs are derivatives of the model, it&#x27;d be difficult to argue that the model itself isn&#x27;t a derivative of all the training data, most of which isn&#x27;t licensed. So if anything, this covers Stability&#x27;s ass, not yours. There&#x27;s also the related question of if AI models - not their outputs, just the models themselves - have any copyright at all. The logic behind the non-copyrightability of AI art would also apply to the AI training process, so the only way you could get copyright would be a particularly creative way of organizing and compiling the training dataset.Remember: while the \"AI art isn&#x27;t art\" argument reeks to high heavens of artistic snobbery, it&#x27;s not entirely wrong. There isn&#x27;t a lot of creative control in the process. Furthermore, we don&#x27;t give copyright to monkeys[2], so why should we give it to AI models?\"Noncommercial\" isn&#x27;t actually a thing in copyright law. Copyrighted works are inherently commercial artifacts[0], so if you just say \"noncommercial use is fine\", you&#x27;ve said nothing - and you&#x27;ve invited the legal equivalent of nasal goblins[1] into the courtroom. Creative Commons gets around this by defining their own concept of NonCommercial use. So what did Stability&#x27;s lawyers cook up?> “Non-Commercial Uses” means exercising any of the rights granted herein for the purpose of research or non-commercial purposes. Non-Commercial Uses does not include any production use of the Software Products or any Derivative Works.Uh... yeah. That&#x27;s replacing a meaningless phrase with a tautology. Fun. The only concrete grant of rights is research use, and they categorically reject \"any production use\", which is awfully close to all uses. Even using this to generate funny fanart mashups for your own personal enjoyment could be construed as a &#x27;production use&#x27;. Stability could actually sue you for that (however unlikely that would be).[0] In the eyes of the law.

Sure, throw enough compute and data at a problem, do a little parallelization, and you can extract plenty of patterns. Does that mean the ml engineers understand art? Or are they just using glorified brute force to alienate people who actually make things from their labor? No, I have very little respect for the AI people. Once you get over the novelty, their creations inspire little else beside disgust.

If AI images were devoid of meaning or value, they wouldn&#x27;t have sparked such passion.You cannot claim ownership over culture, nor can AI. Culture is a collaborative process, and no one can barricade themselves from the input of others. Artists using AI are simply exercising their right to contribute to the collective creative pool.

    "title": "Keras 3.0: Run Keras workflows on multiple frameworks with enhanced performance optimization and compatibility",
    "originLink": "https://keras.io/keras_3/",
    "originBody": "Introducing Keras 3.0 Get started API docs Guides GitHub After five months of extensive public beta testing, we're excited to announce the official release of Keras 3.0. Keras 3 is a full rewrite of Keras that enables you to run your Keras workflows on top of either JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, and that unlocks brand new large-scale model training and deployment capabilities. You can pick the framework that suits you best, and switch from one to another based on your current goals. You can also use Keras as a low-level cross-framework language to develop custom components such as layers, models, or metrics that can be used in native workflows in JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch — with one codebase. Welcome to multi-framework machine learning. You're already familiar with the benefits of using Keras — it enables high-velocity development via an obsessive focus on great UX, API design, and debuggability. It's also a battle-tested framework that has been chosen by over 2.5M developers and that powers some of the most sophisticated, largest-scale ML systems in the world, such as the Waymo self-driving fleet and the YouTube recommendation engine. But what are the additional benefits of using the new multi-backend Keras 3? Always get the best performance for your models. In our benchmarks, we found that JAX typically delivers the best training and inference performance on GPU, TPU, and CPU — but results vary from model to model, as non-XLA TensorFlow is occasionally faster on GPU. The ability to dynamically select the backend that will deliver the best performance for your model without having to change anything to your code means you're guaranteed to train and serve with the highest achievable efficiency. Unlock ecosystem optionality for your models. Any Keras 3 model can be instantiated as a PyTorch Module, can be exported as a TensorFlow SavedModel, or can be instantiated as a stateless JAX function. That means that you can use your Keras 3 models with PyTorch ecosystem packages, with the full range of TensorFlow deployment & production tools (like TF-Serving, TF.js and TFLite), and with JAX large-scale TPU training infrastructure. Write one model.py using Keras 3 APIs, and get access to everything the ML world has to offer. Leverage large-scale model parallelism & data parallelism with JAX. Keras 3 includes a brand new distribution API, the keras.distribution namespace, currently implemented for the JAX backend (coming soon to the TensorFlow and PyTorch backends). It makes it easy to do model parallelism, data parallelism, and combinations of both — at arbitrary model scales and cluster scales. Because it keeps the model definition, training logic, and sharding configuration all separate from each other, it makes your distribution workflow easy to develop and easy to maintain. See our starter guide. Maximize reach for your open-source model releases. Want to release a pretrained model? Want as many people as possible to be able to use it? If you implement it in pure TensorFlow or PyTorch, it will be usable by roughly half of the community. If you implement it in Keras 3, it is instantly usable by anyone regardless of their framework of choice (even if they're not Keras users themselves). Twice the impact at no added development cost. Use data pipelines from any source. The Keras 3 fit()/evaluate()/predict() routines are compatible with tf.data.Dataset objects, with PyTorch DataLoader objects, with NumPy arrays, Pandas dataframes — regardless of the backend you're using. You can train a Keras 3 + TensorFlow model on a PyTorch DataLoader or train a Keras 3 + PyTorch model on a tf.data.Dataset. The full Keras API, available for JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Keras 3 implements the full Keras API and makes it available with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch — over a hundred layers, dozens of metrics, loss functions, optimizers, and callbacks, the Keras training and evaluation loops, and the Keras saving & serialization infrastructure. All the APIs you know and love are here. Any Keras model that only uses built-in layers will immediately work with all supported backends. In fact, your existing tf.keras models that only use built-in layers can start running in JAX and PyTorch right away! That's right, your codebase just gained a whole new set of capabilities. Author multi-framework layers, models, metrics... Keras 3 enables you to create components (like arbitrary custom layers or pretrained models) that will work the same in any framework. In particular, Keras 3 gives you access to the keras.ops namespace that works across all backends. It contains: A full implementation of the NumPy API. Not something \"NumPy-like\" — just literally the NumPy API, with the same functions and the same arguments. You get ops.matmul, ops.sum, ops.stack, ops.einsum, etc. A set of neural network-specific functions that are absent from NumPy, such as ops.softmax, ops.binary_crossentropy, ops.conv, etc. As long as you only use ops from keras.ops, your custom layers, custom losses, custom metrics, and custom optimizers will work with JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow — with the same code. That means that you can maintain only one component implementation (e.g. a single model.py together with a single checkpoint file), and you can use it in all frameworks, with the exact same numerics. ...that works seamlessly with any JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch workflow. Keras 3 is not just intended for Keras-centric workflows where you define a Keras model, a Keras optimizer, a Keras loss and metrics, and you call fit(), evaluate(), and predict(). It's also meant to work seamlessly with low-level backend-native workflows: you can take a Keras model (or any other component, such as a loss or metric) and start using it in a JAX training loop, a TensorFlow training loop, or a PyTorch training loop, or as part of a JAX or PyTorch model, with zero friction. Keras 3 provides exactly the same degree of low-level implementation flexibility in JAX and PyTorch as tf.keras previously did in TensorFlow. You can: Write a low-level JAX training loop to train a Keras model using an optax optimizer, jax.grad, jax.jit, jax.pmap. Write a low-level TensorFlow training loop to train a Keras model using tf.GradientTape and tf.distribute. Write a low-level PyTorch training loop to train a Keras model using a torch.optim optimizer, a torch loss function, and the torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel wrapper. Use Keras layers in a PyTorch Module (because they are Module instances too!) Use any PyTorch Module in a Keras model as if it were a Keras layer. etc. A new distribution API for large-scale data parallelism and model parallelism. The models we've been working with have been getting larger and larger, so we wanted to provide a Kerasic solution to the multi-device model sharding problem. The API we designed keeps the model definition, the training logic, and the sharding configuration entirely separate from each other, meaning that your models can be written as if they were going to run on a single device. You can then add arbitrary sharding configurations to arbitrary models when it's time to train them. Data parallelism (replicating a small model identically on multiple devices) can be handled in just two lines: Model parallelism lets you specify sharding layouts for model variables and intermediate output tensors, along multiple named dimensions. In the typical case, you would organize available devices as a 2D grid (called a device mesh), where the first dimension is used for data parallelism and the second dimension is used for model parallelism. You would then configure your model to be sharded along the model dimension and replicated along the data dimension. The API lets you configure the layout of every variable and every output tensor via regular expressions. This makes it easy to quickly specify the same layout for entire categories of variables. The new distribution API is intended to be multi-backend, but is only available for the JAX backend for the time being. TensorFlow and PyTorch support is coming soon. Get started with this guide! Pretrained models. There's a wide range of pretrained models that you can start using today with Keras 3. All 40 Keras Applications models (the keras.applications namespace) are available in all backends. The vast array of pretrained models in KerasCV and KerasNLP also work with all backends. This includes: BERT OPT Whisper T5 StableDiffusion YOLOv8 SegmentAnything etc. Support for cross-framework data pipelines with all backends. Multi-framework ML also means multi-framework data loading and preprocessing. Keras 3 models can be trained using a wide range of data pipelines — regardless of whether you're using the JAX, PyTorch, or TensorFlow backends. It just works. tf.data.Dataset pipelines: the reference for scalable production ML. torch.utils.data.DataLoader objects. NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes. Keras's own keras.utils.PyDataset objects. Progressive disclosure of complexity. Progressive disclosure of complexity is the design principle at the heart of the Keras API. Keras doesn't force you to follow a single \"true\" way of building and training models. Instead, it enables a wide range of different workflows, from the very high-level to the very low-level, corresponding to different user profiles. That means that you can start out with simple workflows — such as using Sequential and Functional models and training them with fit() — and when you need more flexibility, you can easily customize different components while reusing most of your prior code. As your needs become more specific, you don't suddenly fall off a complexity cliff and you don't need to switch to a different set of tools. We've brought this principle to all of our backends. For instance, you can customize what happens in your training loop while still leveraging the power of fit(), without having to write your own training loop from scratch — just by overriding the train_step method. Here's how it works in PyTorch and TensorFlow: And here's the link to the JAX version. A new stateless API for layers, models, metrics, and optimizers. Do you enjoy functional programming? You're in for a treat. All stateful objects in Keras (i.e. objects that own numerical variables that get updated during training or evaluation) now have a stateless API, making it possible to use them in JAX functions (which are required to be fully stateless): All layers and models have a stateless_call() method which mirrors __call__(). All optimizers have a stateless_apply() method which mirrors apply(). All metrics have a stateless_update_state() method which mirrors update_state() and a stateless_result() method which mirrors result(). These methods have no side-effects whatsoever: they take as input the current value of the state variables of the target object, and return the update values as part of their outputs, e.g.: outputs, updated_non_trainable_variables = layer.stateless_call( trainable_variables, non_trainable_variables, inputs, ) You never have to implement these methods yourself — they're automatically available as long as you've implemented the stateful version (e.g. call() or update_state()). Moving from Keras 2 to Keras 3 Keras 3 is highly backwards compatible with Keras 2: it implements the full public API surface of Keras 2, with a limited number of exceptions, listed here. Most users will not have to make any code change to start running their Keras scripts on Keras 3. Larger codebases are likely to require some code changes, since they are more likely to run into one of the exceptions listed above, and are more likely to have been using private APIs or deprecated APIs (tf.compat.v1.keras namespace, experimental namespace, keras.src private namespace). To help you move to Keras 3, we are releasing a complete migration guide with quick fixes for all issues you might encounter. You also have the option to ignore the changes in Keras 3 and just keep using Keras 2 with TensorFlow — this can be a good option for projects that are not actively developed but need to keep running with updated dependencies. You have two possibilities: If you were accessing keras as a standalone package, just switch to using the Python package tf_keras instead, which you can install via pip install tf_keras. The code and API are wholly unchanged — it's Keras 2.15 with a different package name. We will keep fixing bugs in tf_keras and we will keep regularly releasing new versions. However, no new features or performance improvements will be added, since the package is now in maintenance mode. If you were accessing keras via tf.keras, there are no immediate changes until TensorFlow 2.16. TensorFlow 2.16+ will use Keras 3 by default. In TensorFlow 2.16+, to keep using Keras 2, you can first install tf_keras, and then export the environment variable TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1. This will direct TensorFlow 2.16+ to resolve tf.keras to the locally-installed tf_keras package. Note that this may affect more than your own code, however: it will affect any package importing tf.keras in your Python process. To make sure your changes only affect your own code, you should use the tf_keras package. Enjoy the library! We're excited for you to try out the new Keras and improve your workflows by leveraging multi-framework ML. Let us know how it goes: issues, points of friction, feature requests, or success stories — we're eager to hear from you! FAQ Q: Is Keras 3 compatible with legacy Keras 2? Code developed with tf.keras can generally be run as-is with Keras 3 (with the TensorFlow backend). There's a limited number of incompatibilities you should be mindful of, all addressed in this migration guide. When it comes to using APIs from tf.keras and Keras 3 side by side, that is not possible — they're different packages, running on entirely separate engines. Q: Do pretrained models developed in legacy Keras 2 work with Keras 3? Generally, yes. Any tf.keras model should work out of the box with Keras 3 with the TensorFlow backend (make sure to save it in the .keras v3 format). In addition, if the model only uses built-in Keras layers, then it will also work out of the box with Keras 3 with the JAX and PyTorch backends. If the model contains custom layers written using TensorFlow APIs, it is usually easy to convert the code to be backend-agnostic. For instance, it only took us a few hours to convert all 40 legacy tf.keras models from Keras Applications to be backend-agnostic. Q: Can I save a Keras 3 model in one backend and reload it in another backend? Yes, you can. There is no backend specialization in saved .keras files whatsoever. Your saved Keras models are framework-agnostic and can be reloaded with any backend. However, note that reloading a model that contains custom components with a different backend requires your custom components to be implemented using backend-agnostic APIs, e.g. keras.ops. Q: Can I use Keras 3 components inside tf.data pipelines? With the TensorFlow backend, Keras 3 is fully compatible with tf.data (e.g. you can .map() a Sequential model into a tf.data pipeline). With a different backend, Keras 3 has limited support for tf.data. You won't be able to .map() arbitrary layers or models into a tf.data pipeline. However, you will be able to use specific Keras 3 preprocessing layers with tf.data, such as IntegerLookup or CategoryEncoding. When it comes to using a tf.data pipeline (that does not use Keras) to feed your call to .fit(), .evaluate() or .predict() — that works out of the box with all backends. Q: Do Keras 3 models behave the same when run with different backends? Yes, numerics are identical across backends. However, keep in mind the following caveats: RNG behavior is different across different backends (even after seeding — your results will be deterministic in each backend but will differ across backends). So random weight initializations values and dropout values will differ across backends. Due to the nature of floating-point implementations, results are only identical up to 1e-7 precision in float32, per function execution. So when training a model for a long time, small numerical differences will accumulate and may end up resulting in noticeable numerical differences. Due to lack of support for average pooling with asymmetric padding in PyTorch, average pooling layers with padding=\"same\" may result in different numerics on border rows/columns. This doesn't happen very often in practice — out of 40 Keras Applications vision models, only one was affected. Q: Does Keras 3 support distributed training? Data-parallel distribution is supported out of the box in JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Model parallel distribution is supported out of the box for JAX with the keras.distribution API. With TensorFlow: Keras 3 is compatible with tf.distribute — just open a Distribution Strategy scope and create / train your model within it. Here's an example. With PyTorch: Keras 3 is compatible with PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel utility. Here's an example. With JAX: You can do both data parallel and model parallel distribution in JAX using the keras.distribution API. For instance, to do data parallel distribution, you only need the following code snippet: distribution = keras.distribution.DataParallel(devices=keras.distribution.list_devices()) keras.distribution.set_distribution(distribution) For model parallel distribution, see the following guide. You can also distribute training yourself via JAX APIs such as jax.sharding. Here's an example. Q: Can my custom Keras layers be used in native PyTorch Modules or with Flax Modules? If they are only written using Keras APIs (e.g. the keras.ops namespace), then yes, your Keras layers will work out of the box with native PyTorch and JAX code. In PyTorch, just use your Keras layer like any other PyTorch Module. In JAX, make sure to use the stateless layer API, i.e. layer.stateless_call(). Q: Will you add more backends in the future? What about framework XYZ? We're open to adding new backends as long as the target framework has a large user base or otherwise has some unique technical benefits to bring to the table. However, adding and maintaining a new backend is a large burden, so we're going to carefully consider each new backend candidate on a case by case basis, and we're not likely to add many new backends. We will not add any new frameworks that aren't yet well-established. We are now potentially considering adding a backend written in Mojo. If that's something you might find useful, please let the Mojo team know.",

Hope you&#x27;ll find the new Keras useful!So far the export story focuses on SavedModel and the services that consume that format, e.g. TFLite, TFjs and TFServing. You can just do `model.export(path)`, and you also have access to the `ExportArchive` class for fine-grained configuration.We have not tried CoreML export yet.PyTorch `.compile()` works with Keras models.

I&#x27;ve generally chosen Pytorch over Tensorflow for my day to day, but now that Keras is framework agnostic I&#x27;m excited to revisit it.One thing I&#x27;m wondering about is if it&#x27;s possible (or necessary?) to use Keras in concert with Pytorch Lightning. In some ways, Lightning evolved to be \"Keras for Pytorch,\" so what is the path forward in a world where both exist as options for Pytorch users—do they interoperate or are they competitors&#x2F;alternatives to each other? reply kerasteam 16 hours agorootparentBoth Keras models&#x2F;layers (with the PyTorch backend) and Lightning Modules are PyTorch Modules, so they should be able to interoperate with each other in a PyTorch workflow. We have not tried this with Lightning, but we&#x27;ve had a good experience with custom PyTorch Modules.More broadly, it&#x27;s feasible to use Keras components with any framework built on PyTorch or JAX in the sense that it&#x27;s always possible to write \"adapter layers\" that wrap a Keras layer and make it usable by another framework, or the other way around. We have folks doing this to use Flax components (from JAX) as Keras layers, and inversely, to use Keras layers as Flax Modules. reply revskill 13 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re my favorite Python developer.

That said, Keras is a tough sell. I think the ML framework market, particularly for gen AI is moving either away from abstraction to lower level frameworks (ggml or custom, etc) or consolidating around HF. It would be cool to see Keras emerge as a meaningful HF transformers competitor, but I&#x27;m not sure what it would take to get there. As it is, I don&#x27;t see a big incentive to use it, or for people getting started to learn it (especially to the exclusion of the underlying frameworks) which is too bad. reply imachine1980_ 16 hours agoparentI disagree because the majority of data science roles focus on optimizing production processes or customer acquisition&#x2F;retention. In practical terms, while we often reference tools like OpenAI, the real-world application revolves around machine learning-based data analytics and unstructured business intelligence. Keras emerges as a valuable tool for businesses due to its combination of machine learning capabilities beaing easy,allow data experimentation, for the business knowledge. In this context, the emphasis on machine learning isn&#x27;t as pronounced as it is in companies dedicated solely to ML, such as OpenAI or Google ML reply pantulis 16 hours agoparentprev> consolidating around HFWhat is HF?

For instance, if you&#x27;re looking for a basic solution, you can just set up a Flask app that calls `predict()` on a Keras model.If you&#x27;re looking for a high-performance solution that is entirely Python-free, then you can simply export your Keras model as a TF SavedModel and serve it via TFServing.

If you wanted to craft a model to your particular needs, you will have a much better time with Torch, even 5 years ago when online tutorials were filled with TF&#x2F;Keras.I think Keras more or less died when the TF 2.0 transition was botched so badly.

The experience was pretty good, there was nothing that annoyed me too much.However, as the comments here show, the mindshare and community momentum seems to have shifted totally to Torch.Especially considering that it&#x27;s transformers everywhere, right now, and there&#x27;s just so much premade stuff built on top of pytorch, I&#x27;d probably stick with that. At least out of pragmatism such as the ease of hiring people with torch experience.The transparent Numpy experience seems nice, keras was the first thing I ever built real NNs with, all said it&#x27;s never been bad to me but... to conclude, no. reply kerasteam 16 hours agoparentprevAccording to PyPI downloads and user surveys (like the yearly StackOverflow survey) the two main frameworks are TensorFlow and PyTorch for Deep Learning, and Scikit-Learn for classical ML.See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;survey.stackoverflow.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;#technology* TensorFlow: 9.53% usage among all devs* Scikit Learn: 9.43%* PyTorch: 8.75% reply tastyminerals2 3 hours agorootparentEvery time some survey pops up, TF somehow looks still relevant while I know noone who uses it or even considers using it unless they are new to DL field.

The tech giant recently sent a proposal to Goldman to exit from the contract in the next roughly 12 to 15 months, according to people briefed on the matter. The exit would cover their entire consumer partnership, including the credit card the companies launched in 2019 and the savings account rolled out this year.

My bank indeed issues a real MasterCard but the monthly fees are unreasonable added on top of my already expensive checking account fees and it has very crappy app where trying to temporarily (un-)block my card needs calling their support and waiting in line while amex app gives me these features immediately on app.Amex however gives me real credit(though they book the whole amount on start of next month) and also payback points in exchange for minuscle monthly fees but they have free same card with less sexy design which doesn&#x27;t signal my ego correctly. reply ulfw 2 hours agorootparentWhat you describe for your particular Amex card isn&#x27;t a real credit card either.

Germany never had a culture of cheques and switched from money to money transfers early on (before WW1), so most stuff in Germany either I pay by money transfer (\"Ueberweisung\") or a company takes the money from my account (\"Bankeinzug\") - like mortages, cars, rent, electricity, travelling etc. In the US credit cards partially replaced cheques (and added credit, duh!), which was never something in Germany. The only use of cheques in Germany were traveller cheques when travelling - and then only to get money at the hotel.Even for the catalog business people payed by invoice and money transfer (and the catalog companies gave you credit).What is left, like groceries, is often paid in cash. victorbjorklund 2 hours agorootparentprevOne thing that never made sense to me is that im sure 99% of all the rich people who have amex also got at least another card.

Unless Apple discontinues the card completely, they will choose a new bank, that bank will take on the existing portfolio, everyone will get new cards (maybe numbers depending on how they did the BINs)...but with the physical card not having a visible number, the apple pay card being able to be automatically updated, and the virtual card&#x27;s number being right there in the app it should be pretty painless.Since Apple manages the whole thing through their own app and not a Goldman Sachs app, it should be fairly seamless as everything should look the same and you won&#x27;t need to make a new login or worry about how to start paying a new bank. If there&#x27;s new cards to be issued it&#x27;s likely it will just show up in the Wallet app and they&#x27;ll mail you a new physical one. Last year Apple moved the Apple Cash card from Discover to Visa and most people didn&#x27;t even know that happened. There was even a button to switch it over sooner if you wanted to.With the Savings Account I expect it will be similar as long as they can find a bank willing to offer a similar APY. Especially for people who just use it with the Apple Card and don&#x27;t deposit directly to it using the routing&#x2F;account number, you probably won&#x27;t really notice.source: all speculation, but I have worked extensively in payments for years and have launched banking products. reply toomuchtodo 10 hours agorootparentGreat benefits for Apple Card users to have Apple abstract all the drudgery away.

I suppose he can just get an Apple card then.The beauty if going with AMEX, if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do, it that it&#x27;s a one stop shop. No need to go through a bank to issue a credit card, just deal with the credit card company directly. Currently the card is pretty much useless, but it does fit Apples way of doing things, cutting out the middle man.For American Express it could also help make them relevant as a card company again. If they have plans to expand beyond the US, this might be a good way to do it. Companies will want to be able to accept Apples card, even if that means signing up with AMEX. Then in a few years, AMEX can start pushing their own branded cards which will now be more widely accepted. reply giobox 10 hours agorootparentprevThe fact the Apple card was a Mastercard and had no foreign transaction fees was largely the only reason I opened it, as I too find my Amex a pain in the ass in Europe.

Nothing. (Why do people keep falling for this?)What you really want to see is a combined promise. For example: No fees, plus 1% or less FX spread on major currencies.

Still, this is pretty cheap, given the convenience. reply e63f67dd-065b 4 hours agorootparentThe FX spread is fixed at around 25-50bps for Mastercard&#x2F;Visa due to a settlement long ago. The foreign transaction fee is an additional charge on top of that, usually 3% of the gross transaction volume in USD.The banks don&#x27;t control the exchange rate, it&#x27;s determined by the card network. So yes, when a card advertises 0% foreign transaction fee, it really does mean that they don&#x27;t take an additional charge on top of the spread (which they don&#x27;t control or profit from).It&#x27;s in fact quite easy to pay less than 100bps for a foreign currency transaction; everybody with a 0% FTF card is doing it right now (especially for high volume corridors like EUR&#x2F;USD).> No fees, plus 1% or less FX spread on major currencies. (My preferred credit card promises that.)You bank can&#x27;t promise what they don&#x27;t control; Visa and Mastercard determines FX rates, and they&#x27;re below 100bps because of an old settlement.

This caused a lot of problems:* The ease of sign up &#x2F; approval led to a lot of subprime approvals that might not have gone through with a more established lender. Not only did this cause GS to lose money on delinquent accounts, it prevented the Apple Card from ever becoming a status symbol.* Goldman Sachs developed a reputation for almost never backing up cardholders in the case of dicey&#x2F;fraudulent charges.The sense of security is a huge part of why people use a credit card for purchases. I myself terminated my Apple Card account over this.* The card itself was just not competitive in terms of rewards. The UI&#x2F;UX of the app and the deeper integration into the Apple ecosystem was nice... (if a bit confusing) but when I moved over to Chase I found myself not really missing it at all.* Edit: Forgot one additional thing. Apple Card did not have contactless (tap) technology because they wanted to promote using Apple Pay. But whipping out your phone sucks compared to just tapping your card against a reader.All I wanted was a simple, easy credit card. I didn&#x27;t care about minmaxing bonuses etc... but when I moved over to Chase I realized I had been leaving a lot of money on the table.All the other players but especially Chase and AMEX have very established reward systems setup.It&#x27;s possible that Apple wants to move banks specifically because they want to reposition the card and need a different partner to do it with. reply buildbot 9 hours agorootparent+1 to the whole fraud issue - I had a fraudulent transaction from the apple store, my card but not my account, and they at first refused to believe that the virtual card number could be stolen, which it can as it’s just a credit card number once it’s in a website’s database ripe for stealing. Then they tried to get me to talk to apple to refund it - saying I should give them the order number&#x2F;details that kind of thing. Which I didn’t have of course! Apple was like, chargeback when I talked to them. Goldman sachs had to be prodded like 4 times before they even started the process. In the end luckily the pending charged never went through so the dispute was closed “in my favor” somewhat. reply jkubicek 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had the Apple card since it was launched and have had one or two fraudulent charges, they were trivially easy to resolve, everything occurred via iMessage for Business.I don&#x27;t mean to diminish your negative experience, but it&#x27;s not universal.> The card itself was just not competitive in terms of rewards.

    "originBody": "MUM'S THE WORD — Hackers spent 2+ years looting secrets of chipmaker NXP before being detected Chipmaker claims breach had no \"material adverse effect.\" Dan Goodin - 11/28/2023, 12:56 PM Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 40 with A prolific espionage hacking group with ties to China spent over two years looting the corporate network of NXP, the Netherlands-based chipmaker whose silicon powers security-sensitive components found in smartphones, smartcards, and electric vehicles, a news outlet has reported. The intrusion, by a group tracked under names including \"Chimera\" and \"G0114,\" lasted from late 2017 to the beginning of 2020, according to Netherlands national news outlet NRC Handelsblad, which cited “several sources” familiar with the incident. During that time, the threat actors periodically accessed employee mailboxes and network drives in search of chip designs and other NXP intellectual property. The breach wasn’t uncovered until Chimera intruders were detected in a separate company network that connected to compromised NXP systems on several occasions. Details of the breach remained a closely guarded secret until now. No material damage NRC cited a report published (and later deleted) by security firm Fox-IT, titled Abusing Cloud Services to Fly Under the Radar. It documented Chimera using cloud services from companies including Microsoft and Dropbox to receive data stolen from the networks of semiconductor makers, including one in Europe that was hit in “early Q4 2017.” Some of the intrusions lasted as long as three years before coming to light. NRC said the unidentified victim was NXP. “Once nested on a first computer—patient zero—the spies gradually expand their access rights, erase their tracks in between and secretly sneak to the protected parts of the network,” NRC reporters wrote in an English translation. “They try to secrete the sensitive data they find there in encrypted archive files via cloud storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive. According to the log files that Fox-IT finds, the hackers come every few weeks to see whether interesting new data can be found at NXP and whether more user accounts and parts of the network can be hacked.” Advertisement NXP did not alert customers or shareholders to the intrusion, other than a brief reference in a 2019 annual report. It read: We have, from time to time, experienced cyber-attacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology, the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees, customers, or suppliers, or interrupt our business. For instance, in January 2020, we became aware of a compromise of certain of our systems. We are taking steps to identify the malicious activity and are implementing remedial measures to increase the security of our systems and networks to respond to evolving threats and new information. As of the date of this filing, we do not believe that this IT system compromise has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us. However, the investigation is ongoing, and we are continuing to evaluate the amount and type of data compromised. There can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future. “A big deal” NXP is Europe’s second-biggest semiconductor company behind ASML and the world’s 18th biggest chipmaker by market capitalization. Its chips are used in iPhones and Apple watches to support advanced near-field communications security mechanisms such as tag originality, tamper detection, and authentication for Apple Pay. NXP also provides chips for the MIFARE card used by transit companies, FIDO-compliant security keys, and tools for relaying data inside the networks of electric vehicles. Some security researchers said it was surprising that NXP officials didn’t inform customers of the two-year intrusion by threat actors, often abbreviated as TAs. “NXP chips are in a lot of products,” Jake Williams, a former hacker for the National Security Agency, wrote on Mastodon. “It's likely the TA knows of specific flaws reported to NXP that can be leveraged to exploit devices the chips are embedded in, and that's assuming they didn't implement backdoors themselves. Over 2.5 years (at least), that's not unrealistic.” Advertisement A separate researcher who has published research in the past documenting a successful hack on a widely used product containing NXP chips voiced similar surprise. “If a Chinese threat actor group gets source code or hardware designs of a chip manufacturer, these kinds of groups can use the source code even if the source code isn’t very well commented and documented,” the researcher, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview. “For me, [the intrusion] is a big deal. I was surprised NXP didn’t communicate with its customers.” In an email, an NXP representative said the NRC report “is very dated as it was addressed back in 2019. As stated in our 2019 Annual Report, we became aware of a compromise of certain IT systems, and after a thorough investigation we determined that this incident did not result in a material adverse effect on our business. At NXP, we take the security of data very seriously. We learned from this experience and prioritize continually strengthening our IT systems to protect against ever-evolving cybersecurity threats.” Chimera has extensive experience stealing data from a wide range of companies. The threat actor uses a variety of means to compromise its victims. In the campaign that hit NXP, hackers often leveraged account information revealed in previous data breaches of sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook. The data allowed Chimera to guess the passwords that employees used to access VPN accounts. Team members were able to bypass multi-factor authentication by changing telephone numbers associated with the accounts. Security firm Cycraft documented one two-year hacking spree that targeted semiconductor makers with operations in Taiwan, where NXP happens to have research and development facilities. An attack on one of the unnamed victims compromised 10 endpoints and another compromised 24 endpoints. “The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing intelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, source code, etc.,” Cycraft researchers wrote. “If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating.” reader comments 40 with Dan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking, encryption, and passwords.
