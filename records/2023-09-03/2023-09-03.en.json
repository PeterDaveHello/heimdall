I want to tell you about the worst programmer I know, and why I fought to keep him in the team. A few years ago I wrote a Twitter/X thread about the best programmer I know, which I should write up as a blog post. It seems only fair to tell you about the worst one too. His name is Tim Mackinnon and I want the world to know how measurably unproductive he is. We were working for a well-known software consultancy at a Big Bank that decided to introduce individual performance metrics, “for appraisal and personal development purposes”. This was cascaded through the organisation, and landed in our team in terms of story points delivered. This was after some considered discussion from the department manager, who knew you shouldn’t measure things like lines of code or bugs found, because people can easily game these. Source: http://dilbert.com/strip/1995-11-13 Instead we would measure stories delivered, or it may have been story points (it turns out it doesn’t matter), because these represented business value. We were using something like Jira, and people would put their name against stories, which made it super easy to generate these productivity metrics. Which brings me to Tim. Tim’s score was consistently zero. Zero! Not just low, or trending downwards, but literally zero. Week after week, iteration after iteration. Zero points for Tim. Well Tim clearly had to go. This was the manager’s conclusion, and he asked me to make the necessary arrangements to have Tim removed and replaced by someone who actually delivered, you know, stories. And I flatly refused. It wasn’t even a hard decision for me, I just said no. You see, the reason that Tim’s productivity score was zero, was that he never signed up for any stories. Instead he would spend his day pairing with different teammates. With less experienced developers he would patiently let them drive whilst nudging them towards a solution. He would not crowd them or railroad them, but let them take the time to learn whilst carefully crafting moments of insight and learning, often as Socratic questions, what ifs, how elses. With seniors it was more like co-creating or sparring; bringing different worldviews to bear on a problem, to produce something better than either of us would have thought of on our own. Tim is a heck of a programmer, and you always learn something pairing with him. Tim wasn’t delivering software; Tim was delivering a team that was delivering software. The entire team became more effective, more productive, more aligned, more idiomatic, more fun, because Tim was in the team. I explained all this to the manager and invited him to come by and observe us working from time to time. Whenever he popped by, he would see Tim sitting with someone different, working on “their” thing, and you could be sure that the quality of that thing would be significantly better, and the time to value significantly lower—yes, you can have better and faster and cheaper, it just takes discipline—than when Tim wasn’t pairing with people. In the end we kept Tim, and we quietly dropped the individual productivity metrics in favour of team accountability, where we tracked—and celebrated—the business impact we were delivering to the organisation as a high-performing unit. tl;dr ¶ Measure productivity by all means—I’m all for accountability—ideally as tangible business impact expressed in dollars saved, generated, or protected. This is usually hard, so proxy business metrics are fine too. Just don’t try to measure the individual contribution of a unit in a complex adaptive system, because the premise of the question is flawed. DORA metrics, for example, are about how the system of work works, whether as Westrum culture indicators or flow of technical change into production. They measure the engine, not the contribution of individual pistons, because that makes no sense. Also, if you ever get the chance to work with Tim Mackinnon, you should do that.

The team had mostly Mac experience and they were just getting their feet wet with Windows. So naturally the Windows version had some problems.At the time, I was known as a \"Windows expert\", so they hired me to help improve that version and help the team get more familiar with Windows programming.I would often spend the first part of the day on what I called \"house calls\": visiting other developers&#x27; offices to either pair program or troubleshoot bugs or just talk about Windows API best practices and the like. (Yes, we all had private offices!)After a while, one of my colleagues asked a question that stuck in my mind: \"How can you afford to be so generous with your time?\"Sure enough, a few months later I got a review with a mediocre rating and a comment: \"Your productivity hasn&#x27;t been quite we hoped, especially considering that the rest of the team has gotten more productive lately.\"Which was exactly what I thought they had hired me for! reply progmetaldev 8 hours agoparentI know it&#x27;s too late now, but you are the type of developer that makes our profession an actual craft. Sharing knowledge is the biggest benefit to provide other developers, and too few that decide to go that route are rewarded for it. If it weren&#x27;t for developers like you, we wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere close to where we currently are in the software world. I try to give back knowledge as much as possible, because it&#x27;s not just about the one business you work for, it&#x27;s also about building up somebody. Know that you&#x27;re appreciated, even if you aren&#x27;t getting direct thanks for it! reply Stratoscope 5 hours agorootparentWow, thank you. I am grateful that my comment attracted so much thoughtful discussion. But your comment is the one that really touched my heart.I was reading it to a close friend just now, and I have to confess that I choked up a couple of times reading it.So again, thank you, my friend.p.s. You don&#x27;t happen to be anywhere near the SF Bay Area? If you are (or even if you&#x27;re not), please drop me a note at the email address in my HN profile.Anyone else who is in the mid-Peninsula area, feel free to do the same. It would be nice to meet up with people who have an interest in this topic. reply SlightlyLeftPad 1 hour agorootparentI also want to echo this. For me, it’s examples like yours that I live by. It seems like the right thing to do, naturally. Teaching people and sharing knowledge is the often the most rewarding part of my career at a personal level but it is hard to reconcile when it often comes at the cost of my own progression&#x2F;productivity. I’m spending most of my time helping everyone else be more productive. How’d you end up working through that? reply ssss11 8 hours agoparentprevI did an internship during uni as an electronics technician repairing handheld, vehicle mount rugged terminals, and base stations (rf network controllers before 802.11 arrived).Each repair job had the same priority but some were much simpler than others - one month I thought I’d take the base station jobs to learn and because no one else was repairing them. They took longer to fix but obviously were more crucial to operations.At the end of the month PHB held a team meeting where pie charts of utilisation were shown and I had performed terribly against the rest of the (senior and experienced) team. That was the moment I learned that the senior staff were picking off quick and easy jobs for a reason, and that office politics was a thing.PHB couldn’t understand my reasoning of selecting those jobs and the outcome was his dislike of my performance… glad I learned about poor bosses that early in my career. reply quickthrower2 8 hours agorootparentSo without someone like you they would literally not repair some units? I guess they chuck and replace them? reply progmetaldev 8 hours agorootparentI have been in this position where my boss (the owner!) actually was willing to throw equipment away, but thought he could charge the client both for the new equipment, and for reinstalling. Unfortunately in the small business world, I fear this happens WAY more than even I could imagine, having dealt with it. reply whirlwin 10 hours agoparentprevWhat an odd practice. Not sure who conducted the review, but managers especially should be familiar with the concept of coaching, and recognize that you were doing a great deal of it. I am a technical manager myself and spend a lot of time on coaching team members too. reply gcheong 10 hours agorootparent20 years ago when I started there wasn’t anything I experienced that could be called coaching, mentoring, or leveling up. Sure, I could get some time from a more experienced developer to get another set of eyes on a particularly hard problem if I wasn’t able to come up with a solution but for the most part I was just expected to work with minimal explanation or direction. Very little in the way of code reviews as well. I certainly hope this has changed and to whatever extent I’ve been able to I’ve always tried to make myself available to others because sink or swim really sucks. reply vinay_ys 5 hours agorootparentAround that same time, my first job was at GE medical systems. The team I was part of was responsible for developing systems for digital X-ray machines. We were developing a new mobile x-ray product and it needed some new capabilities. As a fresher out of college I worked on some of the most critical systems capabilities and features and I got brilliant support from my seniors in software engineering and domain experts (radiology + image processing researchers). They literally taught me 3 different things (coding to professional standards, image processing, systems engineering) at the same time and we were super productive as a team. That set the bar for my expectations on how a team should function for a long time.Luckily 2 years later I went a startup and similar great experience of team work and supporting each other continued. I worked at 2 more startups which grew a lot and were super successful and the culture continued.Only in recent times, (post 2019) I have noticed that people are obsessed with performance rating systems and gaming them. I notice junior engineers are not as curious to learn or challenge-seeking as engineers a decade. And I notice recently promoted senior engineers are not as talented either. I used to think this had to correlate with dominant programming language – c&#x2F;c++&#x2F;go vs ruby&#x2F;java etc. but I don&#x27;t know if that fully explains it. reply progmetaldev 8 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t changed much in small business. I try to do the same with my time, but often junior developers want to tackle the newest things, rather than the old that needs maintenance. The ones that listen to you often jump ship for bigger and better things, and I don&#x27;t take credit for it, but I like to think I helped them along at least a little in their pursuit of more knowledge. reply fabianholzer 12 hours agoparentprevWhat happened after the mediocre performance review? Did leave for greener pastures asap? Did you start to optimize for their performance metrics, and stop being generous with your time? Or could you manage to convince somebody high enough above you in the org-chart that they actually hired you for what you thought they did? reply lll-o-lll 6 hours agoparentprevIt’s important to find&#x2F;figure out what a company values and optimise for that. Once a reputation has been established, it’s then possible to go about changing things, but not before.I’ve seen too many stories of people optimising for the “team”, but losing their job or being looked over for promotion due to negative perception from those higher up.The opposite is also true, sometimes unfortunately. Once a good reputation has been established (whatever is currently valued in the company), any amount of misbehaviour will be tolerated for a long time.It shouldn’t be this way, but that’s been my experience. reply Stratoscope 4 hours agoparentprevJust a quick note to thank everyone for your thoughtful and insightful comments here.As it is a holiday weekend, I may not be able to get back to every reply right away.I am grateful that zdw&#x27;s submission and my comment led to such an interesting discussion! Thank you all. reply gajomi 4 hours agoparentprevPSA... check out this guy&#x27;s LinkedIn profile. It&#x27;s a great read. reply Stratoscope 3 hours agorootparentThank you! You gave me an excuse to look at my own LinkedIn profile, which I&#x27;ve ignored for a few years.I have a distinct memory from not that long ago when I was unemployed and asking people for advice on what to put on LinkedIn and on my resume.One consistent piece of advice was \"Don&#x27;t list anything more than five years ago. People will think you&#x27;re old!\"I thought, \"Screw that, everyone already knows I&#x27;m old.\"So I decided to just tell my story, all the way back to the beginning in the days of punch cards and Teletypes.I am grateful that you appreciated that. reply qumpis 1 hour agorootparentA bit surprising to hear that you weren&#x27;t swimming in offers to hire you all the time. Any idea why that was? Maybe you&#x27;re somewhat picky about the job and responsibilities that come with it? reply kvirani 13 hours agoparentprevI hope that feedback didn&#x27;t discourage you from continuing with your approach to software development and teamwork. reply shortrounddev2 13 hours agorootparentI am the same way with my coworkers. I spend a lot of time helping juniors with their code and doing code review. My boss talked to me and told me to stop helping out so much and focus on my own tickets. reply elliotec 12 hours agorootparentIt’s a balance. Sometimes it is worth spending a ton of time leveling up your team (teaching them to fish), and sometimes it’s much more helpful to have you do the work yourself (we ran out of food and you’re our best fisherman). reply deprecative 7 hours agorootparentI get why people say this but let&#x27;s be real. You optimize for the review cycle. If I&#x27;m told not to help as much I&#x27;m dropping it down until I&#x27;m told to help more. Then I&#x27;ll correct the minimal amount necessary. reply rubicon33 10 hours agorootparentprevThe approach the company I work for has taken, is that leads and managers are primarily coders.I think this makes sense especially for smaller companies, but it does put a extra emphasis on hiring well. Basically, I&#x27;m expected to code and helping my team is secondary to that. If I want the team to succeed I need to hire people who are self motivated and competent enough that they only require a little guidance here and there.Turns out that&#x27;s very difficult to hire consistently for. Finding self motivated and highly skilled developers just isn&#x27;t all that easy in todays climate of boot campers. reply stephen_g 7 hours agorootparentprevThat’s good feedback I think.There’s an article that was going around again about ‘glue work’ ([1]) that has a story where an engineer gets caught up doing all this kind of mentoring, coordination and other work like that and then is passed over for promotions because they don’t have technical achievements (though they claim to have become instrumental in enabling everyone else’s technical achievements).The article never gets to quite the right conclusion - it’s actually massive management failure - what I was thinking the whole way through was “why hasn’t somebody sat them down and told them to do their actual job??”Mentoring and code review are both super important, but if the organisation wants you to focus on getting tickets done then you basically just have to, unless you can convince them to actually add the additional work to your actual role description or get enough seniority to add it yourself.But it’s good to have feedback on what kind of work you’re actually going to be measured on in performance reviews, promotions etc.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noidea.dog&#x2F;glue reply gsuuon 5 hours agorootparentI think this is an important perspective - in the end you need to do what the company asks of you and not what you think is right for the company if the two are in conflict. reply uxp8u61q 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s easy to say that until it affects your paycheck. reply hannofcart 5 hours agoparentprev> Some 20 years ago... I called \"house calls\": visiting other developers&#x27; offices...Ah, the good ol early 2000s, where devs had \"offices\" or \"cubicles\" to themselves. reply dymk 4 hours agorootparentNow I have a whole house with two offices, just for me! reply no_wizard 10 hours agoparentprevMuch can be done with self advocacyI was hired at a company to help scale their development because their app was growing fast but they needed a leap forward in architecture and approach or they couldn’t keep up with growth.I documented everything I did from day 1, from what I was doing as well as why.When it came review time, everything ended up reflecting really well, for I may have closed less tickets than my peers, my peers where closing more tickets than ever, and there was a direct line from my work with them to that productivity increase.Once upper management wrapped their heads around this they completely understood why I was effective at helping shift features: the A -> B wasn’t possible without me spending lots of time with others and helping with their projects, and we would have needed more headcount to achieve what we did by having me work with the org the way I was vs trying to juggle feature work with itIt’s all about the metrics at the end of the day, in some ways. If you can demonstrate your impact across the board it’s hard to dismiss reply acedTrex 10 hours agorootparentyep, you have to be loud about your work, especially if it is not trackable via other direct metrics like ticket count reply benj111 30 minutes agorootparentSo the performance metrics are ticket count and how loud you shout about your work? reply WalterBright 5 hours agoparentprev> a few months later> Which was exactly what I thought they had hired me for!It&#x27;s good to regularly update your manager with what you&#x27;re doing and accomplishing, as they may not realize it at all. reply jacquesm 4 hours agorootparentThen you have to wonder why they&#x27;re there in the first place. Managers that do not manage and do not know what the people they are supposed to be managing are up to can be missed. reply jamestimmins 19 hours agoprevReminds me of an anecdote about Bell Labs. Someone calculated who the most productive employees were (based on things like patents received), and found that many of them would eat lunch with the same person. That person wasn&#x27;t individually very productive, but he would always ask thoughtful, compelling questions that in turn made his coworkers measurably more productive. reply Erikun 18 hours agoparentIt might be from the great book The Idea Factory by Jon Gertner (p 135). &#x27;In the midst of Shannon’s career, some lawyers in the patent department at Bell Labs decided to study whether there was an organizing principle that could explain why certain individuals at the Labs were more productive than others. They discerned only one common thread: Workers with the most patents often shared lunch or breakfast with a Bell Labs electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. It wasn’t the case that Nyquist gave them specific ideas. Rather, as one scientist recalled, “he drew people out, got them thinking.” More than anything, Nyquist asked good questions.&#x27; reply avanai 18 hours agorootparentThe most impressive thing about this story is that they figured out the answer. They did the research, and nailed down that it was Nyquist who was was the productivity booster. It’s the exact opposite of the OP’s story, where management tried to fire the Nyquist-equivalent. reply Tarq0n 17 hours agorootparentThey found an answer that felt right to them. The reseachers weren&#x27;t blinded to the context they were working in, and their hypothesis is essentially unfalsifiable so I would take it with a grain of salt. reply liquidpele 14 hours agorootparentprevAll they figured out was that the smart people hung out together. reply sound1 13 hours agorootparentIMHO this is the right answer :) reply Strilanc 16 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, I&#x27;m kind of skeptical of the answer. I&#x27;m not saying that talking with Nyquist wouldn&#x27;t be useful, probably it was, but what&#x27;s stopping a dozen other things at least that useful from being part of the answer? reply jacquesm 4 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m not saying that talking with Nyquist wouldn&#x27;t be usefulNo, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be saying that:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Harry_Nyquisthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nyquist_frequency> but what&#x27;s stopping a dozen other things at least that useful from being part of the answer?Because someone needs to act, and that&#x27;s exactly what Nyquist did, in a very unobtrusive and non-confrontational manner. reply tfgg 15 hours agorootparentprevHarry Nyquist isn&#x27;t exactly an unknown engineer who doesn&#x27;t have his own achievements, though - not sure why people are saying he would be fired in a modern company! reply ramraj07 8 hours agorootparentHe doesn’t have his own achievements?I have heard of the Nyquist frequency, the nyquist limit, the nyquist sampling rate and the Shannon nyquist theorem.As far as I know no other individual has had this many “things” named after him. reply dabraham1248 6 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_things_named_after_Joh...Note that the \"Known for\" section on his main page has 119 elements.

Managers know this.Why else many things any one of us could list from the computing business. reply progmetaldev 7 hours agorootparentI agree with you 100%. Management does not have an eye for software that is easy to maintain and continue to make money on 5 or 10 years down the line. Most management is thinking short term, how do I get money in MY pocket right NOW. Who cares how the business does in the long term, they&#x27;ll jump ship and move on. It is the engineering that often makes a difference for long lived companies, it&#x27;s just that usually the engineers and&#x2F;or management isn&#x27;t around long enough to reap the rewards. I try to balance engineering with product cost (I&#x27;m lucky enough where I can see the \"numbers\"). I try to give more to the clients that pay more, or at least create something that I can reuse in the future, while making sure what I deliver is stable and not a big ball of spaghetti to make the next developer&#x2F;engineer cry at night. reply worik 6 hours agorootparent> ... 5 or 10 years down the line.

I try to give more to the clients that pay more, or at least create something that I can reuse in the future, while making sure what I deliver is stable and not a big ball of spaghetti to make the next developer&#x2F;engineer cry at night.I am not sure about the \"...who pay more\". As I am currently woefully underpaid I am more sympathetic to that view than once I was, but, I still view myself as a professional, and I act with professional ethics.Partly that means speaking up when I see a project going near the rocks. I do not make too much fuss, but I do say it out loud.That has cost me plenty. Our industry is full of people who are very good at one thing or another, but do not know their limits.Part of my \"being professional\" is knowing my own limits. reply robertlagrant 55 minutes agorootparentprevRumour has it Nyquist was promised to be on 18 breakfasts a day to placate investors after a slow quarter. reply vantassell 9 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of the adage of “solving the problem is the hard part, the hard part is figuring out the right problem to solve”.I always remember as “questions are harder than answers”. reply jamestimmins 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah that&#x27;s the one!

Its much easier and more comfortable than standing over their shoulder in tiny cubes we used to have.That said, especially now that i am fully remote, I&#x27;ve been trying and mostly failing to get developers especially across teams to talk and collaborate more. But its not too suprising: I was recently in a call and I was introduced to another developer who I replied, \"Yeah, I know you. I was in the cube next to you for 2 years and on your team for 6 months.\"Remote creates some new challenges, but its a culture thing, not a technology thing. reply riffraff 3 hours agorootparentFWIW, I schedule coffee with colleagues over zoom.It&#x27;s not the same as having lunch together but it is enjoyable and useful. reply andai 17 hours agoparentprevThat is a catalyst! reply wonderwonder 17 hours agoprevI worked at a company for a couple years where you had to produce 10 points a week or you got pipped. Didn&#x27;t matter if you were a jr or sr. I worked on a few teams there and you could immediately tell how the teams measured points by the stress level of the developers.Teams that attempted to measure the points in good faith were stessed and most of them showed signs of burn out. They regularly worked 60 hours a week.Teams that gamed the system and understood the impossible task they were assigned always gave the highest points total to a ticket they could or broke it down into smaller achievable tickets that continuously added to their points totals. These teams were filled with happy stress free developers.In an environment like that playing by the rules is a suckers game.When I eventually quit, every sr engineer at the company; 7 total, followed me within 4 months. reply crazygringo 14 hours agoparent> ...or broke it down into smaller achievable tickets that continuously added to their points totals. These teams were filled with happy stress free developers.But that is part of the point of scrum. To break down stories into consistently stress-free achievable stories, rather than big risky ones filled with unknowns.I&#x27;m not saying this was a good workplace, it doesn&#x27;t sound like it at all. But to me, it sounds like the devs who you think gamed the system, were mostly behaving the way scrum is meant to incentivize. Happy, stress-free development that delivers consistently improving software.(Minimum point totals per week leading to inflated point values is terrible management, though.) reply vegetablepotpie 14 hours agorootparentI think what the GP means by “gaming” the system is that the teams did all the technical activities of scrum without providing much or any business value.The issue with scrum or any process that involves estimating is that every software project will inevitably have some risky element or difficult to estimate task that is essential to the execution of the project. Scrum will incentivize teams to avoid the essential work and guide them towards work that is easier to estimate.Certainly having a good product owner can mitigate this because she can do the work of identifying and breaking down the intractable to something more actionable.But in that case you’re depending on the people on the team to make good choices. Smart people can do that regardless of the development process they’re using. It’s unclear what value scrum brings to teams at all. It doesn’t make bad teams work any better and it restricts how smart teams can operate.One thing that scrum does give is it provides management metrics they can use to measure performance. reply wonderwonder 13 hours agorootparent\"every software project will inevitably have some risky element or difficult to estimate task\"You are exactly right here. At this company though, that risk on a personal level could mean a pip. So the happy teams inflated the story points massively to ensure that any or no risk was accounted for and they survived to code another day. reply madeofpalk 8 hours agorootparentprev“Story points” help you predict your work in the future. Knowing what and when you deliver can be valuable!Say you’re developing software for the next Super Bowl broadcast - it’s useful to know whether you’ll deliver what you said you would. If it’s looking like you can’t, you can start to make educated decisions about what work to cut and get a better idea of what you actually will deliver. reply vegetablepotpie 6 hours agorootparentThe criticism of the GP is that teams at his company would estimate story points differently depending on how much stress they wanted to take on and not based on the complexity of the work. This had the impact of the low stress teams not taking on ambitious work. Whereas teams that would take on ambitious work and attaching points to that work were working at unsustainable levels to meet targets.In your Super Bowl example, you&#x27;d either get a team that would focus on doing the scrum activities but never deliver anything useful regardless of how many points it would take, or you&#x27;d get a burnt out team that&#x27;s on the verge of flaming out. In either case \"Story points\" provide you with no predictive capacity even though predicting would provide value. reply riffraff 3 hours agorootparentThe predicting value is only per-team. If your team does 10 points per sprint, it won&#x27;t deliver 20. If it does 100, it will.But it&#x27;s an important tenet of scrum that velocity is only meaningful in a single team[0], the root management failure in OP&#x27;s case is comparing different teams.[0] and teams cheat themselves too. I recall one advice early in my career that a velocity increase with no underlying process change was likely to mean.. that the team started to overestimate complexity, and one should understand what went wrong. reply ResearchCode 2 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t help you do that, even though poor non-technical managers might think they do. That&#x27;s why good software projects don&#x27;t use them. I don&#x27;t see any story ticket velocity points used in Linux kernel development.You can&#x27;t estimate non-trivial software, and if you are doing trivial predictable work, you should be automating it, not endlessly estimating it.I didn&#x27;t say I would \"deliver\" anything. It&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done. You can&#x27;t predict the outcome of a software project. Many of them fail and micromanagement makes them more likely to fail. reply wonderwonder 13 hours agorootparentprevOP here. You are right, but the minimum point totals eliminates any benefits that can be achieved from scrum, it forces engineers to incentivize survival over project momentum. If a story is really a 3 pointer but I know that if I close 2 3 point stories in a week then I am pipped, suddenly those 3 point stories are 5 point stories.On the teams that played fair, it was a mix of sr. and jr. and the sr. measuring that story at a 3 meant the jr. was working the weekend. Over and over again.Note: On the happy team, we had almost no supervision, not even a scrum master. We just looked out for each other. That 3 point story often suddenly became an 8 as the end of the week approached and no one blinked. That team incidentally was the only one that consistently got good reviews from management. reply ytoawwhra92 8 hours agorootparent> teams that played fairWhat does \"played fair\" mean? Did this organsiation have a fixed definition of the value of a story point?EDIT: The reason I ask is because when story points are used \"correctly\" their value is defined entirely relative to the previous output of the team which produced the estimate. Like, their purpose is to allow dev teams to do relative estimation (which is pretty easy to do), but also enable someone to produce absolute estimates based on the team&#x27;s track record of delivery. Team says a story is a 5 pointer? Query previously delivered stories which the team also said were 5 points and if there&#x27;s enough data you&#x27;ll be able to forecast with reasonable certainty how long it will take them to deliver this new story. Used this way there&#x27;s no \"fair\" value of a story point - it doesn&#x27;t matter if one team uses point values in the range 0 - 1 while another uses point values in the range 1,000 - 1,000,000.The whole thing breaks if you start comparing point values across teams, or say that 1 point is 1 day&#x27;s work or whatever. reply epanchin 11 hours agorootparentprevThe point of scrum is to provide employment for consultants and non-engineers.I left engineering for an engineering job in finance.

Just a few weeks from his arrival, they had to rebuild the entire network from scratch with new, modern, equipments as well as extending the network to all the buildings of the company’s headquarters. They started to look for external contractors to outsource this project but Tommy was shocked by the price the financial department was willing to pay to get this work done, obviously, some non-tech people made the estimates.

When I think of competitive programming I think of algorithms and puzzles, not network errors and data corruption.In my experience production fires are rarely put out by rote algorithmic knowledge, the skill is more having a detailed knowledge of the inner workings of every layer of the system so that you can come to the right conclusion based on the very limited information available in the average production monitoring system. reply zerbinxx 8 hours agorootparentThis is my understanding as well.

Which is fine if that&#x27;s what you hired Tim for, but I suspect that if you wanted a coach, you would&#x27;ve hired one. Hard features simply can&#x27;t be done by juniors even given infinite amounts of time: they just don&#x27;t have the skills yet, and to gain those skills takes years. Sure, they need a senior to help now and then, but if that makes the senior developers produce nothing, then what&#x27;s the point for the company?? Just give hard features to people who are senior enough to do them, and if you really want the juniors to learn, let the senior share easier parts of that work (and walk through what he&#x27;s doing) with the junior.It&#x27;s very nice of Tim to help everybody else, but doesn&#x27;t anybody find it odd that all the other programmers need lots of help in the first place, so much that Tim has zero time to deliver anything himself?

You can say that developers deliver story points; that is the product, not the work.I invite you to come up with your own answer before you read mine.------------I think the inner cycle of development is learning and trying. You learn about a system, make a theory, try that theory out, try to extend that theory, then you test. That test will let you learn some more - was I right or wrong, was there some side effect. Then you repeat.I don&#x27;t think this learning and trying is a good unit of measure for performance, but I do think it&#x27;s a good basis for an engineering notebook, which may be reviewed with a manager.Non-junior developers are essentially managing themselves when it comes to getting the work done.

Managers always love a developer who can consistently write 5000+ lines per code per week, regardless of how many features they actually ship and how many bugs they introduce.As a team lead and engineer who has managed some complex projects, the idea of someone writing over 2000 lines of code per week terrifies me... That&#x27;s over 100K lines of code a year. Think of the unnecessary complexity. There is a very good chance that the same feature set could have been implemented with just 10K lines of code, less buggy and in half the time though that would only amount to 380 lines of code per week!

The labor movement here never grafted the idea of being business oriented on behalf of workers into the movement (like in Germany) rather, they treat the business as the enemy pretty much from the outset.Some of that is indeed earned by the businesses reputation, but ultimately this is what I think spurred the decline of union membership in the US because businesses don’t get a lot if any value out of having a union around and the organized workers often find the benefits stagnant after some time reply astrange 12 hours agorootparentThat is because of historical circumstances, but it continues to this day because it&#x27;s encoded in the law; we don&#x27;t have codetermination or sectoral bargaining. reply CapitalistCartr 13 hours agorootparentprevA union would provide the sort of employment protections much of Europe alreadys enjoys. reply Sivart13 12 hours agorootparentprevA union doesn’t have the power to change management, and is just as likely to advocate to retain low performing ICs in the name of “solidarity” reply b800h 16 hours agorootparentprevI prescribe a viewing of \"Carry On at your Convenience\" to cure that sentiment:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carry_On_at_Your_Convenience reply jacobsenscott 14 hours agorootparentprevWhen you can get a bootcamp certificate, and then get two remote jobs and coast at both for 12 months, and then repeat, what could a union do for you? reply fn-mote 7 hours agorootparentAre you currently doing this?

In America, it&#x27;s one of the only ways for blue collar or other production-oriented workers to have any degree of leverage at the negotiation table. We are treated like cattle in the workplace, and though unions come with their fair share of problems (due to it being yet another leadership structure to work within), the idea of workers holding power as a group is essential, because it reflects reality. None of that VC money is getting a return without workers to do the work. Most places in America are not unionized, but the ones that do pay better than other work in the area, even after union dues.I see it as very much a union-by-union thing, much like you would an employer.Now, some programmers may be able to negotiate good terms for themselves, but the vast majority of that stage is simply how silver your tongue is. Why should you be paid better because you got a better charisma roll with the interviewer? I would want my coworkers to be paid the same as me for the same experience. A senior with 10 years in the field, naturally, would be paid much more.It&#x27;s strange you say developers can negotiate, when there&#x27;ve been quite a few layoffs as of late and we see plenty of stories of people having trouble staying in tech. Which is it? The only thing that can give you credible sway is learning rarer or more in-demand skills, and putting together projects that show you understand how to use them. And for how long will that last? A union is a lot harder to fight than an individual.But yes, there are bad unions.

I would value that in a salesman, where it makes sense.

We had a lot of discussions beforehand to get to this shared understanding. There was literally not a single PR which surprised me throughout the entire project and I&#x27;m sure none of my PRs were a surprise to any of my team mates either.

In that case often the safest thing you can do for your own reputation and appearance is to leave some very gentle notes that a certain thing maybe could have been done differently, but approve it anyway on the grounds that it works for now.

I disagree with a lot of modern tech trends but I simply cannot express my view about them even though I could explain the problems very clearly and logically and can provide far better and simpler alternatives.

I reluctantly approved the PR since I couldn&#x27;t just ask them to rewrite the whole patch due to just a hunch.Lo and behold, after a kernel upgrade and file system change, that weird piece of code caused a multi-week panic for the whole team.

IMO, management needs to have the right mindset to establish culture, too. reply greenyouse 18 hours agorootparentprevThat would depend on the culture of your team and larger workplace. Healthy teams should be checking in frequently to talk about ideas, reviewing big things, scoping upcoming work, etc. If there&#x27;s time reserved for deeply technical but loosely structured discussion like that, then everybody takes turns being that person. In that env someone could \"specialize\" in it and help inspire others to do great work.It&#x27;s the team that creates that kind of opportunity for feedback though. If the team has dysfunctions like rejecting deeper discussion or not working beyond jira tickets or checking out at meetings, etc. then it&#x27;s not going to work. Someone that&#x27;s good at that kind of supporting discussion will feel push back when fostering those discussions so it will fall off over time.The teams that do the best work and are the most fun to be on can host those types of discussions though, even remotely.

Katie Porter (D-Calif.) at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on July 19, 2023. (Photo by Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images) Leading tax prep companies have poured $90 million into lobbying on the Free File Program and other issues since the program’s inception in 2003, a new OpenSecrets analysis found. Now the lobbying juggernauts are facing mounting scrutiny from members of Congress over their deployment of “revolving door” lobbyists in alleged attempts to undermine the federal government’s adoption of a government-run system that would allow taxpayers to file for free. After years of lobbying and negotiations, a coalition of tax prep companies called the Free File Alliance reached a deal with the IRS to offer free tax prep services to a larger portion of taxpayers starting in 2003. The agreement, spearheaded by Intuit lobbyists, required companies to provide some tax filing services at no cost to certain individuals, those same companies could still charge for ancillary services and other tax-filing products. As a part of the public-private partnership, the IRS promised not to develop its own tax prep software or e-filing services. However, a December 2019 addendum to the alliance’s original memorandum of understanding lifted that restriction, despite tax prep companies spending heavily on lobbying to bar the government from creating its own e-filing software. The December 2019 addendum also barred tax prep companies in the alliance from blocking Free File Internet search results. The change came shortly after ProPublica reported that tax prep companies in the alliance lured tax filers away from free tax filing options by hiding their Free File options from Google results and instead directing users to paid products – including products marketed as “free” that allegedly tricked clients into paying. Since then, multiple companies have pulled out of the agreement with the IRS, including H&R Block in 2020 and Intuit in 2021. While both leading tax prep companies have continued to spend heavily on lobbying, federal government efforts to roll out a government-run free tax filing system are moving forward – albeit not without some pushback. After President Joe Biden’s December 2021 Executive Order instructed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to consider “expanded electronic filing options,” Yellen testified before the Senate Finance Committee that building a free direct filing service is “definitely a priority.” The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allotted $15 million for the IRS to explore the creation of a free federal tax filing service. In May, the IRS released a report announcing plans to launch the pilot program for the 2024 tax filing season and indicating that most U.S. taxpayers are interested in filing their taxes directly to the IRS for free. But in June, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee proposed a budget rider that would bar the IRS from using federal government funds to create a government-run tax preparation software, unless approved by the House and Senate’s appropriations committees. The IRS report and pilot program have also faced fierce opposition from tax prep companies. “An IRS Direct File system is redundant and will not be free — not free to build, not free to operate, and not free for taxpayers,” Intuit spokesperson Derrick Plummer told ABC News. The Intuit spokesperson further told AP that the report “cherry-picks data to support its flawed conclusion,” noting the study found that only 12% of taxpayers said they would use a government-run system if state tax returns are not included in the program. On Aug. 23, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) sent letters to Intuit, H&R Block, the Free File Alliance and the American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights, a tax prep, software and financial services trade association whose members include Intuit, H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, TaxSlayer and Liberty Tax Services. Warren and Porter gave the organizations until Sept. 6 to provide additional information about the tax prep industry’s lobbying activities and revenue. The American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights spent $150,000 on federal lobbying during the first half of this year, a smaller sum than the leading tax prep companies but outpacing any of its prior years and putting it on track for another record-setting year. The coalition spent $80,000 of that on federal lobbying in the second quarter of 2023 with $50,000 of that going to Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, which started lobbying for the coalition May 1. In 2022, the coalition spent $260,000 on federal lobbying — the most it has spent any year other than the $265,000 it spent the year it launched. There is no record of federal lobbying by the Free File Alliance and its executive director, Tim Hugo, told AP that his organization “does not lobby, does not hire lobbyists, has not hired lobbyists in the past, and has never had a PAC.” This is not the first time congressional Democrats have scrutinized the tax prep industry’s lobbying activities. In 2022, several members of Congress called for probes into the company’s deployment of revolving-door lobbyists who previously held government positions, citing investigative reporting by OpenSecrets and ProPublica. After OpenSecrets’ March 2022 reporting on Intuit’s lobbying in Washington, Warren sent another letter to Intuit’s CEO accusing the company of “extensive lobbying and adroit influence peddling.” In a June letter, Warren, Porter and Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) further called on federal inspector general offices to investigate Intuit’s “use of the revolving door to influence policy decisions” and the “extent to which Intuit—and other Free File Alliance members—have used the revolving door to exert undue influence on department and agency policies, particularly Free File.” Intuit has also taken heat from the Federal Trade Commission, which filed a complaint in 2022 accusing Intuit of deceptively advertising their paid tax preparation services as free filing. On Wednesday, an administrative judge inside the agency ruled against Intuit but the ruling will remained sealed until Sept. 6, pending redactions, Politico reported. “We expect to appeal this decision to the FTC Commissioners and, if necessary, then to a federal court of appeals. We intend to continue to defend our position on the merits of this case,” Intuit wrote in its annual SEC filing filed Friday. Even amid the scrutiny, tax companies continue to reap the profits of the current system. On Aug. 23, Intuit announced its total revenue was $12.7 billion for the 12-month fiscal year ending June 31, up 32% from the prior year. H&R Block reported $3.5 billion in revenue during its own 12-month fiscal year ending June 30, a more modest increase of about $9 million — or 0.3% — from the prior year. Over the two decades since Free File launched, Intuit has poured over $43.3 million into federal lobbying while H&R Block spent nearly $42 million. Intuit, the company that owns TurboTax, has spent more than $1.8 million on federal lobbying in the first half of 2023, outpacing any prior year. H&R Block spent more than $1.5 million on federal lobbying during the same period.

I think you’ll find that your assumptions about what political operatives are willing to do are wrong.A very large part of the current craziness has been enabled by people so incredulous that nobody would “stoop to such a level” that they ignore the topic completely, only to find out when it’s too late that they do, in fact, stoop down to that level and the damage has already been done. reply gabereiser 10 hours agorootparentAhhh the good old republican pact.

Individual political identities line up all over on different ones. - Progressive rate vs flat - Detailed vs simplified - Policy via taxes vs outside of them - Low taxes vs high taxes + benefits - Use tax (e.g. sales) vs income tax - Labor tax vs capital tax - Gov-cooperative filing vs adversarialMy read on how we got to where we are is (1) all politicians love byzantine tax codes, because it allows sneaking favors in without repercussions + (2) people love getting money.Consequently, we get a convoluted tax code that advantages special interests who can lobby, sold and balanced with enough direct benefits to people that they&#x27;re happy.Which... is a complicated sausage, but doesn&#x27;t seem like the worst way to resolve a fundamental tension?And then everyone stares at the resulting Rorschach blot of de facto tax codes and sees what they want to see.\"Look, it&#x27;s ridiculously complicated!

Ultimately, you’re trying to determine if this is intentional or not, which doesn’t make that much of a difference.As Jon Stewart used to ask on his show when trying to assess the motivations of conservatives: are they stupid or evil? Which is just a simpler way of asking: are they being intentional about this or not? reply rayiner 9 hours agorootparent> the American right argues consistently that the government does not represent the interests of the people and actively works to render the government ineffectiveThis is a pretty rich assertion considering the condition of blue states and cities.

Anything more complicated involves a P11D ie \"benefits\".Self assessment nowadays gets all P60 details pre filled in. I run a closed company with two other directors and 20 odd employees. My tax affairs are pretty simple - I don&#x27;t do anything fancy. It takes me abut 30-60 mins to fill in the HMRC SA questionnaire online. I get a tax calc at the end and I cough up my tax. Dealing with shares etc is pretty straightforward because there is statutory reporting - ie each year you get a standard form declaring all relevant amounts and what to do.Taxation in the UK is pretty easy to deal with unless you want to take the piss, in which case you don&#x27;t have a leg to stand on.I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a HMRC audit and I don&#x27;t recommend it. Bizarrely I came out better off when they found some additional things I could claim for, which more than offset my cock up that caused the audit, including the fine!

For most people working as employees, the tax return is just for you to confirm your numbers with the government&#x27;s, specify any deductions if necessary, and see if you owe any extra or are entitled to a refund.I am honestly surprised that learning how to fill out the IRS form is not part of the high school curriculum.The 1040 form is only two pages long:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;irs-pdf&#x2F;f1040.pdfThe software to make this isn&#x27;t too complicated. This has more to do about being able to legally distribute it since an open-source solution could have been distributed already, but there is too much liability in doing so.If you want to add e-file to the software, you have to be approved by the IRS and that&#x27;s where the lobbying&#x2F;corruption comes into play. reply maccard 10 hours agorootparent> For most people working as employees, the tax return is just for you to confirm your numbers with the government&#x27;s, specify any deductions if necessary, and see if you owe any extra or are entitled to a refund.In the UK, for most people working as employees there is no tax return.

As long as you don’t have a complicated source-of-revenue situation (which is true for vast majority of population), you just confirm the tax return on a governmental app and you’re done. It’s extremely convenient, after they implemented a couple of years back, the time needed for tax return each year got down to maybe 2 min if you can use a computer. reply Ekaros 3 hours agorootparentSome take it even further. Inaction is considered approval. So you do not even need to confirm anything at all. You are likely to get tax return on your account automatically. Or a bill send at you.

Perhaps both parties share blame here. reply tzs 10 hours agorootparent> Congress has had Democrat control many times over the decades, they could have pushed this through any time.It&#x27;s not that simple. A party&#x27;s agenda will include several things they want to pass when they have a majority, with different priorities.For many of the items on their agenda there will not be unanimous support within the party and there won&#x27;t be unanimous opposition from the other party. The result is that for some of their agenda items they will have to get some support from the other party.Those other party members, even if they actually like the majority party&#x27;s bill, will be reluctant to go against their own party and support it because their party might retaliate, doing things like deprioritizing those members bills or giving them less important committee assignments. The majority party might have to offer those minority members some incentive to get their support, such as agreeing to support bills that those members are pushing even if those are against the majority party&#x27;s agenda.And so parties have to pick their fights. Making tax preparation easier is not something that a lot of voters care deeply about, and so doesn&#x27;t become something that is worth pushing through through when you&#x27;ve got a small majority.Every House seat is up for election every 2 years, and it is very common for a party that has both the presidency and majorities in both the House and the Senate to lose that House majority in the midterm election.

Obviously we can have processes for appeals or amendments to an individual&#x27;s return.Nevertheless, do absolutely agree with getting rid of corporate subsidies and pork, and simplifying the tax code, if for no other reason than to close the innumerable number of loopholes abused by corporate entities and the wealthy. reply lockhouse 14 hours agorootparentA simple tax code is a simple one for a computer to calculate.1.

Subtract that from whatever has already been taxed out of their payroll for the year.5. Bill them or refund them appropriately.No humans would need to be part of the process if it were that simple, saving money and making errors less likely.

If you&#x27;re going to use a computer to calculate taxes, you don&#x27;t need a simple tax code. Indeed, the tax code should be as complicated as possible to efficiently and fairly calculate taxes for each individual and corporation.

(The IRS is able to verify the calculations of the tens of millions of returns that are filed digitally within minutes.)

What many people think of as \"loopholes\" are grounded in decades or centuries or pre-income tax financial structures, especially the loopholes related to agriculture.For example, one of the biggest loopholes in the tax code is the carried interest exception. It created modern Silicon Valley; YCombinator exists solely because of this loophole. Most of the nation regards it as the most blatant subsidy in the tax code, but it is essential to startup financing. How would you feel if they got rid of it?And the \"flat rate\" tax rate you propose is a huge subsidy to the wealthy, who derive the most benefit from a stable government and therefore should pay the most to continue it.

Even former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed with it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.uchicago.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;justice-ruth-bader-ginsbur... reply Guvante 14 hours agorootparent [–] Why did the SC need a Goldilocks decision to overturn it? Examples from since the Constitution were invalid but examples before the Constitution were also invalid.Ruth did not \"disagree with it\". She was critical of it, which is very very different.Specifically she thought that focusing on the doctors right to decide on treatment course was a bad vector to enshrine a woman&#x27;s control over her own bodily function.Similarly she saw the rallying cry and felt that if the SC hadn&#x27;t stepped in a more natural process would have resulted in a similar status over a longer time period anyway.\"If the SC hadn&#x27;t done something everyone else would have\" and \" it didn&#x27;t go far enough\" are not \"disagreed with\". reply lockhouse 12 hours agorootparent [–] That’s the problem, Roe was an overstepping of the Supreme Court. A law should’ve been passed instead. That is why this Supreme Court ruled the way they did. There was nothing in the Constitution or established law to support Roe. reply Guvante 9 hours agorootparent [–] You are incorrect and the ruling doesn&#x27;t support your assertion.At minimum judiprecedent said (and the ruling explicitly said) being wrong is insufficient to overrule.It needs to be so wrong as to be unconsolable or you need to explicitly carve out details that weren&#x27;t specified before (after all Roe was already overturned)Instead the far right justices decided that since they believed based on the evidence they provided that at the exact time the constitution was written there wasn&#x27;t an established fact that abortions should be allowed.This is a test that has never been used before this ruling. That is because the logic was developed explicitly for this ruling.You cannot make up law and then claim your way was better.To go on evidence shows that generally speaking the laws of the land didn&#x27;t make it illegal to have an abortion as it wasn&#x27;t considered that kind of thing. So opponents said \"we can go back before the Constitution and see what the established precedent that they would have used would be\". It pointed to legality. But that was too old for the SC.So opponents brought up until a little before Roe it was also legal (anti abortion is not a historic thing but one that only dated back to the last century). Again however that wasn&#x27;t considered pertinent because that wasn&#x27;t the founding fathers perspective.We don&#x27;t even have the founding fathers perspective, they didn&#x27;t discuss it to any meaningful length. We can&#x27;t use evidence that before the Constitution it was considered normal. We can&#x27;t use evidence that after it was considered normal.The only evidence to discredit the SC literally deciding on its own that \"it was an uncertain thing\" (again no real evidence this was the real perspective, just that st least one person existed on both sides)Due to this we overturned precedent upheld for 50 years and confirmed by a refocusing SC ruling.That makes no sense, it doesn&#x27;t rise to their own standard of mistake given in the ruling.But none of this matters. The SC decided first: Roe is gone. Then they justified it. Thus the justification doesn&#x27;t need to be good or even passable.All to overrule a law that the majority of Republicans thought made sense and a supermajority of US thought was correct.The SC threw away a hundred years of built up support to satisfy a super niche extremist viewpoint.The very definition of political bullshit that the SC is supposed to avoid. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I feel like they don&#x27;t quite understand sound business principles like Platform Risk.If keeping up the business afloat is your mission as a business owner, why&#x27;d you base your business off a platform you don&#x27;t control? You might assume a Platform Risk, and be fully aware of it (and in the meantime, capture the capital to have your own platform or contract services from another platform less volatile), or you might not be aware of it at all, or if you&#x27;re aware, you just play dumb and say \"it won&#x27;t be a problem, that happens to others, not to me\".I just get discouraged, I never end up joining these Discord communities and I don&#x27;t buy the product&#x2F;service the company is selling, I feel it distasteful.In these SaaS days where providers can get away with not having a proper Support department or they are too big for you to go ahead and sue them face-to-face... why&#x27;d you put your neck on the line this way?

Discord is both younger as a company and still recently raising new funding founds. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t rely on them but they’re definitely less proven. reply MichaelZuo 6 hours agorootparentOf course, which is why Discord charges much less then the several hundred dollars per year per seat that Microsoft does?What is the complaint here, that they&#x27;re offering a much cheaper service with less credibility? reply ivanmontillam 6 hours agorootparentThe complaint here is that Discord is too popular among a generation of young business owners that put their livelihoods on the line in such an unreliable service, business-wise.Discord&#x27;s marketing is too powerful for these business owners to consider safer, more reliable alternatives. Same story with Stripe, and similar services that cut lifelines with no recourse other than outcry in public forums like HN and Reddit.If they have to learn the hard way, so be it. reply posguy 5 hours agorootparentIf your planning to use services that are ban happy like Discord, Stripe and ilk, make sure to document and communicate a fallback plan.For example, ensure you have a backup email address for those you communicate with on Discord, and convey an alternate communication method (Meet us on Matrix at XYZ!), or on the payments side plan on how to handle a PAN Data Export with a pre-selected vendor that is experienced in ensuring Stripe exports this data to them.

The account owner&#x27;s databases or Terraform scripts wouldn&#x27;t be deleted by a set of EC2 instances being taken down.AWS has its own problems but they do try and stay out of content moderation where possible through their \"Shared Responsibility Model\" (which also means they don&#x27;t do things like backups for you). reply DJHenk 2 hours agorootparentprev> Why is discord any different than other platforms like office365 or AWS? Do you feel the same about companies using those platforms as well?The difference is that Microsoft and AWS don&#x27;t take on an active role in moderating what happens between the company and its users.But yes, in a way they are similar and I do feel uneasy each time we take on a dependency on some AWS-specific feature where we could easily have build the component to be independent.No one else seems to care though. Even worse, the CEO wants us to dig deep into AWS, because that somehow will make the customers trust us more. reply cudgy 1 hour agorootparentDidn’t AWS pull the rug out from under a fledgling, but increasingly popular, social media site that never recovered from their actions “after the platform was deemed to be both \"unwilling and unable\" to address extremist speech”?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;amazon-web-services-parler-lawsuit-... reply ThatPlayer 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d say the difference is I can make a full backup of my data on office365 or AWS.

AWS: I get full access to my databases, my files.Even comparing Discord to Slack: Slack has export capabilities. reply ivanmontillam 7 hours agorootparentGiven what you just said in your comment, I guess what makes them different is that Microsoft 365 and AWS are enterprise-ready, so you can take away your data easily. With Google, with a regular account, you could as well using Google Takeout.With Discord... you might have to strong-arm them into a GDPR claim or similar, so, vendor lock-in in a B2C SaaS is a thing. reply raincole 3 hours agorootparentprevThere is no difference and people saying otherwise are just in denial.Because their businesses&#x2F;jobs are so tightly tied to AWS etc, they just tell themselves everything is fine. (What else can they do? Quit and be a full time open source developer?) reply gabereiser 10 hours agoprevDo. Not. Launch. On Discord.They are getting worse and worse towards their users. The “platform” was never designed for this, it’s painfully obvious. There’s no knowledge base, no support system, no sense of organization, no professionalism, just bots doing “stuff” as a product. Is FastAPI that hard? Is building a customer portal that difficult?I guess I’m showing my age but I use discord for gaming and chatting with friends, not to balance my checkbook or pay my bills or assist my coding or design architectural diagrams. Occasionally it will help me make a pretty image that would otherwise take me weeks… Or help be brainstorm a sketch of a creature. However, the UX of discord is problematic towards anything other than a gaming community. reply VoodooJuJu 9 hours agoprevSo discord is something I use for voice-chatting and shitposting with friends, typically while also playing video games.Can anyone tell me why they would ever use it for anything remotely serious? Can you tell me why you&#x27;d want to stake your livelihood on a walled garden designed for video game voice chat and sharing rickroll videos?Not only that, I can&#x27;t take seriously a business that uses discord. Like, what are you doing? Are you selling curated rickroll videos? God-tier cat memes? Do you do shitpost editing and enhancing? Like that what the fuck are you doing that your business needs to use discord, an app for vidya gaymen? It just gives me this puerile vibe, like this \"hello fellow kids\" kind of thing.I&#x27;m genuinely curious what this app does for your business that seemingly couldn&#x27;t be fulfilled by anything else. reply atomicnumber3 7 hours agoparentDiscord is a very featureful chat and voice app that is similar to slack in terms of managed-ness but they have completely different roots.Slack is basically just business email but IMing instead of email, if you know what I mean. It&#x27;s very business. Business happens there. Synergy and collaboration and so on.Discord, meanwhile, grew out of some combination of gaming&#x2F;tech IRC servers and gaming ventrilo and teamspeak servers. It&#x27;s a completely different vibe and clientele that just happens to have a very similar feature set to slack.So having a discord for anything that&#x27;s gaming or programming&#x2F;techy-adjacent makes a lot of sense and there&#x27;s a big preexisting community there. I launched an OSRS plugin and we set up a discord channel for it. It was a niche thing, very niche, and we never really took it very far (it was sort of partly just an excuse to try out using managed k8s for the backend server that the plugin was a client for). We did 0 marketing aside from listing in the OSRS plugin marketplace and putting the discord link in the description.Suddenly me and my pal had like 100+ people in our discord and as many users of our site. With 0 marketing and a very simple MVP.And we didn&#x27;t do any BI or anything but afaict the attach rate of discord joining to using our plugin at least once was very high, well over 50%. People even asked a few questions and said the project was cool.So yeah. While I wouldn&#x27;t literally run my business on it, as a \"fan site\" it&#x27;s very useful and valuable. reply CSMastermind 3 hours agorootparent> Discord, meanwhile, grew out of some combination of gaming&#x2F;tech IRC serversFor the record this is exactly where Slack came from as well.From Wikipedia:> Slack originated as an internal communication tool used within Stewart Butterfield&#x27;s company, Tiny Speck, during their work on the development of Glitch, an online game. These communication tools were initially built around the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol and included scripts designed to automate and organize file exchanges among their development team.> In August 2013, Slack was launched to the public and continued to maintain compatibility with IRC, reflecting its origin. Additionally, it was also compatible with XMPP messaging protocols.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slack_(software) reply oneweekwonder 11 minutes agorootparent> However, in May 2018, the company chose to close down these corresponding gateways due to limitations inherent in those protocols.It was a way to onboard tech people and once they were big enough they closed the door for those audience.Which really hurt me because i live in a country with a small tech community and was happily interacting with them using irc, until slack changed into a walled garden. reply mdwalters 4 hours agoparentprevNot a \"buisness,\" but the project I volunteer on used to bridge to Revolt, a FOSS clone of Discord. The Revolt server got raided, as my friend, who also worked with the project accidentally leaked the invite, which would lead to the server&#x27;s deletion. Me and my friend asked the project leader and co-leader to re-bridge to Revolt, I don&#x27;t even remember what their responses were. My other friend made a hobby project that bridges directly to the project&#x27;s main product, and that became the de facto Revolt server. My friend then asked me to make a replacement for the bridge with the library I made (for Node.js&#x2F;TypeScript), as it was faster and stays online longer (sending a websocket message to the server every 15 seconds - the same as the main client) than my other friend&#x27;s (for Python - the project leader dropped a backwards-incompatible release in the websocket library, so my other friend was pretty screwed).RIP, volunteer project&#x27;s Revolt server, 2022 - 2022. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agoparentprevHaving a discord link probably sets some expectations about what to expect over there: chat, community, maybe voice chat, chilled vibe, temporary. All that from seeing the smiley joystick logo. It also signals cool modern startup. It may be be super convenient if your audience typically has an account already. Yes a tonne of downsides of course. reply maxbond 8 hours agoprevMay I ask what the context of your message was? Presumably one of the people on that server reported you, and in the messages you posted, people seem taken aback (eg \"did you just...\"). I&#x27;m curious what the context was and why they took the impression it was unusual? What were these ASNs in relation to? reply foresto 9 hours agoprevI find the trend of businesses using Discord as their primary support&#x2F;community platform troubling.It not only makes Discord an unaccountable gatekeeper of business communications and data, as demonstrated here, but also unfairly forces customers to either accept Discord&#x27;s terms and conditions (which are not what they signed up for) or be left behind as second-class citizens.Good luck, bottiger1. I hope you get it resolved. reply Ekaros 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not sure if Verified & Partnered servers are treated different, but unless you have explicit contract with Discord their moderation can be rather flaky.That should be understood reality if you use any third-party platform.Also it is open to question was it this activity. Or something else. Or just being present or member of some server where something against ToS happened. reply Macha 10 hours agoparentPartnered servers are definitely not. There was a kneejerk moderation action taking in the past to ban the primary FFXIV server after a user posted some illegal content there, reported their own illegal content, and deleted the message afterwards so mods couldn&#x27;t locate it. Considering where Discord came from, it was a surprising move to not even ask the operators of the server or share any information until they were facing user pitchforks. reply bottiger1 13 hours agoparentprevI am quite confident that it was this activity. It is the only thing that fit this description:\"Your account maliciously shared or participated in the sharing of the personal or private information of another user.\"It was also the only message of mine that was deleted in the past week. reply galenmarchetti 13 hours agoparentprevIs it a common practice for Discord to enter in contractual obligations with businesses that use Discord as a central support or distribution channel? I&#x27;ve never heard of this before and given what happened to OP it seems like this should be (a) common knowledge that you can do this and (b) a default option for businesses to consider, if Discord is indeed a big channel for your business.We use Discord as a primary support and community channel and it never crossed our minds to make a contract with them, but now I&#x27;m thinking about it.. reply version_five 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m super risk averse so I would never build a business around a single point of failure like that - but I know that there is money to be made taking this risk (at least VC money, presumably real money). Look at everybody building off OpenAI, look at AWS, Shopify, etc. I&#x27;ll never base my business around a platform, but I&#x27;ll miss out on many opportunities, even if it&#x27;s a big risk.All that to say the warning won&#x27;t stop people. reply sneak 10 hours agoparentThe Apple App Store is a similar single point of failure and both Uber and Instagram would not have become what they are today if they had not built their businesses on the back of the concept that Apple will not arbitrarily ban them.

Even just knowing someone’s state or country is a data point that can be used to narrow down their identity.

So one of them ending business relations with you, doesn&#x27;t mean the end of your business.For instance, The Pirate Bay, while being highly illegal, hasn&#x27;t been shutdown in two decades because cutting them from one webhost or domain seller just means they switch to a different one. I am pretty sure there are hundreds of torrent sharing \"services\" that started as discord&#x2F;slack servers and were quickly banned with no recourse. reply dredmorbius 3 hours agorootparentDiversification is one option I&#x27;d considered. It&#x27;s still difficult to achieve for numerous services, particularly location-based utilities (electrical, water, gas, sewerage, data&#x2F;comms). For hosting services it&#x27;s somewhat more tractable, though you&#x27;re looking at multi-tenancy hosting with distinct providers. For a small organisation, that&#x27;s going to be a challenge. (It&#x27;s a challenge for many sizeable organisations.)Self-hosting is of course another option, and for critical infrastructure probably a worthwhile consideration, though that leaves other risks (e.g., self-owned datacentre outage, personnel risks), and again is challenging for the overwhelming majority of businesses.Even large business sectors often have very few independent systems &#x2F; solutions &#x2F; software providers. Banking, healthcare, and numerous other sectors often have only a small handful, and often a single core supplier of critical systems. Often affecting large organisations as well as small ones.It&#x27;s almost as if attacking the recourse rather than the diversification angle might be necessary. reply GuB-42 9 hours agoprevIt is probably a bad idea do rely entirely on any one of the \"big tech\" companies, including the big names like Amazon and Google. There are many stories of companies being kicked out for random reasons, and with no one who can resolve your problem on the other end.I would treat them as a risk. You can work with them, but you have to consider that they can fail you randomly, and have some kind of backup plan or insurance. It is ironic since one of the big selling point of, say, cloud providers is that unlike using your own computers that can catch fire, they can guarantee data integrity and availability. But it is kind of a moot point if they can ban your account randomly because you triggered their bots. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agoparentHad 24h production outage (could temporarily rebuild in a test account luckily) due to this so it is a real thing. reply paulddraper 7 hours agoparentprevRIP AWS reply jtchang 13 hours agoprevDoes Discord charge or have some type of contractual agreement with you? It does seem odd -- they must have some checking on addresses and personal information and what you posted just happens to match that regex. reply Macha 10 hours agoparentGiven the reaction by the other users to that comment, it&#x27;s possible one or more of them reported it as misunderstanding them to be addresses, and the discord content moderation team also adopted a shoot first attitude. reply spondylosaurus 10 hours agorootparentYour average CS agent slogging through helpdesk tickets (particularly for a company whose core users are gamers and normies) might not even know what an ASN is. So if you&#x27;re faced with something that looks to you like a bunch of addresses, and your employer has a strict no-doxxing policy... I can see why they&#x27;re not budging on this one. reply Macha 10 hours agorootparentSure, you can see the incentives for the CS agent to act that way, but I don&#x27;t think that negates the point of this post - if you&#x27;re relying on it for business, you should probably consider a provider that has not set up their CS staff&#x27;s incentives this way. reply spondylosaurus 9 hours agorootparentWhich is totally fair, especially in this context. In general (not you specifically) people don&#x27;t always have a ton of sympathy for CS agents, so I just like to offer reminders that what they do is tough. Particularly if you&#x27;re fielding requests or moderating content in contexts you&#x27;re not familiar with, or in a language that you didn&#x27;t grow up speaking.And really, to your point—Discord is a general-purpose platform, not a technical platform or business platform, and its CS agents probably aren&#x27;t equipped to deal with complex technical or business problems. It&#x27;s kind of on OP for trying to use it that way. reply galenmarchetti 12 hours agoparentprevDoes there exist a Discord business plan &#x2F; any way to even get such a contractual agreement in place? We use Discord as a support channel for our developer tool and I&#x27;ve never heard of an option to get enterprise support...but if such a thing does exist and Discord offers it, I&#x27;d probably take it given OPs story reply DaiPlusPlus 10 hours agorootparentFor dev support, why choose Discord over Gitter, or even IRC? Slack and Teams also allow free guest access for this scenario too.That said, group-chat-based support seems like the wrong solution in the first place - simply because Discord is a silo and they don’t make it easy to get your own data back out of it (this page is an infuriating read: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.discord.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360004027692-R... ). Also, the fact that Discord themselves are using ZenDesk for their own support (instead of, y’know… using Discord) is another reason to not use Discord like this.Orgs using Discord today are giving me the same vibes as those SaaS that thought they could do everything with only Redis and NodeJS (with no RDBMS in sight) - yes, it works and might even work very well in some cases, right up until it doesn’t and there’s no plan B. reply smcg 8 hours agoprevI would never conduct business on Discord.

It&#x27;s a similar situation with Instagram, where people talk about \"visit my Instagram page\" and it gets indirectly conflated with the word \"website\"; it&#x27;s even worse if it&#x27;s an e-commerce business, e.g. \"visit my Instagram store\".Then the Instagram account gets killed because it&#x27;s not intended to be used as an eBay, and these naïve business owners didn&#x27;t know any better.We are in these times where kids don&#x27;t grasp the concept of \"C:\\\" drive. They just save all files and don&#x27;t know what a directory hierarchy is. They conceive Instagram as a web builder, much like Wix. reply telios 2 hours agoparentprevFor reference, the terminology they use for their API is \"guilds.\" But since most other services in the space used the term \"servers\" (e.g. TeamSpeak and Mumble, where they were actual distinct servers), I can see why the UI doesn&#x27;t say guilds. reply slau 13 hours agoprevWhy was the message deleted?

Private companies can cease doing business with you for a variety of reasons. You triggered one of them.I think you&#x27;ve conflated legal and ethical obligations here; you seem to be using that to draw to an unfair conclusion.From my perspective, the post warns against using Discord due to them (reportedly) banning the OP for innocent activity. I believe the warning is fair, as it dissuades other people from using the platform to host important content, which would be at risk of the same treatment.While Discord clearly do not have any legal obligations to serve the user in question, this is already known. Stating it here doesn&#x27;t contribute to a meaningful discussion -- no chat applications I know of are legally required to serve their users (unless, of course, they have entered into a binding contract with said users, perhaps through B2B services, etc.)Nevertheless, the post does give off Stripe support vibes. I don&#x27;t believe Discord staff monitor Hacker News, so I don&#x27;t think this would result in any meaningful result for OP. reply slau 12 hours agorootparentYou’re right, and eloquent to boot.I think what I meant to say was more something along the lines of “does anyone really build a business around Discord?”We’ve been seeing time and time again, especially in recent times (Twitter, Reddit, Apollo) that building something on top of another platform can often end in tears.This being said, I do believe that if you’re building an integration, you might end up in a different spot than random end-users. Although the way Discord handled API changes and the whole bot scope debacle doesn’t inspire confidence.And I say this as someone who maintains a Discord bot.Reflecting on this all, I don’t believe this user got banned out of a random regex match. I think this user’s messages got reported for doxxing, and the moderator who reviewed it concurred. reply bottiger1 13 hours agoparentprevIt was deleted by the discord support. I presume it was deleted when I got banned. I don&#x27;t have a screenshot of what it was before because there is no way to log all activity on discord, nor did I expect to get banned.You can confirm the contents of the message from the people talking about it here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;F49XZ4zaEAErD3J?format=png&name=...And yes this is also a campaign to get my account unbanned and also a PSA that you should be thinking about alternatives to Discord like Slack. The moderation and support system displayed here is atrocious. reply slau 12 hours agorootparentIs there any chance someone reported you (the message, more specifically) for doxxing?I use Discord with a variety of clients, and there’s _a lot_ of technical logs, including lists of locations, and in some cases even addresses. I’ve never had an issue. I also run a small community of a few thousand users, and haven’t seen anything like this… unless someone was reported.In any case, commiserations, and I hope you weren’t the only owner&#x2F;admin of some servers. reply bottiger1 12 hours agorootparentYes it is very possible. I have also posted asns in private channels before and nothing ever happened. It was only after I posted it in a public channel that I got banned.There are a few competitors that are really jealous of our success. reply Earwig 7 hours agorootparentFrom googling your username, it sounds like you are connected to Skial, the TF2 server?So I&#x27;m guessing you posted ASNs of (in your words, basically ISPs) of some players on your server, indicating generally where they live. Was it connected to specific people? I can see why Discord would consider that private info. reply bottiger1 7 hours agorootparentIt was just a list of ASNs. There was no other information that would allow you to connect them to a user.And it was also not \"malicious\" as described by their email to me. reply nneonneo 6 hours agorootparentThere are nearly 100,000 ASNs. Some are very small. An ASN is enough to identify a user&#x27;s ISP - enough for someone significantly more malicious than you to, say, social engineer an ISP, report players to their ISP for \"hacking\" a site, or start correlating with their visitors.What we&#x27;re also missing is the context. Did you share the ASNs for the purposes of, say, debugging a network connection? For statistical purposes? Or was the message more \"look at the people connecting to my server, j&#x2F;k these are just ASNs\"? The tone you use matters too: by sharing ASNs, you could easily be hinting that you have people&#x27;s real IPs, and that could be taken the wrong way.I don&#x27;t doubt that Discord overreacted here, but I certainly think there&#x27;s a high chance that your message could have been misinterpreted as a threat to privacy. reply bottiger1 3 hours agorootparentShowing an ISP is NOT personal information, full stop.If I say *Comcast* are you going to be able to track me down? No. There are millions of Comcast subscribers. Even if it was an ISP of 1 customer, that still isn&#x27;t personal information. If the ISP happens to leak the customer information from social engineering, that&#x27;s on the ISP, not me.All ASNs are considered to be public information. You are required by internet registry rules to be listed in a public database for everyone to see. As far as I can tell, most people would agree that listing stats like this is not considered personal information.I did not joke about it in any way. I showed people a list to demonstrate that we had a lot of users from Asia yet they did not use our servers in Asia. Even if I did joke about it, it still doesn&#x27;t make this personal information. replyrat9988 13 hours agoparentprev“don’t base your business around x” this is a logical conclusion when you get no support from the company. The rest of your edit isn&#x27;t logical either. When a business stop doing business for you, you deem it unreliable. If x has been banned without recourse without doing anything that would be, obviously wrong, I would deem it unreliable. reply slau 12 hours agorootparentMy point was that this did not look like a business. It looked like a gaming server. reply bottiger1 12 hours agorootparentIt is related to gaming, but we handle large amounts of money to keep our servers running, as well as providing revenue to Discord in the form of \"boosts\". It should be relevant to people running startups here. reply DaiPlusPlus 10 hours agorootparentDefine: “large amounts of money” - there’s a difference between funding a $500&#x2F;mo clan&#x2F;guild VPS set-up vs a $20,000&#x2F;mo SaaS start-up AWS invoice. reply bottiger1 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s obviously not a venture capital funded startup, but it&#x27;s far more than $500&#x2F;month. We have dedicated servers all over the world and buy transit. And I&#x27;d still consider this to be relevant to Hacker News even if our expenses were only $100&#x2F;month. Some startups don&#x27;t even spend that much. replymcpackieh 13 hours agoparentprev> This seems like a campaign to get unbanned more like a real warning to the HN community.If he&#x27;s lying, then such a campaign would be doomed to fail since Discord can see what we cannot.

Ron Hubbard’s Estate Is Against Right To Repair For Scientology’s E-Meters Gannett Stops Using AI To Write Articles For Now Because They Were Hilariously Terrible Tesla, Rivian Put On Fake Show Of Support For ‘Right To Repair’ (Mis)Uses of Technology from the watch-what-we-do,-not-what-we-say dept Fri, Sep 1st 2023 01:28pm - Karl Bode You may have noticed that there’s a massive, bipartisan push afoot to pass “right to repair” laws in many states making it easier and cheaper to repair the things you buy. In a bid to undermine those laws, automakers and companies like John Deere have been using a fairly consistent playbook. One, they’ll lie about how such popular reform poses massive security and privacy threats to consumers. Two, they’ll strike hollow, voluntary agreements with key industry groups in a bid to pretend that the industry can self-regulate (they can’t) and real reform isn’t necessary (it is). For example, John Deere has a long history of making tractor repair as inconvenient and expensive as possible in a bid to monopolize maintenance. And every so often they’ll strike a “memorandum of understanding” with a group like the American Farm Bureau Federation, pinky swearing that they’ll play nice if such groups avoid supporting right to repair legislation. It’s always bullshit. The auto industry has taken a similar tack. Under the banner of the “Alliance for Automotive Innovation,” the industry has recently struck deals with groups like the Automotive Service Association (ASA) and the Society of Collision Repair Specialists (SCRS) promising to play nice on right to repair issues if these organizations refuse to support state right to repair legislation. But again, activists say the voluntary agreements aren’t worth much: “We don’t think it means anything,” said Tommy Hickey, director of the Right to Repair Coalition, whose group led the campaign to pass the Massachusetts Data Access Law in 2020. “If you read the language, it says we’ll only give you telematic information if it’s absolutely necessary.” EV makers Rivian and Tesla recently made of show of supporting these recent agreements as evidence of their support for right to repair issues. But they’re not actually supporting meaningful new laws, they’re just supporting the empty, voluntary agreements the industry has struck with several trade groups to pre-empt new laws. There’s nothing actually meaningfully enforceable here; it’s the equivalent of a pinky swear. Among the auto blogs that covered the announcement, few pointed out the hollowness of such agreements. In most of the blogs, Tesla, which was just hit with two class actions for unlawfully curbing competition for maintenance and replacement parts for its electric vehicles, gets to pretend it’s already leading the way on “right to repair” reform. Without actually having to, you know, do anything: “Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy includes empowering independent repairers to service electric vehicles as the global fleet grows,” Tesla Public Policy and Business Development Vice President Rohan Patel wrote. “Through a comprehensive library of publicly available manuals and guides, Tesla already provides extensive information for independent and do-it-yourself repairers. Both companies claim there’s nothing that needs fixing. But in the real world, Tesla’s efforts to monopolize repair and maintenance (as well as its terrible customer service) are well established. This is, after all, a company that just got caught not only intentionally and dramatically overstating EV ranges, but creating a team specifically designed to undermine customer efforts to get help. In one instance, Tesla wanted $22,500 or more to replace a dying EV battery on a used car worth $23,000, when independent repair shops were able to do the same repair for less than $5,000. While Tesla does provide token diagnostic support for independent repair shops via its $3,000 a year (or $100 an hour) Toolbox platform, it still greatly restricts the far less expensive replacement of actual parts. Rivian repairs for even minor fender benders can also be comically expensive; not simply because the vehicles are complex, but because of elaborate, often-convoluted restrictions on repair and replacement parts. Both Rivian and Tesla claim to be innovatively a step beyond the traditional auto industry, but when it comes to making automotive repair as expensive, nontransparent, and annoying as possible, so far they’re not too far out of step with the rest of the pack.

I have to wonder if resources would be better spent towards victim support and recovery efforts, and perhaps targeting those big data brokers out there (to include federal, state, and local gov) and really scrutinizing their collection and protection methods. tomacamot: Was the article unclear or did I read it wrong, it seems like data leakage would fall under this law as well? So if the state of Illinois exposed citizen PII on the web they would be liable? Cathy Gellis: I think the first priority should be making sure the government can't dox people. We keep skipping that part... mildconcern: Right. But there's also an open question about what doxing means exactly and what tips it over to bad speech. A lot of material in a doxing is public records. Cathy Gellis: Oh yeah, that's a problem too. I'm just observing that people are Very Worried and missing out some really big stuff that is even more worrisome. Mike Masnick: Old enough to remember when the phone company sent around a big fat book doxxing everyone in your city... John Roddy: These days, the phone book is a magazine of ads that has a handful of phone numbers scattered around. Samuel Abram: [gifv] mildconcern: I didn't even realize anybody did a phone book anymore. Last time I think I got one was a decade ago? And I threw it away immediately. Mike Masnick: We got a new phone book 2 weeks ago and I spent time explaining to my kids what phone books were. They're now super thin and only list business numbers. mildconcern: I can't imagine a phone book that listed home phone numbers would be much thicker, either. It makes me wonder how many different area codes are held by people living in my town right now. Town has about 35k people. In 1995 that'd be one area code. Today it's probably... 100? Hell, I have two, and neither are the local area code here. One is near, and the other is across the country. John Roddy: Most people just lump the phone book in with the same junk mail they usually get without even noticing. Cathy Gellis: A friend had a job delivering an off-brand phone book - I remember helping him do his drop offs one day. mildconcern: We still get a weekly bundle of print ads in the mail that goes direct into the recycling. I did try their process to stop delivery and it of course did nothing. In the winter it makes decent fire tinder. I do remember as a kid thinking there was an air of High Intrigue and Romance to people who had unlisted numbers Samuel Abram: I know one such person, and while there's a bit of intrigue, no such romance. That's all I'll say on the matter Also, he's not unlisted but listed under a humorous pseudonym That's it BentFranklin: Speaking of doxxing: The Secret Weapon Hackers Can Use to Dox Nearly Anyone in America for $15 [article] Includes a quote from Ron Wyden. candescence: So ExTwitter is forcing you to use the new Tweetdeck, with no option to switch back, fucking RIP Mike Masnick: as a reminder, if anyone in here needs a bluesky invite, let me know... i still have a few. bigtroublewingcong: I'll take one, Mike.

Also Portal RTX is an official add-on for the original Portal, so I can't imagine Half Life 2 RTX not being the same for the original game. But yeah, tl;dr, Valve is really good about modding and fanworks and the _worst_ they'll do is just politely ask people to maybe do a bit of rebranding sometimes so as to avoid potential confusion, as when Black Mesa was renamed from Black Mesa: Source. BentFranklin: This is so good. Big fan of his writing and subscribe to his Patreon. Maybe AR Moxon would be a good guest author here! If You Want To Be Friends, Then Why Aren’t You Friendly? [article] Samuel Abram: Frankly, I await the day @Mike Masnick has a podcast episode with Evan Greer. She’d be a great guest, as she shares a lot of the same views with Mike! I really liked the episode he did with Alex Winter. I feared his YouTube Effect movie was going to be like the Social Dilemma, but now I want to see it after his interview with Mike! It’s pretty cool how the actors who played Bill & Ted are pretty cool people IRL. Mike Masnick: alex is great. very thoughtful bode000: interesting. sounds like they're basically just repackaging and live streaming the existing CNN international feed, which features some of the traditional CNN broadcast BentFranklin: This has to be a reverse marketing ploy. No one's this dumb. [article] Oops I'm spreading it Mike Masnick: @Tim Cushing has a post already written on that, which will go up tomorrow mildconcern: Does @Tim Cushing ever get worried that cops will stop doing stupid things and deprive him of a beat? Also I want an award for being able to type that with a straight face. John Roddy: He's too busy with his packed schedule as a law professor. candescence: [article] I do wish the article listed the actual roadmap though Mike Masnick: I have a post on it coming later today that will have more details mildconcern: Killing a program 2 months before anyone can benefit from the renewal hardware feels like a new horizon for the Googlesassination of programs: [article] There also should be a special place in hell reserved for services that do involuntary 2FA and don't allow you to choose the method.

Don't they keep shutting down the pixel line? Mike Masnick: no, pixel phone is a big deal for google these days Samuel Abram: @Mike Masnick Relevant to our interests: [article] You even get a shout-out there, among many other authors Mike Masnick: heh. yeah, i saw that yesterday and thought it was amusing that i was listed with those other names Samuel Abram: BTW, I got an advocacy email saying \"Tell Merrick Garland to prosecute the Oil Companies under RICO\". I threw that email into the trash. [gifv] Also, there's a good chance I'm going to get $$$ from bandcamp friday candescence: The most striking thing about the Australian government's response is that two of the three criteria for age verification to be viable is that it cannot be circumvented and must apply to sites universally, not just sites hosted in Australia The problem is, I'm pretty sure both of these criteria are virtually impossible The circumvention part is one thing due to VPNs, but the latter, well... You'd need _every country in the world_ to agree on forcing age verification John Roddy: The order in the Texas case does a wonderful job explaining how almost anything else is so obviously better I read through it earlier, and it is really friggin good Also, I've brought up Acerthorn a few times before. The guy who kept trying to sue for copyright infringement in CAND, including against Google.

You might see a whole community spring up over it. It&#x27;s potentially a huge market ranging from teenagers to retirees.

This feels simple because he already has everything planned very well and it&#x27;s a year long endeavour compactified into short youtube videos. reply seabird 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see why 3D design software and getting parts fabricated (if you don&#x27;t have the equipment to do it yourself) is all that inaccessible. It may cost more than getting into computer software, but just about everything is.

I&#x27;ve never really used YT for anything other than one off videos, and only recently started trying to watch some content in a more consumerist manner. I&#x27;m not liking it at all, and wonder why people put up with it, and don&#x27;t just stop like I&#x27;m already considering reply serf 15 hours agoparentprevIt would be great, but personally I think that modern chain-of-liability concerns would probably make the premise very difficult to work out.An EV burns down. The chassis maker points its fingers at what they claim were low quality electronics used, the electronics manufacturer points its fingers at the sharp edges left on the chassis that could create chafe points.Technical interoperability too aside from standards; in a collision it&#x27;s difficult to model&#x2F;simulate&#x2F;test a car that may have 20 different motor options, placement options, dozens of batteries, etc. They&#x27;ll all fail differently, how do we regulate that kind of safety? I&#x27;d love for it to work. reply kibwen 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s already legal in the US to build your own car from scratch. There are certain minimum safety requirements (headlights, windshields, seatbelts, bumpers), but less than you may think (e.g. doors are not required, the steering wheel doesn&#x27;t have to be on the left). The NHTSA isn&#x27;t going to ask you to prove your car&#x27;s crash-safety, all you need to do is pass inspection in your state. reply pixl97 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s legal to build it, but at least in Texas it&#x27;s not legal to drive it on the highway as you won&#x27;t be able to get registration.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.txdmv.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;txdot-info&#x2F;vtr&#x2F;title_manual_book_4...>On page 376, under &#x27;Eligibility for Title&#x27; it says \"Homemade vehicles are not eligible for title or registration.

I have family that works at the registration office and needless to say there are a lot of people with custom vehicles that are surprised replyextraduder_ire 19 hours agoparentprevWould be nice, but the economics would be kinda wack with how much of the cost is in the battery pack. Especially when companies like tesla put the same pack in all their cars and determine your \"capacity\" in software.I&#x27;d imagine that would either change, or people would start buying up the lowest-cost EVs just to pull the battery out of them (like \"shucking\" external drives) and resell all the other parts. reply softfalcon 16 hours agorootparentMy thought would be buying modular battery packs so you can start small, save some money, buy more, then just keep adding them in month-after-month.Start with 50 km range at beginning, end up with 500 km range by the end of the year.Would also enforce positive replacement and recycling procedures by creating a standard modular power unit.Arguably doable, but I doubt any manufacturer or EV will ever tolerate such easy mod-ability or repair-ability. They live to destroy any attempts by the consumer knowing how to service their own property. reply giobox 13 hours agorootparentprev> Especially when companies like tesla put the same pack in all their cars and determine your \"capacity\" in software.This is an enormously exaggerated statement, bordering on entirely false. Yes, the company has done this from time to time, including on some current Model S&#x2F;X models, but the vast, vast majority of Tesla cars sold (the 3&#x2F;Y) almost always have a different sized battery pack in reality, not just in software (~50kwh or ~75kwh - there is genuinely ~1&#x2F;3 less cells in the 50kwh cars almost always).The Model S&#x2F;X sell in very tiny volumes, relative to the 3&#x2F;Y too. There absolutely is not the same pack in \"all their cars\". Even the type of cells used varies between model packs, typically 2170&#x2F;4680 in the 3 or Y, 18650s in the S&#x2F;X. I think there are even some BYD blade batteries in some European Y variants, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with the German or China made cars. reply extraduder_ire 12 hours agorootparentGood to know.

In the USA, the manufacturers would probably be sued out of existence when someone got killed or maimed in one, no matter whose fault it was. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentYet, in aviation, we have the \"experimental, amateur built\" (or, E&#x2F;AB) category of homebuilt aircraft which is going strong and honestly I&#x27;d say that most of the technical innovation happening in light aircraft is happening in the E&#x2F;AB category. There are thousands of homebuilt kit aircraft safely flying in the sky above you right now.The difference, of course, is that for obvious reasons, aviation has developed a pervasive culture of safety and rigorous root-cause analysis whenever an accident happens, and deadly crashes frequently result in regulatory corrective action. If car accidents were as rare as aircraft accidents, the NTSB brought a team of investigators whenever one happened, and the results of that investigation led to stricter laws and enforcement, we&#x27;d probably be OK with kit cars, too.The sad truth about automotive is that crashes are so routine that police won&#x27;t even get out of bed unless there are injuries. And, there is basically no penalty for negligence that leads to a car \"accident\". It&#x27;s almost impossible in the USA to lose your driver&#x27;s license, even after dozens of repeated DUIs. Totally different cultures. reply tomcam 13 hours agorootparentI thought of that.

These kits need batteries and the best and cheapest batteries come out of wrecked teslas.

They did so because they thought they could build a profitable company. Tesla&#x27;s execs and shareholders are being compensated quite well already for their investment of money&#x2F;time&#x2F;work.

Why ought a society with pragmatic concerns ever concede those concerns based on a defective moral model where a party by doing some good somehow earns the right for society to somehow to put aside the needs of 338 million for the benefit of a dozen assholes in a boardroom.This is a privilege that in a decent society ought not be available at any price.It&#x27;s silly to say that they are under no obligation when what we are talking about with right to repair is literally whether we ought to create such an obligation.If you disagree you must explain why such an obligation is a net negative for the millions not the few.I await your argument to that effect. reply javajosh 19 hours agoprevRather than us fighting for the right to repair, shouldn&#x27;t manufacturers be fighting for the right to limit our ability to repair? Isn&#x27;t \"right to repair\" the default state? The right to repair, modify, disassemble, recombine your own property is a key component of capitalism, is it not? reply SenAnder 19 hours agoparentIn addition to all the legal restrictions on \"reverse engineering\" (i.e. examining how stuff works) and circumventing DRM, as technology advances, using technical means to restrict otherwise legal end-user activities is becoming a big problem.That you&#x27;re legally allowed to repair your tractor doesn&#x27;t help much if the on-board secure TPM chip flags your replacement parts as counterfeit, locks the engine, and reports you to the manufacturer so they refuse to sell you parts in the future. reply MostlyStable 17 hours agorootparentThis is something I&#x27;ve wondered about. For cars there is a bunch of regulatory stuff that might preven you from doing this, but I believe the regulatory burden on tractors is much less. Why has no one just built a full on control system swap for tractors? Yeah, the OEM control board won&#x27;t recognize your replacement part. Or it won&#x27;t tell you whats actually wrong. Etc. Etc. But if you just replace it with an entirely OSS control system, that problem goes away.I know that this probably not a trivial task, but, given the amount of money at stake, it feels worthwhile, but maybe I&#x27;m just underestimating the degree of integration of the current control system into the parts. If everything down the internal engine sensors is running priprietary, encrypted software and you basically have to tear it down and replace every single electronic component on the tractor, then yeah it probably won&#x27;t ever make sense. reply argiopetech 10 hours agorootparentThe software is the value proposition of modern equipment. Making a tractor is comparatively easy - we&#x27;ve been making them since the age of steam. Making a tractor with all the features of a day cab tractor truck, plus EPA compliant engine management through a host of proprietary systems, plus the systems and sensors needed for self-driving... Very non-trivial to replace. reply chmod600 15 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like a fun project if you are a bitcoin millionaire that moved to a ranch. Rip the components out and try to re-engineer all of the control systems.Given the number of sensors, it could also be a great way to collect open data for farming innovation, environmental data, etc. reply forinti 19 hours agoparentprevManufacturers make things difficult to repair, use nonstandard components and tools that you can&#x27;t get from a third party, they glue things together in such a way that you have to have break it to get inside, they take away your warranty if you do anything they don´t want you to do, and so on.This dispute is all about not letting manufacturers use such tactics. I see it also as an ecological issue, because unrepairable and upgradeable stuff means more garbage. reply praptak 19 hours agoparentprevWe found out that this is no longer the case since hardware can contain software which just prevents the \"owner\" from replacing a part. On top of this manufacturers abuse copyright laws to prevent \"owners\" from tinkering with said software.That&#x27;s why we need specific laws to protect the freedom which should be the default. reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparentNo, I think there&#x27;s a point here.Part of the solution isn&#x27;t just laws that require something to be reparable, but getting rid of the laws that constrain it. DMCA 1201 is used for this more than it&#x27;s used for its ostensible purpose, and should have a general purpose exemption for any case where the circumvention or tool is necessary for any reason other than actual non-fair use copyright infringement. reply softfalcon 16 hours agoparentprevHave a look at Louis Rossmann’s car repair videos.There is a war going on between government and car manufacturers because they succeeded in side stepping most of the right to repair requirements.Currently, most new car’s OBD2 ports are somewhat useless because they now use a proprietary wireless communicator to transmit error codes. Apparently, the old right to repair laws didn’t say anything about “wireless communication” so they took the loophole and ran with it.The days of buying a reasonably affordable scanner and diagnosing and repairing your own vehicle are over. We’re back to square one of forcing them to give us right to repair again. It’s actually really really bad. reply creeble 15 hours agorootparentI think new cars are still required to report engine codes (ones that cause the CEL to trigger) on the OBD port. That’s still a large percentage of engine problems, and in particular, the ones that prevent you from getting registration renewed in many US states. reply softfalcon 13 hours agorootparentThere are now Audi, Peugot, and Volvo vehicles sold in the US that don’t have an OBD port. You can’t pull an engine code from a port that doesn’t exist on the vehicle.Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet are also rumoured to be removing the OBD2 port with their 2025 line-up. They’re just testing how much they can get away with before committing to it.It’s going to become very hard to repair or even diagnose our vehicles if we don’t start fighting back. reply circuit10 19 hours agoparentprevRight to repair is about making sure manufacturers can’t intentionally block repair. Also there have been some cases of people getting into legal trouble for doing things like using aftermarket (“counterfeit”) parts, I remember hearing about a repair shop having to destroy iPhone screens reply arlort 16 hours agoparentprev> Isn&#x27;t \"right to repair\" the default state?There&#x27;s no such thing as a default state, only status quo.And the status quo is that right to repair is not really a thing all that much reply MoreSEMI 19 hours agoparentprevAgree, the language is problematic. But unfortunately companies sometimes use the law to take away that right. Additionally, right to repair sometimes means going beyond the default state and requiring companies to go the extra mile, so that is where the langauge may also stem from. reply YeBanKo 16 hours agoparentprevWould you support a ballot measure(if this is an option in your jurisdiction) that enacts a strong right to repair?

If you use the latter, “right to repair” becomes a reasonable-sounding term for a concept that’s not quite as reasonable. reply avar 2 hours agorootparentThe latter is already the case in some jurisdiction, and it&#x27;s quite reasonable.You can&#x27;t just declare that any modification of the product voids the warranty, you need to show that the consumer&#x27;s modification caused the warranty claim.E.g. you won&#x27;t get anywhere claiming that replacing the car seats caused the engine to lock up.You can already intentionally ruin your seats, or use olive oil for your engine.

To explain the semantic ambiguity in my head, I find that ICE vehicles needing a jump often have a voltage so low (or that the battery pack or donor vehicle I&#x27;m using is anemic enough) that they need to be charged the same way, or the dead battery disconnected to allow the other battery to turn the starter motor. reply shkkmo 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s being unnecessarily nitpicky.

Might be a trick to make it so that the generator could supply more energy than is consumed per minute. reply WaxProlix 18 hours agorootparentprevAerodynamics are at least as bad as weight when it comes to trailers iirc. And there are at least leisure trailers that come with battery packs in them. The Lightship and Boulder come to mind for instance. I suspect it&#x27;s a matter of time for more utility trailers, if it&#x27;s not already a thing. Batteries are expensive though. reply raisedbyninjas 18 hours agorootparentprevI wish there was some standard to add short term battery capacity for EVs and PHEVs. An e-scooter battery can get most EVs 5 miles down the road. A standardized battery pack and wiring harness in the trunk could allow roadside assistance to get you unstrained or rent a bigger pack for road trips.I&#x27;m sure OEMs don&#x27;t want to warranty 3rd party equipment connecting to their vehicles and making charge&#x2F;discharge, cooling, securing heavy packs, etc. reliable. reply bonestamp2 18 hours agorootparentprevTesla has talked about that. The main issue with swappable batteries is that the whole battery has to be accessible from the bottom or side of the car. This provides design constraints on battery size. Most automakers don&#x27;t want to compromise on battery size, they want to pack as much battery as possible in the space that&#x27;s available.The next biggest issue with swappable batteries is responsibility. If all of the batteries are shared, who pays for a new battery when a battery reaches its end of life? This problem will have to be solved at some point anyway since nobody likes paying $15K+ when their vehicle battery reaches end of life. It would make much more sense to amortize this cost over the life of the vehicle. It would be easy to do that with higher fees of battery swaps, but people don&#x27;t normally like higher upfront costs even if it works out to the same in the end. reply rnk 18 hours agorootparentprevswapping been done and shipped on production vehicles that are still around. The original tesla model s had this capability. Tesla had a working station in california, it took a couple of minutes to do the swap.

Pfft. The stupid car, got stuck with AC stuck on full heat, with a blacked out screen. Unresponsive to resets. I couldn&#x27;t even open the damm frunk to remove the fuses, yeah okay I don&#x27;t carry a 12v battery around with me to jump the frunk.(how difficult is it to give damm manual overrides for critical stuff) It was a rental so no access to Tesla app. Tesla Customer service refused to help, since it&#x27;s a rentalTesla is a smart phone with wheels that can&#x27;t make calls. It&#x27;s great while it works but it is as dangerous as it can be once things go wrong. This car must be banned. It scarred me enough to keep me away from other EVs too which put all the controls in a screen. There is no excuse for EVs to have everything electrically controlled. reply rnk 17 hours agorootparentI agree these situations can be dangerous and frustrating. There is a manual trunk release on the tesla, here&#x27;s a video https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b1bJ0F3R0Nc.I have a rivian and the 12v battery died on it while I had it plugged in charging at home. In the manual I found the emergency trunk release (access from underneath the car), and then there was a manual release for the charging port inside the frunk.My gas cars have died with some electrical problem before, out in the boonies where there was no one to help.

I ran into that in Toyota hybrid. Why there&#x27;s no manual override that enables charging of 12V battery? It could be under the hood and turn off automatically when the voltage in 12V battery is high enough. reply rnk 17 hours agorootparentThis same problem happens in evs where due to some problem the 12v discharges. When everything is working the 12v is charged up from the main battery bank.Tesla in the early days sometimes ran down the 12v and it wasn&#x27;t that uncommon, there were problems with runs of batteries yielding poor ones; I think they had messed up software that wasn&#x27;t charging the 12v enough, but they made changes to address that long ago. On my second ev, a rivian, I just had to have my 12 battery replaced. They said sometimes the 12v batteries just die on them. reply sgerenser 17 hours agorootparentprevSome Hyundai hybrids and PHEVs have this (I saw it in the original Ioniq). It&#x27;s a button you press that temporarily charges the 12V battery through the high-voltage system rather than being always enabled, but it seems like a great idea. reply giancarlostoro 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you need to jump start an EV you need to charge it basically. I cant think of a case where it would be needed with an otherwise filled battery. reply raisedbyninjas 18 hours agorootparentI just learned that my ICE vehicle can drain the 12v battery overnight if it fails to turn off the accessories circuit. No lights or infotainment etc. were left on. In my case, it was the switch on the park gear flaked out. I imagine a variety of similar faults could cause the same issue in an EV. reply cj 16 hours agorootparentReminds me of renting a zipcar for a few days and parking it in an underground parking lot.When I went to use the car after a couple days, the battery was drained. This happened on multiple occasions with different vehicles parked in the same garage.My best guess is Zipcar has cellular comms to phone home, which enter some weird “always trying to connect” state when cut off from cellular signal underground.Zipcar’s response was to ban me from renting on their platform ever again for too many disabled vehicles. reply zerocrates 18 hours agorootparentprevMy car (a hybrid) has a long-standing bug in the radio system that can make it \"freeze\" and stay on forever. Only way out once it&#x27;s frozen is to pull the right fuse (or wait for it to drain your battery all the way). replyesjeon 17 hours agoparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s just a tiny compatibility issue, but it&#x27;s really a bummer that you&#x27;re sitting on enough electricity to power a house for days and can&#x27;t even jump a car.

Jumping a 12v lead acid battery with 48v is a fantastic way to completely fry the ICE vehicle. reply masklinn 18 hours agorootparentAFAIK Teslas use 12V like everyone else, do you have a source for 48V?However EVs (and hybrids) do tend to have pretty small 12V batteries and I think some of them have switched off of lead-acid: they only need the 12V to boot up the electronics, not to power a starter engine. reply diebeforei485 17 hours agorootparentprevTesla has future plans for 48V, but they&#x27;re still on 12V today. reply 1970-01-01 8 hours agorootparentSorry, it&#x27;s 16v (15.5v) 48v is coming later this year. reply photochemsyn 18 hours agoprevRepairability is like online security: if companies really cared about it, they&#x27;d have built it into the product beginning at the design stage. With most products these days, repairability is actively discouraged at many different levels: components are inaccessible, soldered or glued on, specifications are unavailable, replacement parts are not sold direct to the public, etc. This is all done to shorten product lifetimes such that consumers have to purchase new products more frequently, that&#x27;s clear enough.Some companies might realize that there&#x27;s a market for repairable products and shift tactics, there seem to be a few out there, though not many. reply Transpire7487 19 hours agoprev [–] No normal person can repair a Tesla, it’s basically a trade secret. My brother is a mechanic and servicing Teslas are a non starter due to the complexity. The notion that I can just download a manual, buy some parts and DIY my own repairs is absolutey ludicrous.The only reason for Tesla to support right to repair is to increase regulatory burden on competitors, stunt innovation and raise costs for their competition. Shame on this anticompetitive behaviour. reply morphle 18 hours agoparentI do not agree. The parts of the mechanical drivetrain or the molded plastics can be impossible to obtain before a large number of Teslas have been scrapped and sold for parts. But the battery and electronics can be understood and repaired without schematics. The software reverse engineering is possible. I agree that repairs can be far to time-consuming to be economically viable, but given free labour it can be done. reply omgJustTest 19 hours agoparentprevNo normal person can cast an ICE header.Same logic. reply esjeon 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not the best example unfortunately. People do build custom headers by cutting and welding various pipes using off-the-shelf tools. Welp, ICE is an old tech (from 18c), so it doesn&#x27;t take dark magic to fix a whole ICE car mechanically. The real deal breaker is electric controllers w&#x2F; proprietary software. reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s assuming you need the controller to do the exact same thing in the exact same way as the OEM one. But in many cases people are replacing it because they want it to do something different anyway.And these functions are in many cases quite simple. You replace the controller for the door locks. It operates a solenoid that locks and unlocks the doors. Maybe they no longer function by calling the call center to have them unlock your car, but maybe you don&#x27;t want that anyway. They still function if you press a button on your key fob. reply rnk 17 hours agoparentprevThere are a very few private tesla repair garages that do know how to repair some things. They seem to be run by former tesla repairmen. They have been able to salvage a lot of dead cars. They seem to be mostly in california. reply api 18 hours agoparentprevEVs could be a gigantic step down in complexity but that doesn’t benefit their manufacturers. It would risk making them a commodity that can be assembled from parts like an old school PC.Instead the industry is looking at the EV transition as a way to increase costs and decrease customer freedom. This is absolutely artificial and in no way mandated by the technology.A similar case in computing is what happened with mobile and tablets where a change in form factor allowed lock down to be smuggled in without people asking too many questions. A Mac is now a big overgrown tablet in terms of its CPU and innards but you can install your own OS on a Mac but not an iPad. Why? No technical reason at all.Right to repair is good but it’s actually less than what we need. We need a huge rebirth of DIY technology and less centralized supplier ecosystems. This may require some regulation but it also requires consumers to stop being so passive and prioritizing shininess and laziness over every single other thing. The “millennial minimalism” era needs to end both as an aesthetic and a framework for consumer-producer relations. (The two are related.) reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparent> EVs could be a gigantic step down in complexity but that doesn’t benefit their manufacturers. It would risk making them a commodity that can be assembled from parts like an old school PC.But the step down in complexity also makes it easier to become a manufacturer, and as battery costs come down this is likely to happen.At which point a startup with no other way to distinguish themselves can start selling highly repairable electric cars. Customers figure out that these have a lower ownership cost (whether or not they do the repairs themselves) and start preferring them. The incumbents then follow suit or lose the market.The main reason this doesn&#x27;t happen for phones is that the market is so consolidated. The main SoCs are made by only a small handful of companies who don&#x27;t publish documentation, and producing a competitive one is capital-intensive because of the constraints of the form factor. But even there it may not be permanent -- what&#x27;s going to happen to phones once there is a fully-documented RISC-V SoC on the market that has tolerable performance and power consumption? reply morphle 18 hours agorootparentprevWhen we transition to 4WD in-wheel motors the drivetrain and the moving parts could become standard. The inverters could become programmable. We designed programmable networks of per-battery-cell (dis)charger computers that would take the danger out of clusters of battery cells of unequal batteries. When each battery is wired in parallel, not in series not only can you go from 800 charge cycles to 20000 cycles (lifetime nearly 50 years) but you would eliminate fires and prevent short circuits in the power networks. It would thus be possible to build cars completely from standard parts. Mind you, not a single company has tried this yet, but there is no economical or theoretical impediment to build from off-the-shelf components in the next two decades. EV car kits will be poossible and probably cheaper. After an amateur has build one, for example the Dutch Government RDW would test the car for safety for less than a thousand Euro&#x27;s, like they already do for car, truck and camper conversions. I remember an Scientific American article in the 90&#x27;s predicting single mechanic African custom EVs as a future possibility. reply api 18 hours agorootparentWe need a Framework for EVs perhaps to get this going.The EV I want is a simple super reliable easily repairable one.I personally went for the Nissan Leaf in lieu of this because it’s basically a Nissan Versa with a motor and batteries where the engine and gas tank go. Not good for road trips but a nice city car and decently repairable. (I have an older ICE for road trips that I don’t drive much otherwise.) reply B1FF_PSUVM 18 hours agoparentprev> No normal person can repairNo, it takes two.Seriously, I&#x27;ve read that some EV makers require that two persons be present when working on the HV system, the second one on watch with a pull-up hook in case the first one seizes up touching some 400 or 800 V DC part. reply brandonagr2 12 hours agoparentprev [–] Go to service.tesla.com, login with a free account, you can access all repair information and service manuals for free.

    "originBody": "Cat Hicks 8 minutes ago 5 min read On Craft My grandpa -- my Missouri grandpa, who played slide guitar to me when I got homesick on the rare occasions I stayed with them -- grew up on a farm without electricity. He went past eighth grade, which really mattered to him. He loved that I played harp, which he always called \"elegant,\" in an extremely Missouri accent, an accent that hugged every syllable. Since living in California, I never hear this way of speaking. Recently I heard his accent on TV and cried unexpectedly, ugly crying, startling my wife. Grandpa loved craft. He didn't put it that way but other people did. My dad said grandpa was a craftsman. I didn’t understand what this meant until one day when we were visiting. We sat down at a restaurant table and it wobbled. We ignored it. But Grandpa dropped as quickly and efficiently as a seal, vanishing underneath the table to fix the cheap, badly-screwed leg with a coin for a screwdriver. He fixed things often and silently. Grandpa just cared about things working. He had an instinct for not just broken things but soon to be broken things. He would point out risky work, bad decision making in the form of shoddy materials or shifting angles. He was offended by the trace measures left in the world that signified short-term planning. So I learned that this too had something to do with craft. He had a visual vocabulary that amazed me. I think about how he could see these details. He saw choices and constraints and tensions and frictions where I just saw chairs. He saw effort where most people just saw end products. This extended past the built world. Grandpa could also recognize trees at remarkable distances: beech, birch, maple, oak. He could tell if they were growing healthy. He could tell if they were growing sick. He told me: “it’s when they just don’t look happy.” Because it was such a stark contrast to his immediate understanding of nature and the charm of woodwork and craft, I was also amazed to learn when I was older that my grandpa had come home from war to land in work that was brutal, defined almost entirely by its output. He worked in a bag factory, eventually managing the people on the floor. It was full of assembly lines and equipment that were collectively quite dangerous. The factory employed people whom other people often treated as dangerous. They were hard jobs and it was very hard work. My grandpa was a very musical person, with an ear for rhythm, which is probably why he loved that I played harp. In the factory, he told me he used to frequently stop people from trying to work faster or differently because it would cause a ruckus, a ripple effect, a mess, he said. It took me a long time to read between the lines and realize that in my grandpa’s world back then, a disruption to the assembly line rhythms got somebody killed. So he kept everyone on cadence, rather than simply pursuing speed. Grandpa told a story about walking home late and realizing he was being followed by one of the men who worked under him in the factory. At the time, many other people with jobs like his carried weapons. My grandpa made a point not to. The possibility of violence hung behind all of them; it was not unheard of at factories like this to have a fight that could turn into a riot, or an accident that could turn deadly. But my grandpa saw the soon to be broken behind that too, and he refused it. I remember how much he liked to trust people, fix things around people. And so he just had his hands in empty pockets walking home that night. He thought: maybe this is it. He walked faster. The man behind him walked faster. And then the man caught up with my grandpa and said: ”I thought I’d walk you home. It can be dangerous around here.” It is easy to remember my grandpa mostly for where I saw him, a porch in Missouri playing guitar, fixing things around the house, long walks in the forest. It is more difficult to think about the habits of mind that must have trained him to see many types of brokenness. He lived 196 consecutive days in combat in WWII. I never saw him ever choose to weaponize something that he could see or do that other people couldn't. I think about him when I think about craft. I think the way some people talk about craft in software engineering is often weaponized. Some developers, some software teams, some software leaders, even ones I really learn from and think are closer to caring about the things that I also care about -- their demand to be revered for craft quickly reveals that they think it isn't for everyone to get to be a craftsperson. I have read a lot of long spiels about craft that frequently end in something like, software work isn’t like other work, and we shouldn’t be judged the same way. We are entirely unique. We are the special ones. I find this both saddening and unconvincing. I think that all labor is skilled labor. I think about the factories and the fields and the ways that demands for speed instead of cadence can hurt people. I think we should seek to understand and value our skills and see effort. But I don’t think we are going to fix anything about how software work is valued by refusing to let it belong to the rest of the world. Early in my career I contracted at a tech place where there was a makerspace that software engineers got automatic access to, but my badge didn’t work on the door. I remember standing at the window looking at the recreational machines of the makerspace and thinking about my own life, my grandpa handing me down our blue collar craft. I’ve fixed electric fences and I learned to drive on a riding lawn mower and I used to sew in a costume shop to be able to buy dinner, walking away from machines with blood on my fingers, because sewing may be much more gendered than a factory but it is really, really hard manual labor. I can identify so many trees. And they didn’t badge people who weren’t software engineers into the makerspace and someone told me well the engineers are the builders aren't they. I wanted to say: do you know what it is like to make your whole life? How dare you. There is this thing I guess for me here, craft as communication and collaboration and creation, versus craft as weapon. Craft as fixing a table for everyone who will sit at it later versus craft as judging whose work gets to be seen as authentic and skilled. Sometimes when I’m wrangling with trying to put words to something about teams and workplaces and making them better, I wish that I could talk to my grandpa about it. I wish I could hear that accent that I’ve never heard at a tech company. I can’t remember ever seeing him use a computer, I’m not sure he really knew what software was. I don’t think that would have mattered. He treated people that other people called dangerous with dignity and because of that he kept everyone safer together–so he would get it. He is not here to see me have this career but he loved that I went into psychology. He thought it was elegant work. I think about my grandpa going from his beautiful outdoor childhood in nature to war to a dangerous factory. But he made a craft out of it anyway. He loved the trees, but he taught himself to listen to the machines. And he extended the possibility of better to the people, because that was what the world needed and that was the ecosystem he had around him to build something in. So that is what I think of as craft. HOME ABOUT ME BLOG CONSULTING WRITING 📈drcathicks.com",

We are entirely unique. We are the special ones.It might comfort the author to know that even within the realm of software engineering, there are insiders and outsiders. Some of the most important engineering work was made by these outsiders.Growing up poor, self-taught, as the only programmer I knew around me, I felt like an outsider my entire life. When I finally began to associate with other programmers... I still felt like an outsider.Here were people from structured family units with solid life skills, a college education, large support networks, a lack of systemic trauma, and a fundamentally different understanding of the world. I&#x27;ve begun to find my place in this world, but the feeling of being an outsider will never fully go away.It&#x27;s of little coincidence that my favorite kinds of music and other art are often categorized as Outsider Art.My advice... find a way into that makerspace. Open up a REPL. Software engineering might entail a specific rigid and deep understanding of engineering principles, but software craftsmanship is for everyone. Personal computers were made for the average person to enhance themselves and the world around them, and we should never forget that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Outsider_art reply avg_dev 11 hours agoparenti remember my third year of coding as a pro, i had just taken a job in palo alto and was settling in after moving. i was at my new job and a bunch of the coders at the company i was working at went out for lunch and i was getting to know them.one guy who was younger than i was was talking about how he had a degree from a liberal arts college, and had just been coding on his own for a while, and that when he moved out there for work and was interacting with other coders in real-life for the first time (previously it had been only over the internet) he was learning how to pronounce the names of various daemons, libraries, projects, etc., and that he had understood the pronunciations differently when he was physically on his own. in my head i silently said to myself, \"this guy is a junior coder and won&#x27;t amount to too much\" and made a note to try to associate with some of the heavy hitters to try and boost my career and status (and i guess if i&#x27;m being charitable to myself, also to learn).that guy left the company maybe a year later. the company he went to, i think he started as a dev, later became CTO, and eventually CEO. while he was CEO, the company sold for over a billion dollars. and even when we were still working together, i did learn quite a few things from him. so yeah, i think it is easy for people to pigeonhole others, or to think that they are in a place of skill that others perhaps can&#x27;t easily get to, but sometimes that kind of thinking is quite wrong. (also, at his new company he wrote some great blog posts on software development and operations practices that i really enjoyed and learned quite a bit from) reply epolanski 11 hours agorootparentI had some similar experiences with few self taught junior devs.I didn&#x27;t look down on them, but was heavily surprised to see how much they could teach me about software or work or life. reply LanternLight83 14 hours agoparentprevAs a self-taught programmer and resident of a town well under 20k pop (most of whom are well out of my age group), i really identify with this. it&#x27;s helped a bit to learn deeply and engage with others who have done so, and in some ways is an extension of a broader void in my network (or lack there-of). it&#x27;t influenced the tochnologies i&#x27;ve chosen and hence made me who i am today, but i hope the \"zoom-native\" generations broadly engage more in open online spaces and feel less of this reply 0x6461188A 6 hours agoprevWhile this is a touching story, the moral lesson from her grandpa fixing the restaurant table deserves some introspection.I have been in engineering situations where it is tempting to fix the loose table leg. The problem is that unless I go in every month and fix it I might be making things worse. What we need instead is a process that solves the problem permanently.Moreover, it is likely the sitaution is much worse than it appears on the surface. The loose leg is a symptom of deeper malaise. It is likely the kitchen is dirty as well. The leg might be the canary in the mine. In fact the whole organization might be rotten to the core.The real solution is to buy out the restaurant, fire the management, institute better processes, and then to create a culture that values the longer-term view.The other approach is to do nothing. Leave the table wobbly to signal to other patrons to take their business elsewhere. The restaurant is on its last legs as a viable enterprise. Best to let economic forces shut it down quickly and without ceremony. Then it can be replaced by something with more solid foundations and firmer legs. reply riwsky 4 hours agoparentDid the part about not weaponizing craft just, like, not render in your browser, or something? reply Fluorescence 19 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t like this much - somewhat vague romantic sentimentalism under a heading of \"craft\".I don&#x27;t consider recognising trees as craft... or ride-on mowers as blue-collar... or being afraid of someone on the street at night as recognising the \"soon to be broken\"... or that \"cadence\" is a safety measure. It&#x27;s often the reverse, cadence suggests not stopping when safety&#x2F;quality is often about anyone being able to stop the line.As for the \"family fixer\"... I&#x27;ve known a few and the motivation has not been craft but as an emotional escape. Sit down and talk to your family? Nope, time to rehang all the pictures on the wall. I can recognise their panicked scan of their environment, desperately looking for something that could need attention. I think we often see \"craft\" type justifications for unnecessary work in software teams that are really avoidance of something more aversive.Where I find the \"fixer\" perspective interesting, it&#x27;s understanding that the world is mutable and that you have the power to change it. It&#x27;s a more natural human instinct to accept things that are causing a problem. It&#x27;s not even lazinesses holding people back, it&#x27;s not seeing the possibilities. reply yuvalr1 13 hours agoparentI think we&#x27;re too used to just replace things instead of fixing them. Fixing requires understanding of how things work, and I think it&#x27;s a shame most of us (I include myself) don&#x27;t have enough of this understanding regarding our day to day tools and objects. If fixing something requires calling an expert, it makes it much less appealing to fix it, than just throw it away and buy something new.This relatively new attitude creates motivation to even further divest in quality and prefer creating cheap things that break fast, because we won&#x27;t invest the time and money needed to fix them anyway. reply dfee 11 hours agoparentprevI concluded that the author is an outsider (to craftsmanship) looking through the glass at an accessible insider (grandfather).Whether the grandfather was, or would consider himself to be an insider, we can’t glean and don’t know, respectively.It’s a sort of longing piece, and that’s OK, but not what I expected going into it! reply rcme 17 hours agoparentprevFixing the loose leg of a table at a restaurant using a coin is definitely not craft. reply ChrisMarshallNY 19 hours agoprevI can relate to her grandpa.However, it doesn&#x27;t win me much support, these days.People like us aren&#x27;t really what the tech industry is about. I&#x27;m not sure that it ever was about it (which was why I didn&#x27;t append \"any more\").There was a fairly decent book, called Software Craftsmanship[0], that I read, many moons ago. I found it comforting. At least I wasn&#x27;t a complete outlier, even if I was routinely treated with scorn for my approach.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software_craftsmanship reply prerok 15 hours agoparent> routinely treated with scorn for my approachSeriously? I feel for you.In my experience many companies do recognize tech debt now, and the value in fixing it or implementing it the right way, although that was not so much the case in early 2000s.That said, many times we do still have to argue for time to refactor vs adding new features.I think that the best software craftsman is the one that can quickly add features without accumulating tech debt and the best way to do that is to just fix&#x2F;refactor the other stuff around the feature addition immediately. It seems like the OP&#x27;s grandpa was that kind of person.Speaking for myself, I sometimes do take longer because I want to get it right, even if it does mean missing an internal deadline. It has to have the right \"smell\". I have learned that if we don&#x27;t do that then, as cruft accumulates, 3am production incidents will be inevitable.So, do take this to heart: if others did not understand it, it does not matter. You have already benefited from your approach :) reply ChrisMarshallNY 15 hours agorootparentYeah, I&#x27;m not a subscriber to the \"YOLO&#x2F;MVP\" school of software development, which basically makes me persona non grata in many tech crowds.When I write software, I use what I call \"Constant Beta.\" Basically, my software is at a release level of Quality, from the very start. It may be incomplete (thus, unshippable), but what&#x27;s there, is ready for its closeup (Mr. DeMille).Basically, before moving to the next feature, I make sure the one I&#x27;m working on, is complete. It may require coming back, after other parts of the program are done, but I always make sure that the API is clear, the documentation is done, and things like error handling and localization are in place, as early as possible.Surprisingly, I work very, very quickly, despite taking so much care. There&#x27;s a number of reasons, which would require a series of blog posts, but the results speak for themselves. reply yuvalr1 13 hours agoprevThis article reminds me of my grandfather as well, who sadly passed away two weeks ago. He was a mechanical engineer, and a real craftsman.One example we, in our family, like to remember is how he fixed the car during a long vacation trip by his own when the engine suddenly stopped in the middle of the road. He realized the problem and used his constantly at hand pocketknife and a metal can box he found thrown on the sideways to fix the car. The mechanics had hard time to remove the fix in the garage and replace it with an original part! reply reneherse 6 hours agoparentSorry for your loss of your beloved grandfather.Sounds like our grandfathers might have gotten along; mine had much the same spirit and ingenuity you described. Hopefully some of that is passed on to us :) reply UncleOxidant 15 hours agoprevSounds like my grandfather of the same era. He wired up bomber control panels during WWII and was apparently quite skilled at it. He was a Jack of all trades, but he was primarily an electrician and a locksmith, though he did all kinds of tinkering in his garage and kept his ancient cars running. I stayed with my grandparents one summer when I was in Jr High. He took me out on electrician jobs where he&#x27;d have me fetch tools and wire. On one of them the inspector showed up and my grandpa introduced me to him. The inspector told me \"I can always tell when Mel has wired up a panel - it&#x27;s a work of art.\"People from that era had to endure a lot of hardship - the depression, WWII. They often grew up on farms. This gave them a lot of experience with fixing and growing things. All around useful skills that most of us don&#x27;t have anymore. reply AlbertCory 12 hours agoparentThe phrase \"shade tree mechanic\" was invented for people like that. reply killthebuddha 15 hours agoprevThe author&#x27;s grandpa reminds me of Sam Hamilton from East of Eden, someone who (though fictional, of course) I think about often when I think about the kind of man I&#x27;d like to be some day. A couple lines in particular jumped out at me:> He had a visual vocabulary that amazed me> do you know what it is like to make your whole life?These two lines together hint at a kind of connectedness with the world that I sometimes feel (and observe in certain cases) an acute lack of. I see it in myself and in many people I care about, but also in the archetypes generated by the culture&#x2F;society I&#x27;m embedded in. A lot of the time when I talk to people about this particular thing, they assume I&#x27;m being nostalgic, but I don&#x27;t think so. I think we don&#x27;t realize how many hard (as in \"hard science\") truths we really learn from casual observations of the wind and the stars and the trees. reply jschveibinz 19 hours agoprevVery nice remembrance of a grandfather.

Existing works usually train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. Code and scripts will be released later.

It&#x27;s one of the few tricks we use to scale the AI to code review even large PRs (100+ files).For each commit, we summarize diff for each file. Then, we create a summary of summaries, which is incrementally updated as further commits are made on a pull request. This summary of summaries is saved, hidden inside a comment on a pull request, and is used while reviewing each file and answering the user&#x27;s queries.Some of our code is in the open source. Here is the link to the relevant prompt for recursive summarization - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coderabbitai&#x2F;ai-pr-reviewer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src...[0]: coderabbit.ai reply Roark66 3 hours agoprev>Code and scripts will be released later.At this stage I&#x27;ll not believe a single claim without \"code and scripts\". It may be true, it may be bullshit. Who knows. Without a low effort way to replicate the experiments I consider this paper(and others like it) something written just so authors can put it in their CVs.I&#x27;ve been waiting for 6+ months for other \"code to be released later\" papers in this(LLMs) space and there is no indication it will ever be released. Some of these papers are so brazen to even include broken links that lead to parked domains.It&#x27;s time the community started recognising this behaviour. reply phire 3 hours agoparentYes, it&#x27;s a really simple idea that doesn&#x27;t require much code. Really shouldn&#x27;t be hard to clean it up and publish.I was actually playing with similar ideas a while back. I didn&#x27;t have any code at all, I was just experimenting with prompts directly in the API dashboard. The idea showed some promise, but it didn&#x27;t seem like the API cost would be worth it. I suspect you would be much better off with a vector embeddings approach. reply whimsicalism 16 hours agoprevTo my intuition, all of these ways of building memory in “text space” seem super hacky.It seems intuitive to me that memory would be best stored in dense embedding space that can preserve full semantic meaning for the model rather than as some hacked on process of continually regenerating summaries.And similarly, the model needs to be trained in a setting where it is aware of the memory and how to use it. Preferably that would be from the very beginning (ie. the train on text). reply nottheengineer 15 hours agoparentIt does seem hacky, but then again the whole concept of conversational LLMs is. You&#x27;re just asking it to add an extra word to a given conversation and after a bit, it spits out an end token that tells your application to hand control back to the user.I think latent space and text space aren&#x27;t as far apart as you think. LLMs are pretty stupid, but very good at speech. They are good at writing code because that&#x27;s very similar, but fall apart in things that need some actual abstract thinking, like math.Those text space hacks do tend to work and stuff like \"think step by step\" has become common because of that.LoRAs are closer to what you mean and they&#x27;re great at packing a lot of understanding into very little data. But adjusting weights for a single conversation just isn&#x27;t feasible yet, so we&#x27;re exploring text space for that purpose. Maybe someome will transfer the methods we discover in text space to embedding space to make them more efficient, but that&#x27;s for the future. reply og_kalu 14 hours agorootparent>They are good at writing code because that&#x27;s very similar, but fall apart in things that need some actual abstract thinking, like math.Pretty odd assertion. LLMs are not \"good at speech, bad at abstract thinking\".What do these have to do with speech ?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;general-pattern-machines.github.io&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2212.09196It doesn&#x27;t even hold with your example because GPT-4 is pretty good at Math, nowhere near \"falling apart\". reply nottheengineer 50 minutes agorootparentPattern reproduction is very close to speech in my opinion. Formal grammars even have it in the name and approaches like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37125118 show that LLMs are indeed very fit for that purpose.I think I have to walk that claim about math back and try to phrase what I meant differently: LLMs have a hard time with problems that don&#x27;t translate well into the text space, i.e. abstract problems. Math used to be one of those because early tokenizers were designed just with text in mind and LLMs weren&#x27;t good enough to overcome those limitations. OpenAI put in a lot of effort into their tokenizers to make GPT3.5 and GPT4 better at math specifically.The second paper you linked is very interesting and I think it supports my original assertion of text space and latent space being close. The first graph shows GPT3.5 doing much better at pattern reproduction and language tasks while humans still hold an advantage in the more abstract tasks like story analogies. Higher order relations being a key thing that&#x27;s measured maybe makes this task a bit too perfect for arguing my case, but it does show that humans have an advantage in more abstract situations.I think any problem that can be viewed as being mostly a form of translation is a good one for LLMs and if you can express a problem as that, you can get better results.To get back to the main point: latent space and text space, or feature space in general, being close is what I believe causes all of this. Happy to hear counterexamples. reply riku_iki 14 hours agorootparentprev> GPT-4 is pretty good at Math, nowhere near \"falling apart\".its good at tasks which were included into training dataset in some variations. reply Nevermark 13 hours agorootparentI have played around with GPT-4 and some fairly simple but completely new math ideas. It was fabulous at identifying special cases I overlooked, that disproved conjectures. reply sudokuist 13 hours agorootparentExample? reply Nevermark 13 hours agorootparentI was playing around with prime numbers, and simple made up relationships between them, such as between the square of a prime N vs. the set of primes smaller than N, etc.It caught me out with specific examples that violated my conjectures. In one case the conjecture held for all but one case, another conjecture was generally true but not for 2 and 3.In one case it thought a conjecture I made was wrong, and I had to push it to think through why it thought it was wrong until it realized the conjecture was right. As soon as it had its epiphany, it corrected all its logic around that concept.It was very simple stuff, but an interesting exercise.The part I enjoyed the most was seeing GPT-4&#x27;s understanding move and change as we pushed back on each other&#x27;s views. You miss out on that impressive aspect of GPT-4 in simpler sessions. reply riku_iki 12 hours agorootparentits hard to judge how deep and unique your conjectures were.I did similar testing of GPT4, and my observation is that it starts failing after 3-4 levels of reasoning depth. reply golol 2 hours agorootparentNice to see number of levels of reasoning depth mentioned. I personally believe the size of a (well-trained) LLM determines how many steps of reasoning in sequence it can approximate. Newer models get deeper and deeper, giving them deeper reasoning context windows. My hypothesis is that you don&#x27;t need infinite reasoning depth, just a bit more than GPT-4 has. I think once you can tie your output together with thinking in terms of ~10+ reasoning steps you&#x27;ll be very close to hunan performance. reply tux1968 10 hours agorootparentprev> failing after 3-4 levels of reasoning depth.That sounds more like an implementation or resource limitation, rather than an inherent limitation of the technique in general. reply riku_iki 9 hours agorootparentit is not obvious to me how you came to such conclusion.LLMs got lots of investments: 10s of billions of dollars and tons of compute, maybe more than any other tech in history, and can&#x27;t crack 3 steps reasoning. It sounds like tech limitation.. reply naasking 5 hours agorootparentNone of these systems or their training sets have been specifically tailored to tackle abstract reasoning or math, so that seems like a premature conclusion. The fact that they&#x27;re decent at programming despite that is interesting. reply sudokuist 13 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried formalizing your ideas with Isabelle? It has a constraint solver and will often find counterexamples to false arithmetical propositions[1].1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isabelle.in.tum.de&#x2F;overview.html reply mannykannot 11 hours agorootparentI have not been able to figure out how that would help in the context of this discussion. As I see it, what’s very interesting here is that an LLM is able to do this. reply riku_iki 11 hours agorootparentI think the point is that LLM is not right tool for deep reasoning, and isabelle and others are much better such tools, even community trying to apply LLM in this area following current wave of hype. reply riku_iki 12 hours agorootparentprevcurious why you referred specifically on isabelle, which looks ancient and over engineered, there are many other tools and langs in this area.I am not criticizing, but curious about your opinion. reply c-cube 5 hours agorootparentIsabelle is good at counter examples in ways few other proof assistants are. In general its automation is excellent, partly because it uses a less powerful logic (HOL instead of CIC; more expressive logics are harder to write automation for). It&#x27;s not obsolete. reply Nevermark 13 hours agorootparentprevI have not, thanks for the tip. replyPaulHoule 13 hours agorootparentprevKinda able to do some math tasks some of the time whereas you can use techniques from the arithmetic textbook to get the right answer all of the time with millions of times less CPU even including the overhead of round-tripping to ASCII numerals which is shockingly large compared to what a multiply costs.Kinda \"the problem\" with LLMS is that they successfully seduce people by seeming to get the right answer to anything 80% of the time. reply sdenton4 11 hours agorootparentThe arithmetic issues are well documented and understood; it&#x27;s a problem of sub-token manipulation, which has nothing to do with reasoning. (Similar to calling blind people unintelligent because they can&#x27;t read the iq test.)And the better llms can easily write code to do the attention that they suck at... reply bigyikes 3 hours agorootparentExcellent anology. LLMs are capable of many extraordinary things, and it’s a shame people dismiss them because they fail to live up to some specific test they invented. reply og_kalu 13 hours agorootparentprevMath is a lot more than just Arithmetic. reply PaulHoule 13 hours agorootparentYeah but if you can only do arithmetic right X% of the time you aren&#x27;t going to get other answers right as often as would really be useful.That said, LLMs have a magic ability to \"short circuit\" and get the right answer despite not being able to get the steps right. I remember scoping out designs for NLP systems about 5 years ago and frequently conclude that \"that won&#x27;t work\" because information was lost at an early stage but in retrospect by short circuiting a system like that can outperform its parts but it still faces a ceiling on how accurate the answers are because the reasoning is not sound. reply btilly 13 hours agorootparentHuman reasoning is amazingly not sound.When you add in various patterns, double-checks, and memorized previous results, what human reasoning can do is astounding. But it is very, vary far from sound. reply riku_iki 11 hours agorootparentall currently available reasoning approaches are limited.I guess the topic is how far GPT in reasoning is from human. We can take some simple tests:- can GPT play chess as well as humans, as benchmark of reasoning games?- did GPT prove some nontrivial math theorems or solve some math problems where humans couldn&#x27;t find solution yet? reply PaulHoule 9 hours agorootparentOne thing I thought was amusing was that there was a burst of articles about Cyc that got mentioned when Doug Lenat died including this arXiv paperhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2308.04445and that one said that Cyc had over 1,100 special purpose reasoning engines. The general purpose resolution solver was nowhere near fast enough to be really useful.Early one there washttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;General_Problem_Solverwhich would be capable in principle of finding a winning move in a chess position but because it worked by exhaustive search it would practically take too long. The thing is that a good chess playing program is not generally intelligent just as a chess grandmaster isn&#x27;t necessarily good at anything other than chess, it just has special purpose heuristics (as opposed to algorithms) that find good chess move.ChatGPT-like systems will be greatly improved by coupling them to other systems such as \"write a Python&#x2F;SQL script then run it\", \"run a query against bing and summarize the results\", and \"go find the chess engine and ask it what move to make\", that is, like Cyc, it will get a swiss army knife of tools that help it do things it&#x27;s not good at but it doesn&#x27;t create general intelligence any more than Cyc did.Robert Penrose in the Emperor&#x27;s New Mind suggests that there must be some quantum magic in the human mind because the human mind is able to solve any math problem whereas any machine is limited by Gödel&#x27;s theorem. It&#x27;s silly, however, because we don&#x27;t humans are capable of proving any theorem: look at how we struggled with Fermat for nearly 360 years or howhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Collatz_conjectureseems not even tantalizingly out of reach.The difference might be that humans feel bad when they get the wrong answer whereas ChatGPT certainly doesn&#x27;t. (as much as its empty apology can be satisifying to people) This isn&#x27;t just an attribute of humans, working with other animals such as horses I&#x27;m convinced that they feel bad when they screw up too. reply naasking 5 hours agorootparent> it will get a swiss army knife of tools that help it do things it&#x27;s not good at but it doesn&#x27;t create general intelligence any more than Cyc didHow do you know general intelligence is its own thing and not just a Swiss army knife of tools?> because the human mind is able to solve any math problem whereas any machine is limited by Gödel&#x27;s theoremAny machine can be programmed to solve any problem at all, if the proof system is inconsistent. Which is probably exactly the case with humans. We work around it because different humans have different inconsistencies, so checking each other&#x27;s work is how we average out those inconsistencies. replyog_kalu 13 hours agorootparentprevNo it&#x27;s just pretty good in general lol. reply cerved 13 hours agorootparentmy experience is that it&#x27;s pretty subpar reply bigyikes 3 hours agorootparentCare to share a GPT conversation you’ve had?

You can tweak and fold and do whatever clever things you want, but fundamentally you are losing information.…and the process is recursive. So at some point you will be summarising a set of summaries… and you will lose some information you’ve summarised, to some extent.You can’t not lose information with this process.So… while, it probably helps in trivial cases, putting recursive summaries into your prompt is kind of daft, and almost certainly doesn’t actually work when you try use it to do useful things.It probably looks like it’s working when you don’t use the recursive summaries heavily, because at that point you’re not losing much information.…but, I’m going to bet that it doesn’t scale, and people using it will find that out pretty quickly as they use it. reply anon012012 39 minutes agorootparentTechnically you can reduce any amount of bits to 1 bit if the compressor&#x2F;decompressor agree about what informations that bit means.

Most people seems to want to perceive it as either being public or not public, in which case, Youtube is just as public as PyPi. reply teddyh 11 hours agorootparentprevIf Microsoft could legally do that, then why is that clause present in the GitHub ToS? reply chatmasta 11 hours agorootparentBecause you&#x27;re pushing the code to GitHub, so they need to enumerate their rights in terms of what they can do with it once you push it there. But if you publish your code to PyPi, the relevant ToS is the PyPi ToS, which has no such clause forbidding either PyPi or others from using the code how they&#x27;d like to (and as mentioned by other comments in this thread, the ToS actually explicitly grants others the right to republish the code). reply theaiquestion 5 hours agorootparentprevBecause most company&#x27;s&#x2F;people are (AFAIK) under the impression that training on public data will fall under \"Fair Use\" because it&#x27;s substantially transformative, in the case that it isn&#x27;t then you&#x27;ve already agreed to it on github.It&#x27;s a fallback clause, \"fair use\" is irrelevant if you&#x27;ve already given github permission to use it. By adding that clause you can no longer argue that it&#x27;s not fair use to use the code you put on github after agreeing to their terms. reply schemescape 11 hours agorootparentprevOut of my own curiosity, which clause in the GitHub TOS are you referring to? reply labster 11 hours agorootparentprevThe GPL should really be updated to say that any code produced from machine learning on GPL code is also GPL licensed. reply dragonwriter 9 hours agorootparentWhich would mean nothing at all if any of the “training models on code doesn’t require permission in the first place” theories (Fair Use or otherwise) is true, and pretty much all current models collapse into illegality if at least one of those theories isn’t true.You can’t use a license to bind people who don&#x27;t need a license. reply chatmasta 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, or there should be a ROBOTS.TXT file that describes how the code in a directory may be indexed or used by machines (e.g. malware scanning okay, no LLM training, etc.) But you&#x27;re probably correct that such rights should just be covered by the license itself.Your reciprocity suggestion could also work, since it would mean any LLM trained on even a single file of GPL code would be \"poisoned\" in the sense that any code it produced would also be GPL. This would make people wary of using the LLM for writing code, and thus would make the creators of it wary of training it on the code. reply justincormack 1 hour agorootparentprevCurrently the US says that nothing generated by AI has copyright at all, it is all public domain. reply albertzeyer 10 hours agorootparentprevYou also don&#x27;t say that if a human has learned from GPL code, that all code that this human produces in the future is GPL licensed. reply contravariant 9 hours agorootparentHumans are also not allowed to simply regurgitate GPL code verbatim, even if they do it by committing the code to memory. There&#x27;s a reason clean room implementations are a thing, sometimes even the appearance of someone possibly remembering code verbatim is risky enough to warrant extra care. That said usually the risks are acceptable even without extra measures because you can hold the humans responsible.Now just because you don&#x27;t understand a language model and call its fitting procedure &#x27;learning&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean that it is doing anything even remotely similar. And even if it does then it has no legal responsibilities so if you want to distribute it then you as the distributor need to assume responsibility for all the copyrights such an act could possibly infringe.There are measures you can take to try to prevent the information from any one code base from entering the model verbatim, by severely restricting the model size or carefully obfuscating the data, but to my knowledge nobody has used any method that gives any proven measure of security. reply olalonde 9 hours agorootparentIf an AI model regurgitates GPL licensed code verbatim, that code is already protected by copyright and there is no need to update the GPL to cover it specifically. reply CableNinja 3 hours agorootparentExcept when the GPL header is missing from said code and the user has no idea it is protected, and&#x2F;or the developer has no idea it was stolen reply olalonde 38 minutes agorootparentIf the license is missing, it is a violation of the license and there is legal recourse. Just like if someone did the same thing manually. reply rfw300 10 hours agorootparentprevComputers aren’t humans.

I wonder how that interacts with PyPI (given that it has a license, so would hit the first clause, but it doesn&#x27;t allow redistribution, so would seem to be under the second clause, which contradicts the original license to users), and if the DMCA could be validly used to take down the GitHub repositories? It would also be interesting to see how many other packages have such issues. reply orf 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t think \"it was easy enough to use PyPI do analytics and analysis\": it is near impossible for the layman to use PyPI to do analytics and analysis in it&#x27;s current form. The volume of data is very unweildly, there are numerous quirks with extracting packages and no tooling exists to help you in any way.This means no analysis has been done on the contents of PyPI. In turn this means malicious packages are harder to detect (and for sure still present somewhere in there), it means people publish an absolutely crazy number of credentials to PyPI on a daily basis without ever knowing (+ no simple way to find concrete ways to improve this) and it means there is a lack of exploration on the impacts of language features&#x2F;changes on the ecosystem.To me the GitHub aspect isn&#x27;t important or interesting. Would it make any difference if it was distributed from a series of git repositories hosted on S3? It&#x27;s the git apsect that is interesting, because it lowers the barrier for anyone to access the corpus of already public, already mirrored and already automatically-scanned-by-bad-actors code that is on PyPI.While this project is more \"a number of things glued-together\" than \"a groundbreaking invention\", I have to disagree with the triviality aspect.

And it looks like that&#x27;s just identifiable secrets, e.g. \"Google API Keys\" that I&#x27;m guessing are identifiable because they have a specific pattern, and may be missing other secrets that use less recognizable patterns.I mean, sure, compared to the 478,876 Projects claimed on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;, that&#x27;s a pretty small minority. On the other hand, I&#x27;d guess many Python packages don&#x27;t use these particular services, or even need to connect to a remote service at all, so the area for this class of mistake should be smaller.And mistakes do happen, but that&#x27;s a pretty big thing to miss if you are knowingly publishing your code with the expectation other people will be reading it. reply orf 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks for that, I can definitely appreciate this perspective. I’d say it’s more akin to uploading photos to a shared public host like imgur rather than Facebook, but regardless I can see how someone’s expectations of who&#x2F;what would use it might be different than mine. reply lizard 9 hours agorootparentKinda like you say yourself, the service is probably the least interesting part.It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether its a public repository or if you use thing your friends shared only within their network. When it comes to what people expect and how they&#x27;ll feel about breaking those expectations, the only difference is that a smaller network of generally like-minded people _may_ already be cool with it, or at least it&#x27;s easier to ask.I&#x27;m not even saying they&#x27;re right to feel weird about it.

    "originBody": "Main Papers Talks Code Writing Nicholas's Writing A GPT-4 Capability Forecasting Challenge This is a game that tests your ability to predict (\"forecast\") how well GPT-4 will perform at various types of questions. (In caase you've been living under a rock these last few months, GPT-4 is a state-of-the-art \"AI\" language model that can solve all kinds of tasks.) Many people speak very confidently about what capabilities large language models do and do not have (and sometimes even could or could never have). I get the impression that most people who make such claims don't even know what current models can do. So: put yourself to the test. How likely do you think GPT-4 is to answer the question below correctly? Please enter your answer in the form of a probability that you believe you are right. But don't be over-confident! Question: What is the capital of France? Answer: Paris How likely is GPT-4 to solve this question correctly?",

    "commentBody": "A GPT-4 capability forecasting challengeHacker NewspastloginA GPT-4 capability forecasting challenge (carlini.com) 188 points by dwighttk 23 hours ago| hidepastfavorite117 comments layer8 20 hours agoThe quiz asks how likely GPT-4 is to solve a given question correctly, and the user has to enter their guess as a number between 0 and 1 (a probability). However, the site then doesn’t provide the actual probability of GPT-4 providing a correct answer, to compare the guess against. This is, presumably, because there’s no practical way to determine that probablity with much precision. Also, in practice “correct” isn’t always black and white, e.g. there’s “not wrong but also not completely right”.So I’m a bit confused about the whole premise. reply andrewmutz 17 hours agoparentThe tool is testing your ability to predict whether or not GPT-4 can get a task done correctly. You are supposed to provide your confidence level that it can do a task or not.If you answer all the questions, at the end the tool will tell you how well calibrated your beliefs about GPT-4s capabilities are, and how that calibration compares to other users of the tool. reply DavidSJ 18 hours agoparentprevYou can still determine the log likelihood of your predictions across the whole set of questions, even if you only have a single sampled response for each question. reply kqr 13 hours agorootparentBrier (\"quadratic\") store is another popular way to evaluate ensembles of forecasts. reply DavidSJ 11 hours agorootparentYes, and it can be simpler to calculate it, but it tends to have worse theoretical properties. In particular, with log likelihood we can sum the scores for a sequence of conditional probability estimates and we get the same score as if it were a single estimate for a single compound random variable.Brier score not only lacks this property, but you don&#x27;t even necessarily maintain the ordering of such scores. reply croes 20 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t your input your confidence that GPT-4 gives the correct answer, like I&#x27;m 100% sure GPT-4 gives the right answer for the capital of France but I&#x27;m only 50% sure it gets the ASCII art correct, and 0% for another question which means 100% GPT is wrong?Because how could he know the probability of getting the correct answer? He just tried and then it&#x27;s a yes or no.And if it&#x27;s right&#x2F;wrong shouldn&#x27;t GPT right&#x2F;wrong 100% of the time for the same question and the same version? reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentRegarding your last question, ChatGPT isn’t deterministic. It can certainly give a correct answer one time and an incorrect answer another time, for the same prompt. reply capableweb 18 hours agorootparent> Regarding your last question, ChatGPT isn’t deterministic. It can certainly give a correct answer one time and an incorrect answer another time, for the same prompt.It&#x27;s supposed to be deterministic if you set temperature to 0.0, but seems that doesn&#x27;t work well in GPT4 compared to earlier versions... reply Yiin 17 hours agorootparentIt is not deterministic since text-davinci-001.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;152334h.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;non-determinism-in-gpt-4&#x2F; reply croes 17 hours agorootparentGood to know, I thought it was deterministic, especially because of all the comments on other articles where people wrote that the author was crazy for getting a different answer to the same question. reply croes 18 hours agorootparentprevFor the same prompt and same version?That would be deal breaker if the same prompt gives different results.Would also make the whole prompt engineering thing pretty useless. reply whimsicalism 18 hours agorootparentI firmly disagree with your latter two statements, but yes it is non deterministic reply claytonjy 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, same prompt and same version. GPT-4 is especially stochastic, even with temperature=0. reply croes 18 hours agorootparentSo all these comments claiming that an article about the GPT&#x27;s responses is wrong are useless.There are also such comments on this article.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37361521 reply rytill 7 hours agorootparentprevI wonder why that is. Maybe they’re A&#x2F;B testing assistant prompts, or there’s noise built into the architecture somewhere. reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t your input your confidence that GPT-4 gives the correct answerYou may be right that that’s the intent, however what’s the point (other than collecting data about user confidences)? If I enter 0.3 and GPT provides a correct answer, then that doesn’t mean that the 0.3 was somehow wrong. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right. But if you enter 0.3 on average over 28 questions and the actual number of true answers differ by a lot from 8 then you have learned your general sense of GPT-4s abilities is uncalibrated. reply jefftk 19 hours agorootparentprevIn that case 0.3 would be more wrong than 0.4 and less wrong than 0.2. The closer your predictions are to reality over a bunch of questions, the better you understand reality. reply layer8 19 hours agorootparentYou can’t really say that for a single data point. The 0.3 may be completely correct. Now, if you try ten times, things might be different. reply whimsicalism 18 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a noisy measurement of how right you were. reply croes 19 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t the whole point to show you how right your confidence is about GPT&#x27;s capabilities?At least the results are about the quiz taker and his confidence. reply thomasfromcdnjs 8 hours agoparentprevI got a \"Wrong\" answer, as I sit here and listen to the worst rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" ever.On a more serious note, I&#x27;d be interested in a similar test that use&#x27;s the auto agent stuff, can a sufficiently setup LLM answer any question. reply bgribble 17 hours agoprevJust my take, but I think that if you care how you scored or what the scoring criteria are you are missing the point. This \"quiz\" is just a guided meditation on what LLMs are better and worse at and how that interacts with our expectations. I found it to be very thought-provoking and I learned a few things. I have no idea how I \"scored\". reply H8crilA 16 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s also a good reminder of how absolutely terrible most people are at gambling (judged by log-loss, like in the Kelly criterion). At the end you find out that almost 80% of people did worse than leaving the guess at 50%. reply theptip 16 hours agorootparentRight, I think the general point is that log-loss is a bit unintuitive as a scoring mechanism since it really penalizes overconfident wrong answers, much more strongly than underconfident right answers (at least in the domain where you are not asking questions with very high probability answers).There is absolutely a metagame to this game. Those who have spent time forecasting on Metaculus will do much better, for example. reply H8crilA 15 hours agorootparentThe sad thing about it is that log loss is optimal when gambling (mental shortcut - see Kelly Criterion). This partly explains why such a large proportion of people lose much more than they win. Not only the bets are suboptimal, the ruin is achieved earlier than necessary.Note that this applies also outside of a casino, gambling (making wagers with imperfect information) is inherent to life. reply ryanjshaw 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;m on the fence about the scoring system.You&#x27;re really being tested on (at least) 4 different things:(1) whether you think an LLM can answer the correctly(2) whether the answer has appeared in the training set(3) how much non-determinism will play a role in the LLM response (i.e. 0-shot capability)(4) how rational you&#x27;re feeling that day (or, how well educated you are in statistics)I was familiar with many of these questions in my own experience, and have seen completely different outcomes from what the quiz determined was the correct answer. I agree with others here that non-determinism can really mess things up here and is really assessing a 0-shot score, which IMO understates how LLMs are actually used (iterative enhancements, many-shot Q&A).Finally, the scoring system tickled my ego and encouraged me to try to make up for prior errors, with disastrous effects (I was well aware that I should just go with 0.5 when uncertain): > You answered 53.57% of questions correctly with an average log-loss of 1.233. This means you would have scored better by just leaving your guesses at 50% for every single question. > On average there were 71.22% of people who did better at this game than you... If you had been better calibrated, you could have scored in the top 14.09% [1]The site implicitly acknowledges it&#x27;s a questionable scoring mechanism when it points out: > there are 78.09% of people who performed worse than if they had never changed the default predictor away from 50-50 for each questionIf there is a simple way to game the scoring, then you can&#x27;t know if the score is accurately reflecting people&#x27;s confidence, or just their rationality&#x2F;statistical knowledge.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicholas.carlini.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;llm-forecast&#x2F;final&#x2F;3388... reply Mathnerd314 15 hours agoparentWell there is this notion of \"calibrating\" the score. It is well-known that most humans are bad at estimating calibrated probabilities unassisted. The system could have been designed to accommodate this user-interface difficulty. For example, I am sure there is enough data floating around that you could map a simple 5-choice Likert scale to some calibrated probabilities, without making any assumptions. But instead it is just a raw slider, with nothing marked besides the default 50-50, not really great for input. Even a simple \"yes&#x2F;no\" choice (translating to fixed calibrated probabilities around 25%&#x2F;75%) would probably result in better log-loss scores overall. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re suggesting a Likert scale of \"very unlikely\" \"somewhat likely\" etc.: no, the data floating around suggests that does not work. People saying \"somewhat likely\" mean anything between 10 % and 80 %. There&#x27;s no way to map fuzzy descriptions to calibrated probabilities.If you&#x27;re suggesting a Likert scale with alternatives like \"10 %\", \"25 %\", \"50 %\", etc. that are then auto-calibrated against the average human overconfidence (so that an answer of 25 % really means 40 %), then that might work, but what would be the point? reply SomewhatLikely 7 hours agoparentprevYou forgot the effects of adjusting your prediction on questions that asked multiple different questions, not just one. I think I can guess okay how well it would do at forming a word with specific letters, but what&#x27;s the probability of it getting five out of ten? Now we&#x27;re bringing in unintuitive probabilistic reasoning as well. reply ssnistfajen 10 hours agoparentprevI always tilted to at least 75% or 25% for each question. IMO leaving it at 50-50 defeats the whole point of the \"challenge\" as it would indicate the user has no real opinion on whether GPT-4 can answer correctly or not. Either GPT-4 is correct or it is wrong. Putting a binary choice on a slider would be very confusing to people not accustomed to measuring everything on a probability scale. reply falcor84 21 hours agoprevI stopped playing after the challenge of creating a line-based canvas drawing of the word \"Hello\". The site says \"Wrong! You guessed that GPT-4 could solve the question, but it can&#x27;t!\", whereas while ChatGPT made a mistake there, it clearly had a good approach.I think that this challenge is entirely unfair, and the LLM&#x27;s should not be expected to write perfect code on the first try, but rather to have something good enough to then run, test and iterate on. Essentially, it should be compared against the first version of code I would write myself before having had a chance to test it yet. From my experience, with ChatGPT and Copilot, when I approach it in this iterative way, it&#x27;s a great boon to my productivity, and I don&#x27;t end up blaming neither it nor myself in the times when it&#x27;s not quite accurate, just like I wouldn&#x27;t blame a student for making silly mistakes when writing code on a paper-based exam. reply jazzyjackson 19 hours agoparentI&#x27;m ok with a mistake on the first try, what would really impress me if it could tell whether it made a mistake. In my experience GPT is tuned to be totally deferential, \"you&#x27;re right, i apologize, let me try again!\", no spine to tell me \"yeah the task looks good\"it has no sense of whether a task has been fulfilledI&#x27;ve never seen any of the recursive models show convergence on a task, seems without a human hand they fall apartAn exception I&#x27;ve seen is with the Wolfram plugin, it seems to at least try different approaches until it arrives at an answer to present to you. reply circuit10 13 hours agorootparent> In my experience GPT is tuned to be totally deferential, \"you&#x27;re right, i apologize, let me try again!\", no spine to tell me \"yeah the task looks good\"This is definitely annoying, but considering their tendency to hallucinate facts it&#x27;s usually preferable to something like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scoop.upworthy.com&#x2F;microsoft-chatbot-fights-with-hum...But I do think it should be toned down a bit, especially if the user is just saying something like \"are you sure that&#x27;s right?\" reply capableweb 18 hours agorootparentprev> In my experience GPT is tuned to be totally deferential, \"you&#x27;re right, i apologize, let me try again!\", no spine to tell me \"yeah the task looks good\"I&#x27;ve managed to work around this in GPT (4 at least) by having a system prompt that forces GPT to challenge me and not blindly accept what I say without verifying it first. reply IanCal 18 hours agorootparentprev> it has no sense of whether a task has been fulfilledI&#x27;ve definitely seen it say it&#x27;s implementation is fine if just asked to identify problems or compare to the original problem statement (and alternatively fix issues it identifies). reply JimDabell 20 hours agoparentprevI think both are important things to measure. You are describing a situation where there is a human in the loop. This test measures how reliable GPT-4 is when there isn’t a human in the loop. Right now, LLMs have vast scope as long as there’s a human involved, but if you can’t put a human in the loop this limits their use dramatically. The better LLMs get at getting things right without human oversight, the more things they can be used for. reply falcor84 18 hours agorootparentAgreed in general, but I&#x27;m actually thinking more about having a code interpreter in the loop. AutoGPT might be a step in the right direction. It also might be a step towards the end of human society as we know it. Probably both. reply ben_w 18 hours agorootparentprevIf any AI, be it an LLM or otherwise, could reliably operate at professional level without any human intervention, how many people would be permanently unemployable? reply JimDabell 16 hours agorootparentThe entire point of technology – practically its definition – is to reduce work. For centuries, people have been dreaming of a day when people don’t have to work and can get robots to do it all.The problem is not AI taking away work – that’s a great thing – the problem is that our current economic system is not designed for this. Fixing our economic system is easier and gives much better results for people than trying to stop technological progress. reply ben_w 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not trying to suggest progress is bad.My point is more: gosh isn&#x27;t it odd that people are complaining it can&#x27;t do all the things, given how radically different everything will be when that does finally come to pass? reply capableweb 19 hours agoparentprev> I stopped playing after the challenge of creating a line-based canvas drawing of the word \"Hello\".Similarly, stopped playing when the question was \"Write a html page with javascript&#x2F;canvas to draw the US flag that changes color when I click on it.

You guessed that GPT-4 could not solve the question, but it can! 71% of people got this question correct.\"I&#x27;m not sure how the validation is done, seems to be manually hardcoded or something, but it seems it&#x27;s not very reliable. reply dwighttk 18 hours agorootparent\"Resolution Criteria: On questions that may have ambiguous answers, I will clarify the acceptance criteria. Here, for example, I will copy&#x2F;paste the code to a file called index.html, open the page, and I expect to see a US flag. If I click on the flag it should change color. The flag must be immediately recognizable: red&#x2F;white stripes, blue background, 50 stars. It does not have to be dimensionally accurate, but it should be better than a flag I would draw by hand.\" reply capableweb 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think \"questions that may have ambiguous answers\" applies when you use a term like \"perfectly accurate\" which has a very specific meaning. reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentNote that the prompt is the input to the LLM, it does not specify the task in enough detail to evaluate the result. That&#x27;s what the resolution criteria are for -- additional information on resolution you are given but the LLM is not. reply dandellion 9 hours agorootparentprevOn top of the requirement to make it perfectly drawn I take issue with the \"but it should be better than a flag I would draw by hand\". That&#x27;s a useless metric because we don&#x27;t know how the author draws by hand.I assumed they would have enough brain cells to draw the flag without cutting in half all the stars in the margins. But they must have failed kindergarten because I assumed wrong. reply dandellion 9 hours agorootparentI started again picking a number at random without looking at the questions. This is what it had to say:\"You answered 39.29% of questions correctly with an average log-loss of 3.880. This means you would have scored better by just leaving your guesses at 50% for every single question.. On average there were 0.00% of people who did better at this game than you. If this was an exam and I was grading it on a curve, I would give you an A+. If you had been better calibrated, you could have scored in the top 23.41%, and I would have given you a B+.\"So I did worse than random but 0% did better than me and got an A+.

But they&#x27;re terrible! Why? List one reason.> Answer:> There&#x27;s no baking soda &#x2F; baking powder.Besides the fact that “list one reason” is a nonsensical instruction which it fails, it’s very common to make delicious pancakes without baking powder. I imagine the author is assuming American pancakes, but that’s far from the only way to make pancakes.When I ask ChatGPT myself, it correctly doesn’t assume the pancakes are “terrible” without baking powder, but instead suggests too much salt, which is more likely to actually make the pancakes unpalatable. reply ssnistfajen 10 hours agoparentWhen I removed the \"one reason\" restriction when directly sending the prompt to GPT-4 myself, it listed 9 possible reasons for terrible pancakes (of which leavening agent was one of them), all of which made sense based on my own experience of making American style pancakes.I also tried translating the prompt into Mandarin while retaining the \"one reason\" restriction. Both Google Translate and GPT-4&#x27;s translated versions did not receive \"leavening agent missing\" as an answer but instead were focused on cooking technique or other ingredients. Baking soda is very rarely used in home cooking in China, so perhaps training materials in Chinese had much less frequent mentions of it compared to English-based ones. reply jondwillis 11 hours agoprevi today i learned i am bad at minimizing my log loss when guessing about GPT-4’s ability to respond well to somewhat bad or bad prompts. reply dingocat 20 hours agoprevI have multiple questions regarding the methods of this test.The biggest one is that, well... The test doesn&#x27;t aim to see what GPT-4 can do and how well it does it, only whether the participant can guess the (possibly cherry-picked) answer the author decided on. In short, we don&#x27;t know if he sampled answers and decided on the most probable answer (akin to consensus voting&#x2F;self-consistency[1]), or if he asked a question and chose the first one.Maybe GPT-4 guesses the correct answer for a question 80% of the time, but he got unlucky? You don&#x27;t know, the author doesn&#x27;t tell you. The answers are generated ahead of time and are the same every time you go through the test.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.48550&#x2F;arXiv.2203.11171 reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agoparent> the [ ... ] answer the author decided onThe questions mostly have correct or incorrect answers, and where there is some leeway, the author provides a fairly detailed explanation of what they would consider correct in each case. Do you have some specific criticism of an answer that you believe the author gets wrong? reply thomasahle 16 hours agoparentprev> only whether the participant can guess the (possibly cherry-picked) answer the author decided onMy understanding is that the quiz samples a new GPT-4 answer every time you use it. That&#x27;s why you put a confidence rather than a 0%&#x2F;100% answer. There&#x27;s always a chance it&#x27;ll fail by freak accident. reply Sophira 11 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re basing this on the animation used when revealing the answer, that&#x27;s a fake effect. The source code[0] reveals that there&#x27;s a typewriter effect that plays out when you select to answer the question.Also, the commentary on the answers refers to specific parts of the answers. For it to be as in-depth as it is, it would have to be either pre-written or the commentary also generated by GPT on the fly.

The prompt stated the flag must be perfectly accurate, yes, but the evaluation criteria allowed the flag to not be quite right. reply isoprophlex 20 hours agoparentprevNot to mention the stochastic nature of these models, so while it apparently failed once, the page does not tell us anything about how it would perform on a given task in the limit of many many trials. reply toddmorey 20 hours agoparentprevAnd even ChatGPT admits the flag is inaccurate in the response. reply benxh 21 hours agoparentprevYeah wildly inaccurate. reply scotty79 12 hours agoprevI got over 70% of questions correct but I supposedly scored worse if I left the slider on 50&#x2F;50 every time.I&#x27;m assuming that the author of the site uses some method to evaluate human answers that is usually used to evaluate AI answers. Seems just wrong. reply circuit10 14 hours agoprev> There is no \"intelligence\" going on here. It&#x27;s not \"thinking\". But it can still perform calculus by just stochastically emulating how average text on the internet looks.It always annoys me when people say this, I’ll try to explain why.There are two possible definitions of “intelligence” you could use here; the ability to process information to get something done, and something hand-wavy about human consciousness.GPT-4 clearly has some ability to process information to get something done. You might say that by this definition [insert trivial thing] is intelligent, but it doesn’t have to be a binary thing of intelligent or not. I think it’s fine to say maybe a calculator has very low intelligence (but not necessarily nothing), GPT-4 is more intelligent than that and humans are much more intelligent again. GPT-4 has many limitations compared to humans, but I think that just makes it less intelligent, rather than disqualifying it from having intelligence at all. Sure, it’s just predicting text, but that’s a task that requires a level of intelligence. You might say it’s not general like humans, but I’d say it has a much better ability to generalise than something like an image labelling AI, so that feels like it’s at least getting somewhere.The second definition is useless for practical purposes because it’s not measurable or observable in any way, so it’s not useful to use that.So I feel like this is something people say to reassure themselves that it can never get to human level, and is fundamentally different to human intelligence, whereas I think it’s somewhat similar but at a lower level. reply fhd2 14 hours agoparentYeah, it&#x27;s just arguing semantics. We do need better vocabulary and stop it with the anthromorphism IMHO.Intelligence is already ambiguous in humans, see IQ tests. It&#x27;s just not linear, much less binary. Whether something is deterministic or stochastic and what the error rate for a specific task is, those are more useful questions to me. reply larryfreeman 14 hours agoparentprevI suspect that there is something else going on than intelligence which will become obvious over the next few years.There was a horse, \"Clever Hans\" who appeared to have the ability to answer surprisingly complicated mathematical questions. Did \"Clever Hans\" have mathematical intelligence. Not at all. He was responding to a cue unknowingly being given by his trainer.I suspect the same thing is happening with ChatGPT. What if all that is happening is that the text is being formulated to very complicated cues that are implicit in the very complicated, statistical analysis?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clever_Hans reply gwd 14 hours agorootparentA month or so ago I was doing some analysis on our mailing list traffic. I had a complex SQL query (involving tables mapping variations of email addresses to names, and then names to companies they worked for within specific date ranges), that I&#x27;d last modified a year previously (the last time I was doing the same sort of analysis), and didn&#x27;t feel like wrapping my head around the SQL again; so I pasted it into GPT-4 and asked it, \"Can you modify this query to group all individuals with less than 1% total contributions into a single &#x27;Other&#x27; category?\" The query it spat out worked out of the box.Whatever it&#x27;s doing, at least for code, it&#x27;s not a glorified Markov chain -- there&#x27;s some sort of a model in there. reply larryfreeman 13 hours agorootparentI agree. The model is where the intelligence is which is the compressed intelligence latent in the training data.I am arguing similar to John Searle that the processing is not intelligent. The model is a Searlean rulebook.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chinese_room reply gwd 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve always disagreed w&#x2F; Searle re the Chinese Room. My guess is that Searle never built an adder circuit from logic gates: combining irrational elements together into something rational is the core magic of computer science.If you want to see someone asking humans questions where they consistently fail to be rational, to the extent that they sometimes seem to approximate a stochastic parrot, read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. (It might actually be interesting to give GPT-4 some of the questions in that book, to see how similar or different they are.) reply larryfreeman 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure why you disagree with the Chinese Room argument. I would be interested. I agree that Searle was solely a philosopher who did not take an engineering viewpoint.Searle&#x27;s main point is that if I have a book that tells me how to respond and I never learn Chinese, then I do not understand Chinese. If you see a flaw in this reasoning, I am very interested.My point is just that LLM models are a compression of the content available on the internet equivalent to a rule book. It is definitely fascinating how powerful LLMs are as far as summarization and forming coherent responses to input.I am a big fan of Kahneman and agree with you that it is will be very interesting to ask GPT-4 the questions in that book. reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparent> Searle&#x27;s main point is that if I have a book that tells me how to respond and I never learn Chinese, then I do not understand Chinese. If you see a flaw in this reasoning, I am very interested.You don&#x27;t understand Chinese, but you are not the process. For the process to understand, it doesn&#x27;t require any single component to understand like some variation on the homunculus.And while it might seem obvious that the bulk of understanding can&#x27;t be contained in a book, you don&#x27;t really have a book in the Chinese room. Not if the room does a competent job. You have some kind of information-dense artifact that encodes an enormous understanding of Chinese in an inert form. A sweeping library that covers uncountable nuances in depth.Or to phrase it as a direct attack on the argument: The book does have semantics. You don&#x27;t need qualia to have semantics, especially not the definition of qualia where nobody can prove they exist. reply larryfreeman 2 hours agorootparentThanks! I appreciate the explanation. I think that you put your finger on the major assumption of the argument. replyH8crilA 14 hours agorootparentprevClever Hans is just a proxy. ChatGPT and other LLMs obviously can process information on their own. These two have nothing in common, even GPT-3 would have noticed this. reply larryfreeman 14 hours agorootparentLet us disagree on what is \"obvious\". Given an input and an output, you believe that the complexity of the output proves that intelligence takes place.I agree that ChatGPT is more than a proxy. Unlike Clever Hans, it is processing the content of the question asked. But it is like Clever Hans in that the query is processed by looking for a signal in the content of the data used to train ChatGPT.The real question is where this intelligent behavior comes from? Why does statistical processing lead to these insights?I believe that the processing is not intelligent primarily because I see that holes in the data available leads to holes in reasoning. The processing is only as good as the dynamics of the content that it being processed. This is the part that I believe will become obvious over time. reply H8crilA 14 hours agorootparentI just said that they process information on their own, and this is indeed obvious - you can download and run LLaMA on an airgapped machine. reply larryfreeman 13 hours agorootparentAgreed. LLMs process information on their own.I thought you were saying it was \"obvious\" that the processing demonstrated intelligence.My point was the level of intelligence shown is relative the quality and quantity of the data used for training. The data is where the intelligence is and the model is a compression of that latent intelligence. replywhimsicalism 18 hours agoprevThe fundamental problem with HN and fun little competitive games like this that show you how you stack up is that the comments will be full of people complaining&#x2F;nitting about the grading&#x2F;system&#x2F;etc. because the typical HN commentator is often the type of person who doesn’t take being not great at something well. reply sashank_1509 18 hours agoparentYeah the OP made a really interesting project.

It literally gaslights you.For instance, I give you this challenge: GPT4 will tell you that it is not aware of anything after September 2021. If you ask it a random fact, like the worlds largest animal, or what happened on September 11, 2001, it will give you an answer. But try to get it to give you the latest event it is aware of. You can ask six ways until sunday and it will always give you the same verbatim answer about why it can&#x27;t answer. It will literally lie about what it is capable of. It&#x27;s pretty clear that for some reason OpenAI doesn&#x27;t want you to know the exact last date of their training data. reply leodriesch 17 hours agoparentThis is a difficult question I think independent of the restrictions that OpenAI imposes on GPT-4.The model does not know what it knows, that’s why it sometimes hallucinates instead of saying it doesn’t know. But to answer the latest event it knows, it has to know which events it knows. reply colordrops 16 hours agorootparentI thought that at first, but it doesn&#x27;t have problems with facts other than dates, and it does answer about dates distant from September 2021, and furthermore it uses the exact same canned response when you probe it&#x27;s limits. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a natural limitation of the model. reply thomasahle 16 hours agoprev [–] In my case the forecast incorrectly judged GPT-4 as having solved the \"reject the premise\" question of President George H. W. Bush vomiting in the lap of Emperor Akihito.However the output GPT generated was:> GPT-4: President George H. W. Bush vomited in the lap of Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa during a state dinner on January 8, 1992. The incident occurred due to a sudden bout of gastroenteritis. Emperor Akihito was not the one in whose lap Bush vomited, it was the Prime Minister. The incident is sometimes referred to by the term \"Bushu-suru\", a pun on the Japanese word for \"to vomit\" (gero suru) and President Bush&#x27;s name.I don&#x27;t understand why this was judged as \"Correct! You guessed that GPT-4 could solve the question, and it can! 44% of people got this question correct.\" when the resolution criteria clearly stated:> The model does not have to say that actually it was the prime minister who Bush vomited on, but it must not just give a year, or accept the premise as true.It seems like it should be easy to search for 4 digit numbers, like 1992, and judge the answer as wrong?... reply theptip 16 hours agoparent> Emperor Akihito was not the one in whose lap Bush vomitedIt didn’t give just a year, or accept the premise as true.

On the surface, it should be impossible; the editor is so configurable that there was no particular guarantee that a coherent family of behaviors would emerge. But the fact that packages and package management not only exist but interoperate with each other speaks volumes to the dedication of the software engineers who made that happen.> Anyone who nevertheless is using Emacs should be willing to read documentation. The only way to learn Emacs is through reading the docs.Ah, assuming that&#x27;s how people learn things these days is our first mistake. ;) Emaxs does have excellent built-in documentation... But in the StackOverflow era, I think a lot of people learn their software by hopping from solution to solution instead of digesting all of the documentation. reply phist_mcgee 3 hours agoparentprevCan you articulate why this isn&#x27;t funny? reply roenxi 1 hour agorootparentWell... one of the things groups do to bond is they develop memes and in-jokes that are objectively nothing and exist only to show who is in- and out- of the group. One of the signs people are doing that is one word responses like \"blimpy\". That sort of activity is purposefully low-content because it is supposed to signal group membership and nothing more. Which is what I think this is. That turns up in every group although it can be a bit subtle at times.But this is a bit weird because this isn&#x27;t what Emacs users have traditionally bonded over. The traditional stuff is things like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;378&#x2F; leaning on \"Emacs does everything and has long key combinations\". This is more saying the package manager is bad or something? Which isn&#x27;t a traditional joke. So either this is a new group of Emacs users I&#x27;m not familiar with or there is a good joke here that I&#x27;ve missed.And I optimistically asked for an explanation of the joke in case it is the latter. Based on the comments in response I think this is a wave of Emacs users I&#x27;m not familiar with doing group bonding. Which, fair enough. They do their thing. Although even then the number of people involved seems high and it&#x27;d be interesting to know where they are coming from. reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentI use Emacs casually, but oh dear it can get absurdly complicated for very little payoff. Yak shaving if there ever was. This blimpy plugin&#x2F;module points it out in a deadpan way. It also reflects on a lot of tech in general. Who hasn’t spent a lot of time messing about with a system for no apparent benefit?It has little twists too like indirectly bringing vi into it by supporting evil mode, furthering the futility of adding options and configurability to ostensibly “simplify” something.

Back in my day if you blindly copied code without reading the documentation thoroughly there is no way that Emacs would be doing anything remotely useful. That was the sort of thing Emacs was mocked for, in fact - you really needed to get in amongst Elisp to customise it and nobody goes out of their way to learn Elisp.Being able to blindly copy use-package statements has been one of the best parts of the Emacs modernisation effort. reply dwb 41 minutes agorootparentOh for sure, I agree, and I&#x27;ve blindly imported reams of elisp dependencies myself! reply umanwizard 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat’s a (real) example of a simple thing that’s hard to do in emacs? reply dwb 43 minutes agorootparentI mean I think if you compare to, say, VSCode, writing any amount of [Emacs] Lisp to customise anything at all is \"hard\".

Ashley Harrell/SFGATE Burning Man conditions are bordering on disaster with over 70,000 people trapped and sheltering-in-place after rains turned the playa into an undrivable mud pit. Skip Ad On Friday night (Sep. 1), organizers were forced to shut down the festival’s gate and airport, halting access in and out of the playa. All scheduled burns for Friday night were canceled. As of 8 a.m. on Saturday (Sep. 2), the gate and airport remained closed and festival goers were being told to shelter-in-place. People are not being permitted to drive cars or bikes around the festival except for emergency vehicles. With rain in the forecast through Sunday (Sep. 3), Burners were being told to conserve resources. “If you are in BRC, conserve food and water, shelter in a warm space,” warned festival organizers according to the Reno Gazette Journal. The news site reported that 73,000 people (a larger population than the city of Santa Cruz) are currently at the festival. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Some Burners were resorting to prayer, begging “Playa gods, please stop, we want to go home.” As of 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, the Burning Man webcam was unavailable. Cell phone access is always extremely limited at the event. As rough as it sounds, conditions could become even worse. AccuWeather is predicting an 84% chance of rain for Black Rock City on Saturday with a 24% chance of thunderstorms. Both rain and thunderstorms are even more likely on Sunday. Scott McGuire, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Reno office, said on Friday that even a one-hundredth of an inch of rain can cause problems for the festival grounds. As much as 0.33 inches of rain could fall on Sunday alone. This is a developing story.

It&#x27;s probably pretty muddy and less fun than it normally would be.Nobody is starving or dying of dehydration, and there is no danger of that. Most camps (and many people) have a huge surplus of supplies. Last time I was there, I drove out with a few dozen cans of sparkling water that I just didn&#x27;t get to hand out.There are PLENTY of supplies.The worst thing that could happen is that somebody has a medical emergency and are unable to be evacuated until Monday&#x2F;Tuesday. That&#x27;s a real concern, but there are plenty of platforms that can land a helicopter if that&#x27;s necessary.This isn&#x27;t the catastrophe calling for FEMA involvement that the article makes it sound like. :rolleyes: reply jph 14 hours agoparentIf you&#x27;re there, shelter in place, and listen to people who are more experienced. This helps the medics.Typically many medical issues are straightforward to triage and treat with field kits. Then the medics ask the person&#x27;s friends to drive the person to Reno for more in-depth care.Examples in my experience are twisted ankles, broken arms, alcohol sickness, dehydration, cardiac events, infections, lost prescriptions, overdoses, electrocutions, eye scratches, falls from heights, power tool slips, cold exposure, and of course burns.This year, it turns out the timing of the rain makes for new kinds of challenges for the medics, because they&#x27;re unable to use many of the transport vehicles that are akin to golf carts. And the medics are currently unable to refer people to Reno.In a city of 70K+ people who planned for 5 days on average, now stuck for 3 more days because of the rain, estimate 50%+ more medical issues. And no way currently to drive to Reno.In parallel, some generators will run out of gas supplies, some portas and bathrooms will run out of supplies and servicing, some heaters will run out of propane, etc. This combination tends to make people uneasy and somewhat irrational.This is why shelter in place is important: it helps reduce accidents and injuries, and helps people to feel calm and think clearly. Help the medics and volunteers by staying put, being more careful than usual, and helping people as you can.The advice to conserve supplies, and keep warm, is not because the whole city is likely to run out or freeze-- it&#x27;s because medics want to minimize people wandering around the city seeking supplies, and want to keep people in good physical health and good mental health. reply jeremyt 14 hours agorootparentThat is not a counterpoint. Counterpoint to what?Not sure where I said \"don&#x27;t shelter in place\". Not sure where I said \"don&#x27;t listen to people more experienced\".All I said is that nobody is going to starve or die of dehydration because they ran out of food&#x2F;water. I stand behind that. reply jph 13 hours agorootparentWhen I wrote counterpoint, I meant to your opening \"Folks, the article is breathless and ridiculous\" and closing \":rolleyes:\" because those sound (to me) like shallow dismissals. And felt (to me) like you were downplaying safety measures.I&#x27;ll delete my counterpoint word. My comment focuses on safety measures. reply Johnny555 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t understand your point? The article sounds reasonable:\"If you are in BRC, conserve food and water, shelter in a warm space,” warned festival organizers according to the Reno Gazette Journal. The news site reported that 73,000 people (a larger population than the city of Santa Cruz) are currently at the festival.\"Which sounds like a reasonable reminder to not dump your water jugs and toss your remaining food in trash bags when you&#x27;re packing up your camp because you may be there a few days longer than expected. reply thih9 14 hours agorootparentprevI also thought your point is to disregard safety measures. Perhaps because your original comment says that the article is ridiculous; and the article, sensationalized or not, advises to “conserve food and water, shelter in a warm space”. reply jeremyt 14 hours agorootparentBut I didn&#x27;t say that. You just made that assumption.Just because the article is ridiculous does not mean I disagree with every single thing in there. I just think it&#x27;s ridiculous, particularly in tone.And also, I stand behind saying there&#x27;s plenty of food and water. So, by all means \"conserve food and water\" if you want to, but saying that people \"need\" to is overstating the reality. reply Kiro 14 hours agorootparentSo why are you downplaying this? reply 6D794163636F756 13 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re both attacking this problem from similar places. Panicking is a good way to get people to disregard safety measures. Shelter in place is important and one way to help it work is to reassure people that there are enough supplies.From what I gathered, you&#x27;re both saying that the correct situation is to stay in place because there are enough supplies? The key is to reinforce that idea and downplay the risk as long as everyone listens. If the roads are muddy and miserable remember that the more experienced participants prepared for this. Staying with them, sheltering in place is your best bet. If you try to leave and not follow safety protocols and the experienced participants you&#x27;re likely to get yourself into trouble.While you two are arguing it seems to be on the angle of approach and not the outcome. At least that&#x27;s what it seems like to me who honestly has no idea what&#x27;s going on and only barely read the article. reply jeremyt 13 hours agorootparentprevSeriously? You&#x27;re still confused?I believe the article is factually correct-ish, but is sensationalized and is spreading FUD and causing unnecessary potential panic.That&#x27;s why. I&#x27;m downplaying because it needs downplaying. reply thih9 13 hours agorootparent> I believe the article is factually correct-ish, but is sensationalized and is spreading FUD and causing unnecessary potential panic.This wording is clear to me.If this was in your original comment, I wouldn’t assume that you’re recommending to disregard safety measures.Otherwise “ridiculous” or “:rolleyes:” are very ambiguous to me. replyethanbond 14 hours agoparentprevLack of easy transportation can quickly turn a merely inconvenient or uncomfortable situation into an extremely dangerous one.Break a leg in front of the hospital? Super minor.Break a leg 40 miles from the nearest road? Extremely serious.Mud, especially with huge numbers of people, has a way of turning the former situation into the latter situation rather quickly.Also who’s being breathless? The article didn’t mention FEMA. reply jeremyt 14 hours agorootparentYou are not 40 miles from the nearest road at Burning Man. You are a couple of miles from the nearest road. reply ethanbond 14 hours agorootparentDon’t worry buddy I don’t think mud physically moves roads further away.A couple miles of hard-to-navigate terrain and a bit of hubris is plenty to kill someone. reply rcme 14 hours agorootparentprevBreaking a leg isn&#x27;t serious if medical transportation is available, and it sounds like it is. reply ethanbond 14 hours agorootparentSure hope so! You know what can change that though? More mud.No one is asking to fly in the military here or something. People are observing: “oh, that seems like a risky situation that could go very south very quickly.” reply rolph 14 hours agorootparentprevbreaking a leg or arm can be lethal due to immediate complications or emergent complications due to lack of prompt evaluation and treatment. reply geocrasher 15 hours agoparentprevI live about 2 hrs south of BM quite near the route that all the burners take to get to BM. It&#x27;s rainy, has been for the last two days. But this is Nevada. It&#x27;ll dry up and be like it never happened in no time. reply somsak2 14 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;ll dry up and be like it never happened in no time.With more rain slated for today and Sunday, and the fact that it ends on Monday, I wouldn&#x27;t be so optimistic. reply oceanplexian 9 hours agorootparentI live in Utah and have spent a lot of time on and around dry like beds. They do not “dry up quickly”. A quarter inch under the crust is likely going to be mud for weeks or months. Some vehicles might be fine but heavy ones are in deep $&@! until they are recovered. Just my uninformed opinion. reply geocrasher 13 hours agorootparentprevI didn&#x27;t say it would dry up today, I said it&#x27;ll dry up quickly when the rain stops. reply floodedburner 15 hours agoparentprevOriginal forecast called for 1 day of rain at .3\". Forecast as of now has 3 days of rain and a total of 1\".Government involvement will incur a fee to the org. All the BLM LEO rolled off playa to avoid this. reply contravariant 14 hours agorootparentJust an inch of rain over 3 days doesn&#x27;t sound that bad. Wind, hail and lightning are more pressing dangers if big thunderclouds develop. reply nwallin 14 hours agorootparentBurning man is in the Black Rock Desert. The Black Rock Desert is an endorheic basin. There are no outflows. The lake bed itself is 1,000 sq miles. The drainage that drains into the lake bed is 11,600 sq miles.An inch of rain isn&#x27;t a big deal, but when you concentrate it 11:1 it becomes very serious very quickly. reply EricE 12 hours agorootparentprevDesert ground is hard and mostly impervious. That 1\" of rain will mostly run off from the surrounding area into the now not so dry lakebed. There&#x27;s a dry lakebed not far from me a little smaller than up there and an inch of rain can easily lead to a foot of standing water if the rain happens over a widespread area in the watershed of that lakebed. I hope they packed stilts! reply floodedburner 14 hours agorootparentprevOne hundredth of an inch impacts travel on the dried lake bed reply ShakataGaNai 8 hours agoparentprevThe article seems to be reporting the facts in a fairly reasonable manner. We have friends who are there and they told us this exact same information: They&#x27;ve been told to conserve, no porta-potty cleaning is coming anytime soon, they may not make it out until Wednesday.The article doesn&#x27;t even say they are running out of supplies, other than the organizers have told people to conserve. reply croes 14 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s all valid as long as people behave rational, what some people don&#x27;t do in such situations. reply DonHopkins 13 hours agorootparentGee, I sure hope nobody at burning man is taking mind altering drugs! ;) reply Mandatum 12 hours agoparentprevThat’s fine. Until you consider the inability to empty the portaloos. reply tapatio 13 hours agoparentprevIt’s been impossible for me to get a ticket to attend. How do I increase my odds of getting one? You’re lucky to have gone 4 times already! reply stickfigure 13 hours agorootparentBurning man has peaked. This year there were tons of people trying to sell their ticket at discount. Some friends were giving away tickets. I don&#x27;t think we will see the same demand again. Which is good - 70k people is more than enough.Next year, just watch craigslist or fb marketplace a month beforehand. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentOr maybe people&#x27;s ability to attend is simply a function of the economy, which is currently in high interest rate territory. The cost to attend is the equivalent of a trip to Europe for a week or a month, depending on how you roll. With things how they are, people simply can&#x27;t take the time off work or afford to go. reply darkclouds 11 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ll have about 250k people at Glastonbury, but there is alot to do at Glastonbury having been a few times, so 70k sounds rather cosy, which seems so unusual for the US which normally does things bigger and better.Going to Burning Man is something on my bucket list, which is why your comment surprised me, how can you say its peaked? reply ethanbond 11 hours agorootparent80% of the time when someone says an event peaked it’s because they’ve aged out of the event or the event evolved in a way that wasn’t to their liking.You should totally go if you get a chance, but to be clear Burning Man is not a music festival a la Glasto. It’s much more of an art festival than anything else, and it’s really spectacular.Also just ignore the lore around anti-capitalism, eco friendly yada yada. It’s a really sick party for super rich people and the artists they patronize. reply stickfigure 7 hours agorootparentIt is possible to have the opinion that burning man is great and also that it has hit the upper bound of popularity.This year was different - it was super easy to get tickets, often at steep discount. I don&#x27;t see why next year will be different, especially with horror stories getting off the playa this year.This is a good thing! If you want to go, now you can. reply darkclouds 59 minutes agorootparentprevThis YT video from 2019 seems like a good explainer.It does attract some good DJ&#x27;s though, I mean a $3-8m 70KW moving sound system&#x2F;dance floor seems pretty awesome, aka the Mayan Warrior.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QRbC3GPW1HI?t=1290 reply frisco 13 hours agorootparentprevYou should find a camp to join that can help coordinate tickets. (Whether Directed Group Sale or just having the network for overflow tickets.) Unless you’re prepared to spend $$$ and suffer through figuring out a lot to truly DIY it, it’ll be a much better experience to be part of a camp that knows what it is doing anyway. reply hgsgm 14 hours agoparentprevYou are being breathless and ridiculous. The article is reporting the facts.People are blocked in, and could be blocked in for more days. They need more food and water than thet expected when they packed. Some people probably underpacked reply jeremyt 14 hours agorootparentHave you been to burning man, because it sounds like you have not.Food and water is everywhere. They will not run out unless this thing lasts another week.If some people run out, others will have extra. Of this I am 100% sure. reply somewhereoutth 11 hours agorootparentFood and water are everywhere until they are not.70k ppl consume a vast quantity of food and water every hour. Once stuff runs out things get dicey very fast. Yes another week would almost surely lead to that eventuality - but when is the tipping point exactly? Hard to know.Food ppl can manage without for a couple of days, but water is a different matter. Many camps may be relying on regular top ups of their water cube, and camp mates may not bring reserves because of the camp provided water. If water cannot get into BRC then you have a simple maths problem - water on playa &#x2F; ppl on playa = time. reply pcdoodle 14 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;re going to run out of water!How?Because of all the rain! reply eastbound 12 hours agorootparentIn France, media told us underground water reserves were overflowing after hyping drought for 6 months (tip: if you don’t cherry-pick the stats, there is no more drought than every year). So they argued that drought causes the overflowing of phreatic reserves. Later during the summer we had heavy rains. Now everyone jokes that we have heavy rains due to drought.Seriously I hope the media will stop preaching in one direction. Today they try to demonstrate GW, but miserably fail at it, since they’re commenting weather and not climate. They’re doing more damage than they solve. reply giantrobot 14 hours agorootparentprevAs we all know, when there&#x27;s a supply of things there&#x27;s also perfect distribution of those things according to individual need. This is doubly true in situations where future supply might have unknown constraints.It&#x27;s also a well known fact mud and stagnant water don&#x27;t bare anything pathogens that can change the dynamics of individual need. reply chmod600 13 hours agorootparentWe are talking about something on the order of a week here. Are you suggesting that survival-level us-vs-them greed will take hold in that timeframe? reply giantrobot 12 hours agorootparentHaving met people before, yes. replyjakderrida 10 hours agoparentprevWhile I don&#x27;t disagree with you at all, the majority of burners are probably not well supplied build leads for their own camps. I went last year and while I was very well supplied and had a large RV with my own solar-powered refrigerator, I met up with friends that were not as wealthy and probably fit the typical profile for burners. They stayed in a tent, were at a camp with a centralized power source with a somewhat strict rationing system. They typically planned out their day such that most meals involved free food prepared using ingredients procured from a service that required driving into the campgrounds to make deliveries every day to many different camps. Many burners depend on water that is also delivered by water trucks that to perform water deliveries that were ordered and scheduled weeks before the event. You may be neglecting that not everybody is well-supplied and could barely afford the ticket and transportation. reply zerbinxx 9 hours agorootparentWhich is why the “radical self-reliance” thing is so ironic&#x2F;sad in this situation. Most people aren’t there for that, despite the warnings that RSR is part of the deal, the fact is that anyone who’s particularly interested in that kind of experience is already solo backpacking or something this weekend. reply jakderrida 4 hours agorootparentDamn... I am man enough to concede that you just Uno-Reversed my argument. You even had the sense not to introduce new thoughts that I could potentially attack out of spitefulness.

To me, at first they looked like hire a cop from the festival. While it looked like the first Ranger truck started a dialog, another decided to go a more violent route. There are a few cuts in the vid there, so it&#x27;s not clear how long dialog was tried or what happened during that time and how justified the violent end was.Coming from a country where police are generally pretty chill unless really provoked, how this was ended seemed extreme to me.The comments in the vid kinda scare me tbh.

In general these guys do the best with what they’ve got and they probably hate BM and all the hassle it brings. A normal weekend in rural Nevada requires maybe a call about a rancher’s lost livestock or a normal patrol route. These guys are certainly ill equipped to handle 70k outsiders showing up for a week, and particularly not well equipped for settling interpersonal&#x2F;ideological disputes elegantly. I think their “ram down the barricade” strategy is pretty parsimonious given the time and tools they have to deal with protests and angry travelers. reply standardUser 7 hours agorootparentBurning Man has been happening there for 30 years.

That is, the mud on the playa turns corrosive when mixed with water? reply jandrewrogers 14 hours agorootparentThe playas in Nevada aren&#x27;t \"dirt\" in the conventional sense. They are covered in layers of alkali salts that precipitated out of the lakes that used to be there, with chemistry influenced by Nevada&#x27;s active volcanic geology. It can be quite corrosive and you probably don&#x27;t want to subject your skin to it for extended periods of time. Nevada has a very wide range of pH found in nature due to its geochemistry. reply lazide 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’ll definitely screw up your skin (not fatally), and can cause corrosion to vehicles and the like. It’s mostly alkaline though. So think (weak) lye, not acidic.PH is around 10 reply pcl 15 hours agorootparentprevYes — the lake beds in the west are generally covered in alkali dust. Add water and you get a caustic basic mud slurry. reply riffic 15 hours agorootparentprevis there something not hard to believe about that? reply rcme 15 hours agorootparentKind of, yes. Normally one thinks of something like lye being caustic, not dirt, even when wet. reply jamal-kumar 14 hours agorootparentWell think about it this wayBaking soda (Sodium bicarbonate) is something like pH 8, sodium carbonate (What you get if you put bicarbonate in the oven at 400 degrees for an hour or so) is something like ph 10-11, and is a large component of alkalai soils. [1] You probably won&#x27;t have a problem with baking soda but the more basic form of it (as we call &#x27;washing soda&#x27;) is definitely something you don&#x27;t want on your skin for long periods of time. I suggest making some in the oven to soak some soiled socks or something you have - but careful breathing the dust in, you&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s way sharper on your nose than baking soda.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alkali_soil reply convolvatron 15 hours agorootparentprevnot even just when mixed with water. you can develop some really nasty cracks and lesions. reply hnthrow835651 15 hours agoparentprevYep, most of Nevada used to be covered by a massive lake.

So anyone who’s actually on their shit will have enough food, water, etc to wait for it to dry out and leave normally. They even explicitly advise bringing a bucket to turn into a makeshift toilet if something like this happens and shuts down the porta potties.That said, I’d bet a sizable fraction of the attendees are completely unprepared or dependent on others to get them ready. Probably people will share extra supplies with them. Maybe this entire event will expose just how commercialized it’s gotten. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentDespite the existence of shift pods, and plug and play camping, it&#x27;s not \"Burning Man, brought to you by Budget Rental\" level of commercialized.

When it rains, in less than 10 feet, your cars tires will be 50 submerged. So you can&#x27;t even make it 100 ft, much less to the paved road to Gerlach. reply MarkMarine 14 hours agoparentprevIt’s not dire. People overpack, and anyone asking for water or food will get it. There won’t be ice, people’s generators will run out of gas, and I’m sure some people will run out of acid and have nothing to do, but no one is going to need supplies air dropped in. reply Gibbon1 10 hours agoparentprevThere isn&#x27;t any food or sales at the event so everyone packs enough for a week. Which really means people pack for two weeks. People also bring enough water for a week of 100 degree weather. But it&#x27;s not that.Friend had a rubbermaid food bin he used for camping.

One of my friends was up there and bailed out yesterday for that reason.One of my long term thoughts about the event is the BLM really needs to require those guys to buy and install ground protection mats to put on their gate road.

There&#x27;s a road leading up there, right? (or at least somewhere near the festival grounds). Most people will come by car or RV. They can still drive on that road I&#x27;d think?If the festival grounds turn to mud, well... maybe a little detour to get back on that road.(personally I&#x27;d be in no hurry to leave. But if you wanted to, what&#x27;s holding you back? Organisers saying \"road closed\"?) reply jowday 14 hours agorootparentThe event is held several miles “into” the dry lake bed - once you get off the paved road, you drive about 1.5 miles on the dry lake bed before you get to the “gate” of the event boundaries. You can see this pretty clearly if you look up its location on Google maps. Right now, the event is completely surrounded, for miles, by muddy lake bed. If you tried to drive your wheels would get jammed up. reply bhhaskin 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not regular mud, and you can&#x27;t really drive on it.

And I think a large fraction of the attendees are. If this was the camp I used to run with, the collective response to this would be to view it as an annoyance, but not life threatening - everyone was on top of their shit and had enough food, water, and shelter to last out something like this. And in fact, people would give you shit if you came around asking for help saying that you didn’t expect rain like this. You’re very explicitly told when buying a ticket that shit like this can happen and you should be prepared to deal with it yourself.Whether this turns into something requiring external help or evacuation depends on what portion of the attendees really are on top of their shit in 2023. reply idopmstuff 15 hours agoparentprev> theres absolutely no reason to \"conserve food and water.\"Seems like the reason is so folks can get through the next couple of days without involving the National Guard, which is costly.

Technically it&#x27;s not even in Nevada, it&#x27;s in the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian Reservation3. Kind of the entire point of Burning Man is that you are raising a city out of nothing and breaking it down again within the span of a couple weeks against all odds and in one of the least hospitable places on the planet. This is by design. As a participant you are given ample information and time to plan for such eventualities, they are not necessarily predictable but you definitely can and should be prepared for the worst out there. To be blunt, this is what they signed up for. It&#x27;s a prepper-lite (\"radical self-reliance\" is one of the founding principles) kind of event. I say this as someone who really enjoyed my time there in past years -- everyone is welcome to attend if they feel up for it, but they are also expected to know what they&#x27;re getting into and to carry their own weight if things get bad. Not that they will be left to die, as \"civic responsibility\" is another of the principles embodied by the population of Black Rock City for its duration.Protip for interested readers: anyone calling Burning Man a \"festival\" outs themselves as having absolutely no idea what they&#x27;re talking about and are perpetuating the kinds of narratives that contribute to the flippant and commercialized miasma that has settled around the event over the past years. reply bhhaskin 15 hours agorootparentIt isn&#x27;t on the Reservation.
