Some recommend separating the router from the access point for better coverage and suggest using APs with dedicated radios for backhaul traffic for proper mesh networking. Users also discuss the drawbacks of certain manufacturers' devices, including shady anti-user features, mandatory cloud accounts, and undocumented or non-removable tracking tools. It is important to prioritize security and transparency when selecting network equipment.- Mesh networks may halve bandwidth, but newer solutions support MU-MIMO with separate backhaul\n- For better support of roaming/fast handoff, Ethernet connection is ideal\n- 802.11r is only useful when using WPA enterprise authentication, 11r adds mobility domain and FT-PSK, good for WPA2.

Some users recommend building a router using old hardware with Proxmox or purchasing an APU router from teklager.se. The discussion includes suggestions for resolving issues with wireless connectivity and hardware chipsets. There is also speculation about errors caused by the chknvram component of the asd service for ASUS firmware. Overall, the discussion provides readers with a variety of options and considerations for selecting and configuring a router.ASUS routers have been deleting files due to a malwares scanner marking them as malicious, despite being legitimate files. Some users have reported losing significant amounts of data. Users mount discs to routers to share files or install extra software. Routers can also double as budget NAS devices or print servers. Firmware updates for routers are essential to maintain security and prevent botnets from using compromised routers. While software from consumer routers is often exploitable, updating firmware decreases vulnerabilities. Logs should prioritize simplicity over deduplication.The post discusses syslogd's handling of repeated log messages. Some commenters express concern about the lack of timestamps for repeated occurrences, while others argue that within a certain threshold, it is not an issue. The discussion also touches on the ASUS Healing System, a feature that some speculate periodically checks system health and reboots or restarts a daemon if needed. There are also discussions around router firmware updates, automated update features, and concerns about botched updates or telemetry. Finally, there are anecdotes and discussions about the reliability and quality of consumer-grade hardware, and how it compares to custom and commercial routers.No meaningful content to summarize.",

While non-tech users may not know what a PWA is, the ChatGPT webapp audience is almost entirely nontechnical, hence the need for native apps in the App Store. The in-app purchase to upgrade to the Plus version is easy to use and cancel, and is subject to Apple's 15% fee (unless earnings exceed $1 million a year). The voice input feature may not work in the iOS app.Users complain about the poor search function on the AppStore, leading to difficulty finding apps even when searching with the exact name. The delay in indexing new apps is attributed to a \"cold start\" issue and takes a few days before indexing. Some users cannot find the OpenAI official app on AppStore due to trademark infringement or cold start issues. Complaints regarding Apple's lack of flexibility on organizing icons and the inability to transfer files via USB, among other issues, lead many to prefer Android devices.

If a building has materials with some chemically-insignificant mixture of uranium and thorium, such as concrete or granite, then the radon can diffuse out of the material into the air. This is part of your normal background radiation, unless you have accidentally built a concrete basement with granite countertops and poor air exchange with the outdoors, in which case the radon can accumulate.When radon does decay, the decays leave behind ionized atoms of the heavy metals polonium, lead, and bismuth. These ions neutralize by reacting with the air. Here my chemistry is weak, but my assumption is that they are most likely to oxide, and I assume further that the oxide molecules are electrically polarized, like the water molecule (the stable oxide of hydrogen) is polarized.Polarized or polarizable objects are attracted to strong electric fields, even when the polarized object is electrically neutral. Imagine a static electric field around a positive charge. A dipole nearby will feel a torque until its negative end points towards the static positive charge. But because the field gets weaker away from the static charge, there\u2019s now more attractive force on the negative end of the dipole than there is repulsive force on the positive end, so the dipole accelerates towards the stronger field. If you used to have a cathode-ray television, you may remember the way the positively-charged screen would attract dust much more than other nearby surfaces.Clothes dryers are very effective at making statically charged surfaces. (Dryer sheets help.) So when radon and its temporary decay products are blown through the dryer, electrically-polarized molecules tend to be attracted to the charged surfaces. The decay chain isisotope half-life decay mode222-Rn 3.8 days alpha218-Po 3.1 minutes alpha214-Pb 27 minutes beta214-Bi 20 minutes beta214-Po microseconds alpha210-Pb years irrelevantIf your Geiger counter is actually detecting radiation, it's almost certainly the half-hour lead and bismuth. Constructing a decay curve would make a neat home experiment (but challenging given what you've told us here).True story: I was once prevented from leaving a neutron-science facility at Los Alamos after the seat of my pants set off a radiation alarm on exit. This was odd because the neutron beam had been off for weeks. It was a Saturday, so the radiation safety technician on call didn't arrive for half an hour \u2014 at which point I was clean, so the detective questions began. I had spent the day sitting on a plastic step stool. The tech looked at it, said that radon's decay products are concentrated by static electricity, and told me that I needed to get a real chair.ShareCiteImprove this answerFollowedited yesterdayanswered yesterdayrob\u266681.8k1919 gold badges156156 silver badges306306 bronze badges7Do you think the door being open/closed would affect the readings?

The static electricity created by clothes dryers can attract charged particles like radon present in the air, which could explain some Geiger counter readings. However, hobbyist-level Geiger counters are not necessarily able to detect all types of radiation, especially alpha radiation. Ingested radioactive materials, like polonium-210, cannot be detected externally by some radiation detectors.

One comment mentions the discovery of radon in homes due to air-tight construction in the 1980s, leading to the creation of the radon mitigation industry. Another notes that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking. The comment thread also briefly discusses the topic of artificial intelligence, specifically in regards to GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) and their potential usefulness in replacing knowledge workers. Some commenters appreciate the opportunity to learn about these topics through internet discussions, while others express amusement at anecdotes shared by other users.Florida is using phosphogypsum, a waste product of the fertilizer industry that contains high quantities of radium that decays into radon, a cancer-causing radioactive gas, in test road construction, despite experts' concerns. Phosphogypsum is highly radioactive and presents a potential risk to public health because radon gas produced by the material can accumulate in nearby homes. Radon checks are, therefore, a standard part of home inspections, even though remediation can be costly. However, the cost is much lower if installed in the foundation during house construction, making radon-resistant new construction (RRNC) a popular choice. Radon ventilation costs may surpass $2,000 CAD if sub-slab depressurization with a fan is required. At the sub-$1,000 mark, a Better Geiger S-1 dosimeter is one of the best consumer options. However, dosimeters are less accurate than professional equipment.Sorry, but there is not enough meaningful content to provide a summary.",

While better graphics can sometimes be beneficial, it is not always necessary and can negatively impact gameplay, forcing games to compromise on other aspects. There is currently a debate among AAA studios regarding the focus on graphics over gameplay. False marketing has led to high expectations, leading to disappointment, and the majority of players cannot run games with the highest graphics settings. Lastly, some users criticize companies for prioritizing graphics and other technical aspects over gameplay and story.Comments on a forum discuss gaming industry trends. While some commenters appreciate the art and style presented in games, others criticize the emphasis on graphics at the expense of gameplay innovation. The conversation focuses on recent releases, including early access games that underdeliver, while praising longstanding franchises like The Legend of Zelda for continuing to provide complete game experiences without forced online play or pay-to-play mechanics. Zelda\u2019s newest release includes impressive mechanics such as the ability to build machines and jump through any ceiling surface. Some argue that innovative gameplay, not just beautiful graphics, is what makes a game successful. Criticisms of poor game mechanics are also noted, with poor frames per second (fps) on the Switch hardware cited as one example.Nintendo has a history of using proven technology to create new experiences rather than chasing bleeding-edge graphics. This has led to successful products like the Wii, which focuses on motion controls, and the Switch, which combines portability with console gameplay. While Nintendo does care about technology, they prioritize gameplay mechanics, art direction, and story over fancy features. They have been successful in using familiar technology in new ways, such as docking computers. The 6-year-old Switch is still selling well due to its compelling IP, and backward compatibility could continue to drive future sales. While the Steam Deck and Switch share similarities, characterizing the Steam Deck as a Switch clone is not entirely correct as the Steam Deck is a fully moddable PC that plays Steam games.Commentators discuss Nintendo's strategy over time and the success of its consoles. They mention Nintendo's focus on gameplay, art direction, and accessibility over raw specs and technological advancements for its consoles. The commentators also mention the success of games like Minecraft that prioritize accessible gameplay over graphics fidelity. The article briefly mentions the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming device that some liken to a Nintendo Switch clone. Emulation of Nintendo consoles is also briefly discussed.The thread on HN discusses different gaming experiences of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch console vs. emulated versions running on more powerful hardware; a user argues that the game might have benefited from more graphics performance to better render the game world and dynamic weather effects, but someone refutes that the game was designed for a mobile GPU. Some users challenge the idea that FPS is critical to gameplay, but others acknowledge the immersion-breaking stutters; one user mentions the game's \"gacha\" mechanic but explains that it's not real gambling since there's no way to spend money on it.Comments on multiple aspects of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's gameplay and performance were made in this thread, including discussions of gacha mechanics, microtransactions, FPS drops, and design decisions. Many commenters praised the game's visuals, with some acknowledging the limitations of the Switch hardware in maintaining a stable frame rate. Some commenters criticized the game's occasional frame rate drops down to single digits, while others noted that similar performance issues exist in AAA titles generally. While some commenters noted that gambling mechanisms have existed in games for a long time, others argued that the toxicity of microtransactions and \"loot boxes\" has worsened in recent years. Finally, some pointed to the significance of optimization in the face of complex game programming and developmental deadlines.",

    "content": "Skip to contentVOICES OF OPEN SOURCEAboutDonateHomeSearchMay 16, 2023Simon PhippsOSI opinionAnother issue with the Cyber Resilience Act: European standards bodies are inaccessible to Open Source projectsOne of the proposals in the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is that European standards bodies should develop suitable standards that help simplify conformance. Bert Hubert explains how this might work in his extensive CRA explainer.There\u2019s a crucial issue here for Open Source. EU policy experts say not to worry about CRA compliance because the EU standards bodies will streamline it. But the European Standardisation Organizations (ESO) are corporate-controlled, patent-loving and expensive to engage. Shouldn\u2019t the EU address this if they want Open Source accommodated?In Europe, standards requests from the European Commission are handled by bodies which have been designated an ESO under EU law. There are only three of these; CEN, CENELEC and ETSI. None of these standards development organizations are accessible to Open Source projects per se.CEN and CENELEC are largely controlled by national standards bodies which in turn are dominated by national industries, while ETSI is a member organization with high membership fees and largely secret proceedings (although laudable with free specifications) that is directly controlled by its members, predominantly from the telecoms industries but also including the European states. In addition, ETSI celebrates its role as a pioneer and proponent of FRAND licensing, which is fundamentally incompatible with Open Source communities. As with all de jure standards, participation in each of these standards bodies is expensive, both financially and in time, and engaging in their governance is beyond the scope of small players.Given this context, when the European Commission requests standards that will be applied for conformity assessment, it\u2019s not clear how they will take into account the development workflow that applies to Open Source software. Like the European Commission itself (as I commented recently), Europe\u2019s standards bodies have no functional relationships with Open Source charities and do not consult them.It is very important to find ways to give a voice to the true community and not just its corporate members. As things currently stand, Open Source will only be considered through the lens of its corporate uses. Since Open Source is a social movement with software artifacts for which the applications are diverse, paying heed only to the attributes of the software and the needs of the companies consuming it is an inadequate approach. You can\u2019t even proxy through small business, let alone multinationals and their lobbyists \u2013 many of them are unaware of how communities work and without community understanding, fundamental errors can be made.As a result, I believe whatever legislation arises from the CRA (and related instruments) needs to specify that standards bodies making related standards must include effective measures to consult and include the Open Source community. If this doesn\u2019t happen, as NLnet Labs explained, \u201cThe only alternatives left available are the conformity assessment procedures that involve paying for third-party process auditors.\u201d And Open Source developers definitely can\u2019t afford that.This article first appeared on Webmink in Draft.Image Walls Within Walls by Simon Phipps.MentionsWe support webmentions.

The standards have legal weight, and not complying means products can't be sold in the EU. Working out which standards to comply with is difficult, as they reference each other in a cascading web, and viewing them costs \u20ac150 each. Standards are written by authors on the payroll of businesses in the industry. Small EU companies lack the resources to spend on standards and a legal department to check that they are conforming. The markets for public services, government, and EU agencies are restricted to big corporations, leaving small companies unable to sell their products. Standards should be free and open or have no legal weight.Many established companies from Western Europe, mostly Germany, gained new markets and labor from Eastern European countries in return for money, but the quality of life and cost of living for Eastern Europeans has increased significantly. Most energy, oil, and gas companies, as well as banks, are owned by Western enterprises, and profits go to them. Eastern European food products, largely made by German or French companies, are often of a low quality and more expensive. Eastern Europe receives disproportionate amounts of EU subsidies, but lacks economic and political power in the EU. Issues of discrimination, inequality, and corruption continue to prevent solidarity across the European continent, and some commentators suggest that a more ideologically cohesive core may arise in the future.Readers are discussing the economic impacts of EU membership, particularly on Eastern European countries; some argue that the EU is a rigged market that benefits Western countries, while others maintain that EU membership provides access to a free market. Despite some challenges, many Italian citizens still support their country's membership in the EU. Apple's proprietary Lightning charging port is compared unfavorably to the USB-C standard.The comment section discusses topics such as European Union regulations on technology, standards compendiums, and copyrighting laws. Several users express their frustration with the high cost of ISO standards and believe that standards should be free and open. The lack of vision in restricting access to standards that could lead to economic growth is also highlighted. It is noted that while Chinese products that do not meet European Union standards are not officially permitted, enforcement is difficult and often relies on individual packages not being sold through EU retailers. Overall, the conversation covers various aspects of the intersection between technology, government regulations, and commerce.Developers and open source advocates are expressing concern over a proposed EU legislation that would require developers to comply with certain security standards when marketing their products in the EU. The EU Essential Cybersecurity Requirements mandate for critical software and products could impose huge fines for noncompliance. Open source developers are worried that this would cut off the grassroots, small competitors who cannot financially afford to get these certifications. Advocates are arguing for accessible and inexpensive standards and the creation of a FOSS politics group that can liaise with policymakers in the EU. Some suggest politicians should be required to have an open source repository as a precondition for office, while others argue that everything should be built on open standards with an Apache Foundation-like to handle all of it.- Discussion around access to standards and the limitations and costs associated with them.\n- Criticism of organizations like ISO and ITU-T for holding back development due to paywalled standards.\n- Calls for FOSS developers to write their own standards since megacorps heavily influence pricing and membership.\n- Emphasis on the importance of simple but effective standards that allow for real-life alternatives and legal considerations.\n- Sarcasm around the idea that \"security\" measures in software are really about controlling who can create and release software, with a focus on Big Tech and their financial resources.",

    "content": "Supreme Court Rules Andy Warhol\u2019s Prince Art is Copyright InfringementMAY 18, 2023 JARON SCHNEIDERThe United States Supreme Court has released its opinion on The Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith case, finding in favor of Lynn Goldsmith and stating that Warhol\u2019s use of her photo was not fair use.For those unfamiliar, the Warhol v. Goldsmith case has been ongoing for several years and involves photographer Lynn Goldsmith\u2019s photo of Prince and Andy Warhol\u2019s use of that photo which his Foundation argues was fair use.The details of the case to this point can be read in prior coverage, but in summary, Goldsmith had been victorious in the most recent court\u2019s decision leading up to this point. The Andy Warhol Foundation had appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, who has affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision and sealed Goldsmith\u2019s win.Photo Courtesy / \u00a9Lynn GoldsmithIn an 87-page, seven-to-two opinion written by Justice Sotomayor, the Supreme Court has ruled that Warhol\u2019s use of Goldsmith\u2019s Prince photo was not transformative enough to warrant fair use and was instead a violation of her copyright. Justices Roberts and Kagan dissented.\u201cAlthough new expression, meaning, or message may be relevant to whether a copying use has a sufficiently distinct purpose or character, it is not, without more, dispositive of the first factor,\u201d the court holds.\u201cThe \u2018purpose and character\u2019 of Andy Warhol Foundation\u2019s (AWF) use of Goldsmith\u2019s photograph in commercially licensing Orange Prince to Cond\u00e9 Nast does not favor AWF\u2019s fair use defense to copyright infringement.\u201dThe opinion continues:\u201cAWF contends that the Prince Series works are \u2018transformative,\u2019 and that the first fair use factor thus weighs in AWF\u2019s favor, because the works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. But the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an allegedly infringing use has a further purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like commercialism.\u201cAlthough new expression, meaning, or message may be relevant to whether a copying use has a sufficiently distinct purpose or character, it is not, without more, dispositive of the first factor. Here, the specific use of Goldsmith\u2019s photograph alleged to infringe her copyright is AWF\u2019s licensing of Orange Prince to Cond\u00e9 Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF\u2019s copying use of it share substantially the same purpose. Moreover, AWF\u2019s use is of a commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds new expression to Goldsmith\u2019s photograph, in the context of the challenged use, the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith.\u201dAs noted by the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP), while the opinion is lengthy and is still being analyzed, it is clear that \u201cin large measure Goldsmith prevailed and this holding is a restraint on \u2018fair use\u2019 as a defense to the type of infringement seen in this case.\u201dBreaking Down the RulingBoth the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) and the ASMP are celebrating the ruling as a win for photographers.\u201cThe importance here cannot be overstated,\u201d Thomas Maddrey, Chief Legal Officer and Head of National Content and Education at ASMP, says.\u201cThe last case that the US Supreme Court fully opined on transformation and fair use was more than 25 years ago in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose. Here, the Court has added much needed guidance to when a use is truly \u2018fair\u2019 and when it is an impermissible usurpation of the rights of the copyright holder.\u201dLynn Goldsmith with her attorney Lisa Blatt outside U.S. Supreme Court on October 12, 2022 after oral arguments in her case. | Photo by Mickey H OsterreicherMaddrey says that the case will likely have wide-ranging implications in not only the arts community, but also across all intellectual property areas.\u201cCopyright practitioners have long sought clarification on what \u201ctransformation\u201d actually means in the context of a fair use analysis.\u201dThe court has clearly identified the boundaries of what constitutes transformation in the context of fair use analysis.\u201cAWF wanted to say that any use that gives the underlying work new message, meaning, or expression is transformation, the Court held that is not the case; other factors must be considered at this stage as well,\u201d Maddrey continues.\u201cThe Court here uses unambiguous language to eliminate an oft-used point raised in fair use analysis. Simply adding \u2018some new expression, meaning or message\u2019 does NOT, in and of itself, create a transformational use. Period. The fact that the Court fully understood the impact on photography that the interpretation AWF was taking would have is vital. If all that it took to be considered fair use is that there was some degree of difference in expression, meaning, or message, then it would be open season on photographs for all sorts of purposes,\u201d he explains.Lynn Goldsmith with her legal team outside U.S. Supreme Court on October 12, 2022 after oral arguments in her case. | Photo by Mickey H Osterreicher\u201cNo more needs to be said. This is what groups like ASMP and photographers have been saying since the beginning of this matter. And now the Supreme Court has heard all arguments and rendered their opinion. And their opinion is in support of Goldsmith\u2019s right to create and make a living in her profession.\u201d\u201cGiven that the NPPA was one of the amici in this extremely important case we are very pleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisive 7-2 ruling addressing the contours of fair use,\u201d Mickey H. Osterreicher, General Councel for the NPPA tells PetaPixel.\u201cUnfortunately, the exponential growth of fair use as a defense to copyright has turned copyright protection of photographs on its head where the exception had almost subsumed the rule. Hopefully this opinion will now cause those who believe that images are free for the taking to reconsider their position and seek to obtain permission from the photographer, along with a proper license, credit, and fair compensation. We are very grateful to all of those who supported our efforts to address this problem, especially Lynn Goldsmith, her legal team and those organizations who joined along with ASMP in our amicus brief.\u201dUpdate 5/28: Added context and explanations from the ASMP and NPPA.CULTURE, LAW, NEWSANDYWARHOL, ASMP, COPYRIGHT, COPYRIGHTINFRINGEMENT, DISPUTE, INFRINGEMENT, LAWSUIT, LEGAL, LYNNGOLDSMITH, PRINCE, RULING, SUPREMECOURTRELATED ARTICLESJudge Rules Fair Use in Photographer's Copyright Case Against Andy WarholPhotographer Wins Copyright Battle Over Warhol's Use of Her PhotoThe Supreme Court Will Hear the Warhol Copyright Case TomorrowAndy Warhol Estate Sues Photog Over Prince Photo Copyright FightU.S. Copyright Office Argues Warhol's Use of Prince Photo Was Not 'Fair Use'DISCUSSIONLOAD COMMENTS",

    "hn_content": "The Supreme Court recently ruled that Andy Warhol\u2019s Prince art is copyright infringement. The case is centered on whether Warhol\u2019s Prince works qualified as transformative art or not. The decision was based on the fact that the works were used in an article about Prince, which is considered a different purpose. The ruling highlights the importance of licensing works, which is necessary regardless of whether they are stock photos or famous people. The case has sparked discussion on the legal concept of transformative art and how it applies to different mediums such as visual arts and music. The ruling also reflects the complicated mess caused by eternal copyrights.The recent Supreme Court ruling on fair use in copyright cases has created confusion amongst legal experts and the public. The case involved Andy Warhol's use of a photograph of Prince taken by Lynn Goldsmith, which was transformed into several versions of art prints. The court ruled that Warhol's art was not sufficiently transformative to qualify for fair use protection due to its commercial purpose. Some argue that the ruling lacked an understanding of the context and meaning of art and highlights the need for art experts to advise judges. The discussion also touches on the inheritability of intellectual property, and views differ on whether or not it promotes progress or merely enriches heirs.The comments section contains discussions on various topics, including copyright laws and the Andy Warhol Copyright Case. One comment mentions the importance of having fixed-term copyright laws instead of copyright laws extending beyond the life of the creator. The main topic of discussion is how wealth passed down through generations can lead to laziness, entitlement, and corruption. One commentator shares their experience of growing up without many resources and how their parents raised them to appreciate hard work and not waste resources. They believe in encouraging their children to provide value to others and to become capable individuals. The discussion touches on issues like personal responsibility, entitlement, and how to raise children to become better people. Overall, there is an emphasis on the importance of hard work, not wasting resources, and raising children to become capable individuals.This text is a conversation about copyright law and the use of generative AI to create artwork. Key points include:\n\n- The discussion includes debates about the legality of copying artwork and whether AI-generated works could be considered infringing on copyright.\n- There are examples of legal cases that explore likeness rights and the use of AI in recreating a specific voice or likeness.\n- There is debate about whether generative AI packages can create entirely novel artwork or if they only generate work based on the previous object and external changes.\n- The conversation includes references to fair use factors in US copyright law and the de minimis doctrine, which allows for trivial copying without being considered infringement.\n- Some reference is made to Andy Warhol's art and his use of copying images.\n- There are no new or exciting developments or releases mentioned in this text.The Supreme Court ruling on the lawsuit between photographer Goldsmith and the Warhol Foundation, which involved the use of a Warhol painting of Prince based on a photograph taken by Goldsmith, affirmed Goldsmith's copyright and clarified that simply adding new expression to a work does not necessarily make it transformative or fair use if it still has the same purpose as the original; this could have implications for AI-generated art. Justices Kagan and Roberts dissented. The ruling generated discussion about the complicated issues of copyright law, enforcement, and artistic transformation, including satire and commentary, and several HN commenters added personal anecdotes and examples of copyright-related cases.The Supreme Court handed down a decision in the closely-watched copyright case of Goldsmith v. Warhol. The ruling tests the \"purpose and character of use\" factor in the fair use doctrine. The commercial nature of use is relevant, but not dispositive. The same copying may be fair when used for one purpose but not another. The decision in favor of the plaintiff, Lynn Goldsmith, had a very limited scope. Andy Warhol's use of Prince's photograph was ruled to be infringing because it was for the same kind of commercial use as Goldsmith's licensed photograph. The ruling does not contemplate AI-generated art, and it is not the end of 'fair use' law as many comments suggested. Copyright is upheld to prevent moneyed interest from copying and dominating audiences.The posts discuss the flaws and issues with copyright laws, primarily related to issues such as duration of copyright, ownership by corporations, and protecting small artists. The current system is considered broken, and some believe that it only benefits the wealthy and powerful. Suggestions for reforms include shorter copyright durations, limited control over copyrights transferred to corporations, and limits on profit-earning from artwork after the artist's death. Some argue for complete abolishment of copyright laws, while others maintain that some form of reform is necessary. While the primary issues with copyright law are related to duration and ownership, there are also concerns related to access to science or art, and the potential for censorship.A discussion on copyright laws and their impact on creativity and access to information. Some argue for reform of copyright laws, with separate provisions for personal and corporate copyrights and a shorter term for software copyrights. Others argue that while current copyright laws are flawed, they still serve a legitimate purpose in encouraging artistic works and preventing unauthorized dissemination of personal material. The discussion raises questions about the potential negative effects of abolishing copyright laws on artists, while also pointing out the overzealous nature of current copyright laws, necessitating targeted reform. Additionally, arguments are made both for and against the financial incentives provided by copyright laws in the creation of new works.The debate surrounding copyright is discussed by various individuals, with some advocating for its abolishment while others insist that it is necessary to ensure creators are able to make a living. Opponents of copyright have not proposed viable solutions for funding creators in the absence of copyright, with some suggesting that purchasing companies like Disney or blackmailing legislators may provide some scope for change. However, critics argue that giving up copyright will lead to a decline in quality entertainment as professionals will no longer be incentivized to create cutting-edge works. Overall, the issue of copyright and its future implications remain contentious and polarizing.",

It also limits me from accessing services like my GP, online help and shopping.\"The government points to a number of steps it has taken to help those who find broadband hard to afford.In June, following negotiations with the government, leaders from major broadband and mobile operators agreed a set of public commitments to support customers struggling to pay their bills.But campaigners the Digital Poverty Alliance echoed the concerns of Citizen Advice and said while social tariff uptake was \"slowly improving\", it was still far below the levels needed to ensure all households were digitally included.\"For households in severe poverty, even an affordable social tariff may mean that essential connectivity is still out of reach,\" the organisation said.Related TopicsCost of livingUniversal CreditBroadbandMore on this storyMillions of families miss out on cheap broadbandPublished24 AprilView comments",

The country's high taxes and significantly higher prices for consumer products were cited as reasons for the cancellations. One person on the Hacker News thread recounted his experience of paying \u00a348 for three hamburgers and two large soft drinks at a well-known food chain. The worker's tax was also mentioned by another thread user, although it was not confirmed if the person was a high earner. There were comparisons to California income tax highlighting that the top marginal rate was higher in California than in the UK at equivalent income levels. VAT in the UK was also mentioned as a significant contributor to the high cost of living.Discussions on taxes and expenses in the UK and US, with mentions of college costs, VAT, and mandatory state-run pension funds. Some commenters discuss the efficiency and quality of healthcare systems in each country, with differing opinions. The conversation also touches on employer contributions for healthcare and their relationship to taxes.The UK is capable of defending itself militarily and spends more than 2% of its GDP on defense, but its defense spending has been criticized as hollowed out. Some NATO members are accused of free-riding on the US for defense spending. The US has a high tax burden including state, local, and federal taxes, and this is often compared to tax rates in the UK. Prices in the UK are generally considered cheaper than in the US. However, the UK has seen rises in the cost of living and struggles with bills and credit. The UK has higher taxes due to various factors such as social benefits and funding for state pension. Brexit and corruption are issues that have raised concerns and reportedly cost money.The text includes various comments discussing the cost of living in the UK and the US and the taxes people pay. Some people claim that the UK is a high tax-wasteland. Others compare the prices of food and the cost of eating out in both countries. There is also a discussion about healthcare, retirement contributions, and tips. It seems that the takeaways for readers new to the industry are the following:\n\n- Taxes and cost of living vary greatly between different regions and countries.\n- It is important to compare salaries and expenses for specific job titles and locations.\n- Healthcare, retirement contributions, and tips are additional factors to consider when calculating expenses.\n- In the US, there is a culture of tipping that may increase the cost of eating out.\n- The cost of living and dining out may be expensive in both the UK and US, but it ultimately depends on where you live.People discuss high tax rates and the complexity of tax systems in the UK, as well as rising prices for fast food chains like Five Guys.

However, amidst the discussion, some suggest solutions like cooking at home or practicing caloric restriction.The debate over the use of fiber optic networks versus mobile connectivity has been ignited by comments from users on an HN thread about the increasing cost of fast food. Some believe that homes should have access to high capacity fiber optic networks as a permanent and reliable backbone, with mobile connectivity as a less important add-on. However, others argue that for some, mobile broadband is sufficient as a substitute for landlines, and that the costs of this option are more manageable. The discussion also centers on the accuracy of descriptions of internet connections as \"fiber\", with some commenters believing that distinctions between fiber and DSL are important to ensure informed consumer decisions.People are reconsidering technological subscriptions and cancelling ones they do not use; pay-as-you-go phone plans combined with free WiFi almost everywhere offer cost-efficient alternatives; establishments have decent WiFi which is easy to connect to if you want to sit there all day, and even offer a protocol where an access point becomes public and automatically switches any device in range on cellular to it if the person does not wish to invest in mobile data. Some users recommend BT Wifi, which is off-set by cellular data usage and lowers phone plan costs, while also reducing the cost of an unlimited phone plan by dividing the broadband price by the number of people in the household.",

    "content": "The article discusses the ways in which conversations around programming languages are often fear-based and bogus. It divides language comparison into three categories: soil, surface, and atmosphere. Soil is the properties of running code in that language, surface refers to the features, and atmosphere is the broader community. The author argues that the current thinking is \"atmosphere at all costs,\" resulting in risk aversion and a fetishization of boring technology choices. Despite this, the author advocates for taking risks and exploring exotic technologies as a means of reducing innovation tokens. The article also discusses the gaps in developers' knowledge of the tools they use and the importance of skilled mentors, arguing that training is a fixed cost per developer and probably smaller than expected.- The article explores the idea of a \"hidden, Third Thing\" that is needed in engineering leadership, beyond just technical expertise or management skills.\n- \"Boring\" is identified as a popular strategy for engineering management, but it is important to consider the limitations and risks of this approach.\n- The author encourages re-evaluating boundaries between technologies and reconsidering \"sacred cows\" in all areas of tech.\n- Tech choice plays a significant role in shaping the path of a company, and it is important to consider training and scalability when making decisions.\n- The article also suggests asking oneself what they don't know about their favorite technologies and exploring ways to level up on tech stacks.",

    "hn_content": "The Hacker News article explores the observation that hackers may be less common today. One theory suggests that developers are not as passionate about hacking as they are about the money. As programming became more lucrative, more people entered the field only for the income. The rise of bootcamps and college programs that train developers for jobs also contributes to this trend. Other factors like parenting responsibilities and work-life balance may lead hackers to lose their passion. Some commenters note a decline in interest in topics like Lisp and software-defined radios. However, others believe that the hacker spirit remains integral to software development and that hacking goes beyond the low levels of the stack. Hacker culture, including opportunities for children to tinker with machines for play, may be different from the pre-2000s, but it persists in different forms. The post suggests that more effort should be made to encourage young people to take up the hacker mindset and that fostering creativity and the love of learning is key.The article discusses the difficulties of mentorship in tech for younger generations. The author notes that the culture and social context of tech are often lost or turning into a mythos. Mentorship in the old way is no longer common, and it is harder to interact with strangers' children due to greater risk aversion. The author focuses on the challenges of cultural knowledge transmission. For instance, few people who could benefit from hacker family cultural knowledge may not come from culturally hacker families, with the ratio of people having that knowledge being very skewed. The author highlights the importance of giving cultural insights and teaching everyone, not only those who can code.A discussion on how the availability of technology has affected the number of hackers. Some argue that the decline in the popularity of physical tinkering contributes to a decline in the number of hackers. The increase in commercial gamified software has led to structured play and has made it difficult for kids to catch on to hacking. People now have less time and energy to dedicate to hobbies outside of work. There has been a huge increase in the number of programmers, but the proportion of hackers has not changed, leading to the conclusion that there are just more people in general. Despite his moral critiques, some acknowledge that Zuckerberg's exceptional depth and breadth of computer knowledge were key in Facebook's growth; the importance of ability to prioritize and satisfice was also noted.The article discusses the idea of \"hackers\" and suggests that while they may still exist, they are less visible due to changes in culture and the industry's focus on making money. Mark Zuckerberg is discussed as an example of a successful entrepreneur who may not be a great software engineer or hacker himself, but who was able to create a powerful social media platform through his drive and vision. The shift to service sector jobs and lack of housing are cited as reasons why there may be fewer hackers, and the current legal landscape and lack of anonymity make it difficult for people to explore and innovate freely. However, some commenters still believe that there are plenty of passionate developers out there who simply need the right opportunity to showcase their skills.People are discussing the decline of the \"hacker culture\" and passion for technology in the current industry. Some attribute the change to a shift towards the commercialization of technology and the increasing focus on making money rather than personal passion. Others suggest that the culture of specialized tinkering has been discouraged by increasingly complex systems and an emphasis on standardization. Some believe that true hackers don't advertise their skills and it's becoming harder to find resources to learn. Overall, it seems that there's a sentiment that passion for technology is becoming less common and less prioritized, and that there are fewer people today truly dedicated to pushing boundaries and exploring the technology landscape for its own sake.The article discusses the changing landscape of programming and how it has become more complex, leading to specialization in certain niches. The author recounts an interaction with a friend who was passionate about a programming language and suggests that conversations about \"atmosphere\" rather than specific features may be more important in safe software engineering. Some commenters criticize the author for belittling his friend and lacking empathy, while others defend the author's argument. The comments include discussions about social skills and the tendency for some programmers to prioritize demonstrating their knowledge over meaningful conversation. Overall, the article and comments provide insight into the evolving world of programming and the social dynamics within the industry.A discussion on a tech forum addresses the problem of MBA programs that allegedly teach a transactional relationship devoid of empathy. One commenter mentioned how MBA programs are designed to think of people as productivity metrics, while another countered that their partner did not experience this in a top 10 MBA program. The conversation shifted to discussions about empathy in conversations about AI and how it's weaponized to de-legitimize others' positions. The American culture of positivity was also brought up, with some saying it feels fake and obnoxious, while others believe that avoiding toxicity is worth it to maintain functional teams.The article explores cultural differences in communication styles in the tech industry, with a focus on American positivity. The author shares an anecdote about a friend who was unaware of garbage collection in Go, framing it as an example of an unfruitful conversation. Some commenters criticize the author for being judgmental or lacking empathy, while others appreciate the honesty in their communication style. The article raises an important question about whether the tech industry should prioritize technical skills over empathy in assessing individuals, and acknowledges the trade-off between equity and effectiveness. Overall, the article offers insight into cultural differences and communication styles in the tech industry.There is no meaningful tech-related content in this text. The discussion revolves around personal opinions on programming languages, as well as debates around social dynamics, empathy, and communication. Some comments criticize the tech industry's focus on buzzwords like \"psychological safety\" and \"vulnerability,\" while others defend the importance of empathy in software development. One point mentions Twitter's switch from Ruby to Scala as an example of spending innovation tokens. There is no new or exciting development discussed in this post.The article discusses the shift in the tech industry from being hacker-driven to business-driven, resulting in a focus on profitability over exploration and experimentation. The author also explores the idea of \"innovation tokens,\" which are used to ensure projects are completed on time and on budget. The article touches upon the cultural war among different programming languages, and the reluctance to work with people in management/business who do not have technical expertise. Finally, the author criticized the idea of making things easy in programming by using tools like JavaScript and Electron, which can result in low-quality software.- A software engineer used math and a pointer to video memory to draw things quickly.\n- Notion and similar tools have become popular because people enjoy pretending to do difficult work.\n- The use of Celery/Sidekiq/WakaQ for siloing is still required in web/api programming, even with proper concurrency primitives.\n- The author of Sidekiq strongly disagrees and believes in the importance of long-term error handling for persistent background jobs.",
    "hn_summary": "- Some commenters believe that the passion for technology is becoming less common, while others hold onto the belief that there are still passionate developers out there.\n- The importance of fostering creativity and a love of learning in younger generations and providing cultural insights is highlighted."

A recent study examined the square one bias in natural language processing and concluded that current NLP methods favor English and Western languages. In a recent analysis of multilingual BERT, researchers discovered that there are significant differences in token lengths between languages that suggest a need for more research in this area. The earth mover\u2019s distance, or Wasserstein distance, was used to compare token length distributions between different languages, demonstrating that the similarity of distributions does not necessarily correspond with linguistic similarities between the languages.",

    "hn_content": "Language models cost more in some languages than others, according to a blog post by an AI engineer. Many users complained about the post being too difficult to read due to the website's Substack platform, but some suggested using Reader Mode to make it easier. An article published earlier this month revealed that Substack, despite being a newsletter service, is burning $7.7 million monthly. It has been suggested that this is due to the company paying writers and other expenses, but it has been noted that the company also raised $65 million in a Series B funding round. The blog post also briefly discusses the difficulties in designing a Morse code for Chinese.A discussion on the number of homonyms in different languages and the difficulties they pose for communication. Chinese has more homonyms than English or Japanese, and Japanese speakers rely on Kanji characters to clarify meaning in speech. While a phonetic writing system is possible for Chinese, it could potentially lead to loss of meaning. A font with both Latin and CJK characters is technically possible, but still faces issues with font fallback and limited support for multiple fonts in some software. The widespread use of English in the internet age has made it the default language for global communication, with the network effect reinforcing its dominance.OpenAI's GPT-3 model requires 10 times more tokens for some languages to express the same sentiment as English. The tokenizer used to minimize the encoded length of the training corpus is constructed to optimize English and languages that use Latin alphabets. Still, language comprehension statistics can change in as little as one generation, complicating long-term predictions. Factors like the globalization of the world, more interconnected societies, or natural disasters are among the things that could impact the longevity of English as Lingua Franca. While the race for the next Lingua Franca might not be easy to predict, experts agree that the more interconnected the world is,\u00a0the more English becomes beneficial, and predicting anything hundreds of years into the future is tricky.OpenAI's GPT-4 model performs poorly on certain languages such as Burmese, Khmer, and Thai, while performing well on English due to its efficiency. Tokenization for Chinese can either be one token per ideograph or sense-annotated pinyin. The model struggles with languages written from right to left, such as Hebrew and Arabic. English's dominance is due to its prevalence rather than efficiency, and Mandarin may have even higher efficiency than English. Learning Chinese characters is a tax on learning for foreigners, but a better pinyin system could change that. Language is a major part of culture, and those who can impose their language have cultural supremacy.Comments on a Hacker News post discuss the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are currently optimized for the English language due to the availability of training data, and its potential impact on other languages and cultures. Some commenters express concern about the dominance of the Anglophone internet and the implications it could have, while others believe that it is simply a matter of optimizing for the most widely used language. There is also discussion around the potential use of LLMs by state actors or forward-looking governments to train models in their own language. Overall, the post generates a debate about the influence of language and culture on the development of technology.",
