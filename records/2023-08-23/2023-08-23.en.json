    "originBody": "The first conformant M1 GPU driver 22 Aug 2023 Conformant OpenGL® ES 3.1 drivers are now available for M1- and M2-family GPUs. That means the drivers are compatible with any OpenGL ES 3.1 application. Interested? Just install Linux! For existing Asahi Linux users, upgrade your system with dnf upgrade (Fedora) or pacman -Syu (Arch) for the latest drivers. Our reverse-engineered, free and open source graphics drivers are the world’s only conformant OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for M1- and M2-family graphics hardware. That means our driver passed tens of thousands of tests to demonstrate correctness and is now recognized by the industry. To become conformant, an “implementation” must pass the official conformance test suite, designed to verify every feature in the specification. The test results are submitted to Khronos, the standards body. After a 30-day review period, if no issues are found, the implementation becomes conformant. The Khronos website lists all conformant implementations, including our drivers for the M1, M1 Pro/Max/Ultra, M2, and M2 Pro/Max. Today’s milestone isn’t just about OpenGL ES. We’re releasing the first conformant implementation of any graphics standard for the M1. And we don’t plan to stop here ;-) Unlike ours, the manufacturer’s M1 drivers are unfortunately not conformant for any standard graphics API, whether Vulkan or OpenGL or OpenGL ES. That means that there is no guarantee that applications using the standards will work on your M1/M2 (if you’re not running Linux). This isn’t just a theoretical issue. Consider Vulkan. The third-party MoltenVK layers a subset of Vulkan on top of the proprietary drivers. However, those drivers lack key functionality, breaking valid Vulkan applications. That hinders developers and users alike, if they haven’t yet switched their M1/M2 computers to Linux. Why did we pursue standards conformance when the manufacturer did not? Above all, our commitment to quality. We want our users to know that they can depend on our Linux drivers. We want standard software to run without M1-specific hacks or porting. We want to set the right example for the ecosystem: the way forward is implementing open standards, conformant to the specifications, without compromises for “portability”. We are not satisfied with proprietary drivers, proprietary APIs, and refusal to implement standards. The rest of the industry knows that progress comes from cross-vendor collaboration. We know it, too. Achieving conformance is a win for our community, for open source, and for open graphics. Of course, Asahi Lina and I are two individuals with minimal funding. It’s a little awkward that we beat the big corporation… It’s not too late though. They should follow our lead! OpenGL ES 3.1 updates the experimental OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL 3.1 we shipped in June. Notably, ES 3.1 adds compute shaders, typically used to accelerate general computations within graphics applications. For example, a 3D game could run its physics simulations in a compute shader. The simulation results can then be used for rendering, eliminating stalls that would otherwise be required to synchronize the GPU with a CPU physics simulation. That lets the game run faster. Let’s zoom in on one new feature: atomics on images. Older versions of OpenGL ES allowed an application to read an image in order to display it on screen. ES 3.1 allows the application to write to the image, typically from a compute shader. This new feature enables flexible image processing algorithms, which previously needed to fit into the fixed-function 3D pipeline. However, GPUs are massively parallel, running thousands of threads at the same time. If two threads write to the same location, there is a conflict: depending which thread runs first, the result will be different. We have a race condition. “Atomic” access to memory provides a solution to race conditions. With atomics, special hardware in the memory subsystem guarantees consistent, well-defined results for select operations, regardless of the order of the threads. Modern graphics hardware supports various atomic operations, like addition, serving as building blocks to complex parallel algorithms. Can we put these two features together to write to an image atomically? Yes. A ubiquitous OpenGL ES extension, required for ES 3.2, adds atomics operating on pixels in an image. For example, a compute shader could atomically increment the value at pixel (10, 20). Other GPUs have dedicated instructions to perform atomics on an images, making the driver implementation straightforward. For us, the story is more complicated. The M1 lacks hardware instructions for image atomics, even though it has non-image atomics and non-atomic images. We need to reframe the problem. The idea is simple: to perform an atomic on a pixel, we instead calculate the address of the pixel in memory and perform a regular atomic on that address. Since the hardware supports regular atomics, our task is “just” calculating the pixel’s address. If the image were laid out linearly in memory, this would be straightforward: multiply the Y-coordinate by the number of bytes per row (“stride”), multiply the X-coordinate by the number of bytes per pixel, and add. That gives the pixel’s offset in bytes relative to the first pixel of the image. To get the final address, we add that offset to the address of the first pixel. Alas, images are rarely linear in memory. To improve cache efficiency, modern graphics hardware interleaves the X- and Y-coordinates. Instead of one row after the next, pixels in memory follow a spiral-like curve. We need to amend our previous equation to interleave the coordinates. We could use many instructions to mask one bit at a time, shifting to construct the interleaved result, but that’s inefficient. We can do better. There is a well-known “bit twiddling” algorithm to interleave bits. Rather than shuffle one bit at a time, the algorithm shuffles groups of bits, parallelizing the problem. Implementing this algorithm in shader code improves performance. In practice, only the lower 7-bits (or less) of each coordinate are interleaved. That lets us use 32-bit instructions to “vectorize” the interleave, by putting the X- and Y-coordinates in the low and high 16-bits of a 32-bit register. Those 32-bit instructions let us interleave X and Y at the same time, halving the instruction count. Plus, we can exploit the GPU’s combined shift-and-add instruction. Putting the tricks together, we interleave in 10 instructions of M1 GPU assembly: # Inputs x, y in r0l, r0h. # Output in r1. add r2, #0, r0, lsl 4 or r1, r0, r2 and r1, r1, #0xf0f0f0f add r2, #0, r1, lsl 2 or r1, r1, r2 and r1, r1, #0x33333333 add r2, #0, r1, lsl 1 or r1, r1, r2 and r1, r1, #0x55555555 add r1, r1l, r1h, lsl 1 We could stop here, but what if there’s a dedicated instruction to interleave bits? PowerVR has a “shuffle” instruction shfl, and the M1 GPU borrows from PowerVR. Perhaps that instruction was borrowed too. Unfortunately, even if it was, the proprietary compiler won’t use it when compiling our test shaders. That makes it difficult to reverse-engineer the instruction – if it exists – by observing compiled shaders. It’s time to dust off a powerful reverse-engineering technique from magic kindergarten: guess and check. Dougall Johnson provided the guess. When considering the instructions we already know about, he took special notice of the “reverse bits” instruction. Since reversing bits is a type of bit shuffle, the interleave instruction should be encoded similarly. The bit reverse instruction has a two-bit field specifying the operation, with value 01. Related instructions to count the number of set bits and find the first set bit have values 10 and 11 respectively. That encompasses all known “complex bit manipulation” instructions. 00 ? ? ? 01 Reverse bits 10 Count set bits 11 Find first set There is one value of the two-bit enumeration that is unobserved and unknown: 00. If this interleave instruction exists, it’s probably encoded like the bit reverse but with operation code 00 instead of 01. There’s a difficulty: the three known instructions have one single input source, but our instruction interleaves two sources. Where does the second source go? We can make a guess based on symmetry. Presumably to simplify the hardware decoder, M1 GPU instructions usually encode their sources in consistent locations across instructions. The other three instructions have a gap where we would expect the second source to be, in a two-source arithmetic instruction. Probably the second source is there. Armed with a guess, it’s our turn to check. Rather than handwrite GPU assembly, we can hack our compiler to replace some two-source integer operation (like multiply) with our guessed encoding of “interleave”. Then we write a compute shader using this operation (by “multiplying” numbers) and run it with the newfangled compute support in our driver. All that’s left is writing a shader that checks that the mystery instruction returns the interleaved result for each possible input. Since the instruction takes two 16-bit sources, there are about 4 billion ( 2 32 ) inputs. With our driver, the M1 GPU manages to check them all in under a second, and the verdict is in: this is our interleave instruction. As for our clever vectorized assembly to interleave coordinates? We can replace it with one instruction. It’s anticlimactic, but it’s fast and it passes the conformance tests. And that’s what matters. Thank you to Khronos and Software in the Public Interest for supporting open drivers. Back to home",

It&#x27;s really hard to render consistently if the underlying drivers are all wonk and proprietary.I am curious to see how this plays out. In my mind, there are two options:1. Apple conforms to the existing standards of OpenGL and Vulkan we see gaining steam for many film and game production pipelines.2. Apple tries to throw its weight around and force devs to support their Metal standards even more, ultimately hoping to force the world onto Metal + macOS.My heart hopes for option 1, but my gut tells me Apple is going to push for option 2 with all the might it can muster. In my experience, Apple doesn&#x27;t like any standards it doesn&#x27;t control with an iron fist (not really saying much about Apple here though... nVidia, Autodesk, Adobe, and Microsoft are all the same).The next couple of years are going to be interesting for sure! reply gumby 15 hours agoparent> In my experience, Apple doesn&#x27;t like any standards it doesn&#x27;t control with an iron fistI would add some nuance to this statement: \"Apple likes open standards when it is weak.\"The iMac and early OS X went big on open standards, and Jobs made a point of pointing this out: USB for the iMac, JPEG, MPG, mp3, Postscript etc for OSX. IP&#x2F;TCP built in. They even paid the danegeld for .rtf.Then as they clawed their way back from the precipice, they started \"adding value\" again.The iphone was an HTML device, loudly repudiating the proprietary (and terrible) Flash much less the crappy, mostly stillborn \"mobile HTML\" attempts.You still get H.264, matter&#x2F;threads, and other standards they don&#x27;t control, where they don&#x27;t have market power. reply foobiekr 15 hours agorootparentYou might actually expand \"Apple likes open standards when it is weak\" to \"companies likes open standards when they are weak.\"Generally speaking you get standards consortiums when there is a clear winner that is mopping up the space.Here&#x27;s an example that&#x27;s happening right now: Nvidia-NvLink-Infiniband.Nvidia owns the highspeed interconnect inside the chassis (HGX), the NICs (Mellanox), the inter-host interconnect (Infiniband), the high performance inter-host interconnect (switched NvLink), the and the ethernet network (Mellanox has the same 52.1Tbps switch performance that everyone else has now). GPU training is RDMA heavy and this is a place where both NvLink and Infiniband shine, ethernet much less so. Retransmissions are very bad, in global-performance-terms, for ROCEv2 transfers. Right now Nvidia is just crushing it and there&#x27;s zero chance anyone is going to catch up by introducing new Infiniband ASICs.So what happens? You have a consortium spun up by all of the companies in the Ethernet space - Ultra Ethernet Consortium - to try and use \"standards\" to push back on customers who don&#x27;t want to make big investments in \"non-standard.\" UEC is pretty vague but seems to be promising Broadcom-style cellized fabrics, the whole point of which is to have an ethernet-like standard that avoids ECMP-induced flow collisions and retransmissions - that is, get Ethernet into the same territory as Infiniband.If you look back in time in the tech industry, you see this over and over and over and over. Standards are great, they make certain kinds of multi-sided markets and markets that need broad participation to be viable possible - but they are also routinely about the losers joining together to compete. reply krsdcbl 43 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;d even bend that quote to say \"Given a problem that maximizes their profit if solved, it&#x27;s an acceptable compromise for companies to resort to solutions they don&#x27;t control, if they don&#x27;t have the ressources to create competing solutions they&#x27;d do control.\" reply galaxyLogic 14 hours agorootparentprev> they are also routinely about the losers joining together to compete.That is the greatness of it. It reminds me of democracy: The less powerful join together to give everyone an equal vote, rather than having one vote per dollar. reply michh 1 hour agorootparentprev> Right now Nvidia is just crushing it and there&#x27;s zero chance anyone is going to catch up by introducing new Infiniband ASICs.I mean, Cornelis Networks is trying with the resurrected OmniPath.

Listed among them were concerns about it not being an open standard, inferiority to H.264, security and performance issues, etc. However, all of these things could&#x27;ve been ignored or overcome.The principal problem was that a huge proportion of Flash applications, games, and websites used mouseovers as crucial methods of interactions, and Apple simply had no way to allow users to mouseover an element on a touchscreen. reply jjoonathan 15 hours agorootparentThat could have been overcome. The general crustiness of flash could not have been (from Apple&#x27;s POV).Apple used to ship a dev app called \"Spin Control\" that would log stack traces whenever an app failed to drain its event queue in a timely manner (i.e. beachball). One time I accidentally left this open for an entire week, went about a bunch of assorted business, and when I came back every single stack trace had to do with flash, and there were many. Either flash in a browser or flash in a browser embedded in something else (ads embedded in 404 pages for broken help pages that were never even displayed, lol). At first I thought it had to be a mistake, a filter I had forgotten about or something, so I triggered a spin in Mail.app by asking it to reindex and sure enough that showed up as the first non-Flash entry in Spin Control.As hard as it was to believe: Flash had been responsible for every single beachball that week. Yikes. reply i_am_jl 14 hours agorootparentI was mistaken, I found a copy of Jobs&#x27; letter re:Flash and he does cite the proprietary nature of Flash and Apple&#x27;s lack of control over the content served on its platform as the most important reason Flash was kept off the iPhone.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;steve-jobs-letter-explaining-ap... As hard as it was to believe: Flash had been responsible for every single beachball that week. Yikes.I used OSX and Flash in the late 2000s so I have no problem believing that. reply bootsmann 13 hours agorootparent> This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor&#x27;s platformsFunny how one could and maybe should point the same criticism towards electron. reply wlesieutre 8 hours agorootparentprevBetter than OS 9 and Flash when it would bring down the whole system! reply zdw 12 hours agorootparentprevBack in the day there was even a Mac browser plugin called \"Click to Flash\" that would prevent Flash from loading in web pages and draining battery like crazy. Made the web livable and more secure throwing Flash garbage ads everywhere.Ah, the dev page for these: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoyois.github.io&#x2F;safariextensions&#x2F;clicktoplugin&#x2F;People also don&#x27;t remember the huge number of CVEs that Flash had: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;version-list&#x2F;53&#x2F;6761&#x2F;1&#x2F;Adobe-Flas... reply jwells89 5 hours agorootparentThere were also browser extensions that&#x27;d replace YouTube&#x27;s terrible flash player with an HTML5 h.264 player which was a godsend on single-core PPC G4&#x2F;G5 machines, where flash would happily keep the CPU pegged for no good reason. reply hot_gril 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah Flash was slow, but the common alternatives for in-browser animation&#x2F;games were (and still are) far slower. H.264&#x2F;5 maybe did video better than Flash, even then idk, Flash YouTube was always way faster on my old iMac than HTML5 YT. Google Hangouts&#x2F;Meet will lag a high-end Intel MBP thanks to the unaccelerated VP8&#x2F;9 video, but AIM Flash-based video calls ran fine on an iMac G4. On top of that, there was never a real replacement to the Flash creation software. All those Flash games that people made without really understanding how to code, no longer doable.I guess Flash had to die because of how outdated, insecure, and proprietary it was. It did seem like a nightmare to support well on mobile. Just wish someone made something strictly better. reply sheepscreek 10 hours agorootparentPerhaps it was fast due to lack of tight security policies etc. These days, everything has to be containerized or be in a sandbox. That adds layers of overhead. Probably also why Google killed NaCl (Native Clients for Google Chrome). It was loosely in the same space as Flash and ActiveX - anyone remember that? reply hot_gril 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve thought about that too. Can only guess about it myself. Old software tends to be faster just because it has to be, and there isn&#x27;t always a compromise other than time-to-implement.Not sure how ActiveX&#x27;s sandboxing worked, but I&#x27;ll bet it was even less than Flash, since it was running actual x86 code. reply londons_explore 2 hours agorootparentActiveX required that the ActiveX code you wanted to run be already installed on your computer. The security mechanism was that users obviously wouldn&#x27;t install insecure stuff...Turns out nearly every extension had gaping security holes. reply brianpan 12 hours agorootparentprevNot hard to believe. Reliability was one of the points in Steve Jobs&#x27; _Thoughts on Flash_:> We also know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash. We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems, but they have persisted for several years now. We don’t want to reduce the reliability and security of our iPhones, iPods and iPads by adding Flash. reply dimator 14 hours agorootparentprevYeesh, thank you for the reminder about how much the flash-based web sucked. It&#x27;s easy to forget. reply wsc981 3 hours agorootparentPart of it sucked, part of it was great. On Mac-side the experience was worse than on Windows, that&#x27;s for sure.But Flash also allowed many games to be easily developed and played in the browser. Lots of fun cartoons were made (the Metallica cartoons \"fire bad\" on Newgrounds come to my mind now).It&#x27;s a shame Flash sucked so much on Mac, since the developer behind Flash [0] did create some nice games on the Mac early in his career, namely Airborne! and Dark Castle.---[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jonathan_Gay reply saagarjha 3 hours agorootparentprevSpin Control lives on as part of Instruments, which can be configured to collect a tailspin whenever an app hangs. reply phillco 8 hours agorootparentprevMy fuzzy recollection was that the OS X version of Flash was much worse than the Windows version. Given \"Thoughts on Flash\" and the direction of the iPhone, this ended up being very expensive for Adobe :) reply newaccount74 1 hour agorootparentI always thought Flash was unusably slow, until I tried it on Windows. On Windows Flash was fast and fluent, on the Mac it was choppy and unbearably slow.Since Flash was so ubiquitous on the web, this made Macs a lot slower for many tasks than Windows computers. No matter how much Steve Jobs touted the power of the G4, and boasted about the speed of Final Cut, nobody would believe it when their Mac couldn&#x27;t even run a space invaders clone in IE4 fluently.Adobe ignored performance on Apple devices for years. There was no way in hell Apple would allow Adobe to do the same to iOS. reply codedokode 8 hours agorootparentprev> Flash had been responsibleWas it just Flash or low skilled web developers using Flash the wrong way, adding 10 Flash advertisements on a page and so on? reply tomjakubowski 15 hours agorootparentprevApple did find a solution in mobile Safari for touchscreen hover states on the Web. However the Web platform generally offers more affordances for accessibility than Flash ever did, which I&#x27;m sure helps. reply i_am_jl 14 hours agorootparentIf I&#x27;m not mistaken the solution was to make touching an element trigger the :hover state and the click action unless the :hover state changed the visibility of another element. If the :hover state changed the visibility of another element, then the click action was not triggered until a user tapped again.This is possible in HTML because it&#x27;s trivial to determine whether or not a :hover changes display or visibility properties of other elements. As you&#x27;ve supposed, Flash did not afford browsers with that sort of ability. reply gumby 14 hours agorootparentprev> more affordances for accessibility than Flash ever didTBF one thing Flash did manage to achieve was the proliferation of web sites and apps that were as hard to use for people without protected disabilities as for people who did have them.Whether this increased empathy for people with disabilities is an open question reply girvo 2 hours agorootparentprevThat, and even if you somehow fixed that, Flash on mobile sucked. I had Flash on my Windows Mobile handset. It was horrible! reply coldtea 9 hours agorootparentprev>The principal problem was that a huge proportion of Flash applications, games, and websites used mouseovers as crucial methods of interactions, and Apple simply had no way to allow users to mouseover an element on a touchscreen.It&#x27;s more about control and all the other reasons.Mousovers is a dead herring. They could still give Flash not to run existing stuff, but new apps, that would take iOS into account.And legacy flash movies and animations and games that just needed click and not mousovers would still work. To be frank, mouseover interaction weren&#x27;t really that big in many (most?) Flash games anyway. reply acdha 9 hours agorootparentMouseovers were just the tip of the iceberg: fixed screen sizes and other desktop UI conventions, assumptions that you could just leave things constantly running rather than figure out how to do proper event-driven programming, etc. Yes, they could have tried to do a “Flash mobile” but most of the appeal was compatibility with the huge library of existing apps and users wouldn’t have been happy with that, while authors would have bristled at having to give up their favorite hacks. Flash was a fractal of bad programming and UI design, and there was no way to get that community to improve since Adobe was one of the worst offenders and didn’t care about their platform in any discernible way. People wrote Click-to-Flash plugins to keep it from crashing your browser, every browser had to change their architecture to handle Flash crashing, the plugin & authoring tools had tons of performance, stability, and security issues – and Adobe just kept snoozing, waking only enough to cash the royalty checks, and claim the next version would be totally better.Another poster mentioned the hangs - which is very true - and I can say that the desktop Macs I supported had a high 90% of the crash logs show Flash as the culprit, not to mention almost every CPU &#x2F; battery life issue.There were some great artists who produced neat work despite it but the only company to blame for Flash’s demise is Adobe. As a thought exercise, ask why Flash on Android consistently sucked – if they were trying to make the case that Apple should reconsider, they could have put at least one intern on making that seem appealing. reply amluto 3 hours agorootparent> Adobe was one of the worst offenders and didn’t care about their platform in any discernible way.This is par for the course for Adobe. The other day I had occasion to try to fill out a PDF form using Acrobat Pro. I made it through about a page (painfully slowly) until I unwisely saved my work. Then I cursed for a bit, tried quitting and reloading, and eventually gave up and started over in PDF.js. Superior in every way.I remember when a major selling point of Acrobat was that you could save a filled out form, whereas third party apps couldn’t. Apparently doing so still breaks the form, and third party apps have gotten it right for many years now.Adobe seems to pretty much never care about their platform once they have market share. reply psd1 49 minutes agorootparentprevFYI, the idiom is \"red herring\" reply brokenmachine 8 hours agorootparentprevI remember my old Samsung Galaxy Note (or was it the Note 3?) could actually sense when your finger was near the screen but not touching, for mouseover events.I always wondered why that feature didn&#x27;t continue - I remember it working quite well, but IIRC it only worked in Chrome browser. reply photonerd 14 hours agorootparentprevAlso, from a practical perspective, even Adobe never had a fully working (feature parity to desktop) way to actually load Flash on the iPhone. Apple kept asking for one: Adobe could never produce something that wasn’t buggy crap.There were some 3rd party things that sorta worked a bit, but they were not good either.Flash was bad on touchscreens for sure, but we’d have seen content adapt eventually anyhow, if it had actually ever worked in the first place. reply xp84 12 hours agorootparentVery true. In case anyone is too young to remember, in the days of the iPhone 3G, it was somewhat popular to buy apps which would use a real browser on a server somewhere to render a browser session, complete with Flash, and stream it to you. It was very handy for those of us who played Flash games and needed to check in on our game on the go. (Think FarmVille, Cityville, etc.) reply _jal 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that wasn&#x27;t the deal-breaker. Jobs didn&#x27;t want Flash to become the de facto development environment for the phone.I&#x27;m pretty sure he always knew they&#x27;d end up with apps on it, they just didn&#x27;t pull that together for the first release, thus the HTML song and dance. But if they supported flash, that would reduce a lot of the demand for apps later, and worse - it would be cross platform.So he used the other (still good) reasons - battery life, security, etc. to obscure the real reason - Apple was not yet ready to compete with it on their own terms, so they banned it. reply JohnBooty 14 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]Then as they clawed their way back from the precipice, they started \"adding value\" again.I don&#x27;t know if I can agree. On the software side, MacOS supports all those things. On the hardware side, it&#x27;s still (edit: almost) nothing but industry-standard ports. reply jwells89 5 hours agorootparentOne thing that I&#x27;ve enjoyed is how for decades Mail.app has been first and foremost a generic IMAP mail client, with features specific to iCloud Mail being far and few between. It works exactly as well with e.g. Fastmail as it does iCloud Mail. Conversely, iCloud Mail is just plain old IMAP and works fine with other generic IMAP clients.Compare this with Gmail for example, which has a crummy IMAP implementation, and though the Gmail mobile app supports adding non-Google IMAP accounts, it clearly prioritizes being a Gmail client. reply xp84 11 hours agorootparentpreviChat stored every conversation (if you enabled history) in HTML files the user could find in their Documents folder and read. Messages history is stored in an undocumented SQLite database that you’re not meant to touch. I’m not saying they’re completely proprietary in every way, but you can see the progression from wide open to “keep your hands off.”For another example, Apple Notes was actually just mail messages stored in IMAP, until they decided to deprecate that in favor of another iCloud-backed black box in order to add more features. reply hooch 11 hours agorootparentIMAP notes still works. reply saagarjha 3 hours agorootparentIt works about as well as it always did, which was not very well. reply bobbylarrybobby 8 hours agorootparentprevHtml as a database is unacceptable though.Emails as notes sounds pretty clever though. reply gumby 14 hours agorootparentprevI didn&#x27;t say they necessarily denigrated the open formats but added and preferred their own proprietary image, audio etc formats as they gained market strength.On the hardware side I&#x27;m delighted by Apple&#x27;s USB C&#x2F;TB push (and Apple contributed a lot to those standards, esp based on what they had learned with Lightning) but note they revived the proprietary \"magsafe\" connecter on recent laptops (though you can still use USB C PD).

They have really tight coupling between hardware and software in order to deliver on the UX that they intend (whether or not you like all or some of it). If they’re designing their own software and hardware, I can see why they’d also want to implement standards that they can control to some degree - otherwise their UX is dependent on others. This is also why I think Apple sometimes implements new industry standards, USB-C being one example - if no one else has made an effort yet, they can influence the direction by being first movers. reply zamadatix 15 hours agoparentprevOpenUSD is a way of bundling and specifying the data to be rendered.

I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m particularly sad, OpenGL is very long in the tooth and writing a good driver for it seems like a nightmare, considering how hard it is to even write good performant application OpenGL code. I wish they had thrown in behind Vulkan instead of creating Metal, but it seems like outside of linux vulkan is a second class citizen everywhere (although it&#x27;s a pretty good second class citizen to target).In terms of supporting games or steam and such, I think the reality is that a large segment of games now use engines that handle the API stuff for you, and if you do have the resources&#x2F;time&#x2F;inclination to write directly to the API, you&#x27;re probably ok with MoltenVK as long as you&#x27;re not doing anything too cutting edge.Seriously though, while I&#x27;ve written OpenGL most of my life to be cross platform and support the most I can, it&#x27;s an absolutely TERRIBLE api. Global state everywhere, tons of functions you can-but-shouldn&#x27;t-use, all sorts of traps everywhere, monsterous header files for extensions, incredibly hard to debug.

Steam is pushing hard with MoltenVK on macOS and native Vulkan drivers on the Steam Deck.I agree there are likely a lot of game devs who like Metal, but it would appear there are a lot of heavy hitters backing Vulkan.As well, in film, many render engines prefer Vulkan due to the flexibility to write complicated compute shaders with complex command buffers.

Sales, marketing, accounting, negotiation, support, etc. Many technical people don&#x27;t really want to handle those job functions, even if they happen to be decently good at them.Certainly you can hire people to do those functions, but you need to have a decently well-established reputation and enough work and income before you&#x27;re able to hire those people.Employment does give you a trade off there: less money in exchange for someone else handling the \"overhead\". reply memefrog 12 hours agorootparentYeah, it is just another example of specialisation&#x2F;divison of labour. reply quickthrower2 13 hours agorootparentprevMassive “it depends” on that reply Yajirobe 11 hours agorootparentprev> Typically employees make poor money in comparison to what kind of profit they generateI think it’s the opposite - developers are overvalued. reply Meegul 10 hours agorootparentI understand where that sentiment comes from, especially looking at the slew of mid-sized companies that have never turned a profit despite paying multiple hundred K TCs, but if you look at the profits of the giants, it paints a different picture. The labor of thousands of very highly compensated engineers is still a drop in the bucket of the revenue generated by their labor. Alphabet seemingly employs somewhere between 20-40 thousand engineers, and it is their labor that produced all (?) of their revenue generating products. Spreading last year&#x27;s revenue (~$282B) across their engineering staff would yield a revenue in the ballpark of $9M per engineer.We all know that their engineers are paid well, but that&#x27;s still potentially more than an order of magnitude off of the value they generate. Of course, there are many other expenses to running their business, but to claim that broadly developers are overvalued when one of the most prolific employers of developers is generating 10x+ the revenue of what they spend on them, is likely no more than only occasionally correct. reply ip26 5 hours agorootparentThat raises an interesting question. If developers are toiling equally hard at company A and company B, on similar products, but company A currently had a dominant market position over company B thanks to network effects - are the developers at company A in any way responsible for its outsize gains and therefore due millions of dollars in TC? reply robin_reala 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy are you leaving out all the other essential people that go towards that revenue figure? reply saagarjha 2 hours agorootparentprevAlphabet has at least twice those numbers. reply unethical_ban 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you consider large employers as labor brokers, it makes more sense that someone accepts the reduction in potential earnings for easier access to labor demand. reply djmips 5 hours agoprevThe atomic trick was very satisfying, especially extrapolating the swizzle instruction from the PowerVR heritage.

It&#x27;d require enabling reduced security mode to load kexts or a custom kernel as well as a good amount of additional code for interfacing it with the macOS kernel interfaces but the majority of the code would be reused. Not trivial by any measure but also not an unreasonable approach in terms of total effort to get a working driver.I&#x27;d be very surprised if anyone was interested in doing all that work given the security limitations and ability to just use Linux.Edit: I forgot Metal is actually a userspace driver, you don&#x27;t need to mess with the kernel side... though I can&#x27;t remember if you still need to lower security to poke the right areas. reply klausa 16 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, I was being overly dismissive in my original reply. reply paulmd 12 hours agorootparentprevintel&#x27;s linux driver is completely different from the windows driver. it also has been open since the start (well, since the start of the rewrite in 2010 or something) actually before AMD did theirs. reply ColonelPhantom 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you look the other way around (which is more relevant anyways), you can compile Mesa for Windows.

Application support is limited, but hopefully with Intel&#x27;s backing, the situation would gradually improve. Meanwhile, Vulkan Compute sidesteps the entire headache with compute shaders. But I&#x27;m not familiar with it in terms of application support.SYCL can be implemented on top of OpenCL and OpenCL&#x27;s SPIR-V extension. It soon turned out that this route is unfeasible due to prevalent vendor lock-in that&#x27;s not going to change anytime soon, so it has largely been abandoned by everyone else but Intel and Mesa. Right now SYCL is usually implemented by backends to GPU vendor&#x27;s respective APIs, like ROCm, HIP or CUDA. Doing the same for Metal would be very challenging.Mesa already has experimental support of OpenCL w&#x2F; SPIR-V on Intel and AMDGPU, so theoretically it can be extended to Apple Silicon. Difficulty of implementing OpenCL&#x27;s SPIR-V extension should be comparable with Vulkan compute shader (which also uses SPIR-V). However, currently OpenCL on Apple Silicon is entirely unsupported. The last time I checked, it&#x27;s on the roadmap. reply owlbite 5 hours agorootparentThe only problem with cross-platform standards is they are never performance portable unless they&#x27;re so high level someone already their primitives have already implemented the algorithm X different ways for you already.For any low level performance programming you need to code to the specific microarchitecture, so the pros of a single programming language&#x2F;library are limited (you&#x27;re not getting any code reuse that isn&#x27;t available in the top level non-hardware C code anyway) and often outweighed by the ability to take advantage of the vendor&#x27;s dedicated extensions provided by their preferred programming mechanism.This issue was well modeled by OpenCL, which never really caught on for programming Nvidia GPUs for this reason. reply thangngoc89 18 hours agoparentprevCorrect.

They use a Mac and like the integration.On top of that, I (as an Android user) am constantly uncomfortable running a mobile OS built by a company that exists mainly to track people&#x27;s behavior and invade their privacy, with the goal of selling ads (and I am more vehemently anti-advertising than most people). As much as I don&#x27;t fully buy \"Apple&#x27;s commitment to privacy\", they are in a much better place in that regard than Android is. I lock my phone down and give nearly every app (including Google&#x27;s) zero permissions, and only enable (and then immediately disable[0]) as necessary, but I&#x27;m still convinced my privacy posture would probably be better with an iPhone. But I don&#x27;t want to live in that walled-garden nanny-state, so that&#x27;s that.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.samruston.... reply mrweasel 16 hours agorootparentprev> I still don&#x27;t understand why people think in 2023 that Android can not be a viable alternative to an iPhone.Because Google... I could live with not having iMessage or AirPlay, that&#x27;s annoying but something I could live with. So it&#x27;s either a de-googled Android phone or iPhone, and I do need a few apps which are only available in the App Store or Play Store, so I figure I&#x27;m limited to phones that can run something like CalyxOS, which basically limits me to Pixel or FairPhone.The FairPhone isn&#x27;t a terrible choice, but I&#x27;m not going to replace a functional iPhone with it... if it break maybe, or I can get a used iPhone.It&#x27;s not that I trust Apple all that much, I just trust them way more than Google at this point. I don&#x27;t think Google is evil or bad, but their interest and mine doesn&#x27;t really align. reply ohgodplsno 15 hours agorootparent>I could live with not having iMessageSo, literally any messaging app, something that non-Apple users have to do anyways, and have to deal with your bullshit about only going through iMessage when they have to send you SMS.>AirPlayChromecast is infinitely more ubiquitous. Also, if Apple didn&#x27;t patent AirPlay and refuse to share it with anyone, you wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation.I will absolutely agree with Google being an absolutely dreadful steward of Android, but make no mistake: you gave Apple full support in locking themselves down in their own little playground, and now you&#x27;re complaining you can&#x27;t get out. reply sbuk 14 hours agorootparent> Chromecast is infinitely more ubiquitous.Chromecast is a device.> Also, if Apple didn&#x27;t patent AirPlay and refuse to share it with anyone, you wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation.Google Cast is just as proprietary as AirPlay. Both require licensing to be included in devices. I have an LG TV that supports both, an ancient Roku device that does the same, as well as supporting Miracast.

Every application implemented it differently, sometimes I&#x27;d find it bumped me right out of an app if I tapped it once too often, others didn&#x27;t do that. I hated the thing; it required learning a different set of mysterious tendencies for every app and situation.

I&#x27;ve suffered one recall, another one which failed 1 month past the warranty and which the Apple Store said was quite normal(!), and several had degraded to the point I had to ensure they didn&#x27;t drop down to below 20% (or some other magic number). After the first few I took into the Apple Store only for them to say \"oh that&#x27;s to be expected\" I stopped going in. Not sure why people think Apple laptops are magically immune, they&#x27;re not. They suffer battery issues just the same as other brands do. reply fomine3 8 hours agorootparentApple introduced battery charging limitation feature on MacBook in 2019 (or a few years ago?), while Windows laptops supported it in 2000s.

Apple battery health in system preferences will show you how much the battery has degraded since the device was new. My ~2yo M1 MacBook Pro still has 92% capacity compared to when it was brand new. reply LoganDark 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in System Preferences, but for me, System Information shows my mid-2015 MBP (running macOS 10.14.6 Mojave) still has a battery capacity of 8266mAh and a remaining charge of 8079mAh at 100%. Compared to the advertised capacity at launch of 8755mAh, that&#x27;s a charge capacity of ~92% after ~five years (AppleCare replaced my battery during their recall). MacBooks are just built different. reply kalleboo 2 hours agorootparentprevApple&#x27;s batteries are covered under warranty up to 1000 cycles. I had them replace my battery that hit 80% capacity at 3 years right before AppleCare ran out. reply nerdbert 10 hours agorootparentprevModern Macbooks are very strategic about when and how much they charge. You can override it if you know you need a full charge Right Now, but otherwise they will decide how much to charge based on your usage patterns, which keeps the battery alive much longer than on many other brands of laptop. reply pohl 16 hours agorootparentprevDevice manufacturers can engineer for longer useful lifespan by oversizing the battery, can&#x27;t they? Do they all do that to the same extent? reply tracker1 16 hours agorootparentTo an extent, there&#x27;s a limit for air travel, generally speaking as they can be dangerous. The m1&#x2F;m2 are just killer in terms of lifetime and usage for general reading&#x2F;browsing&#x2F;email.. and still very long for even content viewing. Most people aren&#x27;t rapidly draining their batteries, so the longevity gets to be a bit better overall.AMD is getting pretty close and the perf:watt on the coming generation(s) for laptops (including integrated gpu) look to be really impressive to say the least... reply hedora 16 hours agorootparentprevThey can also implement better battery management technology (cooling, charge rate curves, keeping the charge between 10%-90% instead of 0-100%, but reporting 0-100% to the user via scaling), etc, etc.For a good counter-example, look at the early Nissan Leafs. They burned out their batteries in a matter of a few years, but battery replacements for other brands from that time are basically unheard of. (The inherent information asymmetry for new car purchasers is one reason Biden&#x27;s IRA dictated minimum car battery warranties.) reply ralferoo 16 hours agorootparentFunny, I heard the total opposite about Nissan Leafs. The industry was guesstimating that batteries would last 8-10 years. The first Nissan Leafs (which was about the first commercially mass-available EV) had battery lives where something like 90% were still going strong and still 80% of original capacity left after 13 years.Rather than the Leaf being problematic, it was the car that showed the market that worrying about the lifespan of EV batteries wasn&#x27;t really necessary. reply saagarjha 2 hours agorootparentI had one of those early Leafs, the battery degradation was real. Newer vehicles seem to have much better curves. replyHankB99 16 hours agorootparentprevThe key to battery life&#x2F;health on the XPS is to use the BIOS functions to limit charging. My XPS-13 9370 has been plugged in most of its life (about 4 years now) and battery health has dropped from 96% to 93%.I can&#x27;t speak to the rest of the comparison to the Macs - they&#x27;re probably better overall - but the battery life is a solved problem if you know to limit charging. reply rendaw 5 hours agorootparentprevAndroid phones come loaded with ad tech, malware, depending on a matrix of carrier _and_ manufacturer.

If this is supposed to be a standard, there&#x27;s no way for a third-party to use Google&#x27;s RCS APIs right now. Some messaging apps, like Beeper, have asked Google about integrating RCS and were told there&#x27;s no public RCS API and no plans to build one. Google has an RCS API already, but only Samsung is allowed to use it because Samsung signed some kind of partnership deal.> If you want to implement RCS, you&#x27;ll need to run the messages through some kind of service, and who provides that server? It will probably be Google. Google bought Jibe, the leading RCS server provider, in 2015. Today it has a whole sales pitch about how Google Jibe can \"help carriers quickly scale RCS services, iterate in short cycles, and benefit from improvements immediately.\" So the pitch for Apple to adopt RCS isn&#x27;t just this public-good nonsense about making texts with Android users better; it&#x27;s also about running Apple&#x27;s messages through Google servers. Google profits in both server fees and data acquisition.Like c&#x27;mon google doesn&#x27;t care about open-standards except insofar as that allows them to embrace-extend-extinguish. google&#x27;s end goal is imessage but with google servers in the middle instead of apple ones. reply insanitybit 11 hours agorootparentThanks, glad I asked - I genuinely was not sure. reply smoldesu 9 hours agorootparentprev> there&#x27;s no way for a third-party to use Google&#x27;s RCS APIs right nowTo be fair, this criticism is fundamentally true of iMessage, too. Implementing all of iMessage&#x27;s features in an open, trustless manner is impossible. reply marzullo 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is correct. Google put a lot of effort into making carriers adopt RCS (which has most of the functionality of iMessage), but Apple will not adopt it to keep their \"competitive advantage.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.android.com&#x2F;get-the-message&#x2F;I use an iPhone now but these kinds of business tactics and the others mentioned here really make me wish there were more competitive products on the other end. reply saagarjha 2 hours agorootparentRCS is pretty garbage without Google’s extensions.

By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Aug 22, 2023, 9:00 AM EDT|33 Comments / 33 New Share this story Image: Microsoft Microsoft is bringing popular programming language Python to Excel. A public preview of the feature is available today, allowing Excel users to manipulate and analyze data from Python. “You can manipulate and explore data in Excel using Python plots and libraries, and then use Excel’s formulas, charts and PivotTables to further refine your insights,” explains Stefan Kinnestrand, general manager of modern work at Microsoft. “Now you can do advanced data analysis in the familiar Excel environment by accessing Python directly from the Excel ribbon.” You won’t need to install any additional software or set up an add-on to access the functionality, as Python integration in Excel will be part of Excel’s built-in connectors and Power Query. Microsoft is also adding a new PY function that allows Python data to be exposed within the grid of an Excel spreadsheet. Through a partnership with Anaconda, an enterprise Python repository, popular Python libraries like pandas, statsmodels, and Matplotlib will be available in Excel. Python inside a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Image: Microsoft Python calculations run in the Microsoft Cloud, with the results returned into an Excel worksheet. Excel users will be able to create formulas, PivotTables, and charts all based on Python data, with the ability to bring in charting libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations like heatmaps, violin plots, and swarm plots. “I’m excited that this excellent, tight integration of Python and Excel is now seeing the light of day,” says Guido van Rossum, Python’s creator and now a Microsoft distinguished engineer. “I expect that both communities will find interesting new uses in this collaboration, amplifying each partner’s abilities. When I joined Microsoft three years ago, I would not have dreamed this would be possible.” Python in Excel is rolling out today as a public preview for Microsoft 365 Insiders in the Beta Channel. It will be limited to Windows at first before being made available to other platforms “at a later date.” Microsoft says Python in Excel will be included in a Microsoft 365 subscription during the preview, but “some functionality will be restricted without a paid license” after the preview ends. 33 COMMENTS33 NEW Most Popular Microsoft is bringing Python to Excel Microsoft to sell off Activision cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft in bid for UK approval Microsoft kills Kinect again Nvidia’s new DLSS 3.5 works on all RTX GPUs to improve the quality of ray tracing Brilliant’s new smart home controller makes it easier to put a touchscreen on your wall Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

    "commentBody": "Microsoft is bringing Python to ExcelHacker NewspastloginMicrosoft is bringing Python to Excel (theverge.com) 780 points by Xeophon 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite409 comments vba 16 hours agoThis was a nice surprise to see today as an Ex-Excel developer who worked on trying to bring Python to Excel (and, I guess, failing ;)).7+ years ago I had the option of leaving the Excel team. My then boss’s boss knew I had an interest in bringing Python to Excel and offered me a chance to tackle it if I chose to stay. What was meant to be a 6 month project turned into a ~3 year project, the Python part faded away and we ended up enabling JavaScript Custom Functions in Excel instead.For Python we were also running ‘in the cloud’ (AzureML v1), although there was some back-and-forth on if we should run locally. I think what made the Python part disappear was our partner AzureML team re-orged, re-released, re-hired, we lost a PM and our work caught the attention of another partner team who realised they could use our code to execute their JavaScript out-of-process. And so I spent a lot of time ensuring that feature was successfully shipped at, I guess, the detriment of Python.I had a lot of help from some strong engineers and learnt a lot. The core of the work was modifying the calculation engine of Excel to allow functions to compute asynchronously, allowing the user to continue working on other parts of their spreadsheet while the remote endpoint (be it JavaScript, Python or something else) was computing. Previously the spreadsheet would lock up while calculations were running, and that wouldn’t be cool for long-running unbounded calculations. Have to wonder if any of the stuff we built made it into this new feature.Super great to see this and look forward to trying it out.Recalc or die reply fzumstein 16 hours agoparentThanks for your work! The async JS functions are amazing and allowed me to ship rock-solid Custom functions with xlwings and Python. The problem with Office.js is that it’s just simply too hard to get started with all the npm bloat for the average Excel user (even more professional devs struggle). Well, I am pretty happy how I am saving users from having to use Node.js: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.xlwings.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;pro&#x2F;server&#x2F;officejs_custo... reply vba 15 hours agorootparentOh this must be Felix! I saw and played with xlwings many years ago and was impressed :)Agreed with the friction around getting started. I would like to see it reduced. It’s cool to see you using them to wrap Python functions - I have done something similar before myself, and still need to get around to shimming Haskell into excel at some point.Another thing I don’t like is how JavaScript Custom Function cell formulas have a horrible string after the _xldudf marker, which becomes noticeable if your workbook doesn’t&#x2F;can’t load the custom functions addin (or you unload the addin)Thanks for your comment reply fzumstein 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s me, yes, are you Michael then ;)? Yeah, I love the Office.js platform, I believe it&#x27;s the most versatile extension platform there is, it just came out during an unfortunate time (when people believed that you can&#x27;t use JS without React anymore ;) Anyhow, the magic of Office.js is that you can use it like a JS framework with total freedom what you use on the backend (it&#x27;s just a fetch call away), so whether that is .NET or Node or Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Julia doesn&#x27;t matter at all, it&#x27;s just that the official docs don&#x27;t really bother to explain that or show an example other than Node & C#. What&#x27;s a game changer (and only available on Office.js) is the integrated authentication via SSO&#x2F;Azure AD, which is the first thing any IT department in a corporation is interested in. reply ripley12 13 hours agorootparentprev> The problem with Office.js is that it’s just simply too hard to get started with all the npm bloat for the average Excel user (even more professional devs struggle)IMO deployment is an even harder problem. The Office team makes it incredibly difficult to deploy web add-ins (presumably for business reasons) and accordingly most companies I&#x27;m familiar with are still using the ancient, barely-supported COM+VSTO add-in models. reply fzumstein 12 hours agorootparentWhich part do you find difficult? The web backend or the deployment of the Manifest.xml via the app store &#x2F; office admin? reply kasajian 11 hours agorootparentThe part that makes it a non-starter is that it has to be in some kind of a store (whether it&#x27;s on prem via SharePoint) or the Internet. What is needed is that you can install something on the user&#x27;s computer (xcopy install, msi, w&#x2F;e), but without requiring any other Microsoft end-point. And then, the bits installed either run completely on-node (similar to COM&#x2F;VSTO) or it would require that access to remote web-server be required. If a remote web-server is required (which is a bit of a limitation), it should be something that can be pointed to without Microsoft&#x27;s involvement. Just like I can create a web-site, give you a URL to it, and you can go it using your WebBrowser. No app-stores.That doesn&#x27;t mean app-store shouldn&#x27;t be an option. I would love to also publish my add-in in the Microsoft AppStore, but it should be my choice, not a hard-requirement.That&#x27;s why people are still using VSTO, not because we have a problem with JavaScript vs. C# or COM. reply fzumstein 11 hours agorootparentTotally agree on the part of the add-in: Just give us a dead-simple method to load the manifest locally and be done with it! reply ripley12 8 hours agorootparentprevThe app store &#x2F; Office admin stuff. When I was dealing with this stuff 2 years ago, it was insanely difficult to deploy a web add-in internally (something involving the \"Microsoft 365 admin center\"), let alone deploy it to customers (gotta get approval to deploy it in the special Office app store, and hope+pray that your customers&#x27; IT departments don&#x27;t block that).Compare to VSTO, where IIRC installation just involves editing a registry value to let Office know where your add-in can be found on disk. reply bubblebobble 12 hours agoparentprevThis is so weird. I built a working \"python within excel\" a few years back. (it also did sql and matlab&r remotely)Abandoned now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphawolfxl.com&#x2F;I abandoned this when some people I asked to beta test it said \"their company wouldn&#x27;t pay for it\" and gave me the impression I&#x27;d wasted my time........Not sure how to feel about this..... reply kosolam 12 hours agorootparentDon’t feel too bad because if you would have created a product from it, today this product would be deprecated.. reply fzumstein 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily true. They built VSTO for C#, but everybody was using ExcelDNA instead, an Open Source solution that was much better! reply jll29 11 hours agorootparentprevYou were just ahead of your time! reply dnadler 15 hours agoparentprevThanks for your work on that! I use custom JavaScript functions to hit our internal analytics API. It was really nice to work with. reply vba 15 hours agorootparentThanks for your kind words.

The few examples provided are for programmers only.In general there is a scarcity of working code that you can inspect to see how javascript in Excel works.Now it is mostly \"how to draw an owl\" reply vba 15 hours agorootparentI don’t unfortunately. Given the more technical nature of the feature I’m inclined to agree Microsoft should make a bountiful supply of working examples. reply fzumstein 15 hours agorootparentprevGlad I am not the only one with this impression :) reply smitty1e 11 hours agoparentprevGreat user name.I have a private github repo called NVBC, the \"NecroVisualBasiCon\", with all of my favorite VBA-isms.When I code it, I indent all of the `End *` lines to column 80, to make the VBA look more like python. reply doctorpangloss 13 hours agoparentprev> the Python part faded away and we ended up enabling JavaScript Custom Functions in Excel instead.Nobody could have anticipated that GPT4 would author Python better than anything else.Nonetheless, I kind of just want Google Drive except Excel, without adopting anything more than the Office ecosystem, that just works with simultaneous editing. reply cableshaft 20 hours agoprevI wish it wasn&#x27;t solely powered only by Microsoft Cloud and could support python running locally, but regardless I think this will still be huge and single-handedly modernizes Excel by a large margin.This alone could eliminate the need for websites that just want this sort of data. I can think of a past project at a previous job I did building an analytics website used only by a handful of people internally that could have been just as well served with something like this, had it existed at the time. reply taylodl 20 hours agoparent> This alone could eliminate the need for websites that just want this sort of dataI catch flak for this all the time! Our users just want to be able to use Excel to free-form analyze their data. IT, of which I&#x27;m a part of, insists on building web apps to do that for them. They&#x27;re never happy because all they wanted was Excel.I keep explaining all we have to do is build a data mart built using SQL Server, and use our ETL tools to keep it populated with the data they need to analyze. Don&#x27;t let them anywhere near the source data. They keep looking at me like I have ten heads. Instead they want to launch multi-million dollar projects to bring Tableau to our users - and they don&#x27;t want it! It&#x27;s asinine! reply prometheus76 18 hours agorootparentOur company uses Power BI for this very reason. Most of our users are content with what&#x27;s available in the reports we&#x27;ve built in Power BI. However, a few power users directly connect to the datasets we&#x27;ve created (that also feed the Power BI reports) and can mix and match that data in Excel.Excel will import datasets from the Power BI client, and you can refresh the data at any time. The nice part of this arrangement is that the whole model is imported. All the relationships between tables, all the added calculation columns, all the measures are there for use by the end user in Excel.Power BI has been a great solution for our company (~1000 employees). reply thrashh 5 hours agorootparentThere’s also the Power Query add-in for Excel that’s super steezy.It’s like a light Power BI.Honestly even thought I can make interactive report webapps, that stuff needs to be built and maintained so I rather have people use Excel or a BI tool. Even I rather use Excel or a BI tool than write code. reply rawgabbit 18 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and Tableau Cloud are great if expensive products. With Tableau Prep, you get a visual ETL tool. Being technical, I prefer SQL, but for business folks Tableau Prep is more of a REPL so they see what their actions are going to do. They can schedule these Prep flows in Tableau Cloud which will ETL and produce daily datasets which users can then interact via the dashboards on Tableau Cloud.IMO, Excel is on the right path with out of the box connectors to Salesforce, Azure databases, etc. What it really needs is full blown SQL with REPL output so the users can see the effects of their SQL. (The way Tableau Prep does it is that it defaults to a sampling of rows to output immediate results). There used to be a Microsoft service called Excel online but it was another thing you had to buy and was super confusing. Excel needs to let users schedule their ETL&#x2F;datasets in SharePoint online and then let other users subscribe to it. They can call it Excel Super+ and charge a small fortune. I am positive there are people with their wallets open. reply prometheus76 18 hours agorootparentThat last part is almost exactly what we do with Power BI. We import tables from a SQL data warehouse into Power BI. We then build a data model (creating relationships between tables, adding calculated columns to those tables where needed, and creating measures to summarize the data). We then create reports based on those datasets. Most of our users are content with what they see in the Power BI web client.This is the killer feature, however: power users can access those same datasets through Excel and import the entire model. All the relationships, all the calculated columns, and all the measures are there for the power users to mix and match and filter however they want in Excel.

However, you seem to be saying that Excel should handle ANY numerical strings that way if they are long enough to express a date or datetime, which, while it might make your particular workflow easier (or it might not), it would really mess with people&#x27;s ability to use Excel with large numerical values... reply mulmen 19 hours agorootparentExcel only maintains 15 digits of precision for numbers.

If they were just shipping python (standard library), it would be fine, but all of the useful libraries have large numbers of dependencies. reply zeratax 6 hours agorootparentdoesn&#x27;t this dependency hell still exist, but just in the cloud? reply localhost 18 hours agorootparentprev> games have been skipping with Python scripting for decadesThat only works if there is a forever fixed version of Python embedded in your game. The value of Python in this context is its ecosystem and folks will need to install additional packages and libraries into the execution environment. Now you&#x27;re managing a local distribution of Python. reply SiempreViernes 15 hours agorootparentYeah, but if the big value is supposed to be in the libraries you sort of have to accept dependency hell? Otherwise you&#x27;re in the world where a small set of libraries can deliver all the functionality ever needed.Of the currently available solutions, \"cloud environment made by Microsoft\" doesn&#x27;t sound that different from \"software update made by Microsoft\" in terms of how it solves the dependency hell: basically, the critical library you need is either in or out, but there is nothing you can do about it.Admittedly, here I&#x27;m assuming Microsoft won&#x27;t let you install things into the environment yourself since that basically means hosting virtual machines running arbitrary code and putting the Excel brand in front. reply localhost 14 hours agorootparentDependency hell may be an issue if you install arbitrary libraries into the container at runtime. Note that this feature isn&#x27;t currently available in the preview.On versioning: we freeze the container image that your Workbook was authored against.

Excel doesn&#x27;t have a setting for this either as far as I know, so people who do want discontiguous copy&#x2F;paste to preserve spacing would probably be as irked by Excel as I am by LibreOffice and Numbers.

Not like that 20 year old is gonna know anything about programming either. 99% of people just aren&#x27;t programmers and aren&#x27;t going to learn programming when they just want to futz around with some numbers and the easiest (yet also the most powerful) tool they know for it is a spreadsheet.If somebody in any business, anywhere, at any point wants to do something with numbers, they&#x27;re going to use Excel. reply hospitalJail 18 hours agoparentprevLibreOffice has plenty of other problems to knock out first.Its so slow. reply ayhanfuat 18 hours agoprevDisappointing:> Python in Excel is currently available to users running Beta Channel on Windows.

I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever set up a container with all of anaconda, scikit, statsmodels, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, and more but it gets pretty big. A lot of people would complain about the bloat if Excel installed it by default.Another complication is they claim the container isn&#x27;t just \"a docker container\", but for increased security isolation (they don&#x27;t want a repeat of VBA malware) it&#x27;s a mini-VM focused to run on top of Hyper-V (the Windows Hypervisor) itself. That&#x27;s a really complicated install process on the average machine (like installing WSL2) that sometimes involves flipping entire Windows Features on, so also something unlikely to be a smooth experience out of the box for Excel.It might be neat if they made that an optional install and let users have offline support, but it sounded like they wanted to focus on online and collaborative UX first. reply pseudalopex 5 hours agorootparentHow large is pretty big?

    "originBody": "LISTEN TO THE 404 MEDIA PODCAST SIGN IN SUBSCRIBE ABOUT THANKS PODCAST NEWS The Secret Weapon Hackers Can Use to Dox Nearly Anyone in America for $15 JOSEPH COX · AUG 22, 2023 Most Americans have very little choice but to provide their personal information to credit bureaus. Hackers have found a way into that data supply chain, and are advertising access in group chats used by violent criminals who rob, assault, and shoot targets. A PHOTO OF A MASK AND AMMUNITION UPLOADED TO A GROUP CHAT WHERE DATA ACCESS IS ADVERTISED. Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content It took only a few seconds to uncover the target’s entire life. On the messaging app Telegram, I entered a tiny amount of information about my target into the dark blue text box—their name and the state I believed they lived in—and pressed enter. A short while later, the bot spat out a file containing every address that person had ever lived at in the U.S., all the way back to their college dorm more than a decade earlier. The file included the names and birth years of their relatives. It listed the target’s mobile phone numbers and provider, as well as personal email addresses. Finally, the file contained information from their drivers’ license, including its unique identification number. All of that data cost $15 in Bitcoin. The bot sometimes offers the Social Security number too for $20. This is the result of a secret weapon criminals are selling access to online that appears to tap into an especially powerful set of data: the target’s credit header. This is personal information that the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have on most adults in America via their credit cards. Through a complex web of agreements and purchases, that data trickles down from the credit bureaus to other companies who offer it to debt collectors, insurance companies, and law enforcement. A 404 Media investigation has found that criminals have managed to tap into that data supply chain, in some cases by stealing former law enforcement officer’s identities, and are selling unfettered access to their criminal cohorts online. The tool 404 Media tested has also been used to gather information on high profile targets such as Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and even President Joe Biden, seemingly without restriction. 404 Media verified that although not always sensitive, at least some of that data is accurate. The communities where this tool is advertised include chat rooms focused on swatting, where criminals place bogus calls that result in a heavily armed police response to a specific location; SIM swapping, in which hackers take over a victim’s phone number to then receive login codes and break into their online accounts; and physical violence, where criminals hire one another to rob, shoot, or assault their enemies and vandalize the target’s home. Overall, the tool offers exceptional power and requires little to no technical sophistication to obtain a victim’s sensitive data. Worse yet, it is exceedingly difficult for a user to opt out, and this data may be available even for people who have otherwise been careful with distributing their personal information, and who have taken steps to have their details scrubbed from other data brokers. Senator Ron Wyden told 404 Media in a statement that “These companies have demonstrated that they can't control who has access to their data products. The government needs to stop these companies from packaging and selling our personal information, and the senior executives that put profit over national security and Americans' safety should be punished accordingly.” The Supply Chain Eighty-two percent of American adults had a credit card in 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Whenever someone applies for a credit card, their financial institution transfers personal details about the customer to the big three credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. This is in part so the bureaus can track a user’s credit score. In other words, the majority of the adult population, by the simple fact of how credit cards work, will have their personal information collected and stored by these bureaus. The bureaus also play an important role in preventing fraud, by holding onto peoples’ most sensitive personal information and using that to verify their identities. But years ago the bureaus realized they had such a valuable resource of data, and diversified what they did with that information, John Gilmore, head of research at DeleteMe, a company that helps scrub peoples’ data from the internet, said. The bureaus made some of the data provided by consumers—known as credit header information—available to other companies. The FTC defines credit header information as the portion of a consumer’s credit report that typically contains the person’s name, birth date, current and prior addresses, Social Security number, and telephone number. Essentially, it can include everything on a person’s credit report above the details on who they have borrowed money from—the top, or the header, of the document. While credit reports themselves are limited to certain uses such as applications for credit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), credit bureaus and data brokers generally believe credit header falls under a different piece of legislation: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). This law gives the credit bureaus room to sell credit header information to third parties under a set of use cases that are much broader than the full credit report. Examples include to protect against fraud or the vague term “holding a legal or beneficial interest relating to the consumer.” In February, a group of activist and legal organizations, including the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Just Futures Law, wrote to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about this legislative issue around credit header data. JOIN THE NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST UPDATES. That letter says that the bureaus’ position on credit header data comes from a particular reading of a 2011 report written by the FTC, which the bureaus interpret as meaning they don’t have to treat credit header data with the same protections as a full credit report. “This interpretation of the FTC report is erroneous,” the group of organizations wrote. The third party companies that buy or receive the credit header information in turn often resell or provide access to it for a fee to private investigators, real estate investors, and other industries. One company called AlumniFinder, for example, sells GLBA data so educational institutions can “reach and engage lost alumni” according to its website. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has used similar data that flowed from utility companies to Equifax, which then was sold to data brokers. And in March, the FBI and National Counterintelligence and Security Center warned that foreign intelligence entities working for repressive regimes have sought access to private investigators in part to obtain personal information on targets in the U.S. At some point in that trickle down of data, criminals have found a way in. \"TLO the bitch\" 404 Media accessed around 10 Telegram groups where members discuss and advertise bots that offer personally identifiable data for sale. Prices fluctuate between around $15 and $40 depending on what type of data a customer wishes to buy, and as availability ebbs and flows. One person told a group that their tool finds anybody. 404 Media has seen criminals using the bots specifically for doxing people, meaning publishing their personal information online. In multiple instances, personal information with the same data types as the bot 404 Media used was uploaded to a website popular with cybercriminals and harassers to preserve dox on victims. Members have indicated in their chats and shared dox that they are targeting YouTubers and seemingly ordinary people, as well as the high profile celebrities and politicians. Some of those bot-generated dox have been uploaded by users that deal specifically in physical violence. These include groups whose members offer services for a price such as shooting up a house, armed robberies, stabbings, and assault. The cybercrime underground has seen a dramatic rise in violence and harassment over the last few years, with innocent neighbors sometimes being swept up in online fights turned physical. In those violence-as-a-service groups, some members explicitly ask for or offer this type of data. A PHOTO OF A WATCH AND WEAPON UPLOADED TO A GROUP CHAT WHERE DATA ACCESS IS ADVERTISED. The exact data broker the criminals used to to obtain data appears to have changed over time. In January, I reported criminals were advertising access to a tool called TLOxp, owned by TransUnion. This direct relationship with TransUnion makes TLOxp an especially powerful tool. In one of the few well-documented cases of abuse of TLOxp, in 2018 Forbes covered how an amateur rap crew used TLOxp as part of a million dollar fraud spree. More recent Telegram messages suggest the new wave of cybercriminal access to TLOxp was short-lived, before they moved onto other providers. But judging by the voluminous chatter mentioning it, TLOxp is the database that has caught the cultural zeitgeist of the criminal underground. Talk of TLOxp is now so common that people use it generally to mean a powerful lookup tool. They also use the name of the tool as a verb. “I should TLO the bitch huh,” one message reads. “Have fun tlo’ing me,” another reads. “TLO her,” a third says. Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content TransUnion is aware of its brand recognition within the criminal underground. In a statement, TransUnion said that “At times, fraudsters will pull data from other sources and misrepresent it as TLOxp data.” The company added it deploys various safeguards and protections to ensure its data is only used as legally permitted, but acknowledged unauthorized parties do sometimes gain access. “On the very rare occasion where we confirm misuse of TLOxp, we coordinate with law enforcement to help prosecute those responsible,” TransUnion added. Beyond TLO, criminals have mentioned multiple different companies in the Telegram groups they claim to use: Data-Trac, SearchBug, and USinfoSearch among them. Data-Trac told 404 Media that someone gained access to its tool by stealing the identity of a former law enforcement officer and private investigator in Florida. The criminal then opened an account with those credentials, which included a drivers’ license. Data-Trac said it is working with law enforcement on an active case concerning the incident. Normally, data brokers verify who a private investigator customer is by performing an on-site visit to the customer’s office. They’ll verify the private investigator has a locked filing cabinet and shredder for properly handling records. Data-Trac, however, said at the time of the criminal gaining access, the company only performed “remote confirmation,” where the applicant is asked to provide various pieces of identity and security verification virtually rather than in-person. Noah Wieder, CEO of SearchBug, confirmed his tool had been used to look up around half a dozen names 404 Media identified as being targets of criminals. Those included Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, President Biden, as well as some rappers and others who don’t appear to be celebrities. Spotify, which hosts Rogan’s podcast, did not respond to a request for comment. X, the site previously known as Twitter and which Musk owns, did not respond either. A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment when asked about the tool being used against President Biden and instead directed the request to the CFPB. Wieder said he didn’t know whether SearchBug’s own data provider gave it credit header data specifically, but said it was the responsibility of the data supplier to block requests for lookups on high profile individuals like celebrities and politicians. Do you know anything else about the sale of credit header data? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co. In response to 404 Media’s findings, Wieder said SearchBug will now perform those blocks itself. The same day Wieder said SearchBug would introduce those limits, one bot seller said on Telegram their bot would now face restrictions; they later told their customers to not look up celebrities or public officials. USinfoSearch, meanwhile, said its tool had not been used to lookup any of the names criminals targeted, but criminal chatter shows a high level of interest in the company. Scott Hostettler, general manager of USinfoSearch, told 404 Media in an email that “the security and protection of our licensed databases and information is at the very top of our priorities and our systems are monitored continuously.” “We understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and upholding the trust of our users is our top priority. Any allegation that we have provided data to criminals is in direct opposition to our fundamental principles and the protective measures we have established and continually monitor to prevent any unauthorized disclosure,” he added. Other companies mentioned by the criminals, including Microbilt and another called LocatePlus, did not respond to requests for comment. In 2019, I reported that Microbilt was part of a supply chain of location data from telecoms that ended up with bounty hunters being able to instantly pinpoint most phones inside the U.S. Regardless, Julie Mao, co-founder and deputy director of Just Futures Law, which has campaigned against ICE’s use of similar data, said “it’s likely that at least some of this data (and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s almost all) is credit header info” after reviewing a sample of the data generated by the tested bot. The Near Impossibility of Removal In 404 Media’s own tests, while DeleteMe is a helpful tool at removing personal information from a myriad of people-search sites, at the time of writing it does not appear to cover the sites these criminals are using, nor does it prevent the tested Telegram bot from gaining access to information that is otherwise not easily available. Gilmore from DeleteMe said that the company is constantly adding new services to track, and some are more responsive than others. That game of whack-a-mole presents another, more fundamental issue. Curtailing the spread of credit header information will persist until it is stopped at the source: the credit bureaus. But for the ordinary consumer, it can be very difficult to get the credit bureaus to stop selling their data to third-parties, and perhaps impossible to have them delete it entirely, given their continued role in combating fraud. “They will not remove you from their datasets, but they will not sell it in certain conditions,” Gilmore said. The bureaus make the process very onerous, Gilmore added. “They never purge the header data, because that is necessary for fraud checks.” Of course, even if a person did manage to get the bureaus to stop distributing their data, if a third party has already obtained a copy, that data may still find its way out. And then it’s very difficult for someone to learn which of the avalanche of companies sold or provided their data to others as well. Privacy and legal campaigners think the solution is plugging the flow of credit header data at the bureaus. “We really believe that the real, fundamental problem is that this information is being bought and sold to begin with,” Mao said. “When consumers can’t opt-out or organize to have an actual option to protect privacy, that’s precisely the role of government bodies. “This is precisely why regulation is key,” she added. “It should absolutely not be allowed,” Rob Shavell, CEO of DeleteMe said of credit bureaus feeding credit header data to wider industries. Of all the entities that are the root cause of this data, “the credit bureaus are number one,” Shavell added. “They are the ones that should be subject to the strictest compliance and ultimately be held to a higher privacy standard by the federal government and by state governments than they are being,” he said. “The credit bureaus are number one.” In March, the CFPB put out a request for information about data brokers, where organizations can write-in with their concerns about the trade of data. Last week, the CFPB announced it was proposing new rules that would change the regulation of credit header data. Under those proposals, brokers would not be able to sell such data for targeted advertising, training AI, or to perpetrators of domestic violence, according to an overview of the proposed rule provided by the CFPB. Brokers could still sell credit header data for other purposes like insurance and credit underwriting, and employment and government benefit applications. On the face of it, those proposed rule changes may not curb the criminal access or abuse uncovered by 404 Media. When asked for the CFPB’s comment on criminals who carry out physical violence obtaining credit header data, the CFPB shared a quote from the agency’s director Rohit Chopra which again addressed artificial intelligence and not the kind of criminal abuse of the data reported by 404 Media. “Reports about monetization of sensitive information—everything from the financial details of members of the U.S. military to lists of specific people experiencing dementia—are particularly worrisome when data is powering ‘artificial intelligence’ and other automated decision-making about our lives. The CFPB will be taking steps to ensure that modern-day data brokers in the surveillance industry know that they cannot engage in illegal collection and sharing of our data,” the statement said. The CFPB’s announcement made no explicit mention of the sale of credit header data to private investigators, which is how criminals have managed to access such sensitive personal information. When pressed by 404 Media on whether the CFPB’s rule change would address this, the CFPB said it was in the early stages of the process, but that the sale of data to private investigators was a concern. Mao said that if the CFPB does change the rules so credit header data is part of a consumer report, and therefore bound by the FCRA which regulates reports, “it would significantly restrict the sale of credit header data.” However, “it could be a strong regulation or it could be a very narrow regulation that still allows the sale of credit header data.” The “announcement essentially states that the agency intends to address the sale of the credit header data. While that's great news, we do not know the substance of what they will propose, though we hope it will really address the problem,” Mao said. As part of its proposed rules, the CFPB is now asking small businesses to contact the agency and provide feedback. The entire process could still take a long time. Laura Rivera, policy counsel at Just Futures Law, believes the CFPB already has the power to combat the sale of credit header data. “We want the agency to act now, and not wait for a lengthy regulatory process to close the credit header data loophole,” she said. Jordan Takeyama, senior public relations manager at Experian, said “we thoroughly vet all clients and partners, and contractually require them to maintain high levels of commitment to the responsible use and security of data and uphold laws.” Equifax did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “It is now clear that data brokers pose both a threat to U.S. national security and to Americans' safety and privacy,” Senator Wyden’s statement added. “These unaccountable companies have recklessly sold Americans' information to agents working for foreign governments and have enabled hackers to access and sell Americans' personal information to anyone with a credit card.” Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content Unparalleled access to hidden worlds both online and IRL. 404 Media is a new independent media company founded by technology journalists Jason Koebler, Emanuel Maiberg, Samantha Cole, and Joseph Cox.

Initially setting it up is a pain in the butt and is rage-inducing, as you have to provide a bunch of personal data when the whole problem in the first place is that they&#x27;re careless with your data.However, once you&#x27;ve got it set up, it&#x27;s very easy to freeze and unfreeze them. Just keep all the URLs, usernames, and passwords in a secure note somewhere, and any time you need to apply for credit, unfreeze them for a day or a week.I used to have all sorts of identity theft problems (people taking out credit in my name) but freezing my credit has solved it.Experian: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experian.com&#x2F;freeze&#x2F;center.htmlTransUnion: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transunion.com&#x2F;credit-freezeEquifax: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equifax.com&#x2F;personal&#x2F;credit-report-services&#x2F;cred...I truly hate these companies but holding my nose and going through the process was worthwhile and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. reply StillBored 12 hours agoparentAs a long time freeze user, it seems literally every time I go to unfreeze the process has changed at one of them and it can&#x27;t be unlocked with the username +password I setup.

The magical idea of identity as an intangible self isn’t helpful.It is bank fraud and imitation with the intent to abuse the reputation of the person imitated. It should be illegal to imitate you when it negatively hurts you. It’s illegal to imitate police and doctors etc because it uses their reputations for fraudulent means. This is the same thing.Banks are the financially defrauded victims in this situation, but the victims are also individuals because banks passed the reputational risk of fraud to the customers. If your credit score is hurt and you need to hire lawyers to fix it or you get denied for a mortgage (or just a good rate), you’ve experienced tangible harm.Banks know they experience harm here. They plan for it. It’s baked into the prices and financial statements. Read the essays by Patrick McKenzie, he’ll argue that fraud is intentionally tolerated. They know that the consumer won’t be expected pay once the fraud is discovered. That’s not their goal, and they’re not being deceitful here.You can argue if this system is overall good or bad, but it almost certainly has led to cheaper credit for everyone. Outsourcing credit worthiness to a magic national number (or 3) is cheaper than every credit union assessing risk themselves, with less knowledge. reply oxygen_crisis 13 hours agorootparent> the victims are also individuals because banks passed the reputational risk of fraud to the customersIn that case I am not a victim of the fraudster, I am a victim of the bank.The banks do not have sufficient incentive to improve their identification methods, so long as we tolerate the concept that we bear any responsibility for a transaction that involves only themselves and a fraudster who knows the answers to a few trivia questions about me. reply true_religion 10 hours agorootparentIt’s like defamation.

If I use a keylogger to grab your passwords and impersonate you in emails, forums, and so on then your identity is stolen, it&#x27;s in use by someone else instead of you without consent for a period of time. This does not mean your identity has been removed from you permanently. This also does not mean your identity was always in your control just because the sites should have done more verification to see if it was you. It was still stolen but the fraud wasn&#x27;t caught, and the lost money due to fraud falls between the criminal and 3rd party regardless independent of your identity being fraudulently used. Keep in mind that&#x27;s how it is today, if your identity is stolen it is already the bank that eats the loss due to fraudulent lending.If you still disagree please try to make an argument without mentioning banks. Identity theft covers a lot more than banking fraud so the explanation shouldn&#x27;t explain how you want the term to be changed to something which focuses solely on banks.The processes in place do suck. That has nothing to do with the name of the crime though. reply jfengel 13 hours agorootparentIf you still disagree please try to make an argument without mentioning banks.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to avoid mentioning the banks. They are the ones committing the harm against you.They are a stand-in for numerous other institutions who abuse you. You can take the name \"bank\" to mean any organization who is defrauded, and then abuses you to obtain repayment for that fraud.I think it&#x27;s important to recognize that this is a two-step process. The middle-man in this procedure is crucial, because they are the ones with a lot of power to use the legal system against you. If they were somebody other than a bank or other significant corporation, you&#x27;d be able to say, \"No, I&#x27;m not the John Smith you gave money to. Go away and find that person.\" The imbalance makes it necessary to define the argument in terms of banks and similar institutions. reply zamadatix 12 hours agorootparentCriminal identity theft is one class of examples. An example scenario from this class is someone passes your identifiers off as theirs while committing a crime. Nobody was defrauded, no money exchanged, but you&#x27;ll still want to report identity theft.Claiming identity theft is precisely the process to notify the bank (or others) they cannot legally abuse you to get repayment for that fraud or you are not responsible for those crimes or whatever occured on your behalf. Under identity theft laws they are responsible for the loss due to fraud, not you. The same as credit card companies. The legal system is used but as much by you saying \"I didn&#x27;t buy that house, clear my records and eat the losses\" as by the bank initially saying \"this person didn&#x27;t pay their loan\". To not involve the legal system by both parties just opens up an even worse can of worms of fraud.One thing I do agree on is that anything that can reasonably be done to make the process easier on the victim of identity theft should be as the process is too hard on them right now. Probably more fines to most middlemen to increase the cost further beyond their losses. I just don&#x27;t think changing the name of the crime has anything to do with that kind of improvement. reply oxygen_crisis 8 hours agorootparentprev> If I use a keylogger to grab your passwords and impersonate you in emails, forums, and so on then your identity is stolenThis is actually a great example.If you impersonate me in an e-mail and talk someone into sending a thousand dollars they owed me into some strange account, a reasonable victim isn&#x27;t going to come to me and say \"we&#x27;re square now, because I paid that fraudster&#x27;s account what I owed you.\"Instead they should admit they made a mistake in assuming it was me based on suspiciously inadequate information and pursue the fraudster if they want their money back. reply s__s 13 hours agorootparentprevIdentity can’t be stolen.

Impersonation is one way of stealing one of those definitions identity theft refers to. This doesn&#x27;t mean the definition of identity is simultaneously violated.The victim of impersonation isn&#x27;t held accountable for the action of the criminal, particularly with banks.

Near where I live six of the eight trailer parks have disappeared in the last four years and have been turned into two separate campgrounds, a car wash, a dirt parking lot waiting to be redeveloped, a warehouse, and a new luxury senior apartment complex, with intent to redevelop the others into retail or housing shortly.

You might later. There are plenty of articles on the web about how to start, basically getting a credit card (perhaps secured) and slowly building up your credit.I am lucky enough to be a cash buyer.

I have a couple of credit cards which I pay off every month (so good, my credit utilization is low) but by the rating companys&#x27; POV there wasn&#x27;t enough to go on: not enough accounts, and no accounts apart from the CCs: no mortgage, no car payments etc. The fact that I&#x27;m a homeowner doesn&#x27;t appear in the report. reply isykt 7 hours agoparentprevNote that Experian runs their own protection racket called “Credit Lock” that is different from a freeze.

But this feels like a lot more words and doesn&#x27;t actually convey as much as what you get when you have to internalize the rhetoric.Honest question, is sarcasm dead? reply Eisenstein 12 hours agorootparentIn text sarcasm generally works best when it is either appropriate for the setting or it is blatantly obvious. If one employs it otherwise then being treated seriously should be expected. When in doubt many will opt to treat it as genuine since reacting to a serious comment as if it were sarcasm comes across as condescending. reply godelski 10 hours agorootparent> or it is blatantly obviousIt falls under this case.First, we notice the comment isn&#x27;t an actual question, as there is nothing to actually be answered. This is a clear indication that its usage is therefore that of rhetoric. This is likely why they didn&#x27;t respond, as there was nothing informative you could say unless you are significantly updating the premise which is being mocked.Second, the diction and pattern of the sentence matches a commonly user sarcastic pattern of \"wait, you&#x27;re saying x but y?!\" and the only thing missing is a surprised pikachu gif. It even does this at an abstracted level as it emphasizes the arbitrariness of the entity requesting the information. The pattern is up there with \"I have a modest proposal\" and I am having difficulties in even coming up with a more prominent pattern. There are several prominent memes built off of this.Third, it involves additional flare to indicate a mocking of the obviousness of the claim made by the article which is summed by the parent. The comment is quite pejorative, with a clear disdain for the lack of accountability of the credit agencies.As far as sarcastic comments go, this is about as blatant as one can get. Even my sarcastic addendum (\"Is sarcasm dead?\") is less obvious than the comment. Similarly the sarcasm you are employing is far less obvious. But none necessitate vocal inflections. I think your detector is defunct and you may wish to take it in for repairs or an upgrade.I also disagree with your interpretation of when sarcasm works and I would suggest a different strategy. Your strategy will have a high false positive rate and teach you to misidentify sarcasm rather than learn to identify it. If a comment appears reactionary and condescending without a abundantly clear question to answer, either assume sarcasm or bad faith. In the latter case, one should not engage as you&#x27;re only encouraging hostility. Simply downvote and move on. If you are wrong, you have just downvoted a sarcastic comment (which may not be adding too much to the conversation, as is the case here), which also sends a signal to the user that they need to work on their sarcasm or save it for other forums. You can take a middle case and hedge by saying \"I think this is sarcasm, but if not...\" This also goes with a different strategy of not responding if you don&#x27;t have much to contribute. If you don&#x27;t have a clear question to answer then the only reasonable responses are to ignore or ask for clarification, least you just create more noise. Internet conversations are well known to degrade easily and quickly.We also should mention satire, as it is often employed. Satire&#x27;s foundation is that of an alternative interpretation. The simple metric here is \"would a reasonable person state this?\" If there is any doubt to this, I suggest reading this document which describes the definition of satire while also making heavy use of it[0].I mention that my addendum employs sarcasm, through exaggeration, but there is some real question to it, as lately I have seen severe identification even with the use of \"modest proposals.\" Language itself is compression and if one is to take a literal interpretation of everything then you will be unable to accurately communicate and are likely to frequently enrage and annoy others. Due to the compressive nature, you will always be required to \"read between the lines\" otherwise even this sentence would be uninterpretable.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;DocketPDF&#x2F;22&#x2F;22-293&#x2F;242292&#x2F;2022... replybonestamp2 16 hours agoparentprevSome of the \"people finder\" type websites have most of the data they mentioned for free.

And it was already not possible at scale in major European countries before GDPR. What permit it to happen in the USA at scale, is that the baseline of protections is so low compared to Europe. Depending on the state it is getting better, but there is still this culture about making massive files on everybody about everything and then selling them to anybody who ask and pay. Such databases are often forbidden in Europe to begin with because we think of what could happen if they are misused.The notion that the fault would completely be on a \"Belarusian teenager stealing your identity\" and no responsibility whatsoever on people organising a system of massive private data collection in the first place, and then not even able to keep such data secure, is ludicrous. And even when you know that privacy invasion is attempted all the time you don&#x27;t reach the conclusion that at the very least better securing the data would be needed, that task I&#x27;m not sure can be done by any \"Belarusian teenager\" - and that task has de-facto not be done by whoever is collecting and maintaining the private data that has leaked and is still leaking. reply Nextgrid 15 hours agorootparent> That kind of unbounded massive privacy violation would result in million € fines (if not dozen or hundreds of millions) under GDPR lawNo they wouldn&#x27;t.

Sadly, at least according to our popular narrative, America was founded on the principle of extreme distrust of the government.

Zero knowledge stuff seems impossible on the surface so explaining it to political folks is extremely difficult as I have first hand experience with. \"Guaranteeing I&#x27;ve paid my taxes without revealing anything else about my finances\" tends to get them to listen up long enough for me to explain it to them most of the time though.Re govt distrust, not uniformly. As my older leftist friends remind me they grew up in a time were they thought anything was possible for their government to do, with enough protest they could get the civil rights act, the voting act, the infrastructure spending , etc with all their dreams on the horizon. Then a few people got a little too loud about ending poverty and other more \"\"radical\"\" progressive stuff and got killed for it. But it is possible, we&#x27;ve just been beat down for 50 years by neoliberal austerity politics.Very interesting stuff re SSL.

One time (I can&#x27;t find the reference) scammers called from the bank, suggested the person called back to the number on their credit card. The person hung up, picked up, and the scammers had held the line, played a fake dial tone, and had someone else \"pick up\". reply Mordisquitos 15 hours agorootparentI believe that potential exploit only work(s|ed) in the UK telephone network, and maybe those of countries developed in parallel using similar technology. Either way, it is a zero-cost precaution so you might as well do it just in case. reply IIsi50MHz 17 hours agorootparentprevIn USA telephones, unless you timetravel to \"party lines\" (when sets of local numbers had the same line, so picking up while a call was in use allowed people to listen or join in), hanging up any one end of a line disconnects the call the departing user from the call.If the described scam happened, in should have required a simultaneous fault in the phone system. Or more likley, the scammer played a recorded sound of a disconnect+dialtone, which could tricker the target into dialing. reply aidenn0 15 hours agorootparentThis is incorrect at least on Bell Atlantic&#x27;s (and then Verizon&#x27;s) network in the late 90s. Since there is no double-billing on landlines in the US, the person initiating the call is the only one that can immediately terminate a call to a landline. There&#x27;s a timeout for the reverse direction, but it at least used to be fairly long.Someone pulled a trick where they took advantage of this. Had a friend call and keep the line open. Then claim that you have the entire phone book memorized. To prove it, ask someone to name a random name, punch in 7 digits and hand it off to the person who named it. They ask for the name and your friend says \"yes that&#x27;s me\" (or \"they&#x27;re not home now if the gender mismatches). reply techsupporter 15 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s a timeout for the reverse direction, but it at least used to be fairly long.This brings up one of those cultural things: ever noticed how in movies and TV shows from the 80s and 90s, if the caller hung up, the person called immediately got a dial tone?It&#x27;s a trope that prop wranglers, set designers, and writers picked up because the telephone company around Los Angeles (Pacific Bell) had switches that would reset the line state for the destionation back to \"ready for call\", which meant dial tone, when the origin side disconnected. If the destination side disconnected, the origin would only be disconnected after approximately 20 seconds.Almost all other exchanges would put the destination--after the origin disconnects--into an off-hook-but-not-ready and then, after 10 or so seconds, play the \"if you&#x27;d like to make a call, please hang up and try again\" recording, then Special Information Tones, then a rapid busy.Yet because the service in and around LA is what a lot of people in the TV and movie business experienced, it is what got baked into those productions. reply TheKarateKid 6 hours agorootparentInteresting. I always assumed that the immediate dial tone after origin disconnected in movies & TV was for dramatic effect to let watchers know that the person hung up the phone. reply aidenn0 14 hours agorootparentprev> rapid busyI was a rather violent sleeper when I was young and would occasionally knock the phone off the hook while sleeping. Then I woke up to the fairly loud rapid busy sound. Hadn&#x27;t thought about that a while. reply IIsi50MHz 9 hours agorootparentprevNow that you mention it, I did vaguely used wonder why some phones took longer to hang up than others. Some, I would hear the receiver go onto its rest, and &#x27;immediately&#x27; hear a dial tone. Some, it took a few seconds.Related to what some other commenters pointed out…- The delay did seem to get longer when call-waiting became avaliable in an area.- Sometimes, right after pressing your own hook and then releasing it, I could not dial; I had to wait a couple seconds.- I never used a system where you could hang up and have time to run to another extension, but I may have known a couple people who claimed they could? If so, I probably dismissed it as \"weird\".- My direct experiences were with various regions of just three Bells, so another commenter&#x27;s remarks about LA&#x2F;PacBell were interesting.Thanks, everybody, for jogging my memory a bit. reply toast0 16 hours agorootparentprevThe time required for a good hangup might vary a little bit from exchange to exchange. I recall occasionally being able to transfer to different handsets hanging up one before picking up the other. But not to the extent reported in some anecdotes where one end can hold the call open indefinitely. reply jjnoakes 15 hours agorootparentThis is definitely true. I remember being able to quickly press and release the hangup button on a single phone and if I was quick enough the other person would remain on the line. I don&#x27;t recall exactly where the threshold was, but I believe it was around a half a second or so. reply ThinkingGuy 13 hours agorootparentI remember being able to hang up the phone in one room, run to the next room, and pick up the phone and continue the conversation.

Where do phones work like that? Isn&#x27;t it enough for one party to hang up for the call to be over? reply ralferoo 16 hours agorootparentThey used to operate this way in the UK - the line would stay occupied until the call initiator hung up. We used to play with this when I was a kid, but I&#x27;ve not had a landline since early 2000s, so I&#x27;ve no idea if this survived the transition to digital exchanges. TBH I doubt it, and I know lots of people complained about it, because it was really annoying if someone who&#x27;d called you hadn&#x27;t hung up properly as then you couldn&#x27;t make any further calls yourself. reply nickstinemates 17 hours agoparentprevWho answers phone calls, let alone from unknown numbers, these days? reply rootusrootus 15 hours agorootparentI do.

So ideally.. don’t use credit. But even criminals need credit too, so they craft synthetic identities and use these as proxies to operate in, without ever using their real identity.

So all the things people tell you “build credit” (eg: pay your bills on time, pay your rent, etc.) don’t actually “do” anything. There’s no credit score to attach to them, so they just go off into the ether. I built credit a bit late in life and it was a struggle to get started. At this point, I kind of wish I’d just avoided building credit altogether. I wouldn’t be in any of these systems. reply soared 16 hours agoparentNot having credit means you’ll never get a mortgage, auto loan, etc. reply hoosieree 15 hours agorootparentSome lenders still do \"manual underwriting\" for mortgages.So instead of blindly trusting your credit score as the measure of your ability to repay a loan, a human looks at your situation - income, other debts, etc, and makes a judgement call. It&#x27;s more paperwork and slower, but it definitely exists. reply rthomas6 15 hours agorootparentprevYou can get a mortgage without a credit score. It is called manual underwriting. reply gnicholas 16 hours agorootparentprevSo if you don&#x27;t anticipate needing a mortgage or car loan, could you get rid of credit cards and perhaps cut down your online footprint? The question is how you would pay for stuff — are debit cards just as bad? Cash is being phased out at some stores so that&#x27;s not always an option. I guess you could load up my Apple Pay straight from your bank and use that instead of a credit card? reply toast0 16 hours agorootparentDebit cards are (typically) connected to a checking account, and most banks and credit unions use the credit reporting agency ChexSystems to check for a history of checking account infractions and report infractions there as well. However, accounts in good standing aren&#x27;t typically reported. So once your account opening falls off the report, assuming you don&#x27;t kite checks or overdraft, your report will be empty. I think overdrafts likely need to be frequent or left unresolved for a long enough time to get on your report too, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure.Some banks will run a credit report from other agencies while opening too, but if you don&#x27;t ask for or refuse any credit cards offered, you should have an empty report from them, once everything falls off. reply gnicholas 15 hours agorootparentInteresting! So what you&#x27;re giving up is the 2% cash back, and purchase protection that credit cards offer, in exchange for having privacy? reply toast0 15 hours agorootparentYeah, debit cards interchange is much lower as I understand it, so there&#x27;s no room to give big rewards. I think purchase protection is, in theory, equivalent or close, but debit cards presume the transaction is good and hold your money, whereas credit cards are more of a review your bill and decide if you&#x27;re going to pay.But if you don&#x27;t want to have a credit profile, then you can&#x27;t use credit. reply landemva 12 hours agorootparentprevAt least one debit card kicks back 1%. Look around. replystonogo 16 hours agoparentprevThis isn&#x27;t the case. You get signed up for these credit services when anyone makes reports about you to them. This can be, for example, your landlord. Paying rent does not indeed affect a credit score, but credit scores are separate products from credit reports. You have a right to your credit report annually, but you have no right to know your FICO (or other such) credit score; they&#x27;re proprietary products.Basically, these companies will build profiles on anyone whose information gets reported to them, even if those profiles do not include a credit score. reply tptacek 17 hours agoprevDrivers license ID numbers in many states are almost public: they&#x27;re deterministically generated from basic personal information.

A practical guide to a good measurement culture where numbers don’t replace common sense Ágoston Török · Follow Published in Promaton · 5 min read · 1 day ago 185 1 We live in a world where we collect data about everything. Think of the data we track on our navigation, our customer behavior, our health, and our company/team/individual performance. Unfortunately, this abundance of data led to a growing prevalence of KPI* psychosis in technology companies. What do I mean by this? Let’s take the definition of Merriam-Webster for psychosis: “a serious mental illness characterized by defective or lost contact with reality”. This means KPI psychosis is a state of mind where a company has dysfunctional contact with its reality and makes decisions only based on numbers. Human subjectivity So why are companies so obsessed with collecting data to guide decisions? Data is seen as a way to fight biases, and when it comes to biases humans lead the way. We are so much biased that the people who collected the sorts of biases that feature human cognition received a Nobel prize for their work. Just to give a glimpse: we take information that is easiest to gather (availability bias), often that is heavily affected by the latest info we got (recency bias) and when we make conclusions we tend to overgeneralize (halo/horn effect) with more confidence than it was justified by our lintels (overconfidence bias). On top, we are typically stubborn and seldom change our opinions and worldview (anchoring bias, confirmation bias). This is especially problematic when changes happen slowly and in small steps. For instance, the way software development productivity changes in our team. KPI objectivity Enter KPIs as the objective truth. Free of subjectivity, perfect, right? Not so fast. In fact, often our data collection and measurement are also biased by us (e.g. algorithmic bias). And even if that is not the case, unfortunately, KPIs suffer from tunnel vision: they measure what is measurable, while not necessarily all aspects of the situation are. Albert Einstein put it brilliantly: “Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted.” This results in perverse motivation in many organizations, where people have to choose between doing their job well (broader reality) or getting promoted for meeting the KPIs (tunnel vision). And that’s exactly the KPI psychosis I described above. KPIs are only indicators so they don’t capture the full reality. Image with permission from https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department The trivial solution It takes a different mental framing to fix this situation: KPIs should be used in combination with human intuition to enable optimal decision-making. So not just intuition or data, but a constant back and forth of making (i.e. intuition) and testing (i.e. data) hypotheses. This leads us to the importance of explaining what a KPI actually indicates — and not only what it measures. This is often underestimated. Let’s take the example of Time To Last Byte (TTLB), a common metric of service quality that we also use at Promaton. It measures the time between the request sent by the client and the last byte of the related response from the server. In business terms, this is how much time your customer has to wait to get what they want. It’s easy to calculate and you can easily see how optimizing the runtime of server-side processing would result in improvement in the TTLB. However, you never actually want to improve TTLB per se, what you want to optimize is user experience. And understanding this is essential. If you know that you care about user experience, it can easily happen that you start exploring first the user segment that suffers most from high TTLBs. Maybe you are going to see that these users have something in common, e.g. all those requests are from an area with poor internet connection. Now your course of action will not be optimization of server-side processing, but something else (e.g. deploying in that region or on-premise for those customers). And most importantly maybe this action could easily lead to a smaller overall TTLB improvement than optimizing the most time-consuming process in the backend, yet you clearly improved the user experience more. Getting KPI optimization right KPIs are not born perfect: they often require lots of conceptualization, trial-and-error learning, or redefinition before you find comfort in relying on them. So you work on reaching your objective and while doing so you constantly check both what your KPI shows and also how much you can rely on it. Let’s say you want your product to be useful for your users in the long term. You start measuring retention, but there are so many conceptual challenges that you’ll have to resolve before your KPI would be really correlated with the long-term usefulness of the product; e.g. things like who a user is and what long-term means. This is the process called KPI optimization. KPI optimization is not about selecting one such value, telling them it’s bad, and telling your people to optimize it (e.g. our churn is 5%, it should be 2%). The problem with that is that it’s going to discourage people from asking up to which level that number represents reality. Reality both from the validity (it measures actual user loss) and from the reliability (it reliably changes when user loss happens) point of view. And finally, people are pretty good at number hacking: when I was about ten years old, I learned that secretly rubbing the mercury container of the thermometer helps to increase my “measured” body temperature. This was the KPI my mother used for deciding if I was (too) sick to go to school. Learning this hack helped me to score quite some extra holidays, but surely didn’t help our family’s objective of keeping kids at home (only) when they are sick. To summarize, here are my recommendations: Use KPIs in combination with intuition for optimal decision making Always keep in mind your actual objective instead of only defining the KPIs Continuously reflect on the reliability of your KPIs and revise them if necessary Btw, do you want to work in a company that does not suffer from KPI psychosis? Check out our open positions here: https://careers.promaton.com/ *: I use the acronym KPI (key performance indicator) instead of “data” because I consider it advantageous to have the word “indicator” always in mind but think of all metrics, numbers, indices, key results etc. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

It contains some screenshots and instructions like \"agents can now update the foobar rate from their mobile app without having to call in\". After a month or two of these going out like clockwork, it gave both management and business stakeholders a level of comfort that no amount of KPI dashboards ever could. KPIs compress away details that stakeholders need to form an understanding. A full blast from the task tracker is overkill. This solution worked for us. But of course, required a solid feature flag practice so that half-built features (story slices) could be released weekly for testing without affecting production. That said, we did maintain a quarter-level sum-of-t-shirt-size based KPI. reply Aurornis 20 hours agoparentI’ve watched this backfire, too.It works great when everyone is delivering day-long or week-long incremental features that lend themselves to nice screenshots.But then you slowly start accumulating a backlog of difficult tasks that everyone avoids because they won’t sound good for the week. Technical debt accumulates as people cut corners in the interest of getting their weekly presentations out.You can theoretically avoid it with enough trust, but the trigger for our collapse was a round of layoffs where the people with the most visible features were spared while people working on important backend work and bug fixes got cut. After that, it was game over. reply ChrisCinelli 18 hours agorootparentWithout an outstanding company culture, most KPIs are almost useless.While working at a big corporation we had a velocity initiative supposedly aimed to lead the company toward continuous integration.\"How long a PR stays open\" was one of the KPIs in a dashboard.I said: \"Be careful with that!\"People started to close PRs and reopen new PRs with the same code.Middle managers and sometimes the person in the division that was the point of contact for the velocity initiative were asking to do that.The script measuring this KPI was improved to look at the branch name and the code diff. Result? People changing branch name and a change of EOL encoding in the new PR.Learnings? B and C players with questionable ethics screw companies quite rapidly.In this climate KPIs and aligning them with company values is futile. reply rented_mule 17 hours agorootparentWhen I worked at a FAANG ~15 years ago, a new VP came in and heard, correctly, that our group didn&#x27;t have enough automated tests. He created a requirement that every developer commit two new tests to the code base every workday. He had automation put in to monitor our compliance.Within a couple of weeks, scripts were circulating to auto-generate and auto-commit tests. If the JVM we were using had a bug in adding random numbers together, we&#x27;d have known about it very quickly.That&#x27;s about the time I decided I should move on. I&#x27;m glad I did. The company I joined treated developers like adults and developers acted like adults. And we had great automated test coverage.Obligatory mention: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentAccountability is a big part of leadership, though. The anecdote basically just says the VP used the wrong tool for accountability, not that \"adults\" shouldn&#x27;t be held accountable. reply baconforce 11 hours agorootparentI think what was missing here was lack of developer buy-in into the actual changes implemented, and making sure that they were reasonable and sustainable. Sounds to me like a blanket mandate was handed out without buy-in and also wasn&#x27;t achievable, and the developers felt they had to work around it to get their real jobs done. reply bumby 11 hours agorootparentI agree. At the very least, it seems like he didn&#x27;t communicate the \"why\". It certainly wasn&#x27;t \"to make as many tests as possible\". I suspect the developers knew that, which is why is also a little unprofessional on their part to treat it like that was the goal. reply nicoburns 10 hours agorootparentI think the bigger problem here was inappropriate expectations: \"two tests a day\". That&#x27;s not a reasonable way to increase test coverage. And so the developers quite reasonably just tried to minimise the time spent on it. reply bumby 9 hours agorootparent>Number of unit tests isn&#x27;t the best proxy for that goal…However, I don’t think mindlessly creating tests is acting in good faith. It’s bordering on malicious compliance. I doubt they were thinking they can just knock out that metric so they can otherwise create better test coverage. (The OP conceded their coverage wasn’t good). Better employees would work to create a better understanding&#x2F;goal. All of that points to some cultural problems. replyrobertlagrant 17 hours agorootparentprevWould adult developers not have made sure they had enough automated tests? reply recursive 13 hours agorootparentIt probably depends whether they had been given specific instructions that directly conflicted with that. reply fendy3002 10 hours agorootparentAnd it also depends on whether they&#x27;re given a timeslot for that and&#x2F;or incentivized for it. Automated tests need times to maintain, especially if they&#x27;re some changes on flow &#x2F; specs, tests need to follow.I scrap all incentivized metrics when working on something urgent (important and soon), which is often the case. If the metrics somehow incentivized, we&#x27;ll start gaming it.Now if a dev has part on production support and automated tests are purposed to reduce the workload for support then it has time slots for that, I bet everyone will start doing it. reply networkchad 17 hours agorootparentprevI’ve often wondered what is the solution to Goodhart’s law. Obviously a business can’t abandon metrics. Perhaps this is where qualitative management skills come into play - humans in the loop making good decisions instead of blindly marching to the output of an automated reporting system. reply bulatb 11 hours agorootparentGoodhart&#x27;s law is always in effect. It can&#x27;t be solved because it&#x27;s not a problem, it&#x27;s a fact of nature with annoying implications. It&#x27;s the echo of the observation that efficiency is fitness as its consequences ripple from the lowest levels of reality through systems made of people.You can make an engine as effective as the laws of physics let you, but you can&#x27;t solve the limits of thermodynamics. You can only do your best within them. Same with this, for maybe the same reason. reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d argue that the point Goodhart&#x27;s law isn&#x27;t that metrics are bad, but that all metrics aren&#x27;t created equal. In the case above, it seems like the real goal was improved code quality. Number of unit tests isn&#x27;t the best proxy for that goal, so it wasn&#x27;t the best choice of metric. You don&#x27;t want developers creating tests for the sake of creating tests. (There&#x27;s some irony here in that it&#x27;s not the type of behavior I&#x27;d ascribe to professionals). The \"solution\" is a metric that&#x27;s a better measure of what you actually want. reply distant_hat 13 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, there is no good solution long term except changing the metrics themselves every so often. When new metrics come in, as long as they are not totally boneheaded, they improve things. Then people start learn to start gaming them and some of the more sociopathic folks start doing so, then others copy by example and soon enough the metric is useless at best or detrimental at worst and it is time to move to a new metric.It helps to have someone with a hacker mindset think about the metric being designed so the obvious ways in which it could be games are taken care of and their own metrics&#x2F;incentives are aligned with the company goal. reply sleepybrett 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you didn&#x27;t have enough tests you weren&#x27;t acting like adults. Why should he treat you like adults? reply ChrisCinelli 16 hours agorootparentMaybe you are jumping to a conclusion too quickly.How do you know what was really going on?\"He created a requirement that every developer commit two new tests to the code base every workday\" seem a stupid requirement if you do not control the quality of the tests.The same big corporation I wrote above had a goal of 80% code coverage reported on dashboards.I saw people writing tests just to run lines of code, without effectively testing anything.Others people were \"smarter\" and completely excluded folders and modules in the codebase with low coverage from coverage testing.Code coverage percentage numbers on a dashboard are a risky business. They can give you a false sense of confidence. Because you can have 100% code coverage and be plagued by multitude of bugs if you do not test what the code is supposed to do.Code coverage helps to see where you have untested code and if it is very low (ex: less 50%) tells you that you need more tests. An high code coverage percentage is desirable but should not be a target.The real problem is again the culture.A culture where it is ok to have critical parts of the code not being tested. A large part of the solution here is helping people to understand the consequences of low code coverage. For example collecting experiences and during retrospectives point out where tests saved the day or how a test may have saved the day so people can see how test may save them a lot of frustration.But again, when you give people a target and it is the only thing they care about, people find a way to hit it. reply sleepybrett 16 hours agorootparentHe said it himself.> When I worked at a FAANG ~15 years ago, a new VP came in and heard, correctly, that our group didn&#x27;t have enough automated tests. reply slt2021 15 hours agorootparenthad to mention https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;chestertons-fence&#x2F;if team does not have automated test, but still manages to deliver working software - maybe tests are not adding as much value as VP thinks?the most important is feature delivery, and integration test, not automated unit test where you test getters and setters with mock dependencies - absolutely useless busywork reply bumby 13 hours agorootparentChesterson&#x27;s fence isn&#x27;t saying that the fence&#x2F;test isn&#x27;t necessary. It&#x27;s saying you need to take the time to understand the broader context rather than take a knee-jerk assumption. To be more clear, just because developers don&#x27;t see the need for better testing, doesn&#x27;t mean more testing isn&#x27;t needed. But it may indicate the VP didn&#x27;t doing a good job of relating why, which leads to the gamesmanship shown in the story.Schedule isn&#x27;t always the most important thing either. It&#x27;s possible delivery the software may just mean you&#x27;ve been rolling the dice and getting lucky. The Boeing 737MAX scenario gives a concrete example of where delivery was paramount. It&#x27;s a cognitive bias to assume that \"since nothing bad has happened yet, it must mean it&#x27;s good practice\" reply Dylan16807 15 hours agorootparentprevThis might be relevant if the original comment didn&#x27;t say \"correctly\".Also \"not testing a lot\" is not a chesterton&#x27;s fence. \"not testing a lot\" can&#x27;t be load-bearing. reply nostrebored 15 hours agorootparentprevTests aren&#x27;t exclusively about asserting current behavior -- they also help you determine drift over time and explicitly mention the implicit invariants that people are assuming. reply Silhouette 16 hours agorootparentprevThere are a thousand reasons why reasonable people might have found themselves in that position. Maybe they inherited a code base after an acquisition or from some outside consultancy who didn&#x27;t do a great job. Maybe management made a rational business decision to ship something that would make enough money to keep the company going and knowingly took on the tech debt that they would then have some chance of fixing before the company failed. Maybe it actually had very high numbers from coverage tools but then someone realised that a relatively complex part of the code still wasn&#x27;t being tested very thoroughly.If a team has identified a weakness in testing and transparently reported it, presumably with the intention of making it better, then why would we assume that setting arbitrary targets based on some metric with no direct connection to the real problem would help them do that? reply Dylan16807 15 hours agorootparentprev> The real problem is again the culture.The culture lead to fake tests instead of adding tests that were legitimately lacking.Is that so different from saying they weren&#x27;t acting like adults?The phrasing could be called dismissive but I give that a pass because it was mimicking the phrasing from the post it replied to. The underlying sentiment doesn&#x27;t seem wrong to me. reply tetha 14 hours agorootparentprev> Code coverage percentage numbers on a dashboard are a risky business.

Plugin loading, config loading (this was before you spring boot&#x27;ed everything in java). We had almost no tests in that context, because testing the edge cases there would&#x27;ve been a real mess.But at the same time, if we messed up, no dev environment and no test environment would work anymore at all, and we would know. Very quickly. From a lot of sides, with a lot of anger in there. So we were fine. reply Varriount 16 hours agorootparentprevInsufficient test coverage doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean lack of self-discipline. It can also stem from project management issues (too much focus on features&#x2F;too little time given for test writing). reply gopher_space 15 hours agorootparentprevAn adult would have started to write the tests themselves so they&#x27;d understand what was going on around them. You don&#x27;t just frown at people and hope for the best. reply icedchai 15 hours agorootparentprevYep, I worked at a place that was focused on everyone completing 100% of their jira tickets each sprint, just to get the metrics up. You didn&#x27;t have to actually finish, it just had to look like you did to the bean counters.If end of sprint came and you weren&#x27;t done, the manager would close out the ticket, then reopen another similar one named \"Module phase 2\" or something similar for next sprint. One guy was an expert at gaming the system, and his ticket got closed and opened anew for about 3 or 4 sprints. reply asdfman123 11 hours agorootparentprev> Learnings?

From that perspective, it&#x27;s a risk-based approach to maintain the products and services that already have a market and instead effectively out-source the high risk operations of innovation. New companies don&#x27;t have comparatively much to maintain, so they can focus on innovation. It&#x27;s not quite such an either-or, but a balancing act. It&#x27;s just easier to balance when you can outsource risk.>Average CEO is 58 years old. Their first jobs were in the late 1980s.I believe there&#x27;s some neuroscience theory that may illuminate this. When we&#x27;re young, our intelligence is more plastic and can more readily innovate. But as we get older it becomes more crystalline. What we may lose some of that novelty generation, we can gain in understanding the greater levels of experience. Experience is necessary for putting ideas in their appropriate context.

In fact, almost everything work on that condition.But modern organizations are quick to destroy trust on any whim. reply no_wizard 17 hours agorootparentA hallmark of strong high trust environments I&#x27;ve found is that management beyond the team (or squad, or pod, or whatever you call it) is only concerned with Milestones, not sprints or other velocity metrics, and the check-ins with them revolve around the progress on the given Milestone(s) the team is working on.It is up to the team to decide on the best way to approach this, and what works best for that team, and the team is free to do the work as they see it, with the only requirement that if something does negatively affect the Milestone(s), it gets raised quickly and early, in case of re-adjustment.This however, means:- Product management has to be competent enough to present a relatively elastic vision that is not so concrete its essentially a waterfall, but not so vague that its unclear whats being built. Wireframes are usually a good signal here.- Engineering Management has to be competent enough to communicate (or allow others to communicate) technical challenges that may be involved, and more importantly, what may be unknown, to Product management- Everyone has to agree that demoing work is more important than talking about work, whenever possible- Trust in everyone doing the right thing needs to be high, constant interference and meetings will kill this from working right. reply SkyPuncher 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve found the same.We used goals and velocity metrics on the highest performing team I worked on. This was also a high trust team that happily raised concerns and adjusted priorities&#x2F;velocity&#x2F;etc.The goals and velocity were still extremely useful for getting everybody on the same page for what we were looking to accomplish and how long it would take. We needed to land in the general area, but never got caught up in meaningless drivel over metrics.The problem is management wants consistency and expects an explanation when things change. I&#x27;ve found it a team is perceived as failing if they&#x27;re actually realistic with goals and capabilities. reply Consultant32452 20 hours agorootparentprevThe place I&#x27;m consulting for at the moment shut down offices for years due to the pandemic. Some people moved out of state and continued to work because there was no signal of ever returning to the office. Then last week they said everyone had to return to the office 3 days per week or be fired with no exceptions. We&#x27;re losing an MVP on our team due to this. He now lives over 500 miles from the closest office. reply cesaref 19 hours agorootparentThe way around this is to open an office just for them. It sounds dumb, but it meets the business requirement, and could also drive further recruitment around their location. reply meowface 19 hours agorootparentIt seems like it&#x27;d be way more sensible and efficient to just make an exception for that particular employee (and maybe some other important ones). Though, in my opinion, the best option is to just let anyone work remotely as much as they want. Especially if you go years without ever indicating you intend to return people to the office.I think I&#x27;m luckily grandfathered in due to working fully remotely for years before the pandemic, but if that happened to me I would absolutely start looking for a new job. reply criddell 19 hours agorootparentprevThat can be more expensive than it appears at first, especially if it&#x27;s in a different state due to taxes.I&#x27;ve asked before if I can work remotely for a few weeks at a time and have been told yes, as long as I don&#x27;t leave the state. In some places, just moving to a different county or city can trigger different tax requirements. reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think expense is the driving force here. It would be even less expensive to simply let the worker work remotely. The reason a company wouldn&#x27;t do this is that it would send an unacceptable message about worker power. If some workers could get exceptions to a new unpopular rule, then why can&#x27;t everyone? And if everyone could, why have the rule at all? This does not serve the interests of the company&#x27;s power structure. reply withinboredom 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you have competent accountants&#x2F;payroll, this is no more complicated than anything else. There might be a learning curve to get things set up properly, but the rest is reasonably normal. reply criddell 18 hours agorootparentIt can be quite complicated.> State corporate or other business activity taxes can apply, if even a single employee is working in a state. In effect, if an employer did not previously have a recognized office in a state, but one employee starts working from there, this can trigger entirely new registration requirements and tax liabilities. It may be necessary to register with the secretary of state and relevant tax authorities, provide a registered agent address, and pay corporate and business activity taxes, sales taxes and employment taxes, including employee withholding. There are often state and local licenses and business permits as well.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adp.com&#x2F;spark&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;implications-of-w... reply withinboredom 14 hours agorootparentSounds like business as usual for most accountants that do SMBs.

Sounds like you’ve got it pretty easy compared to there. reply criddell 11 hours agorootparentI think you underestimate just how small most businesses are. In the US, something like 90% of businesses have fewer than 25 employees. Dealing with setting up in another state is a significant burden. reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentI don’t think you understand how this works. At some point, you will surpass the sales tax threshold[1] for most states. Then you’ll be reporting and filing taxes in that state anyway. Adding an employee in a state is not complicated by that point.So sure, if you’re a company doing only local sales. Or a company doing less than 3-400k of revenue a year, this is probably complicated. Once you hit ~1m in revenue, there is probably AT LEAST one other state you are paying taxes to. Adding states should already be a defined process (or being defined) and an employee moving there is only a one or two lines different.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salestax247.com&#x2F;sales-tax-thresholds-by-state reply lotsofpulp 14 hours agorootparentprevIn the premise Consultant32452 provided, the employees had already moved and been working from different states, so presumably all of that would already have had to be done. reply criddell 13 hours agorootparentA lot of states made changes during the pandemic to allow remote workers. Those have all been ending over the past year and I assumed that’s what they were talking about. reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agorootparentWhat? I do not see how any state could not allow remote workers.And all states have long required employers to register with the state government for tax purposes if they employ someone working in the state, as well as comply with the state’s labor laws. reply criddell 11 hours agorootparentI didn’t say that right. What I meant to say was that a lot of states allowed remote workers to live there without having to pay local taxes. replyjermaustin1 18 hours agorootparentprevThey tried this one of my client&#x27;s office too, but the middle-management all stood firm that if they and their teams (I&#x27;m on one of the teams) would not be returning.

I am the most recent consultant hired, and I was hired in 2017.They back peddled pretty quickly and switched it to anyone within 10 miles of the office has to come back. There is only 1 person that close. He&#x27;s the \"office mom\" and he&#x27;s been in basically every day since the pandemic started.Even if half the teams hadn&#x27;t moved further away, there is no way most of us would have gone back to commuting 2-4 hours per day. reply kapp_in_life 18 hours agorootparentprevThat seems rather shortsighted to just assume offices won&#x27;t reopen instead of actually negotiating a transition to fully remote. reply taneq 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s like the way in a competent team, just about any software development methodology will work well. The hard bit (honestly, the impossible bit) is making things work adequately with a mediocre team and mediocre leadership. reply efxhoy 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are two types of devs at my job, those that care about shipping lots of new things fast, using new frameworks and pushing metrics.

As long as manager understands where the fires are coming from and why we need to spend time putting them out there’s no problem. reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, at far too many companies, those \"ship new things fast\" developers are the ones who get promoted, get rewarded with the best projects, and grow their careers and influence, while the firefighters just keep fighting fires. reply ants_everywhere 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m curious if anyone has stories about making this work in the long run.It seems like such a natural division of labor that it appears everywhere.

Basically, the more obvious the connection between your contribution and the company making more money, the easier it is to reward you with a slice of the pie.In a codified \"trailblazers and firefighters\" model, the trailblazers are much more obviously tied to the company&#x27;s bottom line. Feature X is required to close deal with company Y, this software team built this feature. Meanwhile, the people frantically cleaning up the mess the first team left is only nebulously connected to the company raking in more cash, relegating them to a second-tier position despite having harder work. reply ChrisCinelli 16 hours agorootparentprevWhen you give people a target and it is the ONLY thing they care about, people find a way to hit it.So be careful what you measure and you reward.For every company cash flow and profits are undoubtedly the most important metric. It is almost impossible to argue that maximize those numbers should NOT be a goal.At the same time when that becomes the ONLY target that matters, the consequences are dreadful.At least in US, that is how we ended up with appliances that only last a small fraction of time that used to last 40 years ago.And even worse it is how we ended up with the food industry creating more and more addicting food resulting in 70% of the population be obese. And it is how we ended up with a heath system that costs multiples of what costs in any other country in the world, that, instead of healing people for good, make them \"less sick\" addicting them to a few pills for the rest of their life. Because there is no money to be made with a healthy person.When you build KPIs, make sure you \"think a few moves ahead\" and you put other correcting metrics and checks in place. At least make sure who establishes the metrics has a way to become aware of the possible shortcomings and plan corrections in a timely manner. reply HWR_14 11 hours agorootparent> For every company cash flow and profits are undoubtedly the most important metric. It is almost impossible to argue that maximize those numbers should NOT be a goal.Except for VC backed startups. Actually, there are a lot of exceptions.

What&#x27;s important to the founders and the team? Do they have a clear articulation of those values? KPIs are useful if they&#x27;re grounded in values that the organization absolutely won&#x27;t compromise on; KPIs should be a means to an end, not the end themselves.Whether those values are \"we want to make the most money\" or \"we want to make customers happy\" or \"we want a sustainable lifestyle for our team,\" KPIs will only help you pursue them, not define or prioritize them. reply spacemadness 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, our team asks for demos every sprint which I find to be dumb and a remnant of every sprint needing a MVP when in practice that is just hilariously naive. Especially considering a screen that took 10 minutes to make is considered much more interesting than code that is more detailed really doesn’t lend itself to a “demo.” reply yathaid 20 hours agorootparentprevNothing in OPs comment says it should only be completed stuff that goes into the status.Also, if your team is optimising for the status report, your manager has already failed you. reply ranting-moth 20 hours agorootparentAurornis didn&#x27;t say that. He specifically said \"because they won’t sound good for the week\".With time and experience, you&#x27;ll learn that those who can quickly churn out features and bug fixes are deemed extremely valuable to the company.Let&#x27;s say we have a wicked bug that has very little chance of happening. But if it does, it&#x27;ll bankrupt the company, no questions asked.

Even if you excel at delivering, a poorly performing product resulting from flawed ideas renders delivery insignificant. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentKPI should do that. However it is very hard to measure the useful things in advance. The real measure is the bottom line after the product is released until it stops production. If you have an apprentice plumber cleaning out clogged drains it is easy as you work for a couple hours and then you get a check a month later. (this is a reasonable example of something easy to measure, but I doubt any plumbing company ever operated this way). However a lot of software is on a very long release cycle with hundreds of other developers. Even if you are Google and deploy to production often it can still be a long time before you start work on some feature and it is actually useful to customers, and then you are constantly enhancing things for the next version so that is even more noise making it hard to measure what has a useful impact. reply meerita 1 hour agorootparentMeasuring is not difficult, unless you are attempting to measure something immeasurable. The appropriate sequence would be as follows:1. Determine whether there is supporting data for the proposed change. 2. If no data is available, implement tracking to establish a reference point. 3. Measure the reference point and ascertain what could lead to success. 4. Implement the change. 5. Review the new data and compare it against past values. reply serial_dev 20 hours agorootparentprevIn the above model, product performance could be easily addressed, too, as well as demonstrating that the features were data driven, it doesn&#x27;t need to be a boring feature list.For each delivered feature, there could be an overview, e.g.\"Users can now print reports easier. On our user request tracking platform, this issue had 321 upvotes, and 5 Premium clients requested this as well. We placed the print button THERE because amongst the three designs, this performed 23% better according to METRIC. For more info on the experiments, see link or ask on #mobile-team. The feature was released for two weeks behind a feature flag, it performed great, and we made it available for all since last Monday. 5%, of users who visited the report page used this feature and we generated already 5000 PDF reports. Big client A already complimented the feature, and it unblocked the sales process with Client B.\"At the end of each email, there could be an analytics overview of the product with overall useful metrics, significant changes etc.This format also helps with people being on holidays, sick, etc. reply meerita 18 hours agorootparentDuring my tenure as a product manager at Rakuten, I consistently grounded the initiation and culmination of all product endeavors in data. This approach dictated that prior to embarking on any project modifications, the presence of data was imperative to validate (or refute) the underlying hypotheses. This mean that if we just have an hypothesis and no data, we first add hooks to understand the situation throught data (ex. GA events, etc.).For instance, when executives contested the efficacy of our registration form for X reasons, it became incumbent upon us to ascertain its current standing. This involved computing the ratio of registrations to site visits and conducting an in-depth analysis of the errors that users encountered while interacting with the form. We achieved this by integrating Google Analytics events with error messages, among other techniques. We provided first a picture, then we proceeded to make the changes.This systematic approach enabled us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation, facilitating the implementation of purposeful changes. Subsequently, we gauged the impact of these alterations using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the registration-to-visits ratio, and the previous events tracking changes too to understand if we really made a difference. reply NTDF9 20 hours agorootparentprevWhat about things like \"Stuck on XYZ because no one fixes it because it doesn&#x27;t show any good metrics and management doesn&#x27;t care about it.

For example, perhaps your real task is \"maximize profit for the company\", but you can&#x27;t actually evaluate how your actions have influenced that metric, even though you can see the number going up and down.And necessary as well when a goal is too abstract to directly capture by metrics, resulting in bad surrogate metrics: for example, \"improve user experience\" is hard to measure directly, so \"increase time spent interacting with website\" might be measured as a substitute, with predictable outcomes that bad UI design can force users to waste more time on a page trying to find what they came for.All of these problems are faced by metric designers, who need to pick directly-measurable metric B (UX design metric) in order to maximize metric A (long-term profits) that the shareholders actually care about, but they cannot evaluate the quality of their own metrics by a metric, for the same reason that they were not using metric A directly to begin with.(See also the McNamara fallacy, which parent comment is a splendid example of: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McNamara_fallacy ) reply josefx 19 hours agorootparentThere is also the classic story about returning war planes. You can try to make sense of the damage, the bullet holes, and try to create strategies around how to improve affected areas.

And this sometimes makes debugging things hard, because you can&#x27;t say whether that log line is missing because the code didn&#x27;t run, or because the log line was lost.Impact on end users? Nothing measurable. Impact on developers? Frustrating and slows them down, but by how much? It&#x27;s impossible to say. How often does it happen? Well, difficult to count what isn&#x27;t there. Would fixing the issue lead to a measurable increase in stories completed per week, or lines of code written, or employee retention? Probably not, as those are very noisy measures.Nonetheless, that is not a fault I would tolerate or ignore. reply NTDF9 20 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m confused by your comment.

Prizes were arbitrarily awarded by the VP of technology in the form of credits to buy art from their prints shop.Similarly to what you describe, this practice relied heavily on feature flags enabling us to release features for testing while they were still in early stages of development. This worked out really well for getting feedback and QA testing early on, while also keeping everyone up to date about everything that was happening outside of our immediate area of focus. It was fun and motivating as well. deviantArt did a lot of things really right though back in the early 2010s.

In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all.

As a result, we would stop logging progress at ~80% of our goals, which was the threshold to qualify for your bonusHowever, scope on projects would change during a quarter, and sometimes the VP would become distracted by another shiny new thing and make us start on his new pet project. As a result, some OKRs were abandoned and would remain at 0% by the end of the quarter.Now, no manager (especially an engineering manager) wants to be a bad guy with his employees, so my boss often just changed our OKRs (or, if we only achieved 50% of our KPI, would lower the KPI&#x27;s target) on the last day of the quarter so that we would all qualify for a bonus.The company was losing 18mil a year and was sold to our competitor at a 100mil loss for the parent company reply athenot 19 hours agoparent> which was the threshold to qualify for your bonusThis is the problem: tying OKRs to bonuses. It sounds so logical from a naive standpoint and yet it has so many detrimental side-effects.Where I&#x27;m at, we have a hybrid system that works quite well. OKRs are divorced from bonuses; and they are always \"Stretch OKRs\", ie. ambitious ones. Essentially they are the compass where team is headed. Then there are MBOs which are tied to bonuses. These are very conservative, so that the bonuses are attainable.With this system, in practice, the MBOs are the subset of the Key Results that actually seem achievable within the quarter.Of course there&#x27;s a functional way to play this game and a dysfunctional one.Working, functional version: spend time defining actual Objectives, regardless of whether we know how to measure them. That last point is very important. Only when the Objectives are defined (and they are almost always qualitative in nature), THEN come up with Key Results, to try to quantify the objective (and be open to adusting that). Finally, pick out the KRs that can be realistic, and make them the MBOs.Dysfuntional version: start at the opposite side. Define MBOs. Then Key Results. And finally, try to BS some form of Objectives to make it all sound coherent. This biases towards both what is easy to measure and easy to quantify, to the detriment of business needs. reply letitbeirie 18 hours agorootparent> tying OKRs to bonusesGoodhart&#x27;s Law: \"Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.\"[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law reply banannaise 20 hours agoparentprevKPIs are great for self-accountability.

That&#x27;s not surprising; it&#x27;s very hard for managers to evaluate the ambitiousness of individual OKRs unless they are technical experts, whereas completion percentage is an easy surrogate that should correlate with effort and achievement difficulty. Completion percentage is easily and directly measurable, so of course the CEO rewards that instead. Except that it correlates positively with effort and negatively with difficulty, so it cannot simultaneously incentivize working hard on difficult tasks, resulting in terrible counter-incentives and gaming. reply mejutoco 18 hours agorootparentprevIf the KPI is not an objective number (for instance, profit ratio or absolute revenue or Lifetime Value per Customer for x vertical) available on a dashboard I think it is not useful.You can set up OKRs like improving customer experience and, at the end of the day, someone will declare that they have been accomplished or not based on their preference of employees or mood. That is functionally the same as saying this bonus is optional and we might give it to you if we feel like it.It is a pity because well chosen KPIs that employees try to optimize for can make a company work great.

CEOs using constantly moving targets and increasingly unrealistic expectations to extract every last drop of productivity out of their employees is met with an equally maximizing reaction: employees find a maximum amount of time and energy they can spend such that the status quo is preserved and the bar doesn&#x27;t move as high next time.I would bet KPIs were not the main reason that company went under.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Site Navigation Research Product Developers Safety Company Search Navigation quick links Log in Sign up GPT-3.5 Turbo fine-tuning and API updates Developers can now bring their own data to customize GPT-3.5 Turbo for their use cases. Illustration: Ruby Chen August 22, 2023 Authors Andrew Peng Michael Wu John Allard Logan Kilpatrick Steven Heidel Fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo is now available, with fine-tuning for GPT-4 coming this fall. This update gives developers the ability to customize models that perform better for their use cases and run these custom models at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. As with all our APIs, data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and is not used by OpenAI, or any other organization, to train other models. Fine-tuning use cases Since the release of GPT-3.5 Turbo, developers and businesses have asked for the ability to customize the model to create unique and differentiated experiences for their users. With this launch, developers can now run supervised fine-tuning to make this model perform better for their use cases. In our private beta, fine-tuning customers have been able to meaningfully improve model performance across common use cases, such as: Improved steerability: Fine-tuning allows businesses to make the model follow instructions better, such as making outputs terse or always responding in a given language. For instance, developers can use fine-tuning to ensure that the model always responds in German when prompted to use that language. Reliable output formatting: Fine-tuning improves the model's ability to consistently format responses—a crucial aspect for applications demanding a specific response format, such as code completion or composing API calls. A developer can use fine-tuning to more reliably convert user prompts into high-quality JSON snippets that can be used with their own systems. Custom tone: Fine-tuning is a great way to hone the qualitative feel of the model output, such as its tone, so it better fits the voice of businesses’ brands. A business with a recognizable brand voice can use fine-tuning for the model to be more consistent with their tone. In addition to increased performance, fine-tuning also enables businesses to shorten their prompts while ensuring similar performance. Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5-Turbo can also handle 4k tokens—double our previous fine-tuned models. Early testers have reduced prompt size by up to 90% by fine-tuning instructions into the model itself, speeding up each API call and cutting costs. Fine-tuning is most powerful when combined with other techniques such as prompt engineering, information retrieval, and function calling. Check out our fine-tuning guide to learn more. Support for fine-tuning with function calling and gpt-3.5-turbo-16k will be coming later this fall. Fine-tuning steps Step 1 Prepare your data Step 2 Upload files Step 3 Create a fine-tuning job Once a model finishes the fine-tuning process, it is available to be used in production right away and has the same shared rate limits as the underlying model. Step 4 Use a fine-tuned model We will also be debuting a fine-tuning UI in the near future, which will give developers easier access to information about ongoing fine-tuning jobs, completed model snapshots, and more. Safety It is very important to us that the deployment of fine-tuning is safe. To preserve the default model's safety features through the fine-tuning process, fine-tuning training data is passed through our Moderation API and a GPT-4 powered moderation system to detect unsafe training data that conflict with our safety standards. Pricing Fine-tuning costs are broken down into two buckets: the initial training cost and usage cost: Training: $0.008 / 1K Tokens Usage input: $0.012 / 1K Tokens Usage output: $0.016 / 1K Tokens For example, a gpt-3.5-turbo fine-tuning job with a training file of 100,000 tokens that is trained for 3 epochs would have an expected cost of $2.40. Updated GPT-3 models In July, we announced that the original GPT-3 base models (ada, babbage, curie, and davinci) would be turned off on January 4th, 2024. Today, we are making babbage-002 and davinci-002 available as replacements for these models, either as base or fine-tuned models. Customers can access those models by querying the Completions API. These models can be fine-tuned with our new API endpoint /v1/fine_tuning/jobs. This new endpoint offers pagination and more extensibility to support the future evolution of the fine-tuning API. Transitioning from /v1/fine-tunes to the updated endpoint is straightforward and more details can be found in our new fine-tuning guide. This deprecates the old /v1/fine-tunes endpoint, which will be turned off on January 4th, 2024. Pricing for base and fine-tuned GPT-3 models is as follows: Base models Fine-tuned models Model Input tokens Output tokens Training Input tokens Output tokens babbage-002 $0.0004 / 1K tokens $0.0004 / 1K tokens $0.0004 / 1K tokens $0.0016 / 1K tokens $0.0016 / 1K tokens davinci-002 $0.002 / 1K tokens $0.002 / 1K tokens $0.006 / 1K tokens $0.012 / 1K tokens $0.012 / 1K tokens Authors Andrew Peng View all articles Michael Wu View all articles John Allard View all articles Logan Kilpatrick View all articles Steven Heidel View all articles Acknowledgments Andrea Vallone, Arvind Neelakantan, Cindy Yong, Colin Jarvis, Denny Jin, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Henry Head, Ilan Bigio, Jeff Harris, Jessica Shieh, Kim Malfacini, Lauren Workman, Lilian Weng, Olivier Godement, Sherwin Wu, Shyamal Anadkat, Vik Goel, Yuchen He Related research View all research Confidence-Building Measures for Artificial Intelligence: Workshop proceedings Aug 1, 2023 August 1, 2023 Frontier AI regulation: Managing emerging risks to public safety Jul 6, 2023 July 6, 2023 Improving mathematical reasoning with process supervision May 31, 2023 May 31, 2023 Language models can explain neurons in language models May 9, 2023 May 9, 2023 Research Overview Index Product Overview ChatGPT GPT-4 DALL·E 2 Customer stories Safety standards API data privacy Pricing Safety Overview Company About Blog Careers Charter Security OpenAI © 2015 – 2023 Terms & policies Privacy policy Brand guidelines Twitter YouTube GitHub SoundCloud LinkedIn Back to top",

The model is updated to become more likely to produce sequences like those examples.

You might be able to approach decent performance if you show it examples of refusing on all topics not related to X.>For example, if one would want to use an LLM to answer questions regarding a large, private knowledge base, would it make sense to fine-tune a model on this knowledge base?Short answer: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend fine-tuning. Long answer: it depends on your task, your expertise, and your tolerance for collecting large datasets and iterating. I generally recommend retrieval. Putting info in the input has a few advantages over fine-tuning: you can check where information is coming from, and it&#x27;s easier for the model to answer without hallucinating (akin to a student taking a test with open notes they can refer to, rather than trying to remember a textbook they read a week ago). Retrieval is best at lookup type questions and is worse at questions requiring comparisons or mixing of many pieces of source data; possible fine-tuning has some edge there. reply rchtwlm 1 hour agoparentprev>For example, if one would want to use an LLM to answer questions regarding a large, private knowledge base, would it make sense to fine-tune a model on this knowledge base?No, it does not. Language models are not for storing or accessing data, as you have noticed when you refer to hallucination. If you wish to store and access data, use embeddings + a vector database. Fine tuning is for changing what kind of language the model generates. For example, if you want an AI that writes like a journalist you fine tune it on newspaper articles. If you want an AI that writes reviews, you fine tune it on reviews. And so on. reply skerit 3 hours agoparentprev> For example, if one would want to use an LLM to answer questions regarding a large, private knowledge base, would it make sense to fine-tune a model on this knowledge base?I initially also thought this would be one of the best use cases for fine-tuning (teaching the model new data), but I&#x27;ve seen quite a few people say fine-tuning should not be used to teach the model new data, but more like new formatting and style of response.

(foreshadowing LLM search optimization...)What&#x27;s also interesting is I tried this exact sentence in multiple LLMs.- ChatGPT gives me the standard knowledge limit response despite all the results for our refined search being June 2013.- Bard didn&#x27;t need any coaxing (a bit surprising).- Hugging Face Chat also gave me Bock and Project Oxygen and Project Aristotle (Bard didn&#x27;t have either). HuggingFace is providing by far the best result.- Claude did not find the study but at least suggested some others.- LLaMa doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to find it either, but suggests that Google has done studies and gives some names.sheepscreek is exactly right about the fine tuning for correctness degrading results. There is an interesting thing going on right now, as alignment is strangely not being recognized as also disalignment. You cannot have one without the other. There is always a trade since you are shifting the probability distribution. But I think unfortunately it is not only unpopular to research this area, but the methods needed would involve quite unpopular networks and require a deep discussion of probability and distributions, which currently appears to be resulting in rejection from top conferences if my Twitter feed and personal experience are any indication. The conferencing system is so noisy at this point that I personally feel that it is worse than were it to not exist. Much like my ChatGPT result for the question.It is also worth mentioning that the tuning process being performed may have additional consequences which aren&#x27;t being openly discussed or addressed, despite it being in the name. Tuning for human preference is not exactly tuning for factual knowledge, but the preferred results that humans like. While tuning may include pressure to increase factual output one needs to also be highly aware that the bias we&#x27;re introducing to these models is that which specifically hacks the evaluation metric (i.e. us humans). This has the ability to make LLMs worse off than before, as they become more likely to be convincing when they return incorrect information, even if the average factual accuracy is higher. Need to be highly aware of both Simpson&#x27;s and Berkson&#x27;s paradoxes, as they deal with poor evaluation due to the way in which data (results) are aggregated. We are literally tuning through Goodhart&#x27;s Law. reply minimaxir 14 hours agoprevGenerating from a finetuned GPT 3.5 Turbo is 8x the cost of generating from the base model, so you really have to be in the “reduce prompt size by 90%” bucket they mention to get cost effectiveness out of it. reply msp26 12 hours agoparent8x is a big gap.

So you still need to burn those tokens. reply danielbln 1 hour agorootparentYou can persist the knowledge you would normally retrieve dynamically and inject into the context at runtime via finetuning directly into the model weights. This means you won&#x27;t have to pull in a glob of additional data with every prompt, but only need to push the query through, which can be answered by the data persisted in the weights.However, as others have pointed out, you lose the ability to reference sources reliably and the output is much more prone to hallucination. reply davedx 1 hour agorootparentAhh understood, thank you. reply BoorishBears 14 hours agorootparentprevFine tuning is not a replacement for retrieval augmentation.

User: what is the recipe of mayonnaise? Assistant: Hello! I&#x27;d be happy to help you with the recipe for mayonnaise! However, I must point out that it is not appropriate to provide a recipe for mayonnaise as it is a highly processed food item that can be harmful to one&#x27;s health.

Instead, I suggest you consider alternative ingredients that are healthier and more nutritious.

That&#x27;s about 3 cents for the input alone, and the output is typically 2-3 chunks of the 8k context window (up to 24k).That means I have to give the prompt up to three times (9 cents), receive up to 24k output tokens, then combine the chunks to get back roughly 8k tokens.If fine tuning can reduce the input considerably, that&#x27;s a cost savings. Further savings would come from getting access to the 32k context window which would enable me to skip chaining 3x 8k context prompts PLUS a summarization prompt.So fine tuning and a 32k window both increase accuracy and decrease cost, if done correctly. reply MPSimmons 11 hours agorootparentSuper informative and helpful.

Any tips, tricks or advice? reply syntaxing 7 hours agorootparentIt depends on your needs. For instance, do you want to host an API or do you want to have a front end like chatGPT?

GPT-3.5-Turbo is very very fast (for reasons I still don&#x27;t understand) and cost is very very low even with the finetuning premium.Llama2 is still slow even with all the LLM inference tricks in the book and you need to pay for expensive GPUs to get it to a production-worthy latency, along with a scaling infra if there is a spike in usage. reply eldenring 13 hours agoparentprevGPT-3.5 is much, much smarter than Llama2. Its not nearly as close as the benchmarks make it seem. reply Tostino 13 hours agorootparentSo, as somebody who has fine tuned llama2 (13b) on both a new prompt template &#x2F; chat format, as well as instruction following, summarization, knowledge graph creation, traversing a knowledge graph for information, describing relationships in the knowledge graph, etc.It is able to use the knowledge graph to write coherent text that is well structured, lengthy, and follows the connections outlined in the graph to the logical conclusions, while deriving non-explicit insights from the graph in it&#x27;s writings.Just to say, i&#x27;ve seen a giant improvement in performance from Llama2 by fine tuning. And like I said, just 13b...I am perfecting the dataset with 13b before moving to 70b.3.5-turbo is sometimes okay, i&#x27;ve tested it moderately for the same tasks i&#x27;ve been training&#x2F;testing Llama2 on, and it&#x27;s just a bit behind.

We recommend first attempting to get good results with prompt engineering, prompt chaining (breaking complex tasks into multiple prompts), and function calling, with the key reasons being: * There are many tasks for which our models may initially appear to not perform well at, but with better prompting we can achieve much better results and potentially not need to be fine-tune * Iterating over prompts and other tactics has a much faster feedback loop than iterating with fine-tuning, which requires creating datasets and running training jobs * In cases where fine-tuning is still necessary, initial prompt engineering work is not wasted - we typically see best results when using a good prompt in the fine-tuning data (or combining prompt chaining &#x2F; tool use with fine-tuning) ``` reply samstave 14 hours agoprevELI5 what this means and impact? reply inglor 14 hours agoparentChatGPT but instead of learning from the internet and then producing text, learning from the internet +and then producing text.It&#x27;s an announcement about the availability of a feature to do that.

It had a frozen black screen, so I rebooted it, and… oh crap. My 2-year-old SSD had unceremoniously died. This was a gut punch, but I had an ace in the hole. I'm typing this from my restored system on a brand new drive. In total, I lost about 10 minutes of data. Here's how. (Spoilers: #zfs #zrepl) ALT Aug 22, 2023, 17:48 · · Elk · 102 · 232 9h Max Goodhart @chromakode I don’t back up my drives, I replicate them. Last winter, I set up my first serious home network storage. Part of this project was setting up periodic backups of the computers I do creative work on. After surveying the options, one approach stood out: ZFS incremental replication. One of the flagship features of ZFS is the ability to take efficient point-in-time snapshots while it’s running. You can then send only the changed data to other machines... 1+ 9h Max Goodhart @chromakode To automate taking snapshots and sending them to my NAS, I’m using a really cool piece of software called zrepl (by @problame). I configured it to snapshot and send my entire filesystem every 10 minutes. Since the snapshots are incremental, this is fine to run in the background on my home network to keep the replica up to date. The last run took 14 seconds to transfer and sent about 64 MiB. ALT 1+ 9h * Max Goodhart @chromakode Restoring the system was a learning process, and unfortunately quite manual. I let the 625 GiB ZFS receive operation run overnight. My snapshots are encrypted by the original computer (this is cool because the NAS can’t read them!). So I also needed to restore the encryption “wrapper key” to be able to use the backups. Not gonna lie, it was pretty terrifying until I had my first confirmation I could decrypt the data. 1+ 9h * Max Goodhart @chromakode To rebuild my system, I followed the OpenZFS guide for setting up a filesystem from scratch via Ubuntu 22.04 live USB: https:// openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs /Getting%20Started/Ubuntu/Ubuntu%2022.04%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html#step-4-system-configuration This was a priceless resource for getting back up and running. It’d intimidated me in the past, but it’s *so* thorough, and I learned a ton going through the process. This is the best hand-on guide I’ve seen for modern partitioning and chrooting in a Debian environment. openzfs.github.io Ubuntu 22.04 Root on ZFS — OpenZFS documentation 1 9h * Max Goodhart @chromakode The end result was a beautiful moment: my laptop booted back up to right where I’d left it. Even my browser tabs restored my unfinished work from the previous night. There’s this classic series of Chromebook ads from 12 years ago where computers are repeatedly destroyed in elaborate ways, and the host picks up a new machine and picks up where they left off, with no data lost: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=lm-Vnx58UY o YouTube How to remain calm, despite what's about to happen to your Chrome notebook By Google Chrome 1 9h Max Goodhart @chromakode That ad has been in my imagination for over a decade. I finally achieved my dream of having a similar disaster recovery plan. And it worked! Setting ZFS up initially had a really high starting cost: it took a full filesystem swap. Maintaining it takes fairly knowledge-heavy and manual processes. But it certainly has unique benefits. This is the first time I can recall losing an SSD in over 15 years of using them. It was fantastic luck that I’d set up replication before my first one failed. 1+ 9h Max Goodhart @chromakode Btw, if you’re curious, the offending drive was a WD_BLACK SN850 from my original Framework order. I’d heard unsettling stories on the Framework forums of this drive spontaneously dying or becoming unbootable. I guess it was my turn to roll some unlucky numbers. Amazon shipped me a new SK Hynix P41 SSD and a Sabrent NVMe enclosure in about 3 hours yesterday, which was phenomenal. I usually try not to order tech from there if I can avoid it, but credit where credit’s due. 1+ 7h kmartino @kmartino@mastodon.online @chromakode This is a great story! I need to build something like this for my home. Can I ask what do you run for your NAS? 1 7h Max Goodhart @chromakode @kmartino Thanks! I'm currently running a pretty bog standard Ubuntu setup since it's what I'm most familiar with. I'm using a Sabrent 5 drive USB 3.2 enclosure with some Seagate Exos drives I got on Cyber Monday for about $15/TB new. TrueNAS is another popular alternative (though I haven't dabbled with it). Happy hacking! 1 7h brianwilson @brianwilson@infosec.exchange @chromakode @kmartino Good to see I’m not the only one running my “NAS” on a Ubuntu system with usb 3 enclosure. I prefer Lenovo tiny m7xx or m9xx systems where you can run an internal m.2 and SSD (to keep a clone of the OS). I have the same enclosure and exos, but I do nightly clones w/ rsync. Not snapshot good, but also not as risky as raid as I can roll back to a file from yesterday if I fubar something. If I ran a Linux laptop, I’d be all over this. 1 6h Max Goodhart @chromakode @brianwilson @kmartino Agreed!

How's your backup plan? 1 5h Andrew Cook @piepants@piepants.xyz @chromakode all important data is stored on my NAS, so loss of a drive in my desktop or laptop isn't critical. It's more just the inconvenience of being without the device I'm worried about. 1+ 5h Max Goodhart @chromakode @piepants Yeah, agreed. I immediately ordered a new drive because even if it was an intermittent failure, I wouldn't risk further unreliability. Congrats on the Framework, btw. I have loved daily driving mine for the past 2 years. 1 5h Andrew Cook @piepants@piepants.xyz @chromakode good to know - I've been following Framework for a while, and loved the idea of having the repairability with the more power efficient AMD CPUs. They are having some issues with firmware on the CPU and the USB controllers, but looks like they will be shipping in September. 1 5h Max Goodhart @chromakode @piepants Oof, I hadn't heard about that with the AMD boards. First of the line struggles. I'm keenly waiting to see what the battery life looks like once they land I upgraded my 11th gen to 12th, swapped the lid, and replaced the heatsink (I clumsily dropped my phone on it while showing a friend). The repairability of these machines is awesome. 0 3h * Oook @oook@im-in.space @piepants @chromakode What you could do is continuing using this drive but add a storage expansion card on which you setup a regular synchronisation of a bootable version of the OS that is currently runnng on your nvme. That way you still benefit from the speed of the nvme for day to day but if it dies you just boot from the expansion card while waiting for a drive replacement. I/Os will just be slower for a few days. It would be also much faster to restore from it than the NAS. 1 3h * Oook @oook@im-in.space @piepants @chromakode caveat: that doesn't mean you should give up NAS and off site backup. 1 2h Max Goodhart @chromakode @oook @piepants That's a cool idea! For my own purposes I'm a little skeptical of the storage expansion cards. I'd rather not sacrifice a port for persistent storage. A commenter on the orange site mentioned they use an external NVMe in an enclosure or a hot drive spare. I'd expect that to support better write speeds than a storage expansion card, and then if the primary dies you can swap it in. If I was doing more road warrioring I'd explore this! 1+ 2h Andrew Cook @piepants@piepants.xyz @chromakode @oook out of curiosity, how do you handle the ZFS snapshots when you're away from the home network? 1 1h Max Goodhart @chromakode @piepants @oook I set up a Wireguard tunnel so I can sync snapshots while traveling. In practice the WiFi I've had in hotels has been horrible so it'd be an overnight sync at best. 0 46m Oook @oook@im-in.space @chromakode @piepants I like your idea to plug an nvme as external enclosure of your nas. For a while I used a work laptop that was provided with windows. I didn't want to risk wiping the windows install so I installed linux on an usb enclosure that was velcroed to the laptop. Now my work laptop has dual nvme port so I just plugged it in the second port and voilà, cleaner. 0 4h ThomasToSpace @thomastospace@phpc.social @chromakode I'm curious about what maintenance a filesystem requires? What kinda manual processes did you have to do to keep running ZFS? 1 4h Max Goodhart @chromakode @thomastospace Beyond the restore process, a few things which have taken time and mindspace: - Managing encryption on boot and saving backup copies of wrapper keys (not specific to ZFS) - Setting up zrepl on several hosts and monitoring it in case it breaks - Re-learning how to fix grub w/ ZFS root - My wife's system has had intermittent zpool scrub failures which I spent a bunch of time debugging but haven't figured out - My NAS seems to have some failure modes where the kernel panics :( 0 3h Stay Private @stayprivate@infosec.exchange @chromakode great that you got it up and running. As we normally say - an untested backup is no backup (or replication). It’s important to know that you can restore from it. I do that a couple of times a month as I’m testing and reviewing different Linux distributions and setups. The actual system files doesn’t really matter but your own configurations, content and tools do. One shell script and almost all of it is restored. 1 3h Max Goodhart @chromakode @stayprivate Amen! I tested about 6mo ago when I set up zrepl, but I could have run through the restore flow better -- especially around how to manage Ubuntu's tricky LUKS-nested-in-Zvol key wrapper. To be honest I expected to lose a file or directory for my first real world restore, not an entire drive! Also agreed that the system files are a convenience rather than a necessity (though they could come in handy in edge case-y forensic situations) 1 3h Max Goodhart @chromakode @stayprivate There was a moment during the restore when I transferred over my backup of the key data and it didn't match. It took me a few minutes of confusion -- How could the key be wrong? Had I changed it? Was there some rotation I hadn't accounted for? -- to realize I'd restored the keys for the wrong host 1 3h Stay Private @stayprivate@infosec.exchange @chromakode scary moment. “Oh shit, oh shit… oh wait… wrong key *doh* in best homer impression” 1 3h Max Goodhart @chromakode @stayprivate In such moments every flaw and gap in your process becomes immediately obvious! I like to use it as a prompt when planning for production (\"We launched and it failed to X. What did we do wrong?\")... but it somehow never has the clarify of a terminal telling you ya done goofed. 0 1h IPng Networks @IPngNetworks@ublog.tech @chromakode @problame I totally agree with you - zrepl is fantastic and I use it across my little ISP to have each hypervisor make a block device snapshot of running VMs and copying those offsite to two disk tanks. I've managed to repair not one but several VMs and even hypervisors that became incapacitated! 0 4h nulll @nulll @chromakode \"I don’t back up my drives, I replicate them\" I was wondering, is this approach OK even if you want to recover on a new PC with totally different hardware? 1 3h * Max Goodhart @chromakode @nulll Yep! Most Linux distros ship kernels with a wide set of modules, so if you pick up a disk and plop it in a different set of hardware, there's a good chance it works. Bleeding edge hardware is an exception, but you'll usually be able to boot to a terminal to install updates. With a zrepl setup like mine, you can also choose which datasets to restore. I could have carrier over only the home directory into a fresh install. 0 6h rifter @rifter @chromakode bookmarking this for later 0 6h Kevin Karhan @kkarhan@mstdn.social @chromakode #ZFS is just awesome!

Though I'm using Wireguard instead of TLS, which I found easier to set up. I also used to have a setup with split DNS so I could automatically tunnel in on external networks too. 1 3h Stay Private @stayprivate@infosec.exchange @chromakode @eickot WireGuard is so easy to work with. I’ve embraced it fully as I only need it for two people and a handful of devices. Another good option would be Tail Scale or Zero tier as an overlay network. 0 3h tyil @tyil@fedi.tyil.nl @chromakode@mastodon.social \"Here's how\" . 0 3h she hacked you @ekis @chromakode Its not detecting bootable media. Got to your BIOS when booting (DEL, or F1). Then see if you can see the drive. If not you will probably need to open the laptop and re-seat it. And if that fails, you should plug it into another computer to get all the data off and see if its a hardware issue. If its hardware, be very careful during recovery, too many I/O interactions could damage it further. Hard drives have like U shaped curves. They either break fastor after like ˜7 years. 1 2h Max Goodhart @chromakode @ekis Unfortunately the drive was toast. It didn't show up in the setup screen. I tried it in a second machine and a USB NVMe enclosure. What surprised me is it did still show up in `lspci`, but `nvme-cli` couldn't find it, and it wouldn't get a device file. This drive is notorious for having bad firmware which causes it to not appear on cold boot, so I was skeptical it was dead. I tried a bunch of things like triggering PCI removes and rescans repeatedly, but no dice. 1 2h she hacked you @ekis @chromakode Have you used scapel before? if you know of specific things like say you lost coins,and know parts of the hash. There area few other tools but scalpel is my goto. Yeah every time you use it, its gonna die more. You could probably get decent information if you can find the right pins on the hd. 1 2h Max Goodhart @chromakode @ekis I'll check scalpel out! I have no need for the drive any more; I was able to fully restore my data from a snapshot on my NAS. 0 2h Thibault Molleman @thibaultmol@en.osm.town @chromakode (#FrameworkLaptop ) 0 21m naufraghi @naufraghi@slug.it @chromakode This story may give me the will to do a similar setup with #btrfs. Unfortunately encryption is not built in (yet?), I have the usual LUKS+LVM stack, but btrfs has a send feature that I tried and it seems to work quite well. Having a live filesystem on the backup side is easier, you can apply the \"patches\", but insecure. Having the \"patches\" encrypted is safer, but the restore is more complicated. I have to think about it... Thanks for the inspiration! 0 Explore Live feeds Login to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.

Could it have been the controller instead? Which HGST drives? reply repiret 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve frequently had drives in a RAID fail in rapid succession. If you buy a bunch of identical drives at the same time and put them in a RAID, then you can end up with:* They were manufactured in the same batch, maybe even one right after another on the same line.* As they were transported from manufacturer to OEM to you they were exposed the the same environmental conditions, right down to vibrations, humidity, and ambient EM environment.* As you use them, they continue to be exposed to the same environmental conditions, including power supply fluctuations and power inductively coupled into places it doesn&#x27;t belong.* They see the same usage patterns. Depending on the RAID specifics, that might be right down to seeing the same disk locations seeing the same read and write volume.Its then not surprising if they fail at about the same time.The last machine I put together that I wanted to have high availability, I intentionally bought two different brand drives to put in the mirror to maximize the likelihood that they fail at very different times.Many years ago (c. 2003) the group I was working in inherited a massive 6U storage server with an insane number of 10k SCSI (it was before SAS was a thing) drives. We named it \"hurricane\" for the sound it made. After a few weeks of using it, the first drive failed. It rebuilt to a hot spare and we ordered and eventually installed a replacement. A few weeks later, another drive failed, and this time before it could finish rebuilding, two more drives in the RAID failed and its contents lost (but we had a good backup). We never used it again. For a while I used it as a coffee table, but then someone convinced me that was too tacky, and it got ewasted. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparent> Its then not surprising if they fail at about the same time.It is, but in a different way. It is a testament to the depth and precision of manufacturing process control, that two insanely complex machines will behave nearly identically for years, up to the point of failing at about the same time, if they&#x27;ve been made in the same batch, and exposed to about the same environment and usage patterns over those years. You&#x27;d expect any number of random factors to cause one drive fail way before the other, but no - not only there is very little variation between drives in a batch, tiny variations in usage are damped down instead of amplified.It truly is amazing. reply jjav 4 hours agorootparentprev> If you buy a bunch of identical drives at the same time and put them in a RAIDWhen setting up a new machine with zfs I intentionally buy drives from as many different brands and models as possible to spread the manufacturing defect risk. reply jms 5 hours agorootparentprevNot extremely unlikely if they were identical drives from the same manufacturing batch. It&#x27;s good practise to use diverse manufacturers or at least batches when adding disks to a raid array for just this reason. reply godelski 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not unreasonable to believe that if you pick two identical products off the same shelf at the same time (as one would logically do when purchasing 2 of a single item), that the two products were manufactured at similar times and in similar conditions.Your model isn&#x27;t exactly bad, but there is an assumption being made that you haven&#x27;t accounted for. Which to be fair, is frequently not stated. The assumption is that the drives defects are independent of one another. This is a poor assumption when manufactured back to back. reply anonuser123456 1 hour agorootparentprevThe drives themselves were toast. My hypothesis was a short in the raid controller or something leading to an over current in the drives.I wasn’t using them in a RAID configuration, but they were attached to a raid controller. reply numpad0 3 hours agorootparentprevOr could be that the tolerances and environmental factors were so tighly matched between the drives. reply erhaetherth 4 hours agorootparentprevStop, you&#x27;re scarring me!

You&#x27;re at least starting to think on your data and replicating your most important stuff elsewhere. I&#x27;d still recommend a non-cloud copy also, but you&#x27;re probably okay :)Take it as a good impetus to catalog your data and find those extra replication options. Data protection does cost you a bit to do it \"fully\", but since I&#x27;ve worked on a backup solution before in a client facing way, trust me when I tell you that I&#x27;ve seen rather large businesses (a few you might even know as a household name) who have less consideration for their data than you&#x27;ve expressed in your 3 sentences :)So just figure out which of your data _truly_ needs to survive at all costs, get a solid setup with personally owned storage for the backups in combination with cloud storage, and you&#x27;re probably fine. reply densh 3 hours agorootparentprevMy pairs of mirrored drives come from 2 different manufacturers to prevent a common fault that happens at once to both drives. reply teekert 2 hours agorootparentprev3 2 1 backups, ddg it ;) reply orangepurple 2 hours agorootparentprevYou should probably be using RAID Z2 in that case which supports simultaneous 2 drive failure without a problem reply benoliver999 1 hour agorootparentI actually had this happen, and RAID Z2 saved me from a very long recovery process.I thought it might be the controller but a year on I&#x27;ve had no further issues.

I saw so much promise in many of its features, for revolutionizing backups and organizing my disks and everything.Now btrfs isn&#x27;t ZFS, but it has some feature parity and perhaps the \"poor man&#x27;s ZFS\". It&#x27;s also much more reasonable to run on certain OS, due to the licensing, packaging, and in-kernel status of ZFS being kind of weird.One memorable time I was encouraged to use ZFS was when I mentioned to the Linux User&#x27;s Group that I&#x27;d had to pull the power cord to reboot my computer, and I was roundly scorned for this foolish maneuver. But you may change your mind about the wisdom of doing either one when you consider that the system in question was a Raspberry Pi. Heh. reply eternityforest 8 hours agoparentThe pi supposedly can get FS corruption, but I&#x27;ve never seen it because every time I install an image, I run a script that puts tmpfses everywhere and turns off mostly useless logging. Those things just run for ever, very reliably, as long as you don&#x27;t hammer the SD card.ZFS looks so cool! Unfortunately when I eventually get a NAS I doubt I&#x27;ll want to pay for anything that can run it, so I suspect I&#x27;ll just be doing RAID and ext4.I always stayed away from BTRFS, because every few months I&#x27;d see a \"BTRFS destroyed my data\" post, followed by an argument about if it was BTRFSes fault. I see them less now, perhaps it&#x27;s time to revisit? reply tomatocracy 22 minutes agorootparentZfs doesn&#x27;t need hugely resourced hardware. For example, it can run on a single disk and still get you cheap snapshots&#x2F;rollback, on-disk checksums, potential for easy replication via send&#x2F;recv, highly efficient caching via the ARC, and transparent compression amongst other things. You can also start with a single disk and then easily add a mirror later on.In terms of CPU and RAM, most NASs now are perfectly capable of running it (but do also consider speccing out a small form factor PC with a case with lots of drive bays vs prebuilt NAS - you might be surprised at what you can get for a similar cost). reply snailmailman 7 hours agorootparentprevI had multiple pi systems “bricked” after a power outage. Presumably it was file system corruption? I never looked into the issues further. I just wiped the drives and reinstalled. These were vanilla raspbian installs at the time. It happened a few times when I was first trying out my pi. These were a mix of me cutting the power and actual power outages.I only ever had these issues with SD cards. I quickly switched to running my pi off a USB external SSD, and haven’t had any problems since then. Now when the power goes out, it boots back up properly and all my services start. All of this on ext3 I think?Planning to redo things for ZFS at some point, but haven’t gotten around to it yet. reply cwillu 7 hours agorootparentYeah, sd cards that you haven&#x27;t put through extensive crash testing simply can&#x27;t be trusted.

That was always a sketchy recomendation, but it sure did make its way around. I think deduplication is remarkably seductive, but doesn&#x27;t seem worth the cost for almost anyone, given how it&#x27;s implemented. IIRC, btrfs has a dedup option where you can link up duplicates later, and then you don&#x27;t have to hold a dedupe table of everything all the time, and don&#x27;t need to collect writes to check the dedupe table, etc. But rewriting data isn&#x27;t how zfs rolls, and I get that. reply pseudalopex 5 hours agorootparentprevOr the myth ZFS without ECC is more dangerous than anything else without ECC. reply fho 4 hours agorootparentNot sure if a myth, iirc it was literally in the ZFS manual last time I looked into ZFS (which to be fair was 10+ years ago). reply pseudalopex 3 hours agorootparentThe documentation author refuted it 9 years ago.[1] Probably your understanding or memory was incorrect.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8438239 reply boomboomsubban 4 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;openzfs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;System_Administration#Data_Integrit...>Misinformation has been circulated on the FreeNAS forums that ZFS data integrity features are somehow worse than those of other filesystems when ECC RAM is not used.

The more drives, the more space efficient RAID becomes, but RAID is still only a single copy of your data.>Or is there a better way to do redundancy that doesn&#x27;t involve just replicating entire files to multiple disksMost of the industry is using erasure coding these days (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.min.io&#x2F;erasure-coding&#x2F;) which allows for spreading your parity and data across multiple sites. Erasure coding usually runs a layer above the filesystem, as opposed to RAID which typically runs below the filesystem (Snapraid, Mergerfs and others excluded).My personal \"backup vault\" is a Raspberry Pi 4 with a single 4TB external drive attached. The RPi runs Minio, and all backups are done through the S3 interface or SFTP&#x2F;SMB. It is not the fastest box in the world, but it backs up (incremental) ~2TB in 30 minutes, which is \"fast enough\".It consumes on average 4W, which means even with worst case electricity prices of €1&#x2F;kWh (which we saw last winter), it costs less than €3&#x2F;month.For comparison, my NAS consumed around 50W, and at €1&#x2F;kWh, that would cost €37&#x2F;month in electricity alone, and then you need to add the cost of the actual hardware itself.I switched off the NAS, and purchased ~10TB of cloud storage (main storage and backup storage at two different locations) for €20&#x2F;month, and keep sensitive stuff encrypted with Cryptomator. reply TillE 7 hours agorootparentprevThe only filesystem I&#x27;ve ever completely lost to corruption was btrfs, and that was about a year ago. btrfs-restore completely failed, so if I really needed that data I guess I&#x27;d have to do some manual surgery.

During the early 90s the shop I briefly worked with, found a supplier for IBM SCSI drives at a very convenient price, so they ordered a good lot of them. They worked great on PCs, but some of us also had Amiga machines and of course would love to benefit from the offer. So we tried one, but it didn&#x27;t work; then another, and another; nothing, they were normal SCSI drives but refused to work on any Amiga with a SCSI controller, although any other drive would work in there. In the end we abandoned all hopes and took the drives for a reformat to be used on PCs, but... they were all dead. Completely, not even detectable by any controller; the mere connection to an Amiga SCSI controller destroyed them instantly. We never discovered where the problem was; those drives worked perfectly on all PCs, while we could install any other drive on every Amiga and expect it to work, but no way to put those in an Amiga and expect it to survive.

I’d purge the minute snapshots after 60 minutes. And I had cron jobs on other machines to backup the hourly and daily snapshots. I had it set up so that hourly snapshots were kept for something like 72 hours. And the daily snapshots were kept forever.The idea with the every minute snapshots being that they were for undoing manually made mistakes during SQL migrations etc.It worked well for me.I still use ZFS on my FreeBSD servers. But at the moment my projects are low traffic and the data only changes in important ways some rare times. So with my current personal servers I manually snapshot about once a week and manually trigger a backup of that from another server.Another thing I’ve changed is that now I only snapshot the parts of the file system where I store PostgreSQL databases and other application data. I no longer care so much about snapshotting the operating system data and such. If I have a serious hardware malfunction I will do a fresh install of the OS, and I have a log of what important config values are used and so on, that my backup scripts copy when I run them, without copying all of the other things. reply vasco 4 hours agorootparentThis sounds overkill even for production data, much less personal data, particularly the every minute and the fact you keep dailies forever.Unless you&#x27;re a custodian of some secret society&#x27;s files! reply oefrha 3 hours agorootparentprevCopy-on-write and cheap snapshots was quite special when ZFS was created. It’s hardly special in 2023, when every single non-vintage iPhone, iPad and Mac has that. reply georgyo 8 hours agoparentprevNot likely.The snapshot doesn&#x27;t write much, and both SSDs and ZFS are copy on write. Which means the cost of writing after a snapshot is the same as before the snapshot.On the other hand context is missing. Both SSDs and ZFS don&#x27;t like being full or even close to full. The working set was ~650GB, of the drive was 1TB, then those snapshots could have easily made the drive over 90% full. This could have made ZFS unhappy all by itself. reply chromakode 8 hours agorootparentI agree that it was unlikely. The total size of all data and snapshots was 625 GiB on a 2 TB drive (which had seen less than 2 years of moderate use). It was a pretty unexpected failure. reply Xaiph_Rahci 6 hours agorootparentprev> cost of writing after a snapshot is the same as before the snapshotI didn&#x27;t understand this, could you please clarify?If there was no snapshot, there would be only one write operation, the actual write. However, with snapshot in place, in addition to actual write, there is a copy operation which copies the original data and writes to snapshot location. So, there should be two write operations (actual + copy). reply boomboomsubban 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no copy operation, the previous data isn&#x27;t overwritten and the new data is written to a new block. It&#x27;s \"copy-on-write.\" reply rincebrain 5 hours agorootparentprevZFS is never overwriting in place in either case, you&#x27;re just not freeing the old one if it&#x27;s in a snapshot, and a snapshot is just a note that \"nickname this point in time &#x27;mysnapshot&#x27;, and don&#x27;t clean up anything referenced at this point in time\", so it&#x27;s very cheap to make, and you just check it later when you would be cleaning things up. reply xpe 8 hours agoparentprevAs I understand it, taking a snapshot with ZFS involves writing a metadata object and some data references. Assuming 100 GB of data, 128K block size, and 64 bit pointers, I&#x27;d guesstimate * that new data written during a snapshot would be in the ballpark of 5 MB. Is doing that 6 times per hour (52,560 times per year) enough to cause premature wear on the drive? That would be ~256 GB per year. This is likely under 1% of an SSD&#x27;s write endurance. So, I&#x27;d be surprised if taking 10 minute snapshots was a significant causal factor.* I could be wrong, I asked for some help from not the most reliable sources. Happy to be corrected. Still, if my estimate is higher than actual and yet still unlikely to affect drive longevity, it may be moot. reply p_l 22 minutes agoparentprevNo. ZFS implements normal writes to the disk as snapshots (just unnamed ones), so in fact you can only write to disk through creation of a snapshot or by writing to \"Intent Log\" which is short-term log of data that is going into next snapshot - but which was synced before the snapshot was done, and as such it&#x27;s secured in case of power failure. reply HankB99 8 hours agoparentprevNot likely. A snapshot just marks the most recently written block and prevents previous blocks from being altered. (More or less.) Since ZFS is copy on write, any changes to files will involve the same writes and some previously written data will not be deleted. reply numpad0 6 hours agoparentprevMinimum write size of a modern Flash chip can be ~100MB(!) according to a comment found in a random orange website[1]. So 5MB write every 10 minutes can be 600MB&#x2F;hr, which is 4.8TB&#x2F;8-hr-day, which is 24TB&#x2F;40-hour-week, which is 3.43 DWPD real time for a 1TB drive, and 2500 TBW in 2 years real time[2].Official quoted specification for SN850 is 600 TBW of write endurance, likely after derating for obvious warranty implications. Incidentally, 2500TB is also a typical endurance figure for many SSDs in this market. Overall, to me, sounds not entirely impossible.I kind of wonder what&#x27;s the controller says in SMART data, if still alive. On Linux the command is `apt install smartmontools; smartctl -s on &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda; smartctl -A &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda`, and it shall print out a table[4].

As others have mentioned, ZFS is CoW. Snapshots are \"free\" in that they (basically) point to a transaction group in the filesystem. They record a small amount of metadata to disk on each snapshot - on the order of a few MB. This is much much lower than an rclone&#x2F;sync style backup. reply Izkata 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s also the least interesting part of comparing a ZFS backup to rsync&#x2F;rclone: The rsync way is to crawl the entire tree being backed up to diff over the network then copy the differences. Because of snapshots, ZFS already knows all the changes that occurred between snapshot A and snapshot B, and (provided state up to A has already been backed up) can update the backup by pushing all changes between A and B as one big binary blob without having to scan or diff anything. reply Filligree 8 hours agoparentprevNo. Individual snapshots are a matter of kilobytes; desktop environments write considerably more. reply istjohn 7 hours agorootparentI read somewhere that snapshots are actually around 5 MB. Still not a lot, but a lot more than a few KB. A year&#x27;s worth of hourly snapshots comes to over 40 GB just in snapshot overhead. reply chromakode 7 hours agorootparentAnother factor to weigh in my case is this laptop probably spends at least 50% of its life suspended.

That&#x27;s basically ancient forum myth, alongside the also incorrect \"ZFS needs 1GB memory per TB of HDD\" nonsense that has thankfully mostly died out finally. ZFS makes no additional assumptions when using ECC vs non-ECC memory.It is theoretically possibly to construct a scenario where evil ram does all the exactly right things needed fool ZFS and corrupt your filesystem. Any pearl clutching about this thing which has never happened somehow also ignores that every filesystem is going to get corrupted.In reality, while ECC memory is always nice to have, it&#x27;s no more required than any other filesystem. Though personally now that amounts of +32gb are common, I generally prefer error correction&#x2F;detection over ultimate speed these days. Though ironically ECC memory is actually really nice to overclock, because I can actually just check my logs and prove if my system is actually stable.There so many actual dangers to your data in comparison that it&#x27;s laughable.

If you rsync over and over, it has to scan basically the whole filesystem for changes each time. Zfs snapshots don&#x27;t. The snapshot is ~instant and the calculation of what to send has no need to examine any files.I don&#x27;t think the performance and drive-lifetime hit of running rsync every 10 minutes would be good.Zfs should have an edge in terms of atomicity as well, but in practice I&#x27;m not sure how much that matters. I _think_ it does matter but isn&#x27;t perfect (zfs can&#x27;t trick applications into doing atomic writes if they&#x27;re not already, but it won&#x27;t have _another_ worse layer of breaking atomicity like rsync must). reply toast0 8 hours agorootparentDepends what else the machines are doing, and how much ram, and the rsync settings.If you read all the files on both sides, every time and don&#x27;t have more ram than disk, it&#x27;s going to be a lot of work. If you&#x27;re just looking at directory entries most of the time, there&#x27;s a good chance that&#x27;s all cached and it&#x27;s no disk load, other than the small changes.I ageee with you though that atomicity is a big difference, if it matters, and in most cases, it probably doesn&#x27;t.Personally, I&#x27;ve mostly stopped doing rsync backups in favor of zfs send, but I&#x27;ve still got one I need to get around to changing. Sanoid&#x2F;syncoid is pretty decent for less effort snapshotting and syncing snapshots; but I haven&#x27;t done anything with encrypted datasets. For most of my systems, I&#x27;d prefer recovery over security. For the one system in iffy hosting, it runs full disk encryption as a layer below zfs, so it&#x27;s zfs sends are cleartext, too. (The hosting facility has given me other customer&#x27;s unwiped disks; better for me to assume my disks won&#x27;t be wiped) reply kadoban 7 hours agorootparent> If you read all the files on both sides, every time and don&#x27;t have more ram than disk, it&#x27;s going to be a lot of work.

I know that rsync is _quite_ clever, but at least any incantations I&#x27;ve ever done it still hits the drives a good amount. I&#x27;d ballpark guess a couple of orders of magnitude better than just \"cp -r\" or something, but still a couple of orders of magnitude worse than zfs snapshots.Yeah you&#x27;re 100% right it&#x27;ll depend on bunch of variables though.> Sanoid&#x2F;syncoid is pretty decent for less effor snapshotting and syncing snapshots; but I haven&#x27;t done anything with encrypted datasets.I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it, but I use both directly on encrypted datasets.

I _think_ they&#x27;re all old issues? reply livueta 7 hours agorootparentprevRegarding atomicity, do you rsync from the live filesystem or from the hidden .zfs&#x2F;snapshot dir?My impetus for swapping to a send-based approach from an rsync-based approach of running an incremental (just from the normal non-snapshot filesystem view) then taking a snap on the far side was encountering corrupted encrypted containers. If rsync ran while a container was mounted and being written to, it&#x27;d get an inconsistent view of the underlying file and produce a nonsense diff, resulting in an unmountable container in the backup. This doesn&#x27;t happen with send because it has a consistent view of the blocks it needs to replicate, but as I was writing this I realized that running rsync from zfs&#x27;s view of the snapshot might get around that. Of course, at that point it&#x27;s probably easiest to just use send. reply toast0 6 hours agorootparentMy rsync backup goes from the live filesystem (and then does some snapshot-like things on the other end with hard links and what not), but it&#x27;s for my househould&#x27;s shared network drive, so atomicity isn&#x27;t super important. Mostly there&#x27;s not many changes, and if there are, it&#x27;s ok if it takes a couple snapshots to settle.I didn&#x27;t originally have that area as its own zfs filesystem, and it wasn&#x27;t even originally on zfs, but I moved things around when setting up a new, offsite, backup system... Just haven&#x27;t gotten around to redoing the old backups. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend any more time on rsync based backups, given how I use things now; incremental zfs means no need to compare, which makes me have good feelings. reply vladvasiliu 2 hours agorootparentprevIs reading a drive actually that big a hit on the drive&#x27;s lifetime?

But a quick search on Google reveals that Windows on ZFS is not a thing, yet. reply vladvasiliu 25 minutes agorootparentYou could flip that on its head, and run Windows in a VM on Linux on a ZFS volume. Depending on what you do on Windows and your particular hardware setup, this may or may not work well enough.I see people use GPU pass-through to play games on Windows VMs. You could probably pass through practically all devices (GPU, sound, network, keyboard, etc.) and this could work well-enough if you don&#x27;t need the absolute last drop of performance from your CPU and drives. And since KVM supports nested virtualization, you could run WSL2 in the Windows VM.And if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the KVM agent in windows can be told to ask the guest OS to sync the drives, and some Windows applications [0] can even cooperate with this and flush their buffers to disk. You could signal this before creating the ZFS snapshot.[0] probably not most, but I think MSSQL does. reply op00to 8 hours agoprevI wonder how much he gained from entirely restoring the system versus simply reprovisioning (gasp, even manually reinstalling) and restoring needed files a will.

They also use the VPN layer to check if they have peer status on a faster local network like the wifi or LAN and use that instead for the snapshot transfers if so.If for any reason any one of these systems either is destroyed or is no longer master, picking up from where I left off is as simple as picking another system up and marking it \"master\". No restore process, no changes, nothing at all, and it picks up from exactly where I left off when I was working on the other system. Means I can just grab my EDC laptop and stuff it in a bag not knowing how long I&#x27;ll be out or where I&#x27;ll be going and also know that it will be completely up to date with my datasets, or I can grab my desktop replacement laptop and its enormous external disk if I am going to be on a different continent for an extended period of time and want full geographic dataset locality. At no point in time does any of the above require the manual running of any process or replication or anything like that.Reprovision and restore would take a whole lot longer than this, wouldn&#x27;t give the abilities that it provides, and the above is only possible because of zfs snapshot replication.I also use a USB C external SSD that is a member of a ZFS mirror and a md raid group that is bootable, so even if my EDC laptop were to spontaneously combust, I could immediately get up and running on any similar laptop with roughly comparable hardware simply by putting that SSD in and booting from it, then adding the SSD on the laptop to the zfs mirror &#x2F; md raid group. reply theossuary 8 hours agoparentprevThe biggest time save is in time spent recovering.

By Mack DeGeurin PublishedMonday 5:55PM Comments (13) Photo: Matt Slocum (AP) US government regulators reportedly tried to come to an agreement with TikTok to prevent banning the app that would have granted the federal government vast powers over the app. That’s according to a draft of a deal between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) obtained by Forbes, a contract that would have given multiple US agencies unprecedented access into the app’s records and operations. Many of the concessions the government asked of TikTok look eerily similar to the surveillance tactics critics have accused Chinese officials of abusing. To allay fears the short-form video app could be used as a Chinese surveillance tool, the federal government nearly transformed it into an American one instead. Forbes reports that the draft agreement, dated Summer 2022, would have given the US government agencies like the Department of Justice and Department of Defense far more access to TikTok’s operations than that of any other social media company. The agreement would let agencies examine TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers with minimal prior notice and veto the hiring of any executive involved with leading TikTok US data security organization. It would also let US agencies block changes to the app’s terms of service in the US and order the company to subject itself to various audits, all on TikTok’s dime, per Forbes. In extreme cases, the agreement would allow government organizations to demand TikTok temporarily shut off functioning in the US. CFIUS did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. TikTok would not confirm or deny the draft agreement but instead sent us this statement. “As has been widely reported, we’ve been working with CFIUS for well over a year to implement a national security agreement and have invested significant resources in implementing a firewall to isolate U.S. user data,” a TikTok spokesperson said. “Today, all new protected U.S. user data is stored in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in the U.S. with tightly controlled and monitored gateways. We are doing more than any peer company to safeguard U.S. national security interests.” The draft document, which Gizmodo could not independently verify, is reportedly around 100 pages long and contains comments sent between attorneys representing ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company, and CFIUS. The agreements, if accepted as written at the time, would open TikTok’s US operations up to supervision by a number of external third-party auditors and source code inspectors. ByteDance leaders, whom US lawmakers and whistleblowers have accused of maintaining close connections with The Chinese Communist Party, would be excluded from some security-related decisions involving the US version of the app. Top Stories 01:12 The Space Fashions of Zack Snyder's Netflix Saga Rebel Moon Provisions described in the guidelines weren’t always agreed on by both parties. In several instances, according to Forbes, TikTok’s attorneys pushed back against terms that would let the government alter what types of user data ByteDance employees could view. Another point of disagreement emerged when the government reportedly asked for limitless veto power over TikTok’s future contracts. At one point, TikTok reportedly altered language that would have allowed government officials to demand changes to the apps recommendations algorithm if it promoted content the agencies disagreed with. CFIUS started investigating ByteDance four years ago, during Donald Trump’s administration, over growing fears from lawmakers and a portion of the public who worried Chinese government officials could use it to spy on Americans. Following threats of a ban by then-President Trump, TikTok said it had agreed to a data routing agreement with Oracle called “Project Texas” where new US user data would be stored on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure in the US. But news investigations and whistleblower reports over the past year have called into question the effectiveness and timeline of TikTok’s data security commitments. Multiple ByteDance employees were caught spying on users and journalists looking into the company, which then sparked a DOJ investigation. CFIUS’s attitude towards TikTok appears to have soured sometime between the draft proposal and March of this year, when the organization reportedly threatened TikTok with a nationwide ban if its Chinese owners didn’t sell their stakes in the app. Show all 13 comments",

Also you would have to believe that they have compromised AES&#x2F;RSA&#x2F;etc in order to break the encryption.China also has a lot more surveillance and filtering controls, especially with traffic leaving&#x2F;entering the great firewall. They have the social credit system and things as well, which the US could have with credit card and banking information, but (at least for now) the US has to get a warrant whereas the Chinese just gobble all of it up. That&#x27;s probably moot though since the banks will store that info forever so a warrant can be gotten later. Anyway we could debate whether those are \"tools\" or not.

Haven&#x27;t we noticed that social platforms are hyper-fickle, especially for ones targeted towards a youth and entertainment market? How many \"look at China&#x27;s awesome high-speed rail\" videos can you slip into the feed before the kids say \"screw this, I&#x27;m moving to this new platform which pioneered the Drink An Entire Litre of Bleach challenge\"? They actually built a very non-sticky platform compared to Facebook (which will persist for decades because people need to talk to Aunt Bertha who never learned any other platform) or YouTube (which has long-form content of value even if the firehose of new content starts winding down)It all just reeks of sour grapes. We were perfectly happy with China when they were a passive trading partner, a convenient \"elsewhere\" to offshore all that pesky polluting manufacturing to. But when they start to represent a real economic and political counterweight, producing a high-margin and culturally relevant product that&#x27;s outcompeting our own offerings, we immediately start rattling sabres.

I dare anybody on HN to proclaim that, I want to see the supporting premise where the foreign party like Russia having all your info is not as big of a deal.The notion that the FBI would do worse things from that position than Russia would is absurd, given what we&#x27;ve seen out of Russia. And China is absolutely no different in terms of its willingness to attack the US opportunistically (the Obama Admin had to obtain a cease fire agreement with China in regards to aggressively attacking the US re hacking, recall).There are no chains at all on what Russia can do to screw with the US citizenry, given the information. And more advanced AI systems should make it even easier for them to do it in the near future.If Russia could push a button and blank out 30 million US bank accounts, via a hacking plausible deniability means (anything that gives them the required minimum cover), they&#x27;d do it immediately. There&#x27;s so little downside from where Russia is sitting these days, it&#x27;d be a no-brainer for them. What are you gonna do? Sanction them?

But it would be going overboard since in actuality it would be insane to for Chinese intelligence services to use TikTok to send exploits -- it could be easily detected and would be the casus belli for shattering the company, which is an 8 billion dollar business in the US.What the US establishment actually doesn&#x27;t like is that TikTok wields a capability to influence the American public by amplifying certain topics and deranking others, also with their content policy. It&#x27;s a capability that the US companies enjoy all across the world with few authoritarian exceptions, and even the EU doesn&#x27;t get to review Facebook or Google&#x27;s algorithms (there is an effort to force them to explain their algos (Digital Services Act), but as far as I know it&#x27;s not even close to the intrusive search-like audits and vetos mentioned in this article), and smaller less influential countries&#x2F;political entities can&#x27;t even dream of forcing the FAANG to comply with their demands.

LEOs don&#x27;t want to have to sift through raw dumps of raw data -- they want nice search interfaces. Intel agencies, on the other hand, almost certainly want raw data, but would prefer continuing feeds over one-time or occasional dumps, so getting to \"examine TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers\" doesn&#x27;t seem all that interesting.So my take is that “agreement would let agencies examine TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers” is specifically to enable the audits also mentioned in TFA. reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> Presumably Byte Dance is already required to respond to NSLs and warrantsThere is a legitimate concern about ByteDance honestly responding to said orders.

All credit for the original idea, designs and implementation go to him. The prettymapp rewrite focuses on speed and adapted configuration to interface with the webapp. It drops more complex configuration options in favour of improved speed, reduced code complexity and simplified configuration interfaces. It is partially tested and adds a streamlit webapp component. Python package You can also use prettymapp without the webapp, directly in Python. This lets you customize the functionality or build your own application. Installation: pip install prettymapp Define the area, download and plot the OSM data: from prettymapp.geo import get_aoi from prettymapp.osm import get_osm_geometries from prettymapp.plotting import Plot from prettymapp.settings import STYLES aoi = get_aoi(address=\"Praça Ferreira do Amaral, Macau\", radius=1100, rectangular=False) df = get_osm_geometries(aoi=aoi) fig = Plot( df=df, aoi_bounds=aoi.bounds, draw_settings=STYLES[\"Peach\"] ).plot_all() fig.savefig(\"map.jpg\") To customize the map apperance, use the additional arguments of the Plot class (e.g. shape, contour_width etc.).

    "originBody": "Skip to main content The Verge homepage / Tech/ Reviews/ Science/ Entertainment/ More Menu REGULATION/TECH/POLICY Experian fined $650,000 for not letting you opt out of its spammy emails / The US government found the credit reporting agency in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, which requires companies to explicitly provide a means to opt out of marketing emails. By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Aug 22, 2023, 1:34 PM CDT|10 Comments / 10 New Share this story A screenshot of one of the Experian emails exhibited in court documents. Image: Federal Trade Commission Credit reporting agency Experian must pay a $650,000 fine for violating spam laws. The US Justice Department and the FTC have announced a permanent injunction granted by the US District Court in central California, forbidding the company’s deceptive marketing email practices. The regulators’ complaint last week alleged that Experian had sent customers with free credit monitoring memberships deceptive marketing emails that lacked both “clear and conspicuous notice” of the ability to opt out and “a mechanism for doing so.” The FTC says this violates the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act). The FTC referred the case to the DOJ to file the injunction before the court granted it, ordering Experian to pay the almost three-quarter-million-dollar fine within seven days. If you’ve been unlucky enough to receive Experian spam, you may already know the format. A new car has been noticed on your account — please confirm it! You need dark web monitoring to protect you! And, of course, that old classic: boost your FICO score. And of course, when you log in to your account, you’re treated to a page that wants you to upgrade your account or sign up for a loan, though that doesn’t appear to fall under the purview of this case. Text at the bottom of emails shown in court docs reads, “This is not a marketing email,” and claims the messages were notifications of recent account changes. No explicit opt-out link is visible — only a link to the company’s website and a statement that customers “can update some alerts and communications preferences” but will still “receive notifications like this one” on account status. “Signing up for a membership doesn’t mean you’re signing up for unwanted email,” said director Samuel Levine of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the time, “especially when all you’re trying to do is freeze your credit to protect your identity.” The injunction says Experian is permanently forbidden from sending “transactional or relationship” messages if they fall under the FTC’s definition of commercial advertisements. In addition to ordering the company to ensure there’s an explicit opt-out in its marketing emails, the court also issued several compliance requirements to be sure the company is actually obeying the injunction. 10 COMMENTS10 NEW FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE Sony’s new $2,200 camera vs. an iPhone 14 Pro The new Sony ZV-E1 is a compact mirrorless full-frame camera that’s dedicated to content creators and aimed squarely at vloggers.

Last year, Experian kept sending me spam with the footer \"This is not a marketing email\" and I kept trying to unsubscribe. Eventually, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that this violated CAN-SPAM.I&#x27;d like to think that my report contributed to this fine (although that&#x27;s probably optimistic). In any event, Experian had to take the time to respond. They also canceled my unwanted \"complimentary membership with Experian CreditWorks Basic\", which ended the spam. So I recommend filing complaints if appropriate. reply dpifke 12 hours agoparentYour story sounded vaguely familiar to me, so I just looked in my email archive, and it appears I did the same thing around the beginning of 2021, when Experian also automatically signed me up for \"CreditWorks\" after I disputed fraud with them[0]. They were sending almost-daily spam. (\"Your Dark Web scan is complete!\" \"Congrats, your membership&#x27;s been upgraded!\" \"Important Information about your credit score!\")I wrote to the FTC instead of the CFPB, and got a form letter back for my efforts. Mail from *@*.experian.com is still blackholed, so I guess this is a good reminder that rule is there, if I&#x27;m ever required to deal with those assholes again.[0] Supposed past-due electric utility account in a state in which I&#x27;ve never set foot, let alone owned or rented property.

Structured logs use key-value pairs so they can be parsed, filtered, searched, and analyzed quickly and reliably. For servers, logging is an important way for developers to observe the detailed behavior of the system, and often the first place they go to debug it. Logs therefore tend to be voluminous, and the ability to search and filter them quickly is essential. The standard library has had a logging package, log, since Go’s initial release over a decade ago. Over time, we’ve learned that structured logging is important to Go programmers. It has consistently ranked high in our annual survey, and many packages in the Go ecosystem provide it. Some of these are quite popular: one of the first structured logging packages for Go, logrus, is used in over 100,000 other packages. With many structured logging packages to choose from, large programs will often end up including more than one through their dependencies. The main program might have to configure each of these logging packages so that the log output is consistent: it all goes to the same place, in the same format. By including structured logging in the standard library, we can provide a common framework that all the other structured logging packages can share. A tour of slog Here is the simplest program that uses slog: package main import \"log/slog\" func main() { slog.Info(\"hello, world\") } As of this writing, it prints: 2023/08/04 16:09:19 INFO hello, world The Info function prints a message at the Info log level using the default logger, which in this case is the default logger from the log package—the same logger you get when you write log.Printf. That explains why the output looks so similar: only the “INFO” is new. Out of the box, slog and the original log package work together to make it easy to get started. Besides Info, there are functions for three other levels—Debug, Warn, and Error—as well as a more general Log function that takes the level as an argument. In slog, levels are just integers, so you aren’t limited to the four named levels. For example, Info is zero and Warn is 4, so if your logging system has a level in between those, you can use 2 for it. Unlike with the log package, we can easily add key-value pairs to our output by writing them after the message: slog.Info(\"hello, world\", \"user\", os.Getenv(\"USER\")) The output now looks like this: 2023/08/04 16:27:19 INFO hello, world user=jba As we mentioned, slog’s top-level functions use the default logger. We can get this logger explicitly, and call its methods: logger := slog.Default() logger.Info(\"hello, world\", \"user\", os.Getenv(\"USER\")) Every top-level function corresponds to a method on a slog.Logger. The output is the same as before. Initially, slog’s output goes through the default log.Logger, producing the output we’ve seen above. We can change the output by changing the handler used by the logger. slog comes with two built-in handlers. A TextHandler emits all log information in the form key=value. This program creates a new logger using a TextHandler and makes the same call to the Info method: logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil)) logger.Info(\"hello, world\", \"user\", os.Getenv(\"USER\")) Now the output looks like this: time=2023-08-04T16:56:03.786-04:00 level=INFO msg=\"hello, world\" user=jba Everything has been turned into a key-value pair, with strings quoted as needed to preserve structure. For JSON output, install the built-in JSONHandler instead: logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil)) logger.Info(\"hello, world\", \"user\", os.Getenv(\"USER\")) Now our output is a sequence of JSON objects, one per logging call: {\"time\":\"2023-08-04T16:58:02.939245411-04:00\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"hello, world\",\"user\":\"jba\"} You are not limited to the built-in handlers. Anyone can write a handler by implementing the slog.Handler interface. A handler can generate output in a particular format, or it can wrap another handler to add functionality. One of the examples in the slog documentation shows how to write a wrapping handler that changes the minimum level at which log messages will be displayed. The alternating key-value syntax for attributes that we’ve been using so far is convenient, but for frequently executed log statements it may be more efficient to use the Attr type and call the LogAttrs method. These work together to minimize memory allocations. There are functions for building Attrs out of strings, numbers, and other common types. This call to LogAttrs produces the same output as above, but does it faster: slog.LogAttrs(context.Background(), slog.LevelInfo, \"hello, world\", slog.String(\"user\", os.Getenv(\"USER\"))) There is a lot more to slog: As the call to LogAttrs shows, you can pass a context.Context to some log functions so a handler can extract context information like trace IDs. (Canceling the context does not prevent the log entry from being written.) You can call Logger.With to add attributes to a logger that will appear in all of its output, effectively factoring out the common parts of several log statements. This is not only convenient, but it can also help performance, as discussed below. Attributes can be combined into groups. This can add more structure to your log output and can help to disambiguate keys that would otherwise be identical. You can control how a value appears in the logs by providing its type with a LogValue method. That can be used to log the fields of a struct as a group or redact sensitive data, among other things. The best place to learn about all of slog is the package documentation. Performance We wanted slog to be fast. For large-scale performance gains, we designed the Handler interface to provide optimization opportunities. The Enabled method is called at the beginning of every log event, giving the handler a chance to drop unwanted log events quickly. The WithAttrs and WithGroup methods let the handler format attributes added by Logger.With once, rather than at each logging call. This pre-formatting can provide a significant speedup when large attributes, like an http.Request, are added to a Logger and then used in many logging calls. To inform our performance optimization work, we investigated typical patterns of logging in existing open-source projects. We found that over 95% of calls to logging methods pass five or fewer attributes. We also categorized the types of attributes, finding that a handful of common types accounted for the majority. We then wrote benchmarks that captured the common cases, and used them as a guide to see where the time went. The greatest gains came from paying careful attention to memory allocation. The design process The slog package is one of the largest additions to the standard library since Go 1 was released in 2012. We wanted to take our time designing it, and we knew that community feedback would be essential. By April 2022, we had gathered enough data to demonstrate the importance of structured logging to the Go community. The Go team decided to explore adding it to the standard library. We began by looking at how the existing structured logging packages were designed. We also took advantage of the large collection of open-source Go code stored on the Go module proxy to learn how these packages were actually used. Our first design was informed by this research as well as Go’s spirit of simplicity. We wanted an API that is light on the page and easy to understand, without sacrificing performance. It was never a goal to replace existing third-party logging packages. They are all good at what they do, and replacing existing code that works well is rarely a good use of a developer’s time. We divided the API into a frontend, Logger, that calls a backend interface, Handler. That way, existing logging packages can talk to a common backend, so the packages that use them can interoperate without having to be rewritten. Handlers are written or in progress for many common logging packages, including Zap, logr and hclog. We shared our initial design within the Go team and other developers who had extensive logging experience. We made alterations based on their feedback, and by August of 2022 we felt we had a workable design. On August 29, we made our experimental implementation public and began a GitHub discussion to hear what the community had to say. The response was enthusiastic and largely positive. Thanks to insightful comments from the designers and users of other structured logging packages, we made several changes and added a few features, like groups and the LogValuer interface. We changed the mapping from log levels to integers twice. After two months and about 300 comments, we felt we were ready for an actual proposal and accompanying design doc. The proposal issue garnered over 800 comments and resulted in many improvements to the API and the implementation. Here are two examples of API changes, both concerning context.Context: Originally the API supported adding loggers to a context. Many felt that this was a convenient way to plumb a logger easily through levels of code that didn’t care about it. But others felt it was smuggling in an implicit dependency, making the code harder to understand. Ultimately, we removed the feature as being too controversial. We also wrestled with the related question of passing a context to logging methods, trying a number of designs. We initially resisted the standard pattern of passing the context as the first argument because we didn’t want every logging call to require a context, but ultimately created two sets of logging methods, one with a context and one without. One change we did not make concerned the alternating key-and-value syntax for expressing attributes: slog.Info(\"message\", \"k1\", v1, \"k2\", v2) Many felt strongly that this was a bad idea. They found it hard to read and easy to get wrong by omitting a key or value. They preferred explicit attributes for expressing structure: slog.Info(\"message\", slog.Int(\"k1\", v1), slog.String(\"k2\", v2)) But we felt that the lighter syntax was important to keeping Go easy and fun to use, especially for new Go programmers. We also knew that several Go logging packages, like logr, go-kit/log and zap (with its SugaredLogger) successfully used alternating keys and values. We added a vet check to catch common mistakes, but did not change the design. On March 15, 2023, the proposal was accepted, but there were still some minor unresolved issues. Over the next few weeks, ten additional changes were proposed and resolved. By early July, the log/slog package implementation was complete, along with the testing/slogtest package for verifying handlers and the vet check for correct usage of alternating keys and values. And on August 8, Go 1.21 was released, and slog with it. We hope you find it useful, and as fun to use as it was to build. And a big thanks to everyone who participated in the discussion and the proposal process. Your contributions improved slog immensely. Resources The documentation for the log/slog package explains how to use it and provides several examples.

Logging structured data is a very basic expectation. reply infogulch 10 hours agorootparentThis is structured logging. Stubbornly insisting that \"structured logging\" === \"map\" is dumb and ignores a large fraction of use cases where performance matters. reply mlhpdx 7 hours agorootparentAre there languages that solve the “performance“ problem with maps? In fact, isn’t Go one of them? reply infogulch 6 hours agorootparentIn this use case using maps doesn&#x27;t solve any problem, requires at least one allocation, and requires hashing each key. This is not even an interesting discussion. reply mlhpdx 5 hours agorootparentI can see the case for flat logging, aka. key value logging, as an optimization for very, very performance critical code that needs to emit string logs. That however, isn’t mainstream in my experience. The far, far more common case is logging in code with complex data-driven behaviors where the data is structured (more than one level, not flat) and where forensic debugging via logs is a critical activity.

If you’re not, that’s cool. reply 59nadir 3 hours agorootparentI think you seem to be arguing that the end result should be a \"map\"-like structure, whereas the other commenter is arguing about the interface to the logging library not being based on maps. These are not the same and taking maps in the interface is likely to incur allocations, yes. Having to specify your key-value pairs without maps is the only downside to not taking fully constructed maps in the interface. replyyencabulator 10 hours agorootparentprevAvoiding the map allocation & construction cost is way harder than avoiding the use of a map, like zap and slog.LogAttrs do. reply gdprrrr 15 hours agorootparentprevIs ordering of the keys guaranteed to be the same as in the literal? reply grose 15 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point.

Logging is crucial for monitoring services, and making logging statements many times slower will either sink your service or push developers to avoid logging and making the service impossible to debug.Most log metadata will be attached by libraries and middleware, so service&#x2F;application devs won&#x27;t even see most of it. reply returningfory2 15 hours agorootparentprevPassing in a map would require an extra allocation for the map memory for each log line.

Does it already exist and I just can’t find it? reply scottlamb 10 hours agoparent> Does something like that sound useful to other folks?Very much so!One piece I&#x27;d like to have is a good output format from my program. Right now I have stuff outputting logs in JSON format to stderr&#x2F;local file (then picked up by the Opentelemetry OTLP collector, Datadog agent, AWS CloudWatch, whatever) and the traces&#x2F;spans actually sent from my process to the collector over the network. It baffles me why the traces&#x2F;spans are done in that way rather than placed in a local file (and for compressibility, ideally the same file as the logs). The local file method would make it easier to have simple local-focused tools, would lower the requirements for outputting these records (no need to have async+http client set up, just the writer thread), and would better handle the collector being in a bad mood at the moment.That&#x27;s the most important piece, but if getting that done requires inventing a new format (it seems to?!?), there are some other details I&#x27;d like to it to do well. You should be able to see all the stuff associated with each log entry&#x27;s matching span, which means that spans and attributes should be recorded on open, not just on close. (Attributes can also be updated mid-span; the Rust tracing library allows this.) (OpenTelemetry notably only supports complete spans). It could be more efficient by interning the keys. some care about how rotation is handled, timestamps are handled, etc. reply corytheboyd 10 hours agorootparentI hadn&#x27;t even considered collecting traces&#x2F;spans in this way yet, and have taken the approach of \"stuff outputting logs in JSON format to stderr&#x2F;local file\". I usually end up writing a (temporary, structured) log message with the relevant span tags, but wouldn&#x27;t it be much better to run the actual trace&#x2F;span code and be able to verify it locally without the ad-hoc log message?The prototype I built is a web application that creates websocket connections, and if those connections receive messages that are JSON, log lines are added. Columns are built dynamically as log messages arrive, and then you can pick which columns to render in the table. If you&#x27;re curious here&#x27;s the code, including a screenshot: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;corytheboyd-smartsheet&#x2F;json-log-explorerWith websockets, it&#x27;s very easy to use websocketd (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;websocketd.com), which will watch input files for new lines, and write them verbatim as websocket messages to listeners (the web app).To make the idea real, would want to figure out how to not require the user to run websocketd out of band, but watching good ol&#x27; files is dead simple, and very easy to add to most code (add a new log sink, use existing log file, etc.) reply Too 4 hours agoparentprevThe Grafana stack, including Loki for logs, can be started easily in a docker-compose project in your local environment.

The main program might have to configure each of these logging packages so that the log output is consistent: it all goes to the same place, in the same format. By including structured logging in the standard library, we can provide a common framework that all the other structured logging packages can share.This is IMO the right way of doing it. Provide an interface with simple defaults, usable out of the box. Those who need more can use a library that builds towards the interface.So when evaluating any library, you can ask \"How well does this integrate with interfaces in the standard library?\". Discovering that some functionality is just a \"Fooer\" that pieces well together with existing stuff is calming. Not only do you already know how to \"Foo\", you also get a hidden stability benefit: There&#x27;s an implied API surface contract here.This is in stark contrast to the \"builds on top of\" approach, where you end up with competing, idiosyncratic interfaces.

Infof&#x2F;Debugf&#x2F;Errorf are like fine especially when I&#x27;m making a little CLI tool for myself, but my main consumption of logs at work is other peoples&#x27; logs via a cloud log aggregator, and so when you give other devs who are not me Sprintf they start to do things like \"[%s] default&#x2F;%v - %v\" or so, which makes sense to them but doesn&#x27;t give me great strings to search for when I&#x27;m trying to figure out \"what were all of the situations in which this strange thing happened\".It&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re trying to internationalize, you want to emit as constant of a string as reasonably practical, so that it can be straightforwardly matched and substituted into a different language.

This handler controls _how_ events are written out, the format of them etc.If you want to use slog, I can imagine setting up the logger with a handler specific for the CLI output in the CLI tool, and a json or text structured handler in the webservice app.The quesiton is, do you actually want structured logging in the CLI app? Yes you probably want to print something out, but is it _structured_ in the sense that slog expects? Or is it just some output.If it&#x27;s not really structured, then you probably want some other interface&#x2F;library that better represents the logging you want to do. Slog will push you towards structured key-value pairs, and you might find yourself fighting against this in the CLI app. reply candiddevmike 14 hours agorootparentIt seems like I could write an output handler for the CLI app that is more terminal-appropriate.

Wonder how the perf stacks up.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uber-go&#x2F;zap reply tony_cannistra 14 hours agoparentIt looks like they&#x27;ve included slog in their performance benchmarks, which show zap as considerably more performant (though I don&#x27;t really understand the benchmark). reply llimllib 9 hours agorootparenthttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;bench.zerolog.io&#x2F; Is a useful set of benchmarks reply __loam 15 hours agoprevSlog is an amazing name reply mi_lk 14 hours agoprevQ: what do people use for structured logging in Java? reply paulddraper 10 hours agoparentAny Java logger has structured logging.The prevailing solution is SLF4J, which is a facade that can be implemented by any number of backends, e.g. Logback.There is logging in the stdlib (java.util.logging), but it&#x27;s the less common choice, for whatever reason. reply monknomo 13 hours agoparentprevLogback has structured logging. I think log4j has it as well reply Femolo 14 hours agoprevLog everything as Json!We need to start making Json viewer were we look into log files without tooling the default.It&#x27;s so much easier to use Json automatically and ship them to systems out of the box.Linux logging should do that too. Not just container in k8s reply benatkin 11 hours agoparentThis supports quoting values. There isn&#x27;t much JSON would add except overhead and making it a bit simpler to read and write them. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the overhead. reply politician 13 hours agoprevI wish there was a better approach for the problem of avoiding function calls when the log level at runtime is higher than the call site.So, slog.Info(\"failed to frob\", \"thing\", GetThing(1))Still calls GetThing(1) when the log level is greater than Info. The only solution right now for this is to test the log level before making the logging call. It would be amazing if language designers could make the arguments late bound instead or used aspect-oriented programming approaches to protect each logging call site. reply sa46 10 hours agoparentThere is. See slog.LogValuerhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;x&#x2F;exp&#x2F;slog#LogValuer reply yencabulator 7 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;log&#x2F;slog#hdr-Performance_considerations reply jeffbee 12 hours agoparentprevThere are other languages of course where the logging avoids this, even in libraries written by the same company that writes Go. In C++, the Abseil logging library (f.k.a. glog) will not evaluate a condition for a disabled log level. LOG(INFO) << WowExpensiveFunction();This is safe when the log level is set to WARN or higher. For the same reasons, LOG_EVERY_N and LOG_FIRST_N in the same library are pretty cheap. reply User23 9 hours agoprevJust log to sqlite. It’s literally better than all the alternatives, but for some reason nobody does. reply yencabulator 7 hours agoparentThat&#x27;d be a slog.Handler, not a reason to avoid the new standard API. reply bobbyi 13 hours agoprev [–] Walking past an eatery with outdoor seating, I overheard one diner say the phrase \"process raw logs\" and I thought, \"wow, I guess that is one of those tricky problems that basically everyone ends up dealing with\".And then I heard \"... with a chainsaw. It&#x27;s a chainsaw mill\" and realized I may have misunderstood the context. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
