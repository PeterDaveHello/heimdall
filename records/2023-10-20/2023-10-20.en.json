The funding will allow the growing repository with more than 2 million articles to migrate to the cloud and modernize its code to ensure reliability, fault tolerance and accessibility for researchers. “I am deeply grateful for this tremendous support from both the Simons Foundation and the NSF,” said Greg Morrisett, the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. “This investment ensures that the arXiv service will continue to scale, to serve an even broader constituency, and better serve the arXiv scientific community.” “This generous funding from the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation will allow arXiv to expand its critical growth in the scientific community, where it allows thousands of researchers to freely disseminate, exchange and explore their findings,” said Ramin Zabih, arXiv faculty director and professor of computer science at Cornell Tech. “By modernizing the code base and transitioning to the cloud, we are strengthening arXiv’s infrastructure and ensuring that it will continue to be a source of innovation in the sharing of scholarly publications. We are grateful to the Simons Foundation and the NSF for their support and for sharing in our vision for arXiv.” The next stage of arXiv’s development will include hiring multiple software developers to support the modernization effort. In parallel, faculty members in the Department of Computer Science, with funding provided by the NSF, will develop new search and recommendation techniques that can be tested and deployed on arXiv’s large and active user community, supported by state of the art privacy guarantees. In addition, arXiv will provide substantially better access to the visually impaired by producing HTML as well as PDF versions of its content. “The arXiv has been a critical piece of research infrastructure for decades, and just as important, part of the foundation of open science that the world relies on every day,” said David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation. “Through our partner Cornell Tech, the foundation is proud to continue its investment in arXiv. This gift will help modernize the arXiv and ensure its sustainability for the community of scientists and mathematicians whose contributions have made it what it is.” arXiv was founded in 1991 by then-Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist Paul Ginsparg, Ph.D. ’81, prior to his return to Cornell in 2001. The repository is now maintained and operated by Cornell Tech, and serves researchers in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. “The Simons Foundation has provided essential behind-the-scenes support for arXiv since 2011, as a natural partner in support of the research enterprise,” said Ginsparg, professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. “The additional support to facilitate a transition to long-term sustainability should permit arXiv to enhance through an even longer period the transformative effects it has had on research communication over the past three decades.” In addition to the Simons Foundation’s ongoing support, arXiv is supported by academic and research libraries, universities, research organizations, professional societies and individual donors.

It is an essential resource.For me personally, it’ll be really interesting to see if the frontend changes. No doubt there are some important improvements that can be made (a website can always be made more accessible, moderation tools, support for name changes as mentioned, etc.) However, to first approximation, arXiV’s website already seems almost like a platonic ideal. It reminds me of Craigslist. Simple HTML, loads fast, has the information and features you need but otherwise gets out of your way. I love it.The arXiv team deserves a lot of credit for what they’ve done to get it this far. It’s difficult to overstate how useful and transformative preprint servers have been to science. reply userbinator 7 hours agoparentSimple HTML, loads fast, has the information and features you need but otherwise gets out of your wayExactly. I&#x27;ll be furious if it turns into another trendchasing JS-required SPA.By all means use the funds to pay for additional bandwidth or storage, but don&#x27;t waste it on useless hostile UI changes. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 1 hour agorootparentI had this same thought but was reluctatnt to state it as it feels like unnecessary pessimism.

Not sure you can make it much faster. reply nre 8 hours agorootparentThey probably could make it faster by rendering server-side a preview of sorts. I don&#x27;t think that most papers are large enough for this to have a major impact unless you have a very slow connection. reply choppaface 10 hours agorootparentprevIf the pdfs were served by some of the megacaps who posts tons of papers (e.g. Google or Facebook) then it would be an order of magnitude faster. And said megacaps would end up spending peanuts relative to the value they get from arXiv. reply codetrotter 9 hours agorootparentIt’s better that ArXiv stays not relying on Google, Fb or any other tech giant.What I would like to see instead is first-party support for BitTorrent and magnet links. reply kawhah 42 minutes agorootparentprevAn order of magnitude faster sounds unimportant. Is all the time spent by researchers sitting around waiting for 0.4s for a paper to download really an issue? reply toasted-subs 9 hours agorootparentprevCompression algorithms supported by the browser. reply queuebert 9 hours agorootparentPDFs are typically already compressed.

I found Chrome being much faster than Adobe Acrobat.Either way, the speed of rendering never bothered me. reply generationP 6 hours agorootparentSumatraPDF on Windows is lightning fast with the kind of PDFs you get from the arXiv (true PDFs without heavy graphics). I don&#x27;t know what is fast on Linux, but probably some MuPDF-based viewers are (the MuPDF PoC viewer is fast even on WSL). reply djbusby 6 hours agorootparentprevEvince FTW! replyelashri 9 hours agoprevSome people are angry that arXiv which is probably the most important repository of science are getting public funding because big tech companies are using it to publish their work, and they should fund that from their deep buckets. Are you aware of the consequences of what you are suggesting?If you are funding something, you have some authority over what you are funding. Directly or even indirectly (If you don&#x27;t follow our suggestions, we might revisit our financial contribution). So you want to put the place that should be open and independent under the thump of corporations that does not always have the same goals as the benefit of the science and public interest? reply gerdesj 9 hours agoparentOpen Source is ... open source.There is nothing wrong with chucking money at Archive to help with costs, provided that money does not come with menaces. The basic idea is that if you profit in some way from an open repository of ... something then why not contribute to it? If enough people&#x2F;orgs contribute then we are all good. Otherwise, if the org behind the project is an individual doing it as a hobby and they can&#x27;t afford to continue then they might need support.In the end Archive and co have costs attached. You don&#x27;t have to contribute but it might be nice if you did. reply afandian 3 hours agorootparentYou may be interested in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openscholarlyinfrastructure.org&#x2F; reply dchftcs 8 hours agorootparentprevPublic money indirectly comes from the most profitable companies, so it&#x27;s not as bad as you suggest.

Low-margin SMEs contribute proportionately very little tax compared to Google when we account for tax contribution this way. reply riku_iki 5 hours agorootparentEmployees payroll and income taxes come before margin? reply dchftcs 1 hour agorootparentI guess you&#x27;re referring to my specification of low-margin. As I also specified SME, what that means is both low-margin and low-revenue. And the true intented meaning is that all cash flows one might want to tax (mostly with progressive rates) are small. replywaveBidder 9 hours agoparentprevyou have a good point but why are you, uh, subtweeting them reply jxf 11 hours agoprev> arXiv was founded in 1991 by then-Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist Paul Ginsparg, Ph.D. ’81, prior to his return to Cornell in 2001.I had no idea arXiv was that old.

The order was (very) roughlyHigh-energy theory ~1992Other physics theory ~1994Physics experiment ~1996Math ~2000CS ~2008Some disciplines flipped nearly overnight, while others took several years of slow growth before posting to the arXiv become the default. reply bfung 9 hours agorootparentAdvertisements masquerading as science ~2016 (2023 for sure) reply starcraft2wol 5 hours agorootparentOf course.

I acknowledge it puts them in the cool kids club but it feels unauthentic. Putting research out in the open moves humanity forward.Arxiv can say it made a little dent in the universe and I’m glad it’s getting the funding it needs to be sustainable.I just hope they don’t burn it out trying to scale needlessly. reply noqc 9 hours agoprevPrediction: Arxiv has no need of this money, as it has no need of upgrades. This money will exclusively attract salesman, all of whom will offer to make arxiv worse, for money. One of them might succeed reply gustavus 8 hours agoparentI concur. Seriously it&#x27;s job is to act as a repository of PDF files. It does that it does that well. It doesn&#x27;t not need a fancy new frontend that changes again in 18 months because \"circles are in\" it doesn&#x27;t need to move to a \"distributed load balanced fault tolerant web scale platform solution\" (that costs about 2x in maintenance and engineering time as it currently does).It doesn&#x27;t need to do anything of these things. It needs to serve documents and thats it. If there are problems with load they can always throw it behind a CDN since all of their contentt is largely static it fits nicely into the use case CDNs were developed to solve.Please don&#x27;t change things. reply generationP 11 hours agoprev> migrate to the cloudOh great, looking forward to a captcha every time I download a paper.(FWIW, arXiv is one place I trust not to make such stupid decisions, but migrating to a cloud often means the decisions are no longer made in-house...) reply twosdai 11 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s possible that they jump straight to the hybrid solution that many companies now make. Like migrating to the cloud could be just to have backups of papers in s3 with failures to download them initially then pass through to the s3 location seamlessly. It could also be trying to rewrite everything to run on lambda.My point being that migrating to the cloud means different things to different companies&#x2F;groups. reply generationP 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;d be good. reply mistrial9 11 hours agoparentprevI suspect this cloud move is more for security -- to keep others out -- than to improve the product. As you mention, many decisions will no longer belong to Cornell. This is indicative of larger geo-political trends. reply bostik 3 hours agorootparentPopping arXiv would be quite an impressive watering hole attack. You wouldn&#x27;t need to do anything to the site itself, their PDFs are downloaded by a huge number of bleeding edge researchers and technical journalists. reply dcgudeman 10 hours agorootparentprevkeep who out? reply jacobgorm 12 minutes agoprevPerhaps that means they can set the PDF title tag :) reply yoshuaw 10 hours agoprevOh that’s great to hear! I really like arXiv and am glad it’s getting more funding! I hope this will enable arXiv to fix some of the long-time issues it has, including the way identity and attribution are handled.For example: the current system assumes people’s names do not change [1], which in particular negatively affects trans authors. This seems like it could be fixed if they had the bandwidth to, and I hope they will.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;falsehoods-programmers-... reply solusn 10 hours agoparentIt much more negatively affects women who choose to or are compelled by societal expectations to take their husband&#x27;s surname. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentThey just keep their maiden name for science and it seems to work fine? reply elashri 9 hours agorootparentThe standard convention in citation is to follow the format:FI, MI, Last. For instance, if an individual changes their last name from Davidson to Mitchell, the change would manifest as follows:Suppose an author named Susan Thomas Davidson (S.T. Davidson) decides to change her last name, becoming Susan Thomas Mitchell. The citation would then be updated to (S.T. Mitchell).This alteration retains the consistent impact as the last name, serving as the clear identifier, undergoes the change.\" reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentMost research scientists I know just use their maiden name indefinitely for ‘work’. No one gets confused. Medical Dr’s too. reply akjssdk 4 hours agorootparentprevNot sure about that, the convention is to cite however someone appears on the paper right? That way everything is consistent. reply generationP 8 hours agoparentprevThere is no good way to deal with name changes. You can change them in the metadata, but the old ones will still be around in the paper itself. You can let authors change them in the paper, but the old ones will still be around in others&#x27; bibliographies. You can&#x27;t do much about the bibliographies, since (1) you&#x27;d need an automated way to find them all and disambiguate them (have fun with Chinese names) and (2) a lot of authors will reject the idea that someone else changes their papers. reply SiempreViernes 45 minutes agorootparentFor disambiguation there&#x27;s ORCID, and for the citation there is nowadays the DOI to identify the paper. So long as you can update whatever the DOI points out with a note it seems like this is handled? reply userbinator 7 hours agoparentprevYou must not change history. You can use a new name, but that should be considered a new and separate identity. reply solusn 1 hour agorootparentAgreed, what is needed is a way to link the old and new identities so others can know that it is the same person. reply piperswe 5 hours agorootparentprevSo if someone changes their name, they start from scratch? That seems a bit unfair. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 2 hours agorootparentIf I change my phone number or email, that&#x27;s on me to notify anyone. I [voluntary] broke the world&#x27;s consistency, I must repair it. Same with names. reply bigyikes 10 hours agoparentprevIt seems arXiv does support name changes, just not in citations and references[1]This seems… fine? To modify citations would be a strange alteration of history and an intrusion on authorship.If someone quotes this comment and cites it as “bigyikes” and later Dang changes my name, should he also edit the comments that quote me? I don’t think so, but maybe I’m in a minority here.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.arxiv.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;update-name-change-policy&#x2F; reply yoshuaw 7 hours agorootparentThe link you shared seems great, thank you! I was talking to a friend just yesterday who regularly publishes to arXiv, and my understanding was that changing author names on papers where they weren’t the primary author wasn’t possible. But from the link you’ve shared it seems they’ve made the steps needed to address that. I think this means I might be able to deliver some good news! reply throwaway71271 1 hour agoprevI hope they just use the money for more bandwidth and maybe spend it on free api&#x2F;download access so people can get big chunks of it easily and build all kinds of things (from alert on keyword to just stream of text to finetune models)And I hope they don&#x27;t touch the frontend at all :) reply armchairhacker 11 hours agoprevarXiv is a great resource. At least in my field (Programming Languages, but I imagine it applies to most if not all of Computer Science) it seems like most papers are on arXiv.I see no reason to not make papers free. Most things cost money because either they&#x27;re material themselves, or cost money&#x2F;material to produce which needs to be somehow recouped. But papers cost almost $0 to distribute and are created with grants which get funded by the results and discoveries themselves. reply omgJustTest 11 hours agoparentMy philosophy is that if people want to spend (waste) time on closed journals more power to them.Potentially when fields were small and niche this aggregation of topics might be useful. Today in modern search and computerized tools, the question is: why do we need them?There&#x27;s nothing in academia that I feel is more of a racket than this scheme.I feel that _everything_ should be published and that natural discussion of said topic will drive the importance. reply jltsiren 10 hours agorootparentToday, with modern search and computerized tools, one of the primary heuristics I use for determining which preprints to read is \"do I know any of the authors\". If I don&#x27;t know you, your ideas are most likely not worth reading, even if they appear to be about a topic I&#x27;m interested in. There are so many papers published every year and so little time to read them properly, and the search tools that exist are not that good. If you don&#x27;t have an established reputation, your best bet is submitting your work to a relevant journal or conference, where the peer reviewers will usually give you a fair chance.Google Scholar is a good example of how bad the tools are. Its recommendations are apparently based on things like the papers you publish, the papers you cite, and the papers that cite your work, which sounds superficially reasonable. That worked well enough when I was doing my PhD within the boundaries of an established academic field. But when I started doing more interdisciplinary work, the recommendations quickly turned into garbage. A better recommendation system would understand that there is a field I work in, an upstream field I take ideas from, a downstream field I contribute to, and several fields further downstream that use the work I contributed to. reply CSSer 11 hours agorootparentprevWould&#x2F;could you apply this same argument to books? reply IanCal 10 hours agorootparentWhat people usually picture for books is things written for profit by the author. That&#x27;s very different from academic papers.If you&#x27;re talking about monographs&#x2F;etc then that&#x27;s a different beast. reply omgJustTest 11 hours agorootparentprevI feel this is already true of books, the question is will a publisher put it out... books cost money to produce and by comparision to hosting are massive investments. reply jacobr1 10 hours agorootparentI wish more self-published books would find a way to hire a copyeditor. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 2 hours agorootparentgpt to the rescue? replyIncipient 3 hours agoprevIs moving something that has a seriously tight budget, to the cloud, necessarily a good idea? reply sideshowb 3 hours agoprevI wonder if they could use some of it to make an experimental post-publication review system. I&#x27;m not sure what the future of peer review is, but I doubt it would hurt for them to try. reply drones 35 minutes agoparentI think it&#x27;s antithetical to the philosophy of arxiv in the first place.

Megacaps like Google and Facebook are reaping tons of value from arXiv, i.e. (1) easy access to non-industry peer attention through a respected pre-print publisher, (2) major incentive to their employees and key component to performance review cycle, ...Google itself has out-published most universities in conferences like NeurIPS for the past few years. For Google alone to match the $10m would be a drop in the bucket-- a $10m grant would be an order of magnitude less than the compensation they&#x27;re paying to their own employees who make heavy use of arXiv.NSF funds are scarce, precious, and it&#x27;s immensely hard for lawmakers to divert funding to NSF versus e.g. defense. One thing arXiv needs is high-quality bandwidth and Google &#x2F; Facebook have tons of that. Taxpayers are already paying tons for Google&#x27;s several anti-trust trials, no need waste NSF budget for something industry can very very easily solve. reply perihelions 10 hours agoparentSeems a reasonable use of NSF money to me, to promote sciences by creating a common infrastructure for organizing the world&#x27;s library of preprints.

Not random FAANG&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d want to anyway—what they&#x27;d get out of it.FAANG&#x27;s aren&#x27;t charities; anything they do that looks philanthropic is some kind of trap. reply choppaface 10 hours agorootparentI’m not saying it isn’t a bad use of NSF funds, I’m saying that especially in the AI space that industry use of arXiv is large enough that taxpayers deserve to have industry foot the bill. reply perihelions 0 minutes agorootparentBut I think you have it backwards: public infrastructure exists to make it easy for industry to thrive, to create low-friction business environments.

If you&#x27;re okay with shitty internet access that you can&#x27;t even have a quality video call, you can save $50&#x2F;month. etc. If you breathe mold all day, you can save $50&#x2F;month. If you move all your stuff with muscles and no moving companies, you can save $200&#x2F;month. But then you&#x27;re not having a middle class life. reply BeetleB 10 hours agorootparent> Most people pay more than they think they pay.Sorry buddy. I track my finances - since 2007. I rarely look at them, but I have all the data for me. And I&#x27;m not frugal.Do you have yours?> For example they think they pay 2K&#x2F;mo in rent but that easily blows up to 4K after hidden costs that aren&#x27;t on the sticker price of the lease.This may drive you nuts, but in every place I&#x27;ve rented, I&#x27;ve never paid water, trash, sewage or parking. And I did not seek out these places. I know places do charge for these, but they are locale dependent. In a number of apartments I didn&#x27;t pay for heat either.Moving costs? Only paid them once. Otherwise just moved with friends, or had the company pay. OK, I did have to pay U-Haul. You got me there.No hidden fees. Sorry.As I said, there&#x27;s a whole country you haven&#x27;t seen. reply therealrootuser 9 hours agorootparentprev> UtilitiesMy landlord charges me $60&#x2F;month for water&#x2F;sewer. I pay about $120 for electric and gas combined most months. This is in an area of the country where it gets above 100F in the summer and can easily dip below 15F in the winter.> moving costsStop moving so much? I know very few middle class people that would pay a moving company. Renting a truck and loading it yourself, or using one of the several pod type services is the norm for most middle classers. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t qualify this as rent. A moving company is a luxury purchase. Ideally if you have to move for work, your company would pay for this if needed.> taxEh? There is no tax on rent. Your landlord doubtless has to pay property tax, but they would have to make that up via the rent.> extra months of rent you have to pay because of stupid 12 month lease systemsOnce again, stop moving so much. A lease is a protection against your landlord raising the rent on you. If you don&#x27;t like it, then go month-to-month and pay more.> pest control, mold controlDepends on the state, but landlords are generally legally responsible for mold. It sounds like you had a specific issue with mold, because you keep talking about mold problems. There is almost always an underlying cause of mold that should be dealt with directly.> cleaning costsI do not expect my landlord to clean my toilet. If you are hiring a maid, you are by definition not middle class anymore. Middle class people scrub their own toilets. No, really, they do. Well, some of them don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s a different problem.> pests and bedbug-ridden furnitureI&#x27;m not okay with pests, and my total furniture cost did not come close to doubling my rent. I also don&#x27;t buy new furniture every year, and I&#x27;m okay with using a bookshelf that is 5 years old.Most middle class people are not frequently purchasing new furniture, and if they are, they are going into debt really fast.> moldAgain with the mold. We&#x27;re not all breathing in mold, okay? Paying $50&#x2F;month for \"mold\" makes no sense. How much bleach are you buying with that? It sounds like you have a water leak.> shitty internet accessSure, get good internet, but that&#x27;s still not going to double your costs.> no moving companiesYeah, that is how middle class people move. We rent a truck or a pod thing and ask nicely for our family and friends to help load the coaches. If you&#x27;re moving for work, the company gives you a signing bonus to pay for moving costs. Once again, stop moving so much.Adding everything up in your post, I suspect you live in a very high cost of living area with a limited amount of old generally poor quality housing stock in a humid area (mold mold mold), probably the Bay Area. If you choose to live in the Bay, then your experience has very little correlation with what the rest of the country is like.At any rate, if you earn $500k&#x2F;year, then you are by definition not middle class. That&#x27;s probably why most middle-class people don&#x27;t live in the Bay. reply jsyang00 10 hours agorootparentprevYour medical bills probably are really high if you are spending >$5k on food a month... reply therealrootuser 9 hours agorootparentMost underrated comment. reply Aaronstotle 10 hours agorootparentprevI found it truly incredulous that you are trying to defend the position that $500k a year salary is middle class. reply tpmx 10 hours agorootparentprevThis needs to be turned into a tshirt print:You can&#x27;t live a \"normal\" life of the standards of 20 years ago with less than $500K+ in salary. reply hatthew 10 hours agorootparentprevNot sure I agree that that&#x27;s middle class levels of expense. If you&#x27;re living a \"normal\" life, and for the sake of the example you start with $500k per year, my estimates are $300k after taxes, $290k after medical&#x2F;insurance, $240k after rent&#x2F;mortgage, $220k after food, $200k after transportation. IMO $50k for rent&#x2F;mortgage is the only vaguely plausible number you have. reply dheera 10 hours agorootparentConsidering:- health insurance rarely pays for what they do, balance bill you several thousands of dollars every time you have a regular check up for an incurable health issue, and it often requires legal notices and lots of lost work hours on the phone with debt collectors, insurance, hospitals- rent figures don&#x27;t include my $200 electric bill, $200 water bill, $70 internet bill that comcast decided to charge me $170 last month out of nowhere, $50 trash bill, another $200 in maintainence just to keep the place livable because the landlord won&#x27;t do it for you- transportation isn&#x27;t cheap. a rock hit the bottom of my car last month on the highway and it cost $700 to repair. tires wore out and that costs $1000.

I pay a sixth of what you do to the DMV, and half what you pay for insurance (and I have more than the bare minimum). Repairs? Yeah, sometimes I have to pay a lot. But something on the order of $700 for a single repair is one of those \"once every 3-4 years\" things for me, for 2 cars. reply dheera 10 hours agorootparent> Despite what the news will tell you, most SW engineers don&#x27;t deal with this. In over a decade of working, with lots of interactions with the medical system, not one of these has manifested for me nor for my friends.I&#x27;m a software engineer, and I dealt with this multiple times a year until I joined a big corp. In all my years of startup life it was the norm to constantly battle the system and have several thousand dollar medical bills thrown at me all the time even though I had insurance. I don&#x27;t actually talk about it a lot, because there&#x27;s nobody to talk to who will actually fix the system, short of moving to another country. As I understand it, this is the state of \"21st century life in the US\".At a big corp, things are different, insurances are shit scared of big corp HR ditching their policy so they pay for everything. reply BeetleB 10 hours agorootparentI mean this with the utmost sincerity: Get better insurance. Or work in a company with good contracts with insurance companies. Like probably any Fortune 500 company.(Either that or understand your insurance better). reply dheera 10 hours agorootparent> Get better insuranceBack when I was a contractor I was on $850&#x2F;month insurance and they paid for almost nothing. Deductible was $6K and even after that they paid for almost nothing.Maybe $1600&#x2F;month+ insurance would pay for something, but then it&#x27;s questionable whether it&#x27;s a good deal.None of the marketplace plans covered the only couple of medical institutions in my area I trusted to give me a life-saving medical implant for a condition not well understood. reply BeetleB 9 hours agorootparentThat sucks. I can believe if you have a tough medical condition then there&#x27;s no limit to how expensive life can be :-(And yes, marketplace insurance is poor. I get paid a fraction of $500K and the deductible for the whole family is under $4K. Max out of pocket is about $5K, but we never hit it. I don&#x27;t pay any premiums. If I were single, it would be much cheaper - I mostly pay for the dependents. Big companies negotiate good deals, and they&#x27;ll often have employees who will act as your advocate for weird billing problems. Insurance companies don&#x27;t want to upset a big client.Sad fact of life in the US that one of the reasons people cling to soul sucking jobs is this - even when they have enough money to retire (but still too young for Medicare). replyecshafer 8 hours agorootparentprevArxiv is run by Cornell, which is in Ithaca NY. Upstate NY a $500k a year salary would literally buy you a mansion. Ithaca right by the college is pretty expensive by upstate standards because of houses being converted to multi-family units to rent. But Ithaca for $500k is buying you a big house walking distance to downtown, if you go out of the city $500k is buying you a big house with a large amount of land. reply njbooher 10 hours agorootparentprevMost people don&#x27;t live in California. reply abhayhegde 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m appalled at the perspective of middle class for you.

Sarp here, author of the Build your own BitTorrent challenge on Codecrafters.Some back story: After being laid off from my FAANG job, I found myself very unmotivated to go back. I started looking for interesting programming projects to revive my interest in coding. While nomading, I discovered Codecrafters on Nomadlist and really liked the push code to git and pass different stages interaction. The gamification helped me focus and projects allowed me to go deeper on software I used (SQLite, Git, Redis etc.). I even picked up a new language (Go) to do the challenges with. After completing all the challenges on the site, I ran out of things to do. This is when I decided to build a BitTorrent client which was one of the highly voted ideas on the site.I learned many new things by building a BitTorrent client: the BitTorrent protocol, how torrent files are structured, encoding issues, pipelining network requests, url encoding binary values, using Channels in Go etc.I’d love any feedback on the challenge. Also happy to answer any questions! reply friend_and_foe 8 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve actually just begun work on a project involving bittorrent, I don&#x27;t think I will be implementing a client but maybe, I&#x27;m certainly going to have to implement generation of .torrent files and magnet links, so I&#x27;ve been learning a little bit about the protocol. Interesting to see this pop up and maybe I can use it to help me make headway. reply andnand 13 hours agoparentprevHow did you learn to build a BitTorrent client? I love the idea of codecrafters and books that walk you through building something but I always struggle if I don&#x27;t have something to get me started. reply sarp 13 hours agorootparentMy starting point was searching for tutorials and asking ChatGPT to implement a torrent parser :) There are great blog posts [0] for building a BitTorrent client. Along the way, I referenced open-source implementations and the BitTorrent Protocol Specification as well [1].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jse.li&#x2F;posts&#x2F;torrent&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bittorrent.org&#x2F;beps&#x2F;bep_0003.html reply anjel 17 hours agoparentprevIts not uncommon for invite-only trackers to be very prescriptive about which torrent clients can and can&#x27;t be used with their private tracker. Any ideas on how to overcome this obstacle to wider adoption? reply vincentkriek 15 hours agorootparentIs this something you expect to use as your main torrent client? reply CamperBob2 15 hours agorootparentprevHow do they tell one client from another? reply thedaly 15 hours agorootparentUser agents, fingerprinting, etc. There are certainly ways to mask your client, but these would be considered cheating by most private trackers and would be grounds for a ban. reply paledot 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a whole ton of bluster in the torrent community. Bittorrent is a simple protocol, to the point of being naive (and therefore a fun toy network app project). Clients identify themselves to the tracker by user agent; there&#x27;s really nothing else to fingerprint against. Claims to the contrary are almost certainly bullshit to scare people out of editing their user agent.Clients also self-report the amount of data transferred. That&#x27;s not great in a community that fetishizes share ratios. I&#x27;ve heard an op say \"there&#x27;s no excuse for having a ratio less than 1\", which makes as much mathematical sense as the parent who told my (math) teacher friend \"this is [private school], no student should be below average\".You can theoretically verify upload&#x2F;download numbers because the total amount uploaded in a swarm should equal the total amount downloaded, but there are all kinds of reasons why the numbers wouldn&#x27;t match. Maybe a client lost connection and couldn&#x27;t send its final announce. Maybe one client is sending bad data (I&#x27;m not sure how that is reported, might be implementation specific). And clients only send transfer total updates when they connect to the tracker to change status or request more peers, so every client will have a different degree of staleness.Even if you can tell that someone in a swarm is lying, who is your culprit? As long as they&#x27;re not being egregious, there&#x27;s no way to tell. reply mu5tach3 12 hours agorootparent> \"there&#x27;s no excuse for having a ratio less than 1\"Maybe the context of the quote was in regard to a private tracker?The \"ratio\" in terms of private trackers isn&#x27;t always the real ratio of GBs uploaded or downloaded.There are for example some private trackers that grant additional credit for longer seed-time or they declare specific torrents \"freeleech\" so they don&#x27;t \"cost\" ratio.In the end they are just some of the measures private trackers take to strengthen their network, but they lead to a confusing definition of \"ratio\". reply paledot 11 hours agorootparentYes, but this tracker did not offer any such things. The only reason the mean ratio of active members was > 1 was because of the steady stream of users being banned for low ratios. reply Bu9818 11 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s at least some differences, such as HTTP&#x2F;2 usage, or maybe algorithm usage&#x2F;bugs in newer versions. Whether or not most tracker staff actually bother to attempt fingerprinting, IDK. replyollien 11 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know if this is feedback on the challenge per-se, but I was a little saddened that I couldn&#x27;t add dependencies to my `Cargo.toml`; I wanted to solve part of the bencode challenge using nom (perhaps overkill, but it was for fun), but I can&#x27;t.If this is a concern of load&#x2F;execution times on a remote builder, it would be cool if I had some way to run the testcases locally to avoid this concern reply rohitpaulk 10 hours agorootparentWe just shipped support for this last week!

I&#x27;m excited to watch this. Do you happen to know why captions aren&#x27;t enabled on your videos? Oftentimes the issue is that the video&#x27;s primary language isn&#x27;t set. Once this is done, youtube will probably caption the rest, though I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true of videos of all lengths. reply Jonhoo 15 hours agorootparentHope you enjoy it! I have captions \"enabled\" (and primary language set) on all my videos, but my experience has been that YouTube is very hit-or-miss with whether it adds auto-caption to longer videos (somewhere around 2h seems to be the limit). Sometimes it appears later, it just takes a while, other times it just never manifests.

Up to \"peer handshake\" most things look fine. From there it rushes towards a half-finished goal and if people stop there you&#x27;re leaving the internet littered with one-sided examples.After the handshake you&#x27;ll need state machines to handle multiple peers, piece-sets to track what you&#x27;ve downloaded, the rarest-first algorithm[0], message processing and so on.

When downloading via torrent it takes a while to really ramp up in speed. With a centralized repository you can start downloading basically right away. For many small files the latency is more important than the bandwidth, given that most repositories are not short on bandwitdth. reply strangesmells02 18 hours agorootparentThat seems easy to work around. You could write it in such a way that it would have a live cache of peers ready to go plus also the centralized peers would always be available.I personally suspect that having centralized repos is a legacy technology from pre-torrent days when also disk wasnt cheap. reply kortilla 19 hours agorootparentprevPicking a peer you have good bandwidth to is a hard problem. reply Avamander 21 hours agorootparentprevThough with webseeds it shouldn&#x27;t matter that much, not to add redundancy with BT. reply the8472 20 hours agoparentprevBittorrent is most useful as a long-running application or background service to make data available.

If you choose not to pay, you can only complete one step per day, even if you submit code which would pass future steps.This can be quite frustrating, since each step is often very simple, and IMO discourages producing a well-architected solution which anticipates future requirements, as you&#x27;re left waiting 24 hours to press the submit button for code you&#x27;ve already written.Still: It&#x27;s free, and the restricted progress forced me to not use it for procrastination purposes, so there&#x27;s that. reply linhns 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s better for me this way, having things broken down to piecemeal level like this allow me to avoid overthinking and know when to just produce a solution and accept it. reply sarupbanskota 19 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s also this repo if you&#x27;re keen on free resources: github.com&#x2F;codecrafters-io&#x2F;build-your-own-x reply Mikhail_Edoshin 20 hours agorootparentprevDo submissions have deadlines? reply sarupbanskota 19 hours agorootparentNo deadlines! reply Daffodils 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that option is there anymore.Started the build-your-own-git tutorial and there is a hard paywall after the 3rd stage. reply shp0ngle 21 hours agoparentprevThey have some free tier and paid tier and I am not sure what is in what.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecrafters.io&#x2F;pricing reply orng 20 hours agorootparentLike GP I was also confused and tried looking for a pricing page but failed.

Anna Denisova / Getty Images By analyzing fossilized dental plaque, scientists have found new evidence that early Europeans ate seaweed and other aquatic plants. Today, dental hygienists diligently scrape plaque and tartar off our teeth during regular cleanings. But before modern dentisty, this debris simply built up on early humans’ teeth and gums. Fortunately for archaeologists, some of that plaque has survived for thousands of years. In a study published this week in the journal Nature Communications, researchers analyzed samples of preserved dental plaque from the remains of 74 early humans unearthed at 28 European archaeological sites. Some of the teeth were around 2,000 years old, while others were more than 8,000 years old, reports CNN’s Katie Hunt. They found the chemical biomarkers of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples, which suggests that early humans were eating—or, at the very least, chewing—these bounties from the sea. More specifically, they detected red, green and brown seaweed, as well as pondweed and a relative of the water lily. The results indicate humans were eating aquatic plants as early as the Mesolithic period, through the Neolithic period and into the early Middle Ages. That timespan is significant, as archaeologists had long assumed that the introduction of farming during the Neolithic era meant that early humans largely abandoned such foods from the sea, according to a statement from the researchers. Additionally, aquatic plants weren’t only a coastal menu specialty. The researchers also found evidence in teeth from a site in southeast Spain located nearly 50 miles from the water. How early humans prepared these aquatic plants is unclear—did they eat them raw or cook them? Scientists also don’t know how much of their diets consisted of aquatic plants, as the biomarkers of other types of plants “tend to survive less well in archaeological contexts compared to algae,” study co-author Stephen Buckley, an archaeologist at England’s University of York, tells CNN. “We don’t necessarily get a full picture of all foods consumed, which can depend on prevailing environmental conditions,” he adds. The team thinks early humans may have understood the nutritional benefits of seaweed and aquatic plants—just as we do now. These days, seaweed has been called a “superfood,” thanks to its abundance, rapid growth and vitamin and mineral content. “Seaweed is great,” says study co-author Karen Hardy, an archaeologist at the University of Glasgow, to New Scientist’s Chen Ly. “It’s available, it’s nutritious, it’s local, it’s renewable.” It’s also environmentally friendly and may help halt human-caused climate change by “absorbing carbon emissions, regenerating marine ecosystems, creating biofuel and renewable plastics as well as generating marine protein,” as Time’s Mélissa Godin wrote in 2020. The researchers hope their findings will encourage more people to start adding seaweed and aquatic plants to their diets. “It would be a wonderful thing to think that people actually connected in and thought, ‘Well, if we ate it before, we can start eating it again,’” Hardy tells the Guardian’s Nicola Davis.

Used to be quite cheap for a bag. Very salty but quite edible and said to be nutrient-dense. reply AlecSchueler 16 hours agoparentHaha, I clicked on comment to be the token Northern Irishman bringing this up, but you beat me to it!I didn&#x27;t know seaweed wasn&#x27;t a common food until I moved to the Netherlands and started enquiring about the local seaweed, only to be met with blank looks or people pointing me to the sushi nori at Albert Heijn.I&#x27;ve been here for years and I still don&#x27;t understand how such a seafaring nation with such an intimate connection with the coast line could lack a seaweed culture.Until I saw this article I was starting to think seaweed was unique to rockier island coastlines, but I guess it just comes down to taste&#x2F;fashion?After all, you can sail the seven seas as pillage the world of all its spices, but nothing compares to a broodje kaas!

Hard to build underground cold storage as well in case of flooding or just a high water table. Cheese will save us all. reply AlecSchueler 14 hours agorootparentThat makes a lot of sense actually, thanks for the insight! I guess that kind of chimes with the Dutch passion for preservation as well, with the salted herring etc. Anything you can preserve you can sell further afield as well!You also reminded me of something I heard on the great History of the Netherlands podcast from the University of Amsterdam. Apparently back in the day in Friesland they would tether their cows to something and let them float when the regular flooding came.But speaking of the flooding: I can see how that would be bad for other kinds of crops, but surely seaweed would actually be pretty notable for dealing well water?

People in Europe could and did farm seaweed, but with the technology of the mid 19th century it was not possible to do so in a mechanized way, while they did have the technology to produce grains, get wild fish, and farm animals in a mechanized way. The double whammy is that as populations grew and the amount of available foraged&#x2F;small-scale-farmed seaweed per person decreased, seaweed culturally lost relevance and importance in people’s diets.Because Asia industrialized later, they had access to eg plastics and efficient diesel engine boats to make farming seaweed easier.

And yes, they would also go to the local shop to buy tea, sugar, cloth, shoes, materials to repair everything, coal etc. Pots and pans were handed down through generations or given as wedding gifts.

But that steak is cheap because of hyperprocessing of off cuts seems more contentious - I&#x27;m fairly sure we&#x27;re able to more cheaply raise, slaughter and butcher cows in general, and the beef industry would still find a way to be profitable even if offal etc. was still widely consumed in unprocessed form.

A few millennia before the Indo-Europeans was the farming expansion out of Anatolia, and that already had a dramatic impact on the ethnic landscape in Europe.

Clearly foraged foods lived on, but genetics has shown us that pre-agricultural, hunter gatherer Europeans were very genetically quite distinct from post-agricultural (and post Indo-European migration) populations, and we know that they were not Indo-European speakers, too. So it&#x27;s also quite likely their cultures were lost and along with them at least some of the foods they ate.Which is not to say that people living in these places didn&#x27;t continue to eat seaweed, because they did. reply pfannkuchen 18 hours agoparentprevOn top of that, the creation of agriculture was almost certainly extremely granular. There is a spectrum of foraging to farming. You go out in the forest and take some fruits back. Some of the discarded fruit seeds end up growing trees near your settlement. Someone eventually realizes that having fruit trees close by is really convenient, and they start planting seeds intentionally. This was probably done for a very, very long time without it being the dominant source of food. reply cmrdporcupine 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s actually not clear at all that this is the case in Western Europe. Agriculture came with sweeping genetic and archaeological changes. There&#x27;s quite a bit of evidence for population replacement in large parts of Europe as agriculture moved in, rather than existing hunter gatherers adopting farming.If you look at the more recent history of the agricultural settlement of other parts of the world, it&#x27;s not too different. North America the most recent, but parts of Africa as well. Hunter gatherers have low population densities over often very large territories, and are sensitive to disruptions in animal migrations; but when they&#x27;re able to forage and hunt reliably their diets are actually often much better than agricultural populations and involve less overall labour. So they don&#x27;t necessarily just give it up because somehow agriculture is better.... and even the proto-Indo-European pastoralists of the steppe continued to forage wild grains and plants (rather than plant wheat like their neighbours to the west) for almost a millennia after domesticating horses and cattle. David Anthony gets into this in \"Horse, Wheel, Language\". And it wasn&#x27;t because they didn&#x27;t know how, they just preferred not to. Settling down to plant crops has trade-offs.

    "originBody": "Nota Examples Playground Reference Integration Nota is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts. The goal of Nota is to bring documents into the 21st century. Documents contain a lot of structure — for example, \"Nota\" is a reference to a term defined in the preceding paragraph. Nota enables authors to represent that structure, which allows the reading medium (the browser) to understand that structure, which in turn empowers readers to use that structure. Try clicking on any \"Nota\" reference to see this idea in action. (Then try double-clicking!) A Nota document compiles to a JavaScript program, meaning it's easy to: View documents on any device that has a web browser. Use variables, functions, and data structures to simplify document writing. Integrate with JavaScript libraries like KaTeX, Vega-Lite, and Penrose. Support accessibility needs like screen readers.

You need NodeJS ≥ 16 and npm ≥ 6. The NodeJS global binary directory must be on your shell's PATH, e.g. by running 1 export PATH=\"$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH\" Then you can build a single Nota document by running these shell commands: 1 2 3 4 npm install --global @nota-lang/nota echo \"@Title: Hello world\" > index.nota nota build index.nota open dist/index.html You can interactively edit a Nota file by running the Nota editor, like so: 1 nota edit index.nota To learn more about how to write Nota documents, you can read through the Reference. To add Nota to your website or to learn more about Nota's architecture, read the Integration guide. Nota is a new and evolving technology. The architecture and API are continually changing. Tooling will have bugs and missing features. Documentation will be incomplete or incorrect. Right now, I am seeking early adopters that want to help make Nota the document language of the future. 2 Why Nota? There are two main mediums for digital documents: PDFs and web pages. PDFs were designed to mirror physical documents, so they impose the real-world constraints of paper: page breaks, fixed width, and immutable styling. Web pages, by contrast, provides an essential dynamism. Web pages can be dynamically formatted: resized for phones, translated into other languages, colors changed for color-blindness. Web pages can be dynamically interactive: text prompted for more context, diagrams shifted for a new perspective, annotations added for posterity. Web pages are undeniably the future of digital documents. But currently, that dynamism is only accessible to professional web developers. Existing document tools like LaTeX, Pandoc, Markdown, and Scribble can (for the most part) only generate static web pages. Nota's goal is to bridge that gap by providing authors with a document language that has a low floor, a high ceiling, and a smooth ramp up. Part of this design is identifying components that are easy to use for authors and have high impact for the reader. For instance, the @Definition and @Ref components in the example above require a small amount of document annotation on the author's part. Then the Nota runtime can provide features like presenting a reference's definition in context via tooltip. Future Nota versions could include more advanced features like find all references to this definition. For more on this design philosophy, you can read my original paper \"A New Medium for Communicating Research on Programming Languages\".",

A high-level comment:After developing the initial prototype you see in the webpage, I&#x27;ve since gone back to the drawing board. I&#x27;m working on developing a firmer foundation for issues like:- How do you interleave content and computation? See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.04368- How do different syntaxes make different document tasks easy, hard, or impossible? See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cognitive-engineering-lab&#x2F;doclang-benchma...I still very much believe in the high-level philosophy, but Nota will look very different within ~6 months. In the meantime, the single coolest development in the document language space is Typst, which I encourage you to check out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typst.app&#x2F;Also: the next version of Nota will be written 99% in Rust :-) reply manxman 4 hours agoparentJust my two cents -Not sure the language you choose matters as much as making the API usable by a wide audience. Sure if performance is a real issue then rust makes more sense than JS but I’m not sure that’s going to be hugely meaningful in most use cases.I’ve never been a fan of Latex despite writing some mammoth documents over the years. Latex always felt like a beast for academics not for business. Yet there’s often things I wanted to do consistently in Word etc. that have never been easy.Styles can easily become a muddle. Having consistent numbering and bulleting is a pain and errors can easily creep in.Tracking changes becomes a real problem when you get into many revisions and that often always ends up relying on a level of trust between parties to not override the tracking. I think there’s a killer app in just fixing this issue with a product that guarantees that guarantees all changes are properly shown from the start of a process to it being fully approved by all parties. Businesses, lawyers etc would love that stuff. Heck if you sprinkle blockchain in you might even get easy funding but I think it’s more of a basic cryptography thing than a blockchain thing - at least it doesn’t need that level of complexity. reply celim307 3 hours agorootparentSurprised more legal docs aren’t tracked like git, with pull requests reply manxman 3 hours agorootparentCause git ain’t user friendly enough for lawyers and they use word not a plain text editor which doesnt make it easy to see the diffs. But yes ;) reply SanderNL 2 hours agorootparentStyle and substance separation is easy and should be a requirement. Legal is pure text \"programming\" and what I mean is that the style of the text has zero bearing on the judicial process.The benefits of working at the proper level of abstraction compound. It enables tech like diffs and git, which then nicely solves a bunch of other problems as well. Using Word completely side-steps all those benefits. Sure, you get a few nice buttons, but that&#x27;s literally it. You are trapped forever with no way forward.This feels like actually programming in Word and manually highlighting comments to be green or something. It&#x27;s a travesty IMO. reply Propelloni 1 hour agorootparentOf course this isn&#x27;t and hasn&#x27;t been true for quite some time. I&#x27;m the first to blast MS Word for being a total disaster (esp. templates, ie. style&#x2F;substance separation, are bad) but it is no longer a locked-in platform. Even the docx format is only a zipped XML file. If you want, you can unpack the document file and put it into git. Thank you Open Document Foundation!On top of that, all contemporary word processors I&#x27;m aware of have, of course, versioning with diffs. It is just different than git (or other programmer tools.) Just as you are using your tools of your trade and don&#x27;t know much about MS Word, lawyers use their tools of their trade and don&#x27;t know much about git. It&#x27;s like saying that editing POs is superior to Trados, because for a programmer it is but a professional translator is going to tell you a different story.(Of course, everybody everywhere should be using LaTeX for fine-looking documents in all circumstances. No argument here ;)) reply manxman 1 hour agorootparentprevYou are correct. But this is a culture issue. Culturally legal folk don’t see what they do as programming so they use different tools and work their processes their way. This is advantageous to outsiders who see through this! ;) reply esquivalience 2 hours agorootparentprevI think markdown might be the solution here. reply kwhitefoot 1 hour agorootparentWe used to have word processors that exposed mark up.

Much more “gimme what I ask for” than being super academic about subsubsubsubheaders. reply dash2 3 hours agoparentprevCan I make a simple point?As an academic, 99% of my time is spent doing two things:1. Writing statistical computations using a language like R or python.2. Writing English text.The most important thing about a document language is that it should prioritize those things. For example, here&#x27;s why Rmarkdown&#x2F;Quarto is better than TeX. A TeX document starts: \\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{amsthm} \\usepackage{geometry} \\usepackage{enumitem} \\setitemize{noitemsep} \\usepackage{tabularx} \\usepackage{setspace} \\newcolumntype{x}{>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}X} \\newtheorem{theo}{Theorem} \\newtheorem{prop}[theo]{Proposition} \\newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma} \\usepackage{fontspec,xunicode} \\defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text} \\setsansfont{TeX Gyre Heros}A quarto document starts: --- title: \"Natural selection in the Health and Retirement Study\" author: \"XXX\" abstract:I investigate natural selection on polygenic scores in the contemporary US, using the Health and Retirement Study. Results partially support the economic theory of fertility as an explanation for natural selection: among both white and black respondents, scores which correlate negatively (positively) with education are selected for (against).

If 99% of your documents need the same packages and formatting, then all you need to do in LaTeX is create a template (eg via Yasnippet in Emacs) or dump it all in a LaTeX class file and then import it in your frontmatter, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle. There are many frustrating things about LaTeX but I don&#x27;t see how this is one of them. reply dash2 3 hours agorootparentProbably that&#x27;s true. But first, I don&#x27;t know how to create a class file, or a template (if that is a LaTeX thing). And since I&#x27;ve never seen anyone else do this, I guess that most academics don&#x27;t either.Second, my point isn&#x27;t just about the specific issue, it&#x27;s that this issue reveals how TeX thinks about the world. It thinks you want to spend your time writing TeX. No, I want to spend my time writing English. Here&#x27;s another example. This is how you embed an image in quarto - it&#x27;s just markdown: ![Caption](path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image.png)And here is how you do it in TeX: \\begin{figure}[t] \\includegraphics{path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image} \\centering \\end{figure}Which of these is easier to memorize and to read past? Similar comments apply to tables, links, numbering and so on. reply mr_mitm 2 hours agorootparentI understand your frustration. Maybe it helps to know where this problem comes from.TeX is extremely powerful and lets you create arbitrary documents. This is the first time I heard of quarto, but apparently it makes a lot of choices for you that you understandably don&#x27;t really care about.Instead of developing quarto, one could have simply written a LaTeX class that defines a function like so: \\newcommand{\\image}[2]{\\begin{figure}[t]\\includegraphics{#2}\\caption{#1}\\label{#2}\\centering\\end{figure}}Now you can just write: \\image{caption}{path&#x2F;to&#x2F;image}Of course, it is now much less flexible, as you cannot define a custom label or different placement instructions. But that is the price you pay for short and memorable syntax.By the way, developing a LaTeX class is not necessarily hard. It is more or less a file whose name ends in `.cls` with all the commands that you typically put in your preamble. It just needs a header of three lines that define some meta data and also supports options. See here for an example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;latex-ninja&#x2F;colour-theme-changing-class-t...You put it in the same directory as your main tex file or in the system wide TEXMFHOME or user-specific TEXMHFHOME. reply nanna 31 minutes agorootparentMore on creating your own class file:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.overleaf.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;latex&#x2F;Writing_your_own_packag...How I do it...I keep a directory called LaTeX inside my home directory. Inside that I keep a file with all my frontmatter, myfrontmatter.sty (technically a package rather than a class), and also my biblatex file and a scan of my signature for signing letters. When I start a new LaTeX document I add the line \\usepackage{&#x2F;home&#x2F;nanna&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;myfrontmatter} to the top (note, no .sty). This keeps my frontmatter minimal and tidy.Inside myfrontmatter.sty: \\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e} \\ProvidesPackage{&#x2F;home&#x2F;nanna&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;myfrontmatter}[2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;01 by me] \\RequirePackage{amsmath} % Just replace `usepackage` with `RequirePackage` \\RequirePackage{amsthm} ... \\addbibresource{&#x2F;home&#x2F;nanna&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;biblatex.bib} ... %% Macros like for inserting my signature \\newcommand{\\mysignature}{\\noindent\\includegraphics{&#x2F;home&#x2F;nanna&#x2F;LaTeX&#x2F;signature.png}} ... \\endinput % Not sure if this line does anything?And that&#x27;s it. I never have to worry about a package I&#x27;ve forgotten to add in. Granted a journal might not accept my custom package but I can always just copy and paste it all into my frontmatter, minus the top two lines and replace all the RequirePackages with usepackages. reply xeyownt 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, and with tools like ChatGPT it&#x27;s even easier to write TeX documents.I exposed this very problem and ChatGPT proposed exactly the same solution, and also another one using a custom environment. reply eviks 1 hour agorootparentprev> Instead of developing quarto, one could have simply written a LaTeX class that defines a function like so:If it&#x27;s so simple, why isn&#x27;t there QuarTeX that does all of that and removes the extreme verbosity barrier? reply mr_mitm 29 minutes agorootparentBecause doing something like this is opinionated. The LaTeX developers try to do the opposite: they want to provide packages that cover as many usecases as possible.And users of LaTeX are probably not knowledgeable enough or too busy to publish their opinionated subset of LaTeX as a class. I don&#x27;t know for sure. There is no central body that has an interest in removing barriers, so you might as well ask me or yourself why I or you haven&#x27;t published anything.I developed something similar to this at my company, because we write lots of LaTeX documents and need shortcuts like this not only for brevity but also so that we achieve some consistency across the entire team. It&#x27;s only for internal use though and thus not public. reply cycomanic 1 hour agorootparentprevI can tell you as another academic i almost always get links and images wrong in Markdown (which of title URL is in square which in round brackets, forgetting the !, the conventions around file paths (some Markdown processors need file:&#x2F;&#x2F;...). Admittedly if I would write always one Markdown style I would get used to it, on the other hand I never get it wrong in latex and let&#x27;s not even talk about how to do different alignment, captions and labels. reply bionhoward 10 minutes agorootparentprevMakes me wonder if Nota did work with Rust, then we could move the dependencies into a cargo.toml file and compile our documents. That would enable declarative macros for document generation at compile time as well as interactive rust code inside your document at reading time. Plus you could refer to the dependencies by their package name like amsmath::line or something reply systemEarth 1 hour agorootparentprevYou might be interested in typst. It offers an incremental live compiler. reply bionhoward 15 minutes agoparentprevRust makes tremendous sense for this and I really like your borrowing syntax in Nota. Keep it up.

I still use it for my own writing, although I&#x27;m probably the only one. reply eviks 1 hour agoparentprev> - How do different syntaxes make different document tasks easy, hard, or impossible?That&#x27;s a good idea, would be nice to optimize that instead of sticking to the poor decision of markdown to double asterisks for the more common bold formatting while also wasting another _ symbol in the process reply lencastre 3 hours agoparentprevLooks amazing that typst!! reply dash2 3 hours agorootparentWhat are the similarities and differences between it and quarto? reply SkiFire13 2 hours agorootparentI used typst for some university project and what I really liked about it is that it is as programmable as latex but with a language that&#x27;s much more intuitive (no macro weirdness, but actual functions&#x2F;if&#x2F;loops etc etc). It feels like a better of TeX rather than a different way of writing documents.I haven&#x27;t really used quarto so take this with a grain of salt, but from what I can see it is much more declarative, you just declare the content of your document and pick a template to show it. It feels simplier, but at the same time what if I need to customize something here and there? Looks like there are extensions that can be programmed, but they are more like second class citizens that you are not suppose to use normally. reply Uptrenda 3 hours agoparentprev>Also: the next version of Nota will be written 99% in Rust :-)Cringed. ty reply nologic01 30 minutes agoprevThe problem with any new initiative in this space is that it enters a field that is more than well populated. It doesn&#x27;t matter if existing solutions are less than perfect.Its like walking into a historic European city that has architecture going back millennia and arguing for a great new building design. Greenfield space is scarce and people will not just demolish old structures to try something new. They need to sense overwhelming advantage.The analogy gives some hints as to what needs to happen for a new approach to take hold. In building construction, massively better use of space was one example: For better or worse, use of steel and reinforced concrete opened the vertical dimension and the rest is history.Is there such an unexplored dimension that could entice people into yet another document format to \"improve\" on ascii, restructuredText, wikitext, markdown, tex&#x2F;latex, asciidoc, html etc. etc.?The stock answer is some sort of semantic hypertext infrastructure. The original vision is still unfulfilled. If we assume that the walled gardens of today are just a bad nightmare that will pass away, in a re-decentralized web one would need modern, user-friendly and empowering document writing infrastructure.But there might be other dimensions that would elevate document writing and sharing to new heights. The beauty of innovation is that it is not bound by conventional rules and pre-existing wisdom. reply jxf 7 hours agoprev> There are two main mediums for digital documents: PDFs and web pages.

Dynamism is great for web _apps_, but it&#x27;s the last thing I want in a document reply anon35 6 hours agorootparentOK but then what is the thing in the middle, between documents and applications?There are fantastic, beautiful interactive experiences (for lack of a better word) that are obviously not documents (they can&#x27;t be represented on paper, there is code running) but they&#x27;re not really applications, either (they are fully offline, self-contained, state that&#x27;s only evident on the page).But they are, universally: dynamic.Examples: - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ciechanow.ski&#x2F;mechanical-watch&#x2F; - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;TenBrighterIdeas&#x2F; - even : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neal.fun&#x2F;space-elevator&#x2F;This is what I think the future of textbooks and presentations should be. But I think part of the problem is that not only do we not have tools geared toward creating them, we don&#x27;t even have a name for these things. If we say \"document\", they flunk the pdf test. If we say \"web application\", they are lumped into the same lumbering category as office docs and enterprise software.Maybe Nota is a step in the right direction. But it&#x27;d be an even better step if it didn&#x27;t call itself \"21st century documents\", if for no other reason than to defend against the valid criticism you levied against it. reply function_seven 4 hours agorootparentWhen I was a kid, we called it \"multimedia\". Encarta being the example that comes to mind. My school library had some other interactive encyclopedia that came on a 6–CD-ROM magazine changer (the Pioneer style, if you remember music CD changers). I remember being absolutely flabbergasted at the sheer amount of megabytes sitting in that unassuming disc magazine.That term is really quaint these days, and it doesn&#x27;t fully capture what you&#x27;re talking about. IIRC, it was more prepackaged animations, photos, video, and music; rather than \"dynamic code running on paper\"\"Dynagraph\"? Sorry, that&#x27;s lame, but there&#x27;s my entry. reply DistractionRect 5 hours agorootparentprevHa, I was totally thinking about the watch blog too!I think that one is rather a special case. You could print it out with the first still of each bit and probably get out 90% of the content&#x2F;context, and modify document to print out a few stills from each interactive part and get the same intellectual content. In it&#x27;s case, the interactivity is superfluous, it&#x27;s there to spark joy. It&#x27;s really an example of a document with outstanding figures&#x2F;visual aid - the interactivity is just a bonus.Similarly, the space elevator could be a picture book&#x2F;pdf. The interactive bits there also spark joy.The tenbrighterideas page mostly annoyed me. It&#x27;s just bastardizing structure to be \"interactive\", which is to say most of the information is hidden away behind a bunch of clicks and it could have been a document, with one page dedicated to each idea. reply MrJohz 3 hours agorootparentI strongly disagree with the idea that the interactive elements are only there to \"spark joy\" - in both of the cases you mentioned, the interactive elements are pretty fundamental. Their purpose is to let you get somewhat hands-on with the concepts the text is discussing - to allow you to take apart the watch yourself, at your own pace, and understand what all the pieces are doing.I&#x27;m sure you can convey the same information in text format (like you say, you could just print out the page), but these particular sites would be a lot weaker, because part of their explanatory power is the interactivity.The original quote was that dynamism was \"the last thing I want in a document\", and I think these interactive diagrams and explainers directly show how useful dynamism can be in conveying information.That&#x27;s not to say that all dynamism is good - I don&#x27;t usually want you to use Javascript to just load a new page, my browser can do that just fine - but every medium can be abused. That doesn&#x27;t mean that medium is bad! reply one-punch 3 hours agorootparentprevSome of these interactive simulations for learning are called “Explorable Explanations” [1], coined in 2011 by Bret Victor, the author of your second link (worrydream.com), which also talks about “Explorable Explanations”.For more examples, see [2].Very much agree that this is what explanations and presentations should be in the modern age. I think a documentation language (what Nota and Typst aim to be) is still needed in this age of Large Language Models, when the ideas are more complex than those expressible by natural languages.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Explorable_explanation[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorabl.es&#x2F; reply esafak 6 hours agorootparentprevDo you object to the interactive Vega widget? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nota-lang.org&#x2F;reference.html#def-section-1.1Reputable scientific journals now post videos online alongside their articles. Interactivity is even better for understanding. But permanence is an issue I suppose. reply DistractionRect 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all bad. Digital augmentation can be handy (love the hell out of document search), but honestly their examples aren&#x27;t compelling.I think accessibility is a major issue, where the text doesn&#x27;t make as much sense without the interactive bits, and often the text itself isn&#x27;t substantial enough to be stand alone.But also, it&#x27;s starting to cross the line between web app and document. I can print out a pdf and I just lose peripheral QoL benefits like document search.

Cf. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Line_length (while we&#x27;re talking about typography, the fonts for body copy and code are mismatched in size in a distracting way)As far as formulas&#x2F;notation is concerned, the notation used in this paper is targeted only at experts in theoretical computer science, approximately the level of advanced grad students or above, who also happen to be pretty familiar with Rust and C++. The gimmicky popups are probably not meaningfully helpful for such an audience, and in my opinion don&#x27;t really make the notation any more accessible to people without the extremely steep prerequisite expertise (e.g. I don&#x27;t think this paper is going to be at all accessible to the vast majority of working programmers or computer science undergraduate students).If you really want to make the paper more accessible, it would be better to focus on reducing the reliance on formulas, reducing the amount of jargon involved, and explaining the concepts and techniques using plain English targeted at a broader audience, rather than trying to add extra colors, click targets, or popups.

Far too much cleverness in macro expansions and weaving tricks to keep memory usage in check for what are now laughable limits.Missing far too many niceties in comparison to modern languages with more guardrails to protect yourself from silly mistakes. The only way I can write Latex is to heavily rely upon \\input{} segments to keep isolated blocks in case I break something through a missed escape.I keep yearning for a modern take, but it feels like we are stuck in a local optimum from which there is no escape. New platform has to fight with the decades of accumulated inertia and packages which exist in Tex. reply abdullahkhalids 6 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of these markup languages. The reason none of them really challenge tex&#x2F;latex in its own space, is that they don&#x27;t aim to do what tex&#x2F;latex does.Latex is \"typographically-complete\". Markdown and friends are explicitly not. HTML+CSS is. But what latex has is a reasonable enough syntax that a human can write it by hand, unlike HTML+CSS. Moreover, the syntax, though clunky [1] is designed, as much as possible, to not interfere with the content that the human is writing.For instance, Latex uses curly brackets {} for macro arguments, because they are least used brackets for content. So when you are reading a latex source, you know that () and [] are content, and only {} are ambiguous [2]. Nota, uses a mix of all three brackets for its syntax, causing additional pain for the person reading&#x2F;writing the source.The replacement for TeX&#x2F;latex is never going to a simpler language. It is going to a language just as complex as latex. But it can definitely be cleaned up and sped up compared to latex. IMHO, somebody should write tex from scratch, improve it&#x27;s syntax but otherwise keep it largely unchanged. Basically, any plain latex source using some of the popular packages should continue to compile and give the same output. That is the only reasonable way out.[1] A typographically-complete language will never have a non-clunky syntax.[2] Escaped brackets \\{1,2,3 \\} are literal curly brackets. Personally, I only use them for mathematical sets and have defined a macro \\set, so in my documents {} are 99% not ambiguous. reply DemocracyFTW2 35 minutes agorootparent> what latex has is a reasonable enough syntax that a human can write it by hand, unlike HTML+CSS. Moreover, the syntax, though clunky [1] is designed, as much as possible, to not interfere with the content that the human is writingI could not disagree more. LaTeX syntax is not &#x27;clunky&#x27;, it&#x27;s a mess, and has intentionally been engineered right from the start to be clever rather than consistent. And it&#x27;s not the syntax only, the obvious mess that is LaTeX&#x27;s surface goes right on, right to the heart (\"the guts\" as TeXnicians prefer to say) of the machinery, where no concern is dealt with separately, and anything can influence and break everything else.Hell you don&#x27;t even get a semblance of sane text (string) processing or decent numerical computation. Yes, you can do it, in the way you could use a toothbrush or wet wipes to paint your house.> Latex is \"typographically-complete\"Yes as long as one is ready to ignore the fact that quite a few simple things are quite difficult to achieve in LaTeX, e.g. keeping lines the same height and keep register instead of jumping around whenever a superscript is encountered.> The replacement for TeX&#x2F;latex is never going to a simpler language. It is going to a language just as complex as latex.The complexity of LaTeX is just in part due to the complexities of typesetting. It is complex because of an endless litany of bad design choices. HTML+CSS+JS gets a lot of flak for being too complex, but they pale in comparison. For example[1]:In order to use numerical codepoints to write 東京, you can write any of: ^^^^6771 ^^^^4eac \\char\"6771 \\char\"4EACThe space between the entities is used to signal the end of the codepoint number, hence to write 東 京 with a space you must use tricks, one of \\char\"6771{} \\char\"4EAC \\char\"6771\\ \\char\"4EACIn this system, ^^5c represents the backslash. But, unlike reasonable systems which TeX is not one of, using numerical reference doesn&#x27;t deactivate the backslash&#x27;s special role as command indicator.Compare this to XML &#x2F; HTML &#x6771;&#x4eac; which is a much more reasonable syntax, not any harder to write, and uses an explicit end-of-command marker instead of the &#x27;clever&#x27; space which is highly problematic.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agiletribe.wordpress.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;adding-unicode-c... reply troymc 6 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s a modern take: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typst.app&#x2F; reply CJefferson 6 hours agorootparentFor me, there is one fundamental issue which makes me want to switch from LaTeX -- it can&#x27;t produce accessible documents (and good HTML would do just fine as accessible).

Equity is below every creditor and has been completely wiped out. Companies are not allowed to take cash or sell the furniture to pay out employees. That money is legally owed to creditors and attempting to stiff them is theft. I&#x27;m sorry to those affected at Convoy, but that is the reality of working at a startup that goes through a hasty liquidation. Convoy is not being \"cheap\" about this, as some are suggesting. Any \"retention bonuses\" are to keep executives around for long enough to unwind the company in an orderly fashion. Nobody is getting rich off failure; if everyone were to walk away there&#x27;d be nothing left and therefore nothing to recover and distribute. It&#x27;s bad for everyone, but the alternative is worse.As for the larger situation: Convoy were a digital freight brokerage. They acted as intermediaries between shippers and carriers and make money on the spread between the two. They got into trouble because the entire freight sector has been suffering a double whammy of cost increases due to inflation (ie. diesel costs) and a slowdown in demand. This has caused a number of carriers and brokerages to go bust. Freight brokerage has some other properties that make Convoy&#x27;s situation particularly serious. In particular, carriers typically securitize their accounts receivable. In freight, this is known as \"factoring.\" Convoy got stuck holding the bag after their partner carriers went under, having already paid them for their service, but still waiting for payment from the shipper.Worst of all, Convoy had no exits because their only potential acquirers are in the same industry and are also getting completely crushed. reply HWR_14 5 hours agoparentWhile in general what you are saying is true, employees owed wages are the highest seniority of creditor.

Whereas severance you&#x27;re not an employee and typically paid lump-sum (but doesn&#x27;t matter for this discussion). So in this specific situation, yes, that would be wages and would be paid out first before creditors because you are _legally_ entitled to those wages.The problem of course you cannot hope to put a whole company on \"gardening leave\" in hopes that it can \"act as severance\" for everyone. Your creditors will sue you and easily win. They&#x27;d probably put an emergency injunction on the company and remaining funds before the first month was even completed once they learned of \"creditors hate this one little trick!\"[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Garden_leave reply thaumasiotes 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an unlikely misconception, since paid noncompete periods are not something that most people have ever even heard of. reply hamburglar 25 minutes agorootparentPaid noncompete periods are far from the only reason for gardening leave. reply friendzis 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not the way it is calculated. All payments attached to employment contract are wages, be it regular salary, bonuses, vacation pay or severance.

I’m curious about this last statement however. Just how badly are other players doing?Uber Freight just announced a major overhaul on a foundation apparently provided by their acquisition of Transplace [1]. There seem to be a number of synergies between Convoy and Uber Freight although I may be naive about that. In any case, I’m curious about your view on Uber Freight and whether they are viable or simply playing the long game based on deep capital reserves, and why you think they didn’t acquire Convoy (if that even makes sense as a possibility).1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freightwaves.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uber-freights-new-solution... reply macmccann 2 hours agorootparentUberfreight is also doing very poorly. From my understanding the Transplace acquisition was somewhat of a merger&#x2F;UF trying to get out of only the 3PL business and Uber is just trying to get UF&#x27;s losses off their books. There are not as many synergies as you might think due to the way freight brokerages and their deals with shippers+carriers work. One reason UF didn&#x27;t acquire Convoy: it only makes sense for a brokerage to acquire another brokerage if they can get more customers (shippers) from that acquisition. But most customers of UF are also customers of Convoy, and are splitting their loads amongst multiple brokers to diversify risk and commoditize brokerages. So if you&#x27;re a shipper giving 20% of your business to Convoy and 20% to Uber Freight, you won&#x27;t turn around and give 40% of your business to UF now that they&#x27;ve acquired Convoy, you&#x27;ll just go find another broker to give your business to. reply oldtownroad 8 hours agoparentprevThere’s no obligation to run a company into the ground. If a company reaches a point where the end of its runway is in sight, and the company decides to let employees know that the company will be out of money in 2 months, to give employees time to start looking for options… that’s allowable and not some sort of theft from creditors.Many companies are open with employees about the state of the business.If you have less than 3 months runway and little prospect of any fundraising, tell your employees.

Changing insurers (because you changed jobs) didn&#x27;t reset this period, but having a gap over a certain length did—I believe it was 60 days. So it was very important to make sure you maintained coverage, or else your ongoing cancer&#x2F;arteriosclerosis&#x2F;diabetes&#x2F;etc. treatment was suddenly 100% out of pocket.Also, COBRA and medical insurance in general used to be a much smaller fraction of middle-class take home pay, so it was a lot more realistic to elect to pay it out of savings even if you weren&#x27;t concerned about all the above. reply seltzered_ 14 hours agorootparentprevIt can be a slap but sometimes an employer will discount the COBRA insurance for a period of time. reply codegeek 12 hours agorootparentprevNot only this, COBRA may end up costing you up to 102% of the total premiums. Yes you read that right. Employers can add a 2% fee because they are helping you with COBRA administration (if they do).

It seems purpose built to screw people over. reply andlarry 13 hours agorootparentWe do not have universal single-payer but we have a few very large government-run single-payer systems.If you have an example of a country with a single program that has more effective outcomes for a population of similar makeup and size, that would be a useful comparison. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentA significant administrative cost benefit to single payer is not having to identify the correct payer, do coordination of benefits, etc.With multiple “single-payer” systems in the same population (often serving overlapping populations with each other and private health insurance) you&#x27;ve negated that benefit.You’ve also negated the market power advantage of monopsony purchasing by having multiple of them, and again having them coexist with private health insurance.(And that&#x27;s even before considering that while Medicare and some state Medicaid plans have single payer components, Medicare is not a single-payer plan covering the listed number of beneficiaries, but instead just under half are in the single-payer traditional Medicare, and that Medicaid isn&#x27;t a single payer plan, or even a plan, at all, its a funding mechanism for state-operated plans, each of which may or may not operate entirely as a state-level single-payer plan.) reply hotpotamus 13 hours agorootparentprevI think it would likely be called a non-universal multiple single-payer system if you want to get pedantic about things, but either way given that Americans spend more on healthcare in relative terms while lagging in most health measures makes it all seem very foolish. replytoast0 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think military medical coverage really counts as single payer; it&#x27;s an in-house employer plan, it&#x27;s just that the employer is the federal government. Just because the federal government is paying for it, doesn&#x27;t make it single payer.Re: medicare, I think a reasonable way towards universal single payer (or whatever you call medicare advantage plans, as a sibling notes) would be to drop the eligibility age over many years, and eventually get full coverage; and at the same time, add all kids to medicaid. Ex: years 1-10, reduce medicare eligibity age by 1, have medicaid cover kids less than year number; after ten years, medicare covers you at 55, medicaid covers kids less than 10. Years 11-20, reduce medicare eligibity age by 2, still increase kids by one year per year; after twenty years, medicare covers you at 35, and medicaid covers until 18. Years 21-28?, add medicare one year from both ends, and I think at year 28, everyone is covered. Congress should adjust the rollout schedule regularly, as scaling problems emerge, or don&#x27;t; if after a couple years it becomes obvious that it&#x27;s too slow or too fast, it can be adjusted; it&#x27;d also work, but be more complicated, to do it on a % basis --- once a year, determine what age (years + months even?) would result in a 1% enrollment increase, and do that, you&#x27;ll finish before 100 years, but I&#x27;m not doing the math to figure out how much sooner. reply nevir 15 hours agorootparentprevC̶O̶B̶R̶A̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶d̶a̶t̶o̶r̶y̶,̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶e̶r̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶l̶a̶i̶d̶ ̶o̶f̶f̶ ̶h̶a̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶p̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶i̶t̶…if the company still exists (see comments above and below) reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentOnly if there still is a group health plan to pay for.

Without hyperbole, the 8 hour working day was won with blood. The question needs to be whether you think a strike is right and morally justified, and worth the potential consequences, not whether it is legal. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentLeisure and comforts like the eight hour workday are what economists call a &#x27;normal good&#x27;. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Normal_good> In economics, a normal good is a type of a good which experiences an increase in demand due to an increase in income, unlike inferior goods, for which the opposite is observed. When there is an increase in a person&#x27;s income, for example due to a wage rise, a good for which the demand rises due to the wage increase, is referred as a normal good. Conversely, the demand for normal goods declines when the income decreases, for example due to a wage decrease or layoffs.It&#x27;s entirely expected that people will want to consume more comfort and safety at their income increases.If you compare different countries, you will find that these kinds of things track with income much more than with history of union activism.For a striking example see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pseudoerasmus.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;ijd&#x2F; which is an article on the divergence between Japan and India. Japan has a long history of labour repression, especially compared to India. But by and large Japanese workers have a it a lot better today than workers in India, especially if you go by what&#x27;s happening in reality and not just by what&#x27;s promised on paper.And that difference tracks with the difference in incomes between the two countries, but stands in stark contrast to what we would expect from your sketched theory of union activism driving these things. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparent\"Will want to\" yes. But it was not being offered until after that extensive union activism despite decades of demands. To the point that people died for it. May 1st is the international day for labour demonstrations because of the US union fight for the 8 hour day. The demand long preceded a rise in income allowing people to risk walking over it, or be able to afford to offer to take less pay for less work.It took decades from the demand was there until it became normalised to offer it, with concession after concession won as direct and explicit outcomes of industrial action.That good conditions are offered far more easily when a working population is in a financial position to walk if it&#x27;s not offered is entirely unsurprising and irrelevant. That you can&#x27;t possibly win the same level of outcomes when the financial position of employers doesn&#x27;t allow it is also entirely unsurprising and irrelevant.Nobody expects magic. Nor does anyone suggest that there aren&#x27;t other factors also at play. reply eru 1 hour agorootparentDifferent income levels between countries already suffice to explain most of the variation we see in things like actual provided worker safety etc.History of union activism is an explanatory variable that doesn&#x27;t add much to the mix, and if anything is rather contradictory and noisy in the end. reply vidarh 51 minutes agorootparentGiven we can look back at history and see direct causal links between industrial action and subsequent improvements, there is no way to take this seriously.I have no doubt you&#x27;re right that it correlates neatly with different income levels, but I find it comical that you think that addresses the issue.I also note that you claimed working hours as a normal good whose demand would rise with income but ignored the point that the demand far preceded the economic ability to bargain for it with money, and that the demand was not constrained by lack of money. The notion that it fits your description at all is bizarre.EDIT: I&#x27;ll also note that after having had time to skim the article you linked, it does not appear to even attempt to make an argument aligned with yours. The author very specifically points out significant confounding factors, such as whether or not unions resistance in the specific given conditions affected productivity negatively or hindered productivity improvements.A union certainly can make a wrong tradeoff - Indian unions prioritised keeping the intensity of the work down, at the cost of reducing their then-future ability to demand higher incomes. But they were only able to have that negative effect on future wages because their activism had a substantial effect on working conditions and by extension productivity.That their goal was short sighted does not change that if anything it is a demonstration of the substantial impact unions do have.That there is a risk that a too successful union can end up having an adverse effect by accident is nothing new either - it&#x27;s if anything one of the historical conflicts within the labour movement in terms of outlook on the approach between seeing it as about conditions at individual workplaces or tied to local concerns vs. inherently a political and society-wide and international concern. kortilla 10 minutes agorootparent> but ignored the point that the demand far preceded the economic ability to bargain for it with money, and that the demand was not constrained by lack of moneyYou don’t know what demand means in an economic context here.

Things happening around the same time does not imply causation.Union members were likely emboldened as pay increased because they could ride out strikes. At the same time, people could just get by on fewer shifts because pay increased. This creates downward pressure on required weekly hours (because many people to value their time), regardless of the union activities.“The 8 hour work day was paid for in blood” is a great signal that you’re already very pro union (it’s literally union propaganda), so I don’t expect your view to shift much here.

Just because people work to achieve X, and then X happens, is not a direct causal link. Eg praying for winter to be over, doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a direct causal link with spring coming eventually. And fans cheering for their sports team to win, don&#x27;t have much of an influence on whether their team actually wins.Or to give an example from history: the assassination of Franz Ferdinand is often seen as the event that triggered the Great War; but few people assign it much importance as an underlying cause.> I have no doubt you&#x27;re right that it correlates neatly with different income levels, but I find it comical that you think that addresses the issue.If income levels explain all the variation between countries, and levels of union activism are just noise, I am not sure why you need to appeal to union activism as a cause?It&#x27;s like looking at the correlation between taking antibiotics and recovery from infection, but then adding fervent prayer as a causal explanation for some reason.The tide eventually receded from King Canute, but that&#x27;s not because of anything he did.EDIT: I mostly agree with your edit.

For example, a lot of browser-based work is not totally deterministic but rather requires more intelligence during the automation, e.g. summarizing information on a web page or dynamically filling in a text box with the right answer. reply typosaur 12 hours agorootparentWow! I can totally see that now. Basically you want to build a more intelligent browser-automation tool :) reply Havoc 10 hours agoparentprevWow - did not know about that feature. Thanks for highlighting it! reply Freddie111 14 hours agoprevI was curious about the YC backing and realised that you&#x27;re the founders of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ztool.co. Did you pivot or is this a complementary prodcut to ztool? Would love to hear more about your journey :) reply jonasnelle 14 hours agoparentHey, nice detective work :)This is definitely more of a pivot, though the ZTool product also went through a few bigger iterations itself. I think my learnings from building and talking to users the last few months boil down to two main things that led me to work on autotab. 1. AI-generated software isn&#x27;t ready for non-technical users. With ZTool I was initially focused on making it easy for people who don&#x27;t know how to code to create automations. For the reasons we talked about above, I think having the model&#x27;s output be code is best for now, so autotab is focused on users that can review and tweak Python code. 2. How you communicate intent matters. There is a surprising amount of mental work required to go from \"this task is annoying\" to creating a structured representation of it (c.f. the whole world of process automation). AI demos have focused on short prompts to communicate intent, but those don&#x27;t work that well for more complex domains. Using the browser to communicate intent seems really powerful because it&#x27;s so intuitive&#x2F;familiar. reply btbuildem 9 hours agoprev> This will launch a Chrome session controlled by Selenium and then log you in to GoogleWhy is logging into Google a requirement? reply jonasnelle 7 hours agoparentWe currently only allow log in with Google for logging in to autotab itself, but will add login with username&#x2F;password and other options soon!

This definitely seems useful for some stuff I&#x27;ve been doing, like filling out a CRM spreadsheet with the right user data. reply omarfarooq 10 hours agoprevWhat would make this maximally useful is if an LLM with a ruleset would be available to parse and act on dynamic situations on pages.For example, add to cart, if the LLM detect it&#x27;s out of stock (a rule), then do some other action.What&#x27;s the possibility of LLM-reinforced, rules based branching logic like this being possible with your software in the future? reply jonasnelle 9 hours agoparentCouldn’t agree more! Working on this actively. Interesting questions include 1) what format is most effective for the user to convey their intent (maybe not point & click) and 2) how to represent the model output such that it is auditable and editable. reply omarfarooq 8 hours agorootparentAwesome to hear, it&#x27;s already useful now for us to get started with using it, but this kind of evolution would be panacea.I suggest a Discord group for Autotab to start building up a community! Looking forward. reply gHA5 13 hours agoprevDoes this allow me to record something like a workflow or macro I can use as a shortcut in an open browser window or is it restricted an automated process of opening a browser window and executing some actions?Specifically, assume I have a bunch of open tabs, each with an identical element, say the Full Screen button on Youtube video pages. Can I record \"Exit Full Screen, move to next tab, enter Full Screen of the video on the page\" with Autotab? reply alexirobbins 12 hours agoparentYou could do a version of this if you always open your Youtube videos in the browser instance your autotab script spins up, but short answer is not really. Macros like this are super interesting though, and we&#x27;ve talked a lot about ways browsers could be designed for AI and automation like this. reply jonasnelle 12 hours agoparentprevThis is very interesting, may I ask what macros you would define?

Doesnt it just track mouse &#x2F; keyboard events across the session? reply monkpit 15 hours agoparentAI looks to be involved in creating element selectors. reply alexirobbins 14 hours agorootparentSelectors have been our primary focus so far – they&#x27;re notoriously finicky! Our roadmap includes more extensive use of AI, both as embedded intelligence, and in the code generation process. For example, one thing we&#x27;ve heard from heavy users of browser automation is that maintenance becomes the largest cost. Self-healing automations will be able to either fix themselves, our give you an alert with a suggested fix to work off of. reply jamesmcintyre 14 hours agorootparentThe \"self-healing\" sounds very interesting. I&#x27;ve tried to think, myself, how to approach this in a chrome extension running dom selectors in automations. Curious if you have any high-level thoughts&#x2F;findings in this area? reply alexirobbins 14 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re just getting started on it ourselves but it&#x27;s a really fun problem. I think the useful thing from our findings so far is that simplifying the DOM representation really helps the model reason about state. reply invertednz 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m confused the demo shows typing in to select a element in a row which looks to be AI, I don&#x27;t see anything that looks to be AI in the selectors? I&#x27;m not even sure how you would work with selectors unless you put the whole html into the context window or just ask which locator looks most reliable? reply jonasnelle 10 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly what we do - we sample relevant parts of the DOM and use the model to write the logic for selecting that element. This works pretty well and saves a lot of time that developers otherwise spend inspecting the html structure to write the selectors themselves.Going forward we’re excited to experiment with more intelligence at runtime e.g. using AI to try to recover if the selector wasn’t found. reply monkpit 13 hours agorootparentprevSo I assume the video is the ground-truth, then the AI has access to the DOM and the video, and generates a selector based on the video during the test run (each time) in order to do avoid flakiness due to DOM&#x2F;class&#x2F;attribute changes? reply jonasnelle 10 hours agorootparentRight now the generated script is the ground truth but we’ve been working on augmenting this with images & videos to fall back on. We think defaulting to code is good because it is faster, cheaper and more easy to reason about in the 95%+ of times it works. Plain old Selenium will get you pretty far, especially if creating scripts is much easier. replyjsf01 13 hours agoprevThis is a great use of the sidepanel API. Really like the idea and how you implemented it. The Firefox equivalent to that API isn’t identical to Chrome’s, and I believe that there is currently no way to trigger the side panel to open programmatically unless it’s in response to a user action. So it may take a bit of work, but would be exciting to see support for FF in the future.A bit tangential but I was curious what you used to record the demo video on your landing page with those zoom-in animations during critical moments. I’d like to record something like that for some of my side projects and thought your video looked rather polished. reply jonasnelle 13 hours agoparentThanks! It&#x27;s still very much early days for the Sidepanel and the API feels very much in flux but an exciting new form factor for browser-integrated experiences. Makes total sense, supporting other browsers is likely something we will do in the futureI used https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screen.studio&#x2F; for the demo and past demos, it works quite well I find though it can get a bit too excited on the zoom ins and I have to cut out some of them reply atum47 14 hours agoprevForgive my ignorance, but isn&#x27;t the chrome extension market kind of dead?I had some silly extension a long time ago but after receiving a lot of emails from Google saying that they were killing the ecosystem I&#x27;ve dropped them. reply jonasnelle 13 hours agoparentautotab is not an always on browser extension like you are probably used to. autotab is only added to the Selenium-controlled browser window you use to write the automation while you&#x27;re recording.Also my experience differs more broadly, I use browser extensions quite a bit, e.g. for ad blocking and password management.

We think that output as code is the way to go, so that you don&#x27;t have to learn a new UI&#x2F;language, aren&#x27;t locked in and can integrate it into a larger project. reply HanClinto 17 hours agoprevThanks for sharing this!

I was wondering if Autotab currently supports logging into websites that require 2FA. (Your readme mentions Google only.) reply jonasnelle 12 hours agoparentHey, we&#x27;re looking to build out our library of authentication plugins. Many websites offer \"Sign in with Google\" which makes things easier, you can just specify that in the autotab.yaml file. If you have a specific website in mind, I&#x27;d be happy to add support for it! reply dr_kiszonka 8 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply! I was thinking about an internal website. I don&#x27;t know if this is a reasonable suggestion, but maybe you could focus on common SSOs and 2FA providers like Duo and OneLogin? reply derac 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;d love if it could output Playwright code as well. I haven&#x27;t tried it but if this works well it&#x27;s a great concept! reply jonasnelle 12 hours agoparentGood to know! The comments have definitely made us update towards looking into Playwright again quite seriously reply lobochrome 9 hours agorootparentYeah - I moved my entire automation library over at the beginning of the year. The docker integrations and ease of switching out browsers without having to manage webdrivers individually sealed the deal. I&#x27;m also tentatively using their selectors a bit, although find I have to retreat to Xpath quite a bit. Playwright seems to be the obvious choice for testing - but automation who knows.If you can be playwright for automation instead of testing - that&#x27;d be a biiiig market. Lot&#x27;s and lot&#x27;s of scrapers out there and it&#x27;s a market microsoft is not interested in. reply jonasnelle 7 hours agorootparentInteresting, can you say more about why you prefer Playwright’s selectors? Helpful to have some anecdotes from real experience! reply nomilk 7 hours agoprevCould this work for other languages, for example, R? reply jonasnelle 7 hours agoparentUnfortunately we have no plans to support R at the moment, though in my experience GPT4 is pretty good at translating code between languages reply boromi 8 hours agoprevmacOS only?

I&#x27;m mostly curious what the path to monetization for this is reply jonasnelle 14 hours agoparentI&#x27;m more interested in making it useful than extracting value.Longer term I think you&#x27;d monetize the infrastructure to run the automations at scale in the cloud. reply pkaye 11 hours agoprevWhat AI does this use? reply jonasnelle 11 hours agoparentWe use OpenAI&#x27;s GPT4 to understand the position of the element being interacted with relative to the structure of the website overall.

They are unambiguous, concise and most importantly, a standard. They should be the conventional way to refer to elements. reply bdcravens 15 hours agorootparentThe CSS selector isn&#x27;t the problem, it&#x27;s how you identify it. Many sites have dynamically named selectors, including class names. Even depending on ordering is fraught. Learning how to create robust selectors is about 1&#x2F;2 the battle in writing a good Selenium&#x2F;Puppeteer&#x2F;Playwright&#x2F;etc script. (been doing this as a major part of my day job for about 14 years) reply mherrmann 15 hours agorootparentprevThe CSS structure of a web site is an implementation detail and on a global average, CSS selectors break much more often than user-visible labels. reply monkpit 15 hours agorootparentprev> and most importantly, a standard.A standard for what, exactly?

In *my opinion*, it&#x27;s also more pleasant to work with than Selenium. reply jonasnelle 14 hours agoparentInteresting, what features are most impactful in making it more pleasant to work with?We picked Selenium because it seems much more widely used at least in the Python world (selenium has about 10x more downloads on PyPI than playwright). My guess is that&#x27;s at least partly because Playwright is more focused on the JS&#x2F;TS ecosystem and testing. reply LordKeren 13 hours agorootparentI recently finished moving fr Python-selenium to Python-playwright. Though my outcomes might be different, it is such a significant improvement that I would strongly, strongly recommend at least spending a couple days trying it out if you are familiar with selenium.To my team, selenium’s only advantage in the python ecosystem is that it is easier to hire people with experience. However, anyone familiar with selenium is likely to pick up playwright extremely quickly anywaysPlaywright does ship a pytest integration but it is not requiredSome highlights:1. Better waiting — everything is auto-waited and auto-retried by default2. Easy to install browsers — no need to get separate webdriver browsers. Just run “playwright install chromium”3. Full, accurate typing4. Trace viewing to step through a script execution5. Async support6. (Arguably) more pythonic syntax and easier to pick up&#x2F; train peopleI really enjoyed mastering selenium over the years, but I struggle to think of a use case for it outside of maintaining legacy script suites anymore. Playwright just does it better. reply jasonjmcghee 9 hours agorootparentprevWildly better developer experience. Playwright is also much less flakey and easier to work with than cypress, another alternative to selenium.Selenium is quite outdated, though still widely used. It&#x27;s much older. I would look at downloads over time &#x2F; rate of change, not total downloads.My hot take- don&#x27;t hook yourselves to outdated tech.Don&#x27;t take my word for it- go try out selenium, Cypress, and playwright and draw your own conclusions. reply hugs 6 hours agorootparentfwiw, the Selenium project is now old enough to go to college (19 years this month!); it&#x27;s not ready to retire just yet. (Side-note: Google Chrome is 15 years old. Age is just a number.) Selenium is still learning from other projects and implementing new things. Specifically, check out the WebDriver BiDi project, adding a bidirectional protocol which was the core of what made Playwright and Puppeteer faster. Also, Selenium devs are working with the W3C to make this work for everyone.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;w3c&#x2F;webdriver-bidihttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3c.github.io&#x2F;webdriver-bidi&#x2F;Google wrote a good explainer about WebDriver BiDi here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;webdriver-bidi&#x2F; reply johnsutor 15 hours agoparentprevSimilarly, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AndrewUsher&#x2F;playwright-chrome-recorder reply bdcravens 15 hours agoparentprevTrue, but like the Chrome extension in the sibling comment, it often hard-codes references, which may not be the same in the next run. reply 17 hours agoprev [–] [deleted]GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Timac Dependencies Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS 17 Posted Oct 19, 2023 Now that iOS 17 is available, let’s analyze its built-in apps to answer a few questions: How many binaries are in iOS 17? Which programming languages are used to develop these apps? How many apps are written with Swift? What is the percentage of apps using SwiftUI versus UIKit? Methodology The methodology and tools to create this article have been detailed in my previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to: Apple’s use of AppKit, Mac Catalyst and SwiftUI in macOS Evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14 Apple’s use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12. Before jumping into the details, let’s clarify a few points: I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares are not included. Note that this year, I analyzed the Secure Enclave. I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1. Keep in mind that a developer can mix different programming languages to create one binary. One example is a Mac app I developed, Dependencies, where I use Swift, Objective-C, C++, and C, the most appropriate programming language used to solve each specific problem. In this article, an app containing a single line of Swift code will be counted as using Swift. You will see mentions of Objective-C and C++ but you might notice the absence of Objective-C++. The approach used here can’t really detect binaries built with Objective-C++. Such binaries are counted as using both Objective-C and C++. Finally, you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations because I don’t have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts. Number of binaries Let’s first answer a simple question: How many binaries are in iOS 17? The number of binaries composing iOS continues to increase: iOS 17 contains 6030 binaries, up from 5403 in iOS 16. That’s 627 new binaries. Swift and SwiftUI in iOS 17 Unsurprisingly, there has been a significant increase in the number of apps adopting SwiftUI this year. Notable mentions include: The Preferences app with several of its bundles (StorageSettingsUI, WallpaperSettings, MultitaskingAndGesturesSettings, ThirdPartyApplicationSettings, ActionButtonSettings, …) Several binaries related to Health (Health.app, HealthUI, MentalHealthUI, WorkoutUI, …) The Home app, which appears to have undergone some major changes (Home.app, HomeEnergyUI, HomeUICommon, HomeDataModel, HomeAccessoryControlUI, …) The support for the new Action button (ActionButtonSettings, ActionButtonConfigurationUI, …) Additionally, several other important apps, such as Calendar and Reminders, are now using SwiftUI In iOS 16, only 4 apps used the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. In iOS 17, this figure has grown to 14 apps: /Applications/Batteries.app/Batteries /Applications/ClarityCamera.app/ClarityCamera /Applications/ClarityPhotos.app/ClarityPhotos /Applications/FinanceUIService.app/FinanceUIService /Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/FTMInternal-4 /Applications/MusicRecognition.app/MusicRecognition /Applications/PASViewService.app/PASViewService /Applications/Preferences.app/Preferences /Applications/SafetyMonitorApp.app/SafetyMonitorApp /Applications/ShazamEventsApp.app/ShazamEventsApp /Applications/WorkoutRemoteViewService.app/WorkoutRemoteViewService /private/var/staged_system_apps/Weather.app/Weather /System/Library/CoreServices/AegirProxyApp.app/AegirProxyApp /System/Library/CoreServices/ShortcutsActions.app/ShortcutsActions The Swift and SwiftUI adoption continues its climb: iOS 17 now contains 385 binaries using SwiftUI. Likewise the number of binaries containing at least one line of Swift code increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17: Evolution of the programming languages By analyzing all major releases of iOS from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17, we can see the evolution of the programming languages used by iOS. Again please note that a single binary can be counted multiple times, so the sum of the binaries in this graph is greater than the total number of binaries: Some trends can be better visualized by displaying percentages: What can we learn from these graphs? Objective-C is still at the core of iOS and is used directly or indirectly by most apps The adoption of Swift and SwiftUI continues to grow rapidly The share of Objective-C, C and C++ continues to decrease UIKit versus SwiftUI Up until now, we compared SwiftUI to all binaries. SwiftUI being a UI framework, it would be fairer to compare it to other binaries displaying some UI. Native iOS apps can be built with 2 different UI frameworks: UIKit and SwiftUI (note that it is possible to mix both). My approach to count the number of binaries containing UI is not perfect but should give an approximate trend: I simply check if the binaries link against the UIKit or SwiftUI frameworks. For the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year: By displaying percentages, we can confirm that SwiftUI is clearly increasing in Apple’s own apps: Secure Enclave The Secure Enclave is a hardware-based security component, isolated from the main processor to provide an extra layer of security. It was initially introduced with the iPhone 5S to ensure the security of sensitive user data, playing a critical role for Touch ID, Face ID, and Apple Pay. In the What's new in Swift session (5:35) of the WWDC22, Apple stated that Swift is now suitable for restricted environments like the Secure Enclave Processor: In iOS 17, the Secure Enclave contains 19 binaries, and to my surprise, none of them are using Swift: So is Swift used in the Secure Enclave? Yes! It turns out that the hibernation binary in macOS Ventura is using Swift: Raw Data You can download below the raw data I generated for all major releases of iOS from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17.0. Version Device Raw Data iOS 17.0.2 (21A350) iPhone 15 Pro iOS17.txt iOS 16.0.2 (20A380) iPhone 14 Pro iOS16.txt iOS 15.0 (19A346) iPhone 13 Pro iOS15.txt iOS 14.0 (18A373) iPhone X iOS14.txt iOS 13.1 (17A844) iPhone X iOS13.txt iOS 12.0 (16A366) iPhone X iOS12.txt iOS 11.1 (15B93) iPhone X iOS11.txt iOS 10.1 (14B72) iPhone 5s iOS10.txt iOS 9.0 (13A344) iPhone 5s iOS9.txt iOS 8.0 (12A365) iPhone 5s iOS8.txt iOS 7.0.1 (11A470a) iPhone 5s iOS7.txt iOS 6.0 (10A403) iPhone 3GS iOS6.txt iOS 5.0 (9A334) iPhone 3GS iOS5.txt iOS 4.0 (8A293) iPhone 3GS iOS4.txt iPhone OS 3.0 (7A341) iPhone 3GS iOS3.txt iPhone OS 2.0 (5A347) iPhone 2G iOS2.txt iPhone OS 1.0 (1A543a) iPhone 2G iOS1.txt Conclusion Even though we don’t have access to the iOS source code, we can determine the programming languages used to create the built-in apps in iOS and we can measure the evolution of these languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17. Swift and SwiftUI adoptions continue their growth: the number of binaries using these frameworks increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17. Another good sign of dogfooding is the more widespread use of the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. Also for the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year. In the upcoming years, it will be interesting to observe whether Swift begins to spread into low-level firmware, such as the Secure Enclave. Currently, Swift is absent from the Secure Enclave in iOS, although macOS does incorporate it. As previously mentioned, this approach has obviously some limits and while I believe the overall picture to be accurate, I can’t guarantee that the results are perfectly exact.

It goes to show that transitioning languages is extremely difficult, even when you are applying the impetus to yourself. Consider the Python 3 transition in this light. Python 3 came in 2008 and I don&#x27;t think it could be said the transition completed prior to 2020, so 12 years conservatively. Swift picks up in iOS 10 at 1%. So, perhaps one could estimate by iOS 22 some large majority of Swift in Apple codebases? And then maybe by iOS 30 Objective-C is down to 5% or les? reply lolinder 7 hours agoparentOne thing to note about the data is that the way the author counts a \"Swift\" binary and an \"Objective-C\" binary is a bit misleading, as it dual-counts binaries that feature both, and most new binaries feature both languages. That&#x27;s why the slopes of the two languages look essentially the same: because they&#x27;re the same binaries.By my rough count [0], the number of strictly Objective-C binaries increased by exactly 4 between iOS 16 and 17. The number of strictly Swift binaries increased by 9 [1], and the vast majority of binaries added use both languages. It&#x27;s not clear from the data if there are substantial amounts of ObjC code in these binaries or if there are just one or two functions in each.EDIT: The percentage tallies are calculated weirdly too—because they double- and triple-counted binaries that have multiple languages, they calculated all the percentages out of a total of 8723 binaries (for iOS 17) even though there are only 6030 in their data set. The correct percentages should be:SwiftUI: 6%Swift: 25%C: 7%C++: 17%Objective-C: 89%This is less satisfying because it doesn&#x27;t add up to 100%, but the metric they used doesn&#x27;t have any useful meaning.[0] Using the following regex on the raw data files: &#x2F; \\|Objective-C\\n&#x2F; [0] Using the following regex on the raw data files: &#x2F; \\|Swift(\\|SwiftUI)?\\n&#x2F; and reply saagarjha 1 hour agorootparentConsider using a regex like “objc” or similar, very few places in the code will include “Objective-C” spelled out reply keyle 10 hours agoparentprevA lot of the low level code is working code in ObjC.There is no reason to replace perfectly working code that is battle tested if the requirements don&#x27;t change.The fact that the new binaries on it are written in Swift is showing their 100% commitment to Swift, which is great to see. And why wouldn&#x27;t you, Swift is a joy to work with, especially if you&#x27;re from Apple :) reply inopinatus 5 hours agorootparentI really do enjoy working in Swift too, but the anemic cross-platform story is a colossal hurdle to selection as the primary development language in many commercial cases.It seems to me that Apple&#x27;s strongly insular instincts serve them well for integrated product design, but for the Swift language, alas, they form a severe hindrance to wider adoption. reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentIf cross-platform is your thing &#x27;fraid Objective-C isn&#x27;t a great sell either. reply mpweiher 1 hour agorootparentAt least two open-source compilers, several runtimes, several Foundations.What more do you want? reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentprevHardly any different from going with .NET (many stuff is still Framework only), or C++ with OS specific SDKs like MFC&#x2F;WinUI&#x2F;... reply zoogeny 10 hours agorootparentprevSure, but \"working code\" written in C is declining. So some choices are being made.It fits in line with how I&#x27;ve seen Apple developers at conferences highlighting the memory safety aspects of Swift. They are maybe hoping to position it as a competitor to Rust on that front. I wonder how they feel Objective-C compares from a safety perspective compared to Swift. I wonder if that might influence decisions on what kind of stuff gets re-written in Swift.I hope we can see further graphs like this to track what happens. I don&#x27;t feel MS ever committed to C# in this way but that is due to ignorance at the numbers.

A series of \"ownership\" features have been getting integrated into the most recent versions of the language that let you avoid that runtime cost while retaining memory safety (at the expense of more complex code — the vast majority of code should still use ARC). That makes Swift much more suitable for lots of \"systems programming\" than it was just a few months ago. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swift.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;swift-5.9-released&#x2F;#ownership reply tambourine_man 8 hours agorootparentprevIt was Lattner’s vision, a language that would scale from scripts to kernel. Oh yeah, and one that’s easy for a beginner to learn.I think that’s impossible, Swift should try to be a great language for building Mac&#x2F;iOS apps and hopefully frameworks.But what do I know. I wouldn’t think writing a new industry grade C++ compiler in a modular architecture would be feasible. Just use GCC.

Not just the interface but the whole paradigm was different, only supporting a few features of the original program. I gave up on it.iPhotos was another example: it had languished, but what came out had less functionality (no more external streams, for example) and simply threw info away (tags, face recognition, added metadata like location was all gone). Links to external tools were no longer available, though added later.This happened to Pages and Numbers (& Keynote?) as well but I don&#x27;t know if they count as consumer or pro apps. Consumer I guess.On the Pro Side, replacing Final Cut Pro with Final Cut X (~2010 or 2011) pretty much drive video production off the Apple platform onto Windows. Like the iMovie case (I guess they didn&#x27;t learn) it was a completely new interface without most of the features of the old version. I hear a lot of the functionality made it back in over the following decade, but you wonder why.I think the loss of the pro production side in video (and replacement by Adobe) led to the abandonment of Aperture too. Apple announced that the consumer product Apple Photos was supposed to be the replacement -- what a joke! reply flakes 3 hours agorootparentI feel like this was a trend. Windows Movie Maker from XP was tremendously better than all of their replacements. I remember using that heavily when I was in middle-school, making stop motions and stupid videos with my friends. reply corbezzoli 4 hours agorootparentprev> the new binaries on it are written in SwiftIt appears to be 50:50 with Obj-C for now. See how the Obj-C line in the \"Evolution of the programming languages\" chart is still growing steadily. I can see Swift taking the majority of new code for the next year though. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentMost of the new code written in Objective-C tends to be related to Metal, or new features being added to existing Objective-C frameworks like UIKit. reply MBCook 8 hours agorootparentprevWorking code can hold unknown bugs, including those Swift could help prevent.There are reasons to rewrite it, though I’m sure it will take a long time and they’re prioritizing risk vs reward. reply bpye 5 hours agorootparentRewriting code can equally introduce bugs. Maybe it’s worth it for things with significant attack surface - but certainly not everything qualifies. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agorootparentprev\"can\" being the key word; rewriting code in Swift because the old code \"can\" contain bugs that swift \"could\" help prevent is wishful thinking. Working code is proven code, tested, reviewed, optimized, fixed, analyzed, and has run trillions of times. Rewriting it to another language because it \"can\" hold unknown bugs that may not have been discovered yet is a weird flavor of hubris, similar to people seeing Rust as the one language that will fix all software bugs, amortizing the cost of rewriting and dismissing the existing code. reply brailsafe 8 hours agorootparentprevPrioritizing expense and risk vs nebulous reward reply MBCook 8 hours agorootparentIt’s not nebulous.There are kinds of bugs that Swift can provably catch that Objective-C can’t.There are bits of safety that Swift can ensure without needing to do additional boundary checks or something else, leading to faster&#x2F;smaller code.Perhaps biggest of all Swift doesn’t need a runtime like Obj-C. Apple has done an amazing job tuning it, but a direct function call is always going to be faster than message passing. reply mpweiher 50 minutes agorootparentNebulous is exactly what it is, because despite what you think:1. The empirical evidence does not support the notion of fewer bugs, even for static typing, never mind SwiftAnd no, this is not from lack of trying. People have tried to show this time and time again. And time and time again they end up not showing it, with effect sizes tiny and pointing in both directions.And as an anecdotal example: which way has Apple software quality gone since they started adopting Swift and SwiftUI? System Settings anyone?2. Swift is slow, not fastI did fairly extensive research for on this for chapter 9 of my macOS&#x2F;iOS Performance book. Even those cases where I fully expected Swift to be faster, which were not numerous, it managed to be slower. And there are really egregiously bad examples, like Swift Coding, which despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary some people still believe to be fast.Why do they believe it to be fast? Because so much work can be done in the compiler. So it must be fast. But it just is not. In fact, it&#x27;s ludicrously slow. This is probably lesson #1 from performance optimisation: things are not fast because simply you did something that you believe to be fast. You need to measure to figure out whether they are fast and in order to figure out how to make them fast.(And those mistaken beliefs actually lead to slow code, because you already did the thing that makes it fast, not need to check or optimise. I am pretty confident that a similar effect happens with static typing and safety.)Or check out the computer languages shootout. Swift tends to be somewhat on par with Java. Which is not particularly fast.3. Swift needs loads of runtimeFor example, due to the somewhat bizarre idea of having protocols be polymorphic over (pass-by-value) structs and (pass-by-reference) objects, Swift has to dynamically dispatch the copying of individual arguments to a function when protocols are involved. If you&#x27;re both lucky and not using modular code, the compiler may be able to figure out how to elide that dispatch. But it won&#x27;t tell you if it managed to figure it out or not.Oh, and speaking from 30+ years of experience: message passing simply is not the bottleneck in 99%+ of the cases, and if it is it is fairly trivial to remove. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agorootparentprevWhile this is true, your arguments are mainly in favor of writing new code in Swift, which I agree with. What you&#x27;re missing is selling and convincing people of rewriting existing, working code to a different language, which is a nontrivial investment and a decision that shouldn&#x27;t be taken lightly. reply brailsafe 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat is nebulous is the actual return on the investment of time and money, just the same as it would be in any rewrite of any code ever, when the same resources could be allocated differently. The possibility that some hypothetical bugs might be avoided isn&#x27;t a compelling argument for spending dollars and time on doing the work, if it&#x27;s measurably doing it&#x27;s job now. reply bobbylarrybobby 8 hours agorootparentprevSwift doesn&#x27;t need a runtime, but if it runs alongside Objective C code, doesn&#x27;t it? On iOS wouldn&#x27;t much of what Swift is doing be to calling down into Objective C? In other words, I think that unless you get rid of all of the Objective C in iOS, Swift will still be sitting on top of a runtime. reply astrange 4 hours agorootparentSwift does need a runtime. The language design is kind of accepting of implementation complexity in a way that interpreted languages often are but compiled languages usually aren&#x27;t, so there&#x27;s a lot of implicit heap allocations. replyeviks 5 hours agorootparentprevThe reason is those battle tests showed time and again that the code is vulnerable, so it&#x27;s not working perfectly reply JKCalhoun 10 hours agoparentprevI think that is a case where the percentage chart is deceptive.My take is that C has probably remained steady — all the new binaries in iOS are made up from the other three. reply yreg 1 hour agorootparentThere is a chart for that as well and it is as you say. In iOS 17 the amount of binaries using C even grew a bit.For C++ the amount has been growing steadily with every release, but it went from 14% in iPhone OS 1 to 12% in iOS 17. reply cellularmitosis 7 hours agoparentprevHerb Sutter has a talk where he makes a pretty convincing argument that making a backwards incompatible change in your language costs you about 10 years in adoption reply mjmsmith 8 hours agoparentprev> What is interesting to me is the decline in C, from 52% in iPhone OS 1 to 5% in iOS 17.Note that most of this change is between iOS 1-9, where Objective-C rose from 34% to 70% (+36) and C declined from 52% to 14% (-38). reply pasc1878 1 hour agorootparentYes but is any of that a simple rename from .c to .m chnages the language but no need to change the code. reply jbverschoor 10 minutes agoprevApple needs to start polishing their UI again all the way from the start.Preferences is such a mess.

As far as I know Swift won&#x27;t pull in a heavy runtime or anything like that reply bobbylarrybobby 8 hours agorootparentI think Swift does pull in a runtime, but the runtime is included in iOS itself so apps and users don&#x27;t really pay a cost. It can just link to whatever’s on disk.Prior to some Swift version — Swift 4? don&#x27;t remember — iOS apps that used Swift did have to bring their own runtime, and iirc this was because Swift was evolving so fast that Apple wasn&#x27;t willing or able to commit to including a bunch with iOS. reply dwaite 6 hours agorootparent> ... iirc this was because Swift was evolving so fast that Apple wasn&#x27;t willing or able to commit to including a bunch with iOS.Not just that - they wanted to have language features for stability and migration which they hadn&#x27;t fully flushed out yet and implemented.Now, Swift is part of the OS itself - which has good and bad sides, because policies to support older versions of iOS also mean you can&#x27;t fully leverage all the new language features. replyexplaininjs 12 hours agoprevShame they didn’t look at the “Fitness” app. It’s first party but requires a separate download. Probably because it’s some of the worst quality software I’ve ever seen.Its UI becomes desynchronized and self-inconsistent in ways I wouldn’t have believed are possible. The very fact that it exists and is capable of presenting as incoherent UI as it does is damning evidence against whatever UI framework it uses. reply turdprincess 12 hours agoparentSwiftUI exists to solve exactly this problem - the ui is declarative and state driven.However, its predecessor UIKit is mostly imperative and it takes a lot of manual code to keep the UI reflective of the underlying data model. For this reason I find many IOS apps, and especially apple’s own, to be always mildly broken.Programming in UIKit is like programming in JQuery, or maybe Backbone at best.SwiftUI brings us to the modern age of react (but with less capabilities and more bugs)IOS developers though tend to be pretty resistant to such “modern” paradigms. If you read the rest of the discussion on this post, you fill find that even using Swift, let alone SwiftUI is still a very debated issue.Maybe the grass is greener, but I don’t find the same resistance for new ideas in the web (typescript) or Android (kotlin) communities.I do wonder if this resistance is combing from an objective evaluation of the new tech, or the lack of desire&#x2F;time to learn something new. reply jwells89 11 hours agorootparentAs a mobile dev, so far the biggest issue keeping me from adopting SwiftUI stems from its greenness and UIKit being so well fleshed out.The newness is an issue because new SwiftUI revisions ship with new iOS releases, which means that big chunks of it are gated by the oldest iOS version you support. Jetpack Compose on Android gets this more right since it’s independent of the OS, but suffers from other tradeoffs (Java ecosystem and the rest of Android dev gives me a headache sometimes).SwiftUI is also just missing various things that are present in UIKit, and so if you’re using those things it’s easier to write the whole app in UIKit instead of bridging those controls to SwiftUI.I absolutely foresee going SwiftUI exclusive but realistically that’s still a few years down the road. reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s sort of dismaying that SwiftUI is regarded as a superior native choice as opposed to second-citizen cross-platform frameworks, then see examples like the macOS System Settings app. Though perhaps that is more of a case of poorly-executed Catalyst iOS to macOS porting, and poor design, than a lack of \"nativeness\" with SwiftUI.The framework lacking consideration for navigation until recently shows that its rollout has been half-baked, though. reply saagarjha 55 minutes agorootparentSettings is not a Catalyst app; it’s a poorly designed full rewrite. reply jwells89 10 hours agorootparentprevThe problems with the macOS settings app have just as much or more to do with its design as they do with SwiftUI. If they had instead built the redesign with AppKit it’d feel a bit smoother in some areas but would be just as flawed. Just making it more traditionally Mac-like would go a long way. reply Apocryphon 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard a lot of disgruntlement from macOS developers about SwiftUI. I wonder if the framework has an inherent bias for iOS and maybe iPadOS? Again, it&#x27;s crazy that after years of disparagement of kludgy cross-platform frameworks (albeit more from the fans than the company itself), Apple basically went ahead and built their own, with fewer supported frameworks than the third-party alternatives. reply jwells89 10 hours agorootparentSwiftUI definitely has an iOS&#x2F;mobile bent to it, no doubt because iOS is its flagship platform. macOS no longer has the corporate gravity that it enjoyed prior to the iPhone, when AppKit received most of its post-NeXT development.This problem isn’t exclusive to SwiftUI though, WinUI&#x2F;Windows App SDK is also mobile-flavored likely due to its UWP heritage, lacking basic desktop widgets like a tableview&#x2F;datagrid. reply DaiPlusPlus 9 hours agorootparent> This problem isn’t exclusive to SwiftUI though, WinUI&#x2F;Windows App SDK is also mobile-flavored likely due to its UWP heritage, lacking basic desktop widgets like a tableview&#x2F;datagrid.Hah, it&#x27;s far worse than that - Microsoft has let their desktop DX story stagnate for 15 years now (WPF was launched in 2006), since then Microsoft hasn&#x27;t launched any new desktop-first UI framework for Windows, nor offered more than token improvements to User32, CommonControls, and WinForms since then.It&#x27;s no lie that everything MS has done in the UI-framework space since Windows 7 in 2009 has been a waste of time and money. It started-off with the \"Metro\" Windows Phone reboot, then the shoehorning of that into Windows 8, and the various XAML-derived frameworks since then - and none of them have attempted to tackle the very fundamental flaws (declarative data-binding doesn&#x27;t scale, INotifyPropertyChanged breaks causality tracking and cannot be unit-tested, mutable ViewModels were carved by Lucifer himself!) - and as you said, no care or attention is paid to applications needing high information-density display.----...so while all this is going on, the Office org came up with its own in-house GPU-accelerated UI introduced in Office 2013 which we can all agree is slow, bloated, glitchy (y&#x27;ever used Excel with a 500Hz mouse?), but also proprietary and undocumented, so the wider Windows ecosystem can&#x27;t benefit from the Office org&#x27;s framework which would have otherwise (almost) neatly filled the gaps left-behind by the Windows org.I just want Satya to hire me for the job-title of \"VP of Consistent User-Experience\" and I&#x27;d make it a top-priority that Windows itself comes with a reusable spreadsheet+datagrid component that all applications can use - and it wouldn&#x27;t cost the company more than a year and a few million dollars - but save billions by avoiding lost developer confidence - and would serve to remind everyone that native desktop UX can always be better than browser-based UX.---Sorry, am ranting. reply geodel 8 hours agorootparentMS UI-framework story is essentially over.

This is resolved by scrolling the particular broken widgets out of view then back in. It would seem somewhere in the pipeline the widgets are templates&#x2F;virtualized and the logic to fill a given widget with the right data goes completely bonkers at times and needs to be reset by hiding it then showing it again.Besides that, many of the “Awards” views frequently show incorrect&#x2F;ancient&#x2F;impossible data. For instance I recently saw “You will earn this when you reach you move goal 100 times. You’ve reached your move goal 102 times so far.” with the seat not unlocked. The number sounds only slightly off, but keep in mind that’s 3 days of stale data. I saw similar bugs with the “Perfect Week” award and “Longest Move Steak” one. (At one point I had a move streak of 21 days, the badge said it was 14 days, and the perfect week badge was still not unlocked. You’ll note any 14 day period must contain a full monday-sunday period, not to mention in reality my streak was 3 weeks).The daily summary view is admittedly fine. Though the refresh interval is something like 15 minutes which is absurd for a pedometer. Not sure if the app or the API is to blame there.Sight aside, but not really. The settings&#x2F;Account modal is impossible to discover, and when you do 5&#x2F;6 menu options have a reasonable flow where you can click to go into the detail view, then hit back to return to the main modal (or exit entirely). Except for the “Change Move Goal” detail, which can only be exited entirely, it is impossible to return to the Account modal directly.I’ve never used “Fitness+”, their paid offering, but I assume the quality there would be about as bad as everywhere else. reply pjmlp 4 hours agoprevOn the same subject, some talks from Apple folks,\"Introducing a Memory-Safe Successor Language in Large C++ Code Bases\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lgivCGdmFrw\"Swift as C++ Successor in FoundationDB\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZQc9-seU-5k reply _jcrossley 12 hours agoprevReally look forward to this every year, Timac is a legend.

Unfortunately Apple has only added a package level so far, which seems fairly useless (you&#x27;re either too big for it to be useful or too small to need it). Obj-C didn&#x27;t really have ACLs at all, you just hid stuff in interfaces. Once found, those interfaces were no protection at all. reply turdprincess 11 hours agorootparentprevSwift allows you to program using “headers” - just have a protocol and an implementation, even in separate files if you want.This is a good pattern for some cases, like the public members of a package. However, I love that I don’t need to do this for every class I write.And if you do use this approach, at least swift will emit a compile error if your protocol and implementation signatures don’t match.ObjC will happily compile if your header is missing an implementation and crash at runtime. reply newZWhoDis 11 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t need “the API” in another file.Headers are such an idiotic design, over-abstraction harms locality of reasoning. reply MBCook 8 hours agorootparentThey made a TON of sense when memory was very limited.Why parse out a whole C file when you can get the only bits that matter for compiling your file from a 30 line header? reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentExcept languages with modules already existed, in systems even more constrained memory predating C&#x27;s invention. reply sbjs 9 hours agorootparentprevTypeScript is no headache for me and has no header files. reply myfavoritedog 12 hours agorootparentprevAny time a language forces you to create boilerplate that could be autogenerated by your toolchain, it&#x27;s not a feature. reply jwells89 11 hours agorootparentprevIn the whole I don’t mind Objective-C, but when I have to write it these days I definitely get annoyed by having to navigate and maintain header files.

It helps make the object system expressive enough that I don&#x27;t remember writing much design patterns ;)But seriously though, CLOS and Smalltalk-style OOP is probably the only flavor of OOP I really enjoy to use, and Objective-C gets you way closer to that than C++ and Java do. (e.g. the way KVO is implemented relies on \"isa-swizzling\", or dynamically changing classes at runtime) reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentJava is more like Objective-C and Smalltalk, than C++.

The type system is so much more powerful and expressive compared to Obj-C.There is only one downside, and it’s real. Compiling Obj-C was instantaneous.

Otherwise you can stick to pure C.Of course, C has a lot of ugly traps which makes it less than ideal for this domain. This hypothetical subset language addresses those issues. While, again, you would only reach for the &#x27;Objective&#x27; parts when your code benefits from being object oriented.It is true that the inherit dynamism of message passing makes static analysis impossible to cover all cases, but as with all things in life there are tradeoffs. You lose the nice aspects of object oriented systems if you do not allow for that, and OO is particularly well suited to UI code.Of course, Swift abandoned the object oriented model completely. Which is fine. But Objective-C showed that you can have your cake an eat it too, offering OO where appropriate, and a non-OO language for everything else.Objective-C&#x27;s downfall was really just in that C didn&#x27;t age well – which, among other things, I am sure contributed to seeing the use of the &#x27;Objective&#x27; bits where they weren&#x27;t really appropriate. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentSwift also does OOP, it did not abandoned anything. replympalczewski 13 hours agorootparentprevI’m in a similar boat.

They&#x27;re double- and triple-counting binaries: the slope of the Objective-C line and the slope of the Swift line are identical because nearly every added binary uses both languages. That doesn&#x27;t provide any meaningful information except that Apple is still using both.It gets worse when they get to the percentages: they list 61% as Objective-C&#x27;s number for iOS 17, but 61% of what? According to the raw data, Objective-C is used in 88% of all binaries on iOS 17, with Swift used in 25% (instead of the 17% they list). Their calculated numbers are derived from a denominator of 8723 binaries, even though they only have 6030 in their data set, because they wanted the numbers to add up to 100%. That makes a nice chart, but it has no meaningful interpretation. reply mplewis 5 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re essentially looking at a series of pie charts, and it does tell a useful story: that there is more code being written in Swift and SwiftUI year over year. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentThe problem is that the pie chart is lying—it makes it look like the percentage of binaries containing Objective-C is going down over time, but it&#x27;s actually going up just as rapidly as Swift is, because almost all added files contain both Objective-C and Swift. The only languages that are going down as a percentage of binaries are C and C++, because fewer new modules are being added using those.The reason why it looks like Objective-C is losing ground is that every Objective-C+Swift+SwiftUI binary increments the denominator by 3 instead of by 1, and there are more of those added every single year. Since each of those binaries only adds 1 to the numerator, Objective-C&#x27;s share of the binary pie seems to be decreasing even though it&#x27;s actually keeping up with Swift.It&#x27;s entirely possible and even likely that Swift is increasing faster than Objective-C in terms of lines of code, but this data can&#x27;t be used to show that. reply boxed 3 hours agorootparentI would guess that Swift isn&#x27;t increasing in lines of code as fast as ObjC, because Swift gets more done per line of code.

    "originBody": "Subscribe About Unauthoritative Pronouncements Please Pay For a Year of Nothing This morning, two emails came in from Apple. The first was about the upcoming renewal of my yearly subscription to Disney+ and the second email was about the price increase of my Disney+ subscription from $79.99 to $109.99. It took me all of 10 seconds to think about it, but I canceled my subscription. It’s not really about the $30 price increase, which is outrageous, but mostly because there won’t be 12 months of TV show and movies to watch, in no small part thanks to the actions of Disney’s CEO. I’m affected by the ongoing strikes, where the studios have once again walked away from the negotiating table. Almost all entertainment production has ground to a halt. The recent resolution of the WGA strike was celebrated, but it was a long, and painful process. All of our hopes, as workers in this industry, were pinned on the SAG-AFTRA dispute coming to a close. Instead, the studios decided to do what they did months ago in the WGA strike and take their case to the Hollywood trade publications owned by Penske Media in the hopes that they could gin up dissent in the union to push the union negotiators. It didn’t work with the WGA membership, and I don’t think anyone other than studio brass expects it to work on SAG-AFTRA either. There can be no resolution external to negotiation, so this just delays everything. Films and shows that were slated to come out this year have been spread out, some pushing to next year. You can only spread things out so far, and that is particularly true of all the studio streamers that got into this game late. When Disney+ first premiered it was criticized for only having The Mandalorian and WandaVision which were both over in the blink of an eye. Marvel, for me, has had diminishing returns since then, and I would not subscribe to Disney+ to exclusively watch anything from Marvel at this point. Star Wars, unfortunately, is also on the bubble with several disappointments, including the most recent Star Wars: Ahsoka where I watched 50 minutes of space whales doing space whale stuff. Stretching Star Wars: Skeleton Key and Star Wars: The Acolyte out into next year, with both unlikely to be as inspired as Star Wars: Andor doesn’t convince me that $109.99 needs to leave my bank account right this very minute. If anything I can always dip in if it’s good, or wait until it’s over and binge. A year of, basically nothing, isn’t a year I need to pay for. How Did We Get Here? Disney, and everyone else, sold streaming licensing rights to Netflix for many years. It was like selling the broadcast rights for a film to appear on an old-fashioned TV channel. Audiences were trained to expect streaming media. Bob Iger, infamously, compared this to arms dealing, in a metaphor that no one really thought he should be making. Then Disney’s contract with Netflix ended and they went direct to consumer with Disney+. I still remember the live-streamed shareholder meeting where Disney+ was first announced and Christine McCarthy (former CFO) outlined how the company’s low introductory price, and small number of territories, meant that it would be unprofitable for many, many years. Disney expected the stock market to treat Disney like they treated Netflix, which at the time was operating on a growth model. Everything was upended by the pandemic halting production, starving new services of new entertainment, and then by the Netflix Correction, where interest rates were up and shareholders wanted to see revenue off those subscribers, not just growth. That was not something Disney was prepared for, at any level of the company. Bob Iger’s plans for Disney+ had blown up spectacularly and his hand-picked successor was ousted, by himself, so he could fix his own plans. Unfortunately, he’s been one of the people chiefly responsible for the WGA and SAG-AFTRA issues this year. A lot of the assumptions based on the finances of streaming have to do with taking advantage of labor contracts that didn’t cover streaming well. The AI likeness issue is a huge deal for Disney, not just the money, and they would very much like to treat actors like ageless property that can be applied to their sprawling connected universes. Not a Boycott Neither the writers, nor the actors, called for boycotts of the streaming services. They want to work, and they want to be paid, which means people need to pay the studios. That’s the how the system is supposed to work. Hell, I have absolutely nothing to gain by people canceling their subscriptions. The only way I get paid is by the studios hiring VFX houses. Actors and writers don’t pay me. Having said that, I absolutely do not need to pay studios a yearly subscription for 2024. They haven’t earned that from me on a personal level. Also none of these streaming price hikes translate into any benefit for me, the pressure is still on cutting costs in producing content. What services every person choses to pay for are deeply personal, based on all kinds of factors, so there will be people for whom Disney+ is still essential, even without new content. Or they might be willing to step down to an ad-supported plan (I’m not). Disney+ does have an extensive library. Same goes for Warner Brothers Discovery’s Max, which has been rightfully criticized along the way because of David Zaslav’s bumbling, and attempts to stuff the service with lower-cost unscripted fare from Discovery. Smaller streamers are faced with these same problems, because they did what the big studios did, but they don’t have the libraries, IP, cash, or really anything to compete with the big studios. That’s why they’re small studios. It’s not that hard to understand, but it’s why Paramount+ following along has really hurt Paramount Global. While Comcast is huge, the part that’s a studio, isn’t (NBCUniversal). Outside Money However, things get a little more interesting with Netflix and Prime Video. My opinion of these services is not especially high. In the past month, Prime Video announced it was going to include ads in its previously ad-free entertainment, which was already intermingled with FreeVee ad-supported content. An extra recurring subscription can be paid to watch without ads. Amazon keeps tacking on all these fees onto a product that was supposed to be an all-inclusive affair. Like, that’s supposed to be their whole thing, you know? Their shows are generally expensive, and seemingly don’t do much to motivate any meaningful internal metrics for Amazon. It still pays to license some high quality TV shows and movies from others. That’s really its core value, that I’m not sure Amazon entirely understands. Netflix’s mediocre filler piles up more and more every day. Like a machine that only knows how to spit out half-packaged products. It’s biggest asset is its size. I wouldn’t say it’s too big to fail, but it’s too ubiquitous to ever fail quickly. Which is why they can continue to generally fuck up a lot, and do stupid shit. Shareholders have calmed down since The Netflix Correction, and they’re generally content. There are no concerns about Netflix ever ratcheting up it’s fees too high, the concerns are about the slow growth of their ad-supported tier to bring in more price-conscious consumers. The most recent stumble for Netflix has been in kid-focused animated entertainment. Their history was mostly with buying up stuff from outside companies (Mitchells vs the Machines is frequently cited as a Netflix film, but it’s a Sony Pictures Animation film that Sony sold off in the pandemic), until they started their own internal division. Then last week they announced they were killing projects and cutting staff. Then this week they announced they were going to be taking over Apple’s end of their deal with Skydance Animation. The animation company owned by nepo baby David Ellison, and headed up by the disgraced John Lasseter. David proved to the world that it was worth it to hire John by releasing Luck, a film that at best, was fine but not a critical or financial success for Apple. Netflix’s flailing with making their own films and TV shows kind of doesn’t matter because they’re so big that they can turn licensed library material into a phenomenon. The most recent example being the craze over Suits which originally aired on USA Network, owned by Comcast Universal. Comcast Universal can’t turn anything into a success because it entered the market late with Peacock, and no one could think of a reason to subscribe to it if they weren’t already a Comcast customer. This ability to turn something that could be a small success, and large financial loss, into a big hit by virtue of its ubiquity is what Netflix does best. To circle back to animation, this is also why the plug was pulled on the Paramount+ and Nickelodeon show Star Trek: Prodigy and it found a home on Netflix. Paramount Global will get money for something that wasn’t working for them, because Paramount+ isn’t ubiquitous. Netlfix has also licensed a bunch of HBO shows, which is hugely damaging to Max, because it trains customers to expect HBO shows eventually coming to Netflix, but does help Netflix with their quality problem. So Netflix increasing their prices to nearly cable-package prices? It’s not something I like at all, but it’s working for them because they’re basically a cable package of licensed stuff again, like they were before the studios panicked and tried to start their own streamers. They can weather anything 2024 throws at them because there will always be studios desperate enough to sell shows to them, even if that excludes Disney. The SAG-AFTRA dispute could go on for another year and they’d buy their way through it. As repulsive as that thought is, it’s true. The Lost Year There is, unfortunately, the very real possibility that nothing gets resolved before the winter holidays — or even if it does, productions won’t start ramping up until next January or February. When it resumes, it’s not like turning on a light switch. The entertainment industry works with overlapping schedules. This production starts while this one wraps, this is shooting while this is in post. You just can’t do everything in parallel all at the same time. That means we’re also going to get a trickle of finished TV shows and films. Even lowering the standards, and “putting a rush” on it doesn’t bypass everyone else doing exactly the same thing. That means that even if people aren’t anticipating the drop in stuff to watch, they will eventually realize that there’s not much new. It’s going to be much harder to get those people to resubscribe, at high prices, than it was to get them to subscribe the first time. I’m not sure what’s going to get me to reactivate Disney+, maybe it’ll be whenever the second season of Andor comes out towards the end of 2024 or early 2025, but it’ll just be the two months the show runs, and then I’m out again like the Falcon leaving the Death Star. Disney has lost yearly subscription rights in this household. A brand is a promise and the only promise I’m interested in from Disney is a single TV show, on a calendar far, far away. 2023-10-19 14:25:00 Subscribe About",

It was \"FAANG\" for a reason. Viscerally, Netflix doesn&#x27;t feel like it belongs alongside Google, but it did, because it was good.How does Disney fail to make money off Star Wars?

The only streaming app I have that is worse than Netflix is Amazon&#x27;s but that&#x27;s mostly because the UI is completely unusable on an Apple TV.

The end result in this house is that we barely watch anything on Netflix because new episodes aren&#x27;t tracked along with literally everything else that we&#x27;re watching. Doesn&#x27;t help that 99% of their output is lowest common denominator garbage; compare and contrast Dopesick on Disney+ and Painkiller on Netflix - the former being one of the best, most moving dramas I&#x27;ve watched in years, the latter one of the most superficial, turgid things I&#x27;ve watched. reply epups 3 hours agorootparentprevI disagree.

Even if you do a good job, that&#x27;s very expensive.

This is an edge case, not a purchase influencing decision. reply evilfred 8 hours agorootparentprevthis is factually incorrect. Disney bought a very successful sports streamer BAMTech to power Disney+ reply donavanm 8 hours agorootparenthuge +1. I havent worked in the encoding&#x2F;delivery&#x2F;CDN space for a few years but BAM was great. They aren&#x27;t \"pulling an HBO\" as far as I can tell; they skipped the painful build your own platform from scratch learning experience. _Maybe_ Disney could have taken a different business approach with licensing. And arguably they took a bath on Disney+ costs initially. But I certainly wouldnt fault their technical implementation nor would I guess that content management&#x2F;encoding&#x2F;packaging&#x2F;delivery is going to be a meaningful business problem for Disney+. reply schneems 8 hours agorootparentprevCan you tell me how that changes the story for you? reply evilfred 7 hours agorootparentit discounts the entire parent post. BAMTech wasn&#x27;t a shitty in-house development, it was a billion dollar buyout of the widely acclaimed MLB streamer. reply jrockway 7 hours agorootparentDisney is also a huge tech company, and has been one for a while.

How could I have forgotten a member of the vaunted FAANGB reply dv_dt 6 hours agorootparentprevNot really sure what is so bad about the delivery of Disney+, if anything it’s categorizations are cleaner and simpler (perhaps in part because they have less content). The ui is imho less annoying then Netflix. But I have both services and in the end there’s really not much difference in how well they stream. reply xctr94 2 hours agorootparentprevAs a Star Wars fan, Disney’s failure on this topic isn’t technical at all. The content is just mediocre; it doesn’t excite or motivate one to watch, it feels bland and commercial. What they’re doing to other franchises — and notably Pixar’s work — is quite similar. reply dayjaby 2 hours agorootparentprevSo now we start complaining about competition and not care about monopolies at all? You seriously want all the power given to Netflix? reply lathiat 8 hours agoparentprevI also enjoy every streaming service solving many technical problems the others have already solved.The most painful one for me right now is that Paramount+ has all their videos rendered with black bars top and bottom. So when I watch the latest Star Trek New Worlds and Star Trek Discovery on my 34\" 1440p ultrawide, it literally has a black border all the way around the edge. Watching the same episode on Prime Video, it entirely fills my screen.I&#x27;ve reported this to them a couple times over a year and they haven&#x27;t done anything about it. I imagine, most likely, this is possibly some kind of combination of compatability with some devices that need videos rendered at a certain resolution and not wanting to have too many different encodes of videos. But it is quite annoying not to be able to have the video fill my screen. reply wackget 8 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t that just a regular aspect ratio issue? If the content is filmed in 1:2.4 and you&#x27;re trying to watch it on a 16:10 screen, it&#x27;s always going to be letterboxed.In that case, if it doesn&#x27;t look letterboxed then it&#x27;s either stretched (deformed) or parts of the video are cropped&#x2F;lost. reply scubbo 8 hours agorootparentI think they&#x27;re saying that the base content _itself_ has the letterbox \"burned in\", so that when they watch it on their TV (with an wider ratio) it has black borders on all four sides - at the sides because of ratio mismatch, and at the top and bottom because they&#x27;re present in the base media. reply lathiat 6 hours agorootparentThis is correct. There’s a total black border on all 4 sides. Because the black bars are rendered into the top and bottom of the video. On a 1080p display it full screens fine but with a display with the native wide screen aspect of the actual video I can’t actually have it fill the screen.But only on paramount+This used to be a problem with VHS&#x2F;DVDs when widescreen TVs first came out. TVs often (and maybe still do) had a mode to zoom in to cut them off. reply NoodleDerek 8 hours agorootparentprevPeople expect black bats on the top or the sides but not both. reply chrisweekly 8 hours agorootparentIf it&#x27;s \"both\" someone somewhere messed up, if you&#x27;re in the 99.x% of users not experimenting with aspect ratios or resolutions. reply lathiat 6 hours agorootparentIt is both :)The problem is the black bars top And bottom are rendered into the video. I happen to have a 34” ultra wide which is the native aspect of the actual video. But I can’t actually watch it full screen. But only on paramount+. Works fine on Amazon. replyjayd16 10 hours agoparentprevWhy do you say it&#x27;s a fixed amount of content? Finite, sure, but it&#x27;s not fixed. reply fbdab103 9 hours agorootparentHowever, I doubt just because there are 4x streaming platforms there are suddenly 4x studios capable of producing even a low budget show. Knowing nothing of media production, but I assume there are a large number of technical roles which are advisable if trying to produce mainstream content. reply jayd16 7 hours agorootparentThere is certainly plenty of talent in Hollywood sitting around most of the time. Downtime is a well established phenomena of the business as you wait for another gig. Beyond that, there are plenty of people looking to break into showbiz. If you throw around money, more shows get made. Quality can thin as top talent is spread across more shows but we&#x27;re nowhere near the maximum throughput given infinite dollars.It&#x27;s not cost effective though.

Instead of six seasons of one show, you could just be getting one season each for six different shows.Hard to call that an improvement when it leads to shows getting cancelled right as they start to become interesting, leading to their storyline never getting resolved. reply jprete 9 hours agorootparentprevThis was also the period where Netflix et al discovered that shows become more costly to make and less likely to get brand-new subscribers around season 3. So it’s hard for me to give that statistic any weight. reply kaibee 8 hours agorootparent> This was also the period where Netflix et al discovered that shows become more costly to make and less likely to get brand-new subscribers around season 3.This isn&#x27;t the only reason I stopped watching shows, but its certainly a contributing factor. Kinda gets old seeing some cool first season setup a bunch of interesting story arcs, great show, etc and then cancelled. reply greiskul 8 hours agorootparentYeah, if Netflix wants to do short shows, they should follow the British model of TV series. Short series but with a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Not this bunch of half started stories that just stop. reply starttoaster 8 hours agorootparentNetflix is just following the Japanese model of animated series where you put out an incredibly strong season one and then cut all funding to it. reply ulucs 4 hours agorootparentMost of those are just advertisements for the source material.

I don&#x27;t know when? As long as the service has existed, most likely, and DVDs before that. Even so, by earlier this year I&#x27;d already been thinking about cancelling for a while. Much of their content seems pretty mediocre these days, and there&#x27;s just so much of it. When they cancelled a well executed first season show that was so clearly an introduction to a bigger story.. that really made the decision to cancel a no brainer. reply Tallain 8 hours agorootparentprevFor Netflix, it&#x27;s not just about new shows driving subscriber count. I&#x27;m probably summarizing incorrectly, but it also has to do with their royalty structure. Canceling a show after two seasons allows them to save a ton of money by short-changing their creators and stars, while still getting headlines about signing huge-figure deals with those same people.[source]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hollywoodreporter.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;general-news&#x2F;tvs-new-... reply forrestthewoods 6 hours agorootparentprev…huh?

Haha sorry, I had to! reply labster 8 hours agorootparentprevHonestly detective fiction is perhaps the worst format you could give for your example, because the structure of the story allows you to essentially tell a different short story with different characters every time. Moody Twin Peaks has almost nothing in common with the goofball Psych (except the one tribute episode). Inspector Lewis plots are complex and intellectual, while Castle is fluffy and predictable. Recipes for Love and Murder, Brokenwood, Midsomer Murders, and Murdoch Mysteries are more about life among the varied settings than the murders; the murders give us an excuse to explore the characters around them.Though maybe the most important point of that is that watching TV from different countries will make your viewing more interesting. reply salad-tycoon 50 minutes agorootparentSo you must like detective fiction, eh?You’ve won me over and to your point you can have a Fr. Brown (1950s Catholic priest detective) and a Dexter (blood splatter analysis turned serial killer).Now of course the basic premise is always the same good (but conflicted) guy sees bad thing done, investigates, finds bad guys and reconciles one small aspect of world and maybe one small aspect of self discovery.Heck, most shows have this arc now that I think about it from Sherlock to dr house to those criminal lawyer&#x2F;police shows. reply the_af 7 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. Police fiction is a good format.You can vary it by focusing on a realistic procedural, or the mystery, or ditch the mystery and just focus on characters.

And then on the opposite end you have people enjoying soccer who will be happy to tell you about the nuances between different matches, different players, different teams, etc. reply hn_throwaway_99 8 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the issue there that some people basically just don&#x27;t like soccer so they can&#x27;t appreciate the differences?I would put myself in that camp - watching soccer just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me that much, so it all kind of seems the same. But I can very much appreciate the differences to people that enjoy watching the sport, and I think this could be said about nearly any endeavor. reply harimau777 7 hours agorootparentI think that soccer has a problem where the goalies are so effective that the game often comes down to attempting to shoot on the goal as many times as possible in the hope that eventually the goalie makes a mistake. Things are made worse by the fact that when the goalie gets the ball they generally throw it most of the way down the field; effectively resetting the state of the gameplay.As a result, any given segment of the game is not particularly relevant to the outcome; what&#x27;s relevant is basically the overall time of possession&#x2F;goal attempts across the various segments of the game.Compare that to something like football where the outcome of a given play depends much more overtly on the play the QB decides to run, the skills of the players, how the strengths & weaknesses of the two teams match up, etc. In addition, there&#x27;s a greater degree to which the plays in a possession build upon each other in order to contribute or take away from a team&#x27;s ability to score during that possession. reply cool_dude85 7 hours agorootparentI dont have stats on hand but I promise you a relatively small proportion of goals are scored on keeper errors, even if you expand the category to \"shouldn&#x27;t be beaten from that angle\" type stuff instead of an explicit error. I suspect you do not watch much soccer. reply harimau777 6 hours agorootparentThe point that I&#x27;m trying to get at is that, I agree with you that there&#x27;s a sense in which different people are going to prefer different things, that people who are more invested in a given sport are going to be able to see more of the nuance in it, and that as someone who&#x27;s not invested in soccer there&#x27;s certainly a lot that I&#x27;m missing.However, I don&#x27;t think that it completely comes down to personal taste. There can still be areas where the flow of a soccer match can be more samey or less intrinsically exciting than in certain other sports.For example, soccer doesn&#x27;t have the same moment to moment, head to head, back and forth of something like tennis or boxing. That&#x27;s not to say that it completely lacks those moments of conflict; say when a defender is staring down an oncoming striker. However, as far as I am able to tell, they are less dense compared to something like a tennis match where they take up the whole of the playtime. reply codetrotter 8 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t the issue there that some people basically just don&#x27;t like soccer so they can&#x27;t appreciate the differences?Yep, hence the first sentence of my comment: “I think it comes down to personal taste.” :D reply gpspake 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s actually a pretty good analogy. reply hiccuphippo 8 hours agorootparentprevAh yes, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;915&#x2F; reply harimau777 7 hours agorootparentI kind of dislike XKCD strips like that because they seem to encourage people not to think. In actuality the issue may be much more nuanced:- Perhaps different things do have a greater or lesser degree to which they lend themselves to deep analysis & enjoyment- Perhaps engaging in meditative analysis of some interest such as wine is valuable in itself even if it is mostly arbitrary what people choose to analyze.- Perhaps the decision that wine is worth studying was mostly just an accident of history, but now that it&#x27;s become part of culture failing to engage with it represents a failure to engage with valuable cultural traditions.Any of those ideas and others might be worth agreeing or disagreeing with. However, it sometimes feels like people just read the XKCD comic and don&#x27;t think beyond \"wine snobs dumb\".Edit: To be clear, I&#x27;m not trying to say that the parent post is doing that.

Reducing copyright terms or eliminating copyright would have no effect on those works. So, either your argument is self-defeating, or losing access to works published in 1928 and later would impact QOL. It seems there must be a cutoff point, sometime between 1928 and 2023, where the QOL impact of new works ceased. Why is that -- what changed?And, once we find the cutoff point, can we make copyright terms for works published after that point infinite, since you don&#x27;t need them for QOL anyway? reply jeegsy 10 hours agorootparentprevI think this all the time too.

People that just have too much time on their hands. Or, at least, more time than they have executive function and willpower to fill it with actual activities. They are actively looking for any kind of media consumption to make the hands on the clock move faster.2. People for whom their time has value and products are competing to be the best use of their time.I see so many people who appear to be in the first category and will watch anything, even stuff they admittedly find boring, just to...

I think the problem is that passively consuming content is too easy, humans just aren&#x27;t really wired for it. I am certainly not immune to it. In say 1900 if you wanted to entertain yourself you could talk to people, you could listen to someone play music (live), you could play music yourself, you could write, you could tinker, etc. The most passive consumption was basically reading, which is still a rather active thing compared to scroll tik tok or watch netflix (or both).

    "originBody": "Home Articles Series Feedback Log in Just paying Figma $15/month because nothing else fucking works Oct 19, 2023 25 minute read rant · foss fasterthanlime Contents draw.io - the good draw.io - the bad Figma The worst possible business strategy: protestant ethics Penpot Closing words My family wasn't poor by any stretch of the imagination, but I was raised to avoid spending money whenever possible. I was also taught \"it's a poor craftsman that blames their tools\", which apparently means \"take responsibility for your fuckups\", but, to young-me, definitely sounded more like \"you don't deserve nice things\". I was also taught from an early age that I was born a sinner, incapable of doing good by myself, and that all the earthly things were temptations, sent by the devil to corrupt me (further I guess?) but also temporary, and that I shouldn't attach myself. I'm better now — thanks for asking. But I'm sure you can see why \"protestant ethics\" primed me for head-first into the pit of unpaid labor and burnout that is \"F/OSS at large\" (free and open source software, for the kids in the back). It's perfect: much like in the religious environment I grew up in, everyone is this close to permanently losing it, and there's an infinite supply of thankless work to be done, which means, and this is crucial: nothing you do will ever be good enough. In either place, there is no redeeming yourself. And sure, okay, the other thing that attracted me to F/OSS was, of course, the good parts: that you can look at how it's made, fix it up for yourself and others, etc. As someone most definitely somewhere on the spectrum, being able to stare at the inner workings of complex systems unperturbed, was just... I liked it, You know? Things have changed since, to some extent. The Early Unix Crowd lament having to think about languages other than C. We in the DevOps mines would pay good money never to have to speak YAML again. I get it: GCC 2.95 was an easier time. But, like Andrew Morton famously said: It's time to give up on it and just drink more coffee or play more tetris or something, I'm afraid. Source: LWN, The end of gcc 2.95 support Today still, if you try, if you really try, you can go in and try and modify your favorite software. But, and I wish 19-year-old me would've heeded that piece of advice, you always need to keep in mind that you're either spending time or spending money. Let me IMMEDIATELY add caveats there, because your gut reaction may be what mine was back then: \"Oh! you're one of those. The ones who put a number on everything, and make decisions based on those numbers\". Of course not! There's no poetry in accounting. And little point in counting if you're having a good time. Besides, when you are 19 / still a student / unemployed, time is all you have to spend, so the choice is made for you. And of course, it's really hard to qualify all the second-order effects \"spending time performing unpaid labor for various F/OSS projects\" has had on my career (for the best), my health (for the worst), etc. I'm not saying that to cause more anxiety over picking which thing to spend your time on: I think of it more like a good reason to spend your time on a lot of different things, and people, and ideas, because whether they go terribly right or terribly wrong, there's a lesson to be learned. And friend, do I have a lesson to share with you today. draw.io - the good I started writing sometime around 2019. Well. I've been blogging for a decade, which makes me part of The Old People In The Room at conferences now. The 60-year-olds and me, we have a good time. But I started doing serious, please-give-me-money technical writing around 2019. On a Lenovo X200, for street creds (and affordability) reasons. I needed to make diagrams, so I compared a few options and quickly settled on \"draw.io\", which has been semi-rebranded to \"diagrams.net\" the way Twitter has been semi-rebranded to X? The desktop app still calls itself draw.io, the file format is still .drawio, etc. It's an Electron app, unmistakably: ...but it's not in-your-face about it. It's rather consistent across Linux (GNU or not), macOS, Windows, and, now the most important shell of all: \"the browser\". And it's really good at diagrams. Nowadays you'd probably use something source-defined like Mermaid or one of the cool kids like Excalidraw, but draw.io is burnt into the memory of The Old Ones. Why? Because, like all good products, it started out with \"solving a hard problem\" better than anyone else. The hard bit was \"making a graph editor that could render to SVG and display in non-SVG browsers\", and if that sounds weird, that's because this happened forever ago: We created mxGraph in 2005 as a commercial project and it ran through to 2016 that way. Our USP was the support for non-SVG browsers, when that advantage expired we moved onto commercial activity around draw.io. Source: mxgraph README, History And I think this spirit, of \"taking the problem seriously\", permeated throughout almost the entire product and is one of the reasons draw.io felt so nice to use compared to, well, anything else at the time. What else was I supposed to use? Dia? Dia's download page offers binaries for Solaris 9 Sparc, and Irix 6.5. A German site, last updated 2014, offers Windows and macOS downloads: It's hard to describe the feelings conjured by looking at this Vista-ass screenshot, this large rounded download button with a best-effort glass effect, the subtle mix of serif and sans-serif fonts. The stock photo of a woman drawing a diagram on a whiteboard. The \"Donate via PayPal\" button. Heck, while we're hurting ourselves with nostalgia, here's the last release on SourceForge: That's not what SourceForge looked like when I got my start, but the smell is the same. Just look at those two lovingly hand-crafted .dmg files. No CI/CD there, just vibes. Remember Pidgin? Adium? I can do this all day. GitHub didn't just usher in a new era of collaboration, of new heroes and new villains, it also sent to the grave SourceForge, and an entire aesthetic with it. Personally, I don't miss it. draw.io - the bad But all good things must come to an end at some point, and for draw.io (and the rest of the world, for slightly different reasons), that was 2016. As the history section I quoted earlier covers: \"when that advantage expired (in 2016), we (jgraph) moved onto commercial activity around draw.io\". Now, it's more subtle than that. draw.io is still good, and the dealbreaker I'm about to cover pre-existed jgraph's shift to \"commercial activity around draw.io\". In fact, it's really important that there be a revenue source to fund continued maintenance of draw.io, so, as long as it doesn't mess with the main product too much, I'm happy! But that's when, for me at least, draw.io stopped investing in \"their own engine\" and fully committed to doing \"whatever the browser does\". The browser being, need I say it, Chrome. Of course, you could probably get Gecko to do it instead, but why go all the trouble to end up with a result that looks different from what you get in the Electron-based desktop app? At least the docs, and I would expect no less from jgraph, whom I respect, correctly describe draw.io's ability to do \"rich text formatting\" as simply \"being able to use HTML to style nodes\": Style part of a text label Text labels in shapes and on connectors can be formatted with HTML, so you can apply a style to part of a text label. For example, you can apply bold, italicise, colour, or a link to just one word. Source: draw.io FAQ Why does this matter? Because once you let HTML into your product, a product that, by nature, cares about the precise layout of things, you're fucked. You're fucked because, although I don't believe it's literally impossible to make your own browser (CW: Drew DeVault), it is several orders of magnitude harder than the hard problem mxGraph solves in the first place. Which is why I keep defending Electron as \"not that bad, actually, when you really think about it\" in a very old video I'm quite embarrassed about, and which thesis is essentially: there's more to it than you probably think (but you're very welcome to try). Of course, in another universe, draw.io didn't take the shortcut and didn't just say \"you can just put HTML in there\". In another universe, they only allowed bold, italic, underline, font-size and font-family... and line spacing, and letter spacing, and text alignment, and superscript and subscript and... ...okay you see my point about there being more to it than it seems now, but point is: they could've picked a limited feature set and just written their own text rendering engine. And then you wouldn't need Chrome's DOM, its layout engine and the PDF backend of its renderer to do a \"proper export\" from draw.io. But they didn't! And you do. Worse: I do, and the thing I actually do for this blog, because I've stopped \"just grabbing rectangular screenshots and pasting them onto my blog\" a long time ago (I blame HiDPI displays), is: Have a handwritten Rust app that.. ..launches headless chrome ..loads draw.io in it (from a hyper HTTP server) ..asks draw.io to load the .drawio file (also over HTTP) ..asks chrome to print to PDF (this uses Skia's PDF backend) ..opens that PDF using poppler ..exports it using cairo's SVG backend ..optimizes it using svgcleaner (which is unmaintained and will soon stop compiling) And then you get one of these, which looks crisp at any resolution and can be printed even if you don't have Iosevka installed on your computer: (Also, the workflow for me is great, I can just \"hit CtrlOrCtrl+S in draw.io\" and my ftl.localhost:1111 browser tab reloads with the new SVG asset). And because apparently \"putting all this together\" wasn't enough for me, I documented the whole thing. Like it was a normal or desirable thing to do. And the whole internet went YKINMKBYKIOK. Which, fair. Tired of reading? Aren't we all. How about a video instead? Figma But I started looking into alternatives, for a few reasons. One is that this whole contraption is, overall, pretty painful to maintain. My Don't Shell Out spends several chapters describing how I've managed to get the \"glib cinematic universe\" (\"gee lib\", not \"slippery\") to link statically on Windows, but I have since resigned myself to only run it on macOS or Linux, where nix is available and solves just about as many problems as it causes.

The other reason I started looking into alternatives is because alternatives started looking at me. In 2023, I was contracted to do some very interested work related to Figma, none of which I can talk about because I stupidly signed a very paranoidly-worded contract, which I will never do again unless I am literally on the verge of losing my home. But! It forced me to, you know, actually learn Figma. And, it's a weird and unfair comparison, of course, because draw.io is a diagramming tool and Figma is an interface design tool, but this thing is just built different. The first time I actually heard of Figma (this is how sheltered us software engineers are) was when someone asked me how I felt about them compiling Rust and C++ code to WebAssembly for a product that, fundamentally, feels like it shouldn't really require more than a buttload of JavaScript (maybe even TypeScript at that scale) and DOM crimes. Or perhaps canvas, if you really do care about pixel perfection and you're hell-bent on re-inventing the wheel. But care they did, and they didn't just reinvent the wheel: they changed the game. Evan Wallace has fantastic write-ups about some of the \"casual genius\" ideas he simply willed into existence during his tenure as Figma co-founder. Things like vector networks, which immediately impose themselves as clearly superior to the classical \"vector path\" model literally everyone else is using. Or like successfully migrating the server-side portion of their product from TypeScript to Rust, resulting in 3.8x smaller memory usage, 6x smaller CPU usage, 10x faster file serve time and 16.4x faster worst-case save time. The Figma team didn't solve one hard problem, they solved dozens. All while maintaining best-of-class UX and gaining the favor of designers everywhere. It's really hard not to like them. Even Adobe agrees. The worst possible business strategy: protestant ethics But! It costs money. You get 3 files for free to fully explore the product: beyond that, you need to shell out for Figma Professional, which will cost you $15/seat/month, unless you're comfortable with year-long commitments (I'm not), at which point it falls to $12/seat/month. And, I don't know if you remember from the intro but: I was raised on frugality. You don't understand. I'm talking about an entire community for which couponing qualifies as foreplay. I'm barely exaggerating. And I had big plans! In 2023 I announced I was building a team, so that I could \"produce more content\": everyone hates this way of putting it, and the \"content creator\" moniker, but \"teacher\" is a protected class and I haven't fully internalized the \"clown\" label yet, so it's a happy middle ground. And I did, for a bit! I paid two people for a few months, to help both with the \"content\" part itself (helping with research, triage ideas, follow up on drafts etc.) and on the \"platform\" part, because, part of the fun of \"working here\" is that everything is custom-made and wonky (as evidenced by the draw.io asset pipeline described above). At any other company, this would be a nightmare (and whew, have I been there), but here it's endearing and a feature: doing \"as much as possible\" yourself means having a lot to write about: the machine feeds itself. And I hate, hate per-seat per-month pricing, because everyone is trying to get in on it, and for small business, it adds up. To a point where one might be forgiven for asking themselves: \"if I just bite the bullet and learn Kubernetes, could I self-host all that and eventually save up money?\". This seems like hard work to get worse things. In other words: this is exactly how I was raised. Being a sinner from birth, I of course do not deserve nice things. Nor should I desire them. I will use whatever's in front of me, and I will be glad about it. If it's not suffering, it's not work. And if it's not work, it's probably \"of the devil\". Which brings us to Penpot. Penpot Penpot is not just a product, it's an idea. The headline, which takes up 10% of the viewport height on my browser, is: Bring Design Freedom to your Product Team Source: https://penpot.app/ at the time of this writing Followed by \"Sign up, it's free!\" and \"Self-host install\" calls to action. The next line is \"Penpot is the Open-Source Design & Prototyping Tool for Product Teams\". And at this point, you've used the labels \"free\" twice, and \"open-source\" once, to market your thing, and, uh, let's say charitably: \"I've been warned\". This is not just me being an asshole, by the way. There's a rich history of a vocal minority going \"you can't excuse everything by saying it's free software\" and being met with \"PRs welcome kthxbye\". This is tradition at this point. Perhaps even sport. Anyway: I was told a lot of good about Penpot. \"Of the free alternatives to Figma\", I was told (and this is key), \"it is by far the best\". But after spending a few hours trying to get anything done with it, my assessment is that, if this is true, then it's really not worth checking out any of the other alternatives. And I will describe my user story, but only after you and I agree that you could fix each individual issue I'll talk about, one by one, and it still wouldn't detract from my core argument. Deal? Deal. So! The Penpot homepage talks about its desktop app: makes sense, draw.io (although in a slightly different category, as I've already said) has one, Figma has one, the Penpot userbase certainly would like one, and so somebody made one. I hope this link still loads by the time you read this, because it is a forgejo instance which I can only assume runs on a Raspberry Pi on someone's desk. Just kidding, it's running on a Raspberry Pi behind Cloudflare. I guess only client-side software is evil or something. Anyway, the desktop app isn't official or officially supported (although to their credit, Penpot, or I guess Kaleidos, sponsors sudovanilla. I have no idea for how much). The way you should run Penpot is to... well you should just pay for a seat on their cloud offering but that's what we're trying not to do, so you're supposed to self-host it. The self-host page first suggests paying someone else to run it for you, a completely valid answer to that question (many people do that with Mastodon), but since I've never heard of Elestio and I'm already going the road less traveled... might as well go all the way. Again the self-host page hammers what is essentially their only selling point: it no cost money: For too long, a critical piece of the software development pipeline has been available solely via pricey proprietary SaaS subscriptions or Mac-only desktop apps. Penpot brings total freedom for teams by encouraging self-hosted deployments so you can take advantage of your security and backup policies, as well as extending and customizing your Penpot server the way you need. (Emphasis theirs, annoyingly). I'm not copywriting professional, but even I can recognize a piece of art when I see one. Anyway, option 2 is \"install with Docker\", which gives you a docker-compose file, good enough to run it on your MacBookPro for sure, but, and let me emphasize this: absolutely nobody should be running anything in production using a docker-compose file. What you're meant to do is, of course, run it on Kubernetes, which is largely the same (it's containers all the way down) except it's configured differently, you can now think about scaling out (on several nodes), you have actual health/liveness checks and policies for rolling out new versions, restarting, etc. It's k8s! We all love to hate it, but at least the industry has sorta standardized around it, so that makes commiserating easier. And because penpot is made up of three services (backend, exporter, frontend — not counting postgres and redis), although you could technically deploy all three of them separately, the idiomatic and era-appropriate thing to do at the time of this writing is to use a helm chart, which lets you deploy several resources at once. Nobody told me, but there is one place generally accepted as \"the helm chart search engine\", and it's ArtifactHub. Searching for \"penpot\" will turn up two options: one by CodeChem (last updated 9 months ago), and one by TrueCharts (last updated 6 months ago). I chose the former, not realizing it was pointing at the 1.16.0-beta tag for all three penpot images. After much trial and error, I came up with the following k3s manifest: YAML --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart metadata: name: penpot namespace: default spec: repo: https://charts.codechem.com chart: penpot valuesContent:global: # the plan was to eventually move this postgres DB to a proper postgres # operator like I do with the _other_ stuff I self-host, but I've stopped # caring in the meantime postgresqlEnabled: true postgresql: auth: postgresPassword: REDACTED redisEnabled: true config: publicURI: https://penpot.example.org flags: \"enable-registration enable-login disable-demo-users disable-demo-warning enable-smtp\" registrationDomainWhitelist: example.org smtp: enabled: true defaultFrom: penpotdefaultReplyTo: penpothost: smtp.sendgrid.net port: 587 username: \"apikey\" password: \"REDACTED\" tls: true postgresql: host: penpot-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local username: postgres password: REDACTED redis: host: penpot-redis-headless.default.svc.cluster.local # this is a recent addition, that overrides the version of the penpot # images being used. backend: image: tag: 1.19.3 exporter: image: tag: 1.19.3 frontend: image: tag: 1.19.3 --- apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: Certificate metadata: name: penpot.example.org-cert spec: secretName: penpot.example.org-secret issuerRef: name: letsencrypt-prod kind: ClusterIssuer dnsNames: - penpot.example.org --- apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRoute metadata: name: penpot spec: entryPoints: - web - websecure routes: - match: Host(`penpot.example.org`) kind: Rule services: - name: penpot port: 80 tls: secretName: penpot.example.org-secret And, well, it works! So it's got that going for it. I'm not sure why the preview for the \"wsl2-kernel\" file is missing (the URL just returns a 404): presumably one of the pieces is misconfigured in the helm chart, because the cloud offering gets it right: Recreating my boring old draw.io diagram in penpot felt like it took forever, but I chalked it up to \"being unfamiliar with the tool\". At first, exporting didn't work at all (it would just time out), but upgrading to the non-beta 1.19.3 seems to have fixed some of it. I can, for example, export to SVG now. It takes several seconds, and we end up with this: Looks fine! What's in there? For example, what SVG node type is it using for \"RAM stick #1\"? XML RAM stick #1 Right. Just a text node. This means you need to have the \"Iosevka\" font installed, which doesn't work for me: I want my SVG diagrams to be displayed exactly the same everywhere, so I want them to be paths. What if we use the same trick as with draw.io, and export to PDF first, then use cairo to convert that to SVG? It doesn't fucking work! We get \"generic serif font\" instead of Iosevka. You wanna know why? Well, it takes several seconds because what the penpot exporter is doing is, that's right, spawning a chromium instance and printing to PDF. (But hey, ClojureScript!) And I guess the thing that's supposed to give chromium access to the document's \"custom fonts\" is broken in some way. Because they didn't completely fumble this one: Penpot does have a proper \"Custom Fonts\" feature: It even detects mismatched vertical metrics and points you at this service to see for yourself, and Transfonter to fix it. I mean, it's not Figma's \"just install this native app and you can use all your fonts, even from a browser\", but: someone, somewhere, cared about this! However, it's also terrible, terrible news. Even if it did work properly, we're back to just \"doing whatever the browser does\" (the browser being, at least for now, universally, chromium) in terms of text layout and rendering. Which means export is always going to be slow, and if, like me, you're using the platform-appropriate browser in your operating system (Firefox everywhere if your fetish is Google-funded antitrust mitigations, and Edge on Windows + Safari on macOS otherwise), it's not going to match exactly what you see in the editor. I've also recreated the diagram in Figma, which was a much nicer experience, and not just because Figma is the original and Penpot is the copy, but also because... it works? Snapping works, and when 80% of your interaction with the software is \"moving/resizing things\", that matters a lot. Figma lets you adjust advanced stroke settings, so I can actually match the draw.io default: Exporting the frame to SVG is instant (it's all happening client-side) and should look the same for everyone: Because it's not using the SVG text node anywhere: it's using paths. The \"RAM stick #1\" string is just this (extremely long, cut for your convenience) SVG path: XMLAnd that happens to be exactly what I want, because, much like Figma, I care about precise design (them, because it pays. me, because I can). Even if my diagrams and figures are bad, I want them to look the same everywhere. Penpot didn't solve that hard problem. It's several huge engineering efforts away from solving that problem. In fact, I know they're never going to solve that problem, because they turned it into a selling point. See, Penpot isn't only bashing no \"pricey SaaS subscriptions and macOS-only apps\" (which is don't-sue-me speech for Figma and Sketch), it's saying how it's great that their flexbox model exactly matches the CSS one, saving valuable time when developers have to implement the designers'.. designs, as HTML and CSS. Well, no shit! It is the CSS model, since they don't have a layout engine. Figma is just from a different time, I guess. A time when you could afford to have \"design\" and \"implementation\" be separate jobs with separate expertise. When you could design for things other than the web. And when you could get paid $100K to quit school and focus full-time on tools like Figma, instead of whatever AI/ML slop everyone is being served now. Now that, I miss. Closing words I'll leave you with the synthetic version of this article, which motivated me to actually write it out for real: If I had a dollar every time I saw an \"open source\" project vaguely recreate a handful of surface-level features of some commercial solution then go \"there you have it folks, YOU'RE FREE\" while Nothing Actually Works, I would be able to, like, pay rent with it. Source: me, Mastodon and unfortunately, Twitter If the Adobe acquisition closes, then I shall mourn that, too. In the meantime: Figma's earned my $15 a month.

If I try to contribute code, project misalignment with personal values is going to make getting PRs&#x2F;patches approved a constant battle, and on the cash side of things it&#x27;s hard to justify spending on a project I may never find usable.This means that the number of FOSS projects I contribute to is much smaller than I&#x27;d prefer it to be. reply ozim 14 hours agoparentDon&#x27;t just go into blaming culture.Everyone should accept that is just super expensive to do good software. Money help, but it is also expensive in terms of focus and time. Having team of developers&#x2F;business analysts&#x2F;QA focused on one project is loads of money.Even for small team like 5 devs, 1 QA, 1BA - let&#x27;s say every team member gets roughly $6k a month that is like $42000 a month. Now question is how many features&#x2F;fixes can you do with that team? Well form experience you get maybe 8 big features, where big feature is like 2 weeks of work for a developer back and forth from QA and getting clarifications from BA, you have 5 devs but in reality there will be no 100% alignment and you still have bug fixes, busy work etc.So $42000 divided by 8 gives that any feature costs around $5250 to build initially and still might be having bugs and need for adjustments. But you have at any point in time at least 3 people looking at the feature and making it work&#x2F;finished.Now we can talk about culture where companies throw $5k at a feature on a whim, burn everyone&#x27;s time with useless meetings on VC fueled life support compared to FOSS where budget for a feature is more like $1k of whatever spare time some dude somewhere has and he is \"making the feature up, coding it and testing\" in most projects on his own. reply a1o 14 hours agorootparent> making the feature upThis is super hard, often someone will write a mindless issue with a feature request without thinking about it profoundly.Than the dev has to sift through the text to understand what is the underlying problem the user is facing, if the proposed solution is actually a good solution to that problem (it often isn&#x27;t), what is a solution considering long term maintenability, if the feature has synergy with future features or if it solves or is close to solve other already existing issue so the solution scope should be adjusted. The design stage is huge and it&#x27;s hard to do alone and also hard when other contributors only raise edge cases to try to break a proposed design without validating if the problem the developer extracted is adequate. The scoping and design is often very time consuming and hard to get it right. Usually you end up designing to the scope of available time to solve the issue at hand - time being a rainy Sunday afternoon, or around three and half hours. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentWhich is why you can be entirely helpful in an open source project even without knowing how to code. If you can learn the general program, and interface with the users as a liaison between the developers and the bug tracker, it can be quite valuable. reply mortenjorck 11 hours agorootparentAs a product designer, I naturally agree with this, but... are there any instances of this actually happening?I suppose there&#x27;s Blender, but it&#x27;s kind of a special case. reply beezlewax 7 hours agorootparentBlender is fairly amazing as a case though.

But these environments had great retention and long contractual notice periods, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.IMO the \"two pizza team\" isn&#x27;t as productive as people think. reply palata 11 hours agorootparentI am in a company where most of us are \"experts\" of one part of the system. This is very stressful (because when there is an emergency related to my part, I am the expert on whom management is waiting), annoying at times (because nobody cares about my part, they have their own stuff to do, so it&#x27;s hard to share), painful at times (when I&#x27;m struggling, I don&#x27;t really have colleagues who can help), and annoying again when someone is on holiday and we need a change in their part.Agreed on the handover cost, though (obviously).Not saying that 5 devs are required, but 1 is not always the nicest IMO. reply ajb 10 hours agorootparentFair comment - I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a panacea.

Same result. reply jahnu 14 hours agorootparentSometimes getting a contribution into a FOSS project is more difficult than proving your application will halt. reply josephg 12 hours agorootparentAnd for good reason. If you swoop in and add a feature I (as the maintainer) don’t care about, the maintenance burden for that code usually falls to me. I don’t want to spend my time maintaining someone else’s code for a feature I don’t care about. So yeah, I have higher standards for testing and code quality for 3rd party contributors than I have for my own code. I like PRs which fix bugs. But PRs which add features, without talking them through first? Ehhhhh reply jjoonathan 9 hours agorootparentSure, but that&#x27;s why I mentioned politics -- the particulars matter and there is plenty of ground for reasonable people to disagree.Judgement goes both ways. Maintainers are under no obligation to accept my code, but if enough maintainers stonewall enough of my code for reasons that I consider unreasonable enough then I&#x27;m under no obligation to write the code, either. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve gotten to. It wasn&#x27;t a short journey. Oh well. reply xtracto 11 hours agorootparentprevI make open source code for myself. I&#x27;ve done several minor \"contributions\" to different open source projects.Three examples:- Linux mint start menu isnt able to perform basic numerical computations.

Pr done as well- A Mint tray icon Applet for crypto was missing some functionality I wanted (dont remember what). I added it and made a PR.The first two PRs were rejected for whatever reasons. The last one was accepted and merged.I couldn&#x27;t care less about the first two, I made the code for me and it works for me. I just put it there in case the owners found it useful. If not, I dont care.Nobody is getting paid to do open source, there may be people who like the \"fame\", but myself? I just want to solve my problems. reply eviks 6 hours agorootparentBut solving your problems is easier if your patches are merged, less maintenance burden on your future self reply csnover 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is a secondary issue: Even on projects where someone is interested in doing polish work, since it usually takes longer to polish than to write a new feature, those who only care about writing features cause the backlog of things that need polish to grow infinitely.I don’t really know of a good strategy for dealing with this in FOSS. If a feature contributor doesn’t care about polish, and you say to them ‘please fix the UX’, they can just either ignore the feedback (‘perfect is the enemy of good! move fast and break things!’), or if they don’t have direct commit access, create a fork that they can then advertise as having lots of cool new features.I would love to know some strategies that work to strike a balance between not demanding perfection and not allowing garbage to be mainlined. reply jwells89 9 hours agorootparentThis is why I mentioned keeping a smaller, more focused feature set in several of my comments. Polish is much more attainable when features aren&#x27;t being added as frequently.That has to come from the top of the project&#x27;s management though, since they&#x27;re ultimately the ones responsible for policy and enforcement.My approach would be as I mentioned elsewhere: allow those wanting to contribute new features to do so, but make it clear that these features will be present in prerelease builds only until their quality meets the project&#x27;s standards. reply jwells89 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd that&#x27;s totally fair, but at the same time something of a catch-22. The most well-funded FOSS projects (and thus, those one is most likely to be paid to work on) are generally those that are more polished. What this means to me is that projects need to have a very focused featureset and polish culture from the very beginning to kickstart the virtuous cycle. reply nazka 45 minutes agorootparentprevI actually love polishing but not writing tests unless it’s with cypress. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentprevit&#x27;s also a lot to do with the types of people that do polishing&#x2F;artistic work are very different people from those that do the programming of the features.expecting an artist to be a good programmer or a programmer to be a good artist is just unrealistic. not a lot of artist attracted to FOSS&#x2F;github&#x2F;projects to go looking for things to do. probably a much better result from FOSS maintainers to jump onto Fivr and look for someone to do polish reply jwells89 12 hours agorootparent> not a lot of artist attracted to FOSS&#x2F;github&#x2F;projects to go looking for things to doIt happens sometimes but the aforementioned difference in mentality usually ends up with those artists giving up and moving on because of the friction involved. reply dylan604 10 hours agorootparenta healthy paycheck seems like the only thing that allows the two to work. and a shit load of managerial layering to run interference and cross-translate requests from either side. reply evilotto 12 hours agorootparentprevjwz dubbed this \"CADT programming\" reply opportune 14 hours agoparentprevI don’t mean to be snarky but you really just get what you pay for. A lot of FOSS is produced by people for fun, to solve a specific problem they have, or to learn&#x2F;play around with some technical concept.

GIMP will literally never replace Photoshop and the gap between them is only growing. How can a product that&#x27;s raking in millions of dollars a year ever be replaced by a few people working on it in their free time?When software was simple and if companies were just sitting still without continuing development, maybe. But most companies seem to be full steam ahead pumping everything in to research and development. reply opportune 9 hours agorootparentI think there are two competing truisms at play when comparing paid software to acceptable-ish FOSS software in the same space.One is that funded software is almost always going to be more polished and easy to use than unfunded software. The vast majority of successful FOSS projects are either funded by corporations directly or by nonprofits which usually are still getting most of their contributions from corporations. True volunteers have no incentive to fix your bug or provide support.Another is software provides diminishing returns the more it’s invested in past the point of viability. That’s partly because 95% of people need from the software comes from a small set of important core functionality, with the remaining 5% coming from everything else, but the 5% differing from person to person. Chasing that last 5% is not only very expensive and time consuming, it adds a lot of complexity and overhead. So there is a lot of FOSS that only solves up to the 95% point because it’s not too difficult and the people maintaining the FOSS have a different 5% than you do.Anyway, it may not be the case that all software will be FOSS any time soon and GIMP will replace photoshop, but I certainly wouldn’t consider GIMP a failure. If you just need something basic and free for some light editing it works fine. It’d be a shame if people with simple needs had no free alternative to expensive licensed software. reply Cyphase 8 hours agorootparentRelated to \"the 5% differing from person to person\":> A lot of software developers are seduced by the old “80&#x2F;20” rule. It seems to make a lot of sense: 80% of the people use 20% of the features. So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20% of the features, and you can still sell 80% as many copies.> Unfortunately, it’s never the same 20%. Everybody uses a different set of features. In the last 10 years I have probably heard of dozens of companies who, determined not to learn from each other, tried to release “lite” word processors that only implement 20% of the features. This story is as old as the PC. Most of the time, what happens is that they give their program to a journalist to review, and the journalist reviews it by writing their review using the new word processor, and then the journalist tries to find the “word count” feature which they need because most journalists have precise word count requirements, and it’s not there, because it’s in the “80% that nobody uses,” and the journalist ends up writing a story that attempts to claim simultaneously that lite programs are good, bloat is bad, and I can’t use this damn thing ’cause it won’t count my words. If I had a dollar for every time this has happened I would be very happy.Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2001&#x2F;03&#x2F;23&#x2F;strategy-letter-iv... reply MaKey 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are excellent projects like Blender which proves that high quality FOSS products can be done. reply opportune 9 hours agorootparentCheck out some of the names on fund.blender.orgI think a lot of people have this misconception that FOSS is produced by volunteers working for no pay.

Both contributors and target audience values features and configurability, and \"unpolished\" parts (mostly meaning you need to click 2 submenus more, you need some config to be set or script it yourself) are not a problem. This is the very antithesis of a for-profit company being laser focused on some customer group and wanting to be cost efficient with resources. reply opportune 13 hours agorootparentKind of agree, kind of don’t. A lot of companies also bolt on as many features and integrations to their products as they need, to close sales or just because they think it will help expand their potential customer base. A lot of FOSS is maintained by people who don’t want to spend their free time shepherding some code they wrote turning into everything-software either.There is a particular failure mode in FOSS though - normally in businesses, prioritizing new features is done on the basis of how it will ultimately affect revenue (or reduce costs, simplify things, reduce maintenance burden - still money at the end of the day). For those FOSS projects that are open to new features from randoms, those individuals are mostly adding features they individually want, and the amount of investment in those features is limited mostly by their level of personal interest. So you end up with a set of features that is more stochastically chosen, and some unimportant or minor features may have a huge amount of complexity&#x2F;configurability&#x2F;feature-specific code because one person needed it. reply jwells89 14 hours agorootparentprevLack of polish also extends to some of the things like the TFA mentions, like incomplete SVG export functionality.Either way, I don&#x27;t believe that polish and FOSS feature abundance necessarily have to be at odds; it just means that the project in question needs to have a process for developing new features to production-readiness. This can take form in any number of ways, for example using feature flags to keep things that aren&#x27;t yet fully baked enabled only in beta&#x2F;alpha builds — people happy with a less polished experience can use betas until the feature they need is ready for primetime while the greater userbase gets a better user experience. reply paxys 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not really about culture.

The problem is that the \"polish\" you mention is what takes up the vast majority of development effort and costs, and FOSS projects just aren&#x27;t that well funded.

So yeah... there are good, average and bad FOSS projects just like there are good, average and bad proprietary projects.Then, you have identified some characteristics of FOSS projects: some do tons of things somewhat passably (that&#x27;s typically the case when the maintainers try to accommodate the contributors), some don&#x27;t do much and don&#x27;t get many contributions, some don&#x27;t do much and just refuse contributions that the maintainers don&#x27;t care about, etc.But you have to understand that maintainers don&#x27;t all have the same goals. I don&#x27;t know if you have ever been a maintainer, but users can be real jerks. Almost blackmailing the maintainers (\"if you don&#x27;t implement this feature I won&#x27;t use your software for free\"), sometimes even being aggressive (\"this project sucks, I spent 2 days trying to understand how to do that, if I had a choice I would use something else but I don&#x27;t want to pay\"). Almost nobody says \"I will pay you to implement this feature properly and I don&#x27;t expect you to maintain it for free forever\".It&#x27;s hard to be a maintainer, and if you manage to do a good job and went for a permissive license, chances are that people (companies) will just use it without contributing anything back (not even honoring the attribution clause, because 99.999% of people don&#x27;t understand that permissive licenses require attribution).IMO companies would have to contribute much more if everything was copyleft (at least MPLv2). reply dandelany 13 hours agoparentprevUnsurprisingly, the first 90% is a lot more fun than the \"second 90%\" (polishing)... reply eddiewithzato 10 hours agoparentprevI don’t think a FOSS user facing product can actually work well.

There aren&#x27;t enough human hours to go around.Figma has ~1000 employees last I checked, and Adobe has nearly 30k. Orders of magnitude larger than most OSS projects.So a lot of the time in OSS you end up choosing the work that keeps people interested (because often you don&#x27;t have the money to do so).

I&#x27;m not aware of Inkscape supporting that, and I suspect that even if it somehow does, it&#x27;ll require many more clicks.Draw.io is good enough for a one-off usecase, but if you&#x27;re creating a couple diagrams and consider your time to have monetary value, the better usability of Figma means it&#x27;ll pay for itself really quickly. reply rice7th 13 hours agorootparentYes but figma wasn&#x27;t made for diagrams either.

One or both nodes connect to a special node at the centre of a shape.Inkscape automatically makes that be a straight line trimmed to the edges of the shape(s. You can move the shapes and have the line move too. If you move the path itself it turns back into a regular path.The path is just a straight line as mentioned and there&#x27;s certainly no routing logic. reply rice7th 3 hours agorootparentprevMy point is: does figma have it?

As is using native text nodes. Converting to paths is a postprocessing step and not difficult to do.The hard part is making a WYSIWYG editor, which both Figma and Penpot accomplish beautifully.

It&#x27;s more than good enough to stand people writing snarky hot takes to increase their blog viewership.It just turns out that the economics of open source aren&#x27;t necessarily a good fit for every use case. It&#x27;s just not going to win everywhere for every user.I&#x27;ll give you an example: computer algebra and graphing.Open source we have maxima (and wxmaxima). It is.... well weird but highly functional. It crashes from time to time but when it&#x27;s not crashing you can do a lot with it. Every plot has thousands of options and you sort of need to specify most of them to get anything that looks half-decent. For some reason I don&#x27;t fully understand you have to specify gnuplot options as well as maxima options sometimes but it&#x27;s nice that it supports both of them. It&#x27;s an absolute labour of love by the team who develop it.Paid for there is Mathematica. If you&#x27;re a student it&#x27;s like 75 bucks a year but if you&#x27;re trying to use it in industry it&#x27;s nearly 4 grand. Per user per year. It can do basically the same sort of thing as maxima but the graphs look amazing out of the box, the options aren&#x27;t weird, there is support etc etc.Now here&#x27;s the thing: Maxima is much better than Mathematica at certain things. And it&#x27;s free. But it&#x27;s really weird and some simple things are hard (like just graphing 2 2-d plots on the same axis) until you get the hang of it.

    "originBody": "Jump to Main content Search Account Newsletters Log in Subscribe POLITICS Exclusive: Tech billionaire Peter Thiel was an FBI informant Peter Thiel became an FBI informant in the summer of 2021, Insider has learned. John Lamparski/Getty Images; Rebecca Zisser/Insider MS Mattathias Schwartz Oct 19, 2023, 4:30 AM PDT Peter Thiel has worn many hats over the years: Silicon Valley founder, Trump megadonor, cryptocurrency booster, democracy skeptic. But there is yet another facet to Thiel, one that has remained secret until now: FBI informant. In the summer of 2021, Insider has learned, Thiel began providing information as a \"confidential human source,\" or CHS, to Johnathan Buma, a Los Angeles-based FBI agent who specializes in investigating political corruption and foreign-influence campaigns. Advertisement Charles Johnson, a longtime associate of Thiel's and a notorious figure in the far-right movement that Thiel has subsidized for a decade, told Insider in a statement that he helped recruit the billionaire as an informant by introducing him to Buma. A source with knowledge of Thiel's relationship to the FBI, whose identity is known to Insider but who insisted on anonymity, corroborated Johnson's account, telling Insider that Johnson brokered a relationship between Thiel and Buma. Insider was able to confirm through an additional source that the FBI added Thiel to its formal roster of registered informants. Another source close to Thiel told Insider that while they could not confirm that Thiel was a CHS, Thiel did speak to Buma occasionally. The source said that any assistance Thiel might have provided to the FBI should be understood as part of Thiel's gradual distancing of himself from Trump and the broader MAGA movement, which has vigorously criticized the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies. Valuable information on a recurring basis The FBI maintains a vast network of informants to keep tabs on organized crime, terrorist threats, extremist groups, and other criminal and intelligence targets. These sources, according to the bureau's Confidential Human Source Policy Guide, are more than casual tipsters. Confidential human sources enter \"into a relationship with the FBI, and that relationship will forever affect the life of that individual,\" the guide says. \"[They] will be either an 'FBI source' or a 'former FBI source' and, in turn, his or her conduct or misconduct will reflect upon the FBI.\" As such, the process for recruiting and maintaining such sources is highly regulated, requiring multiple layers of approval. Only people who are able to provide \"valuable information … on a recurring basis\" are granted CHS status, according to the policy. Then President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with Peter Thiel during a meeting at Trump Tower in December 2016. Years later, Thiel would become a confidential human source for the FBI. He was directed not to report on his interactions with Trump or other US political figures, an associate said. Drew Angerer/Getty Images As a CHS, Thiel was assigned a code name and an internal serial number to track his reporting. The information he passed on about foreign contacts and Silicon Valley intrigue was reviewed and \"validated,\" or cross-checked against other sources, by his case agents and their colleagues. Thiel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Thiel spokesperson stopped responding to inquiries after being told that Insider was reporting on Thiel's relationship with the FBI. The FBI's national press office and Scott Horton, an attorney who represents Johnathan Buma, both declined to comment. Advertisement No reporting on political ties Thiel is a citizen of Germany, the United States, and New Zealand; as of last year, he was reportedly in the process of acquiring yet another passport, from Malta. In 2016, he donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign and endorsed him from the stage at the Republican National Convention. After Trump won, Thiel served on his transition team. Johnson, who said that he was also an informant for Buma, told Insider that he believes that Thiel's reporting to the FBI was largely limited to foreign contacts and attempts by foreign governments to penetrate Silicon Valley. Thiel has publicly called on the FBI to investigate Google's ties to the Chinese government. Thiel, Johnson said, was directed by the FBI not to report on his interactions with Donald Trump or other US political figures. Many of the politicians that Thiel has bankrolled — including Trump, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Blake Masters, a former Arizona senatorial candidate — have repeatedly attacked the bureau and its leadership in public. In 2022, Vance, whose campaign and affiliated PACs received a total of $15 million from Thiel, falsely claimed that the FBI had illegally wiretapped Trump's phone. Vance accused the bureau of \"harassing faithful Christians\" and pledged to block all of President Joe Biden's Department of Justice nominees in retaliation for the Trump prosecutions. (Most but not all of Thiel's donations occurred in early 2021, before the launch of Vance's campaign and the many false claims he made over the course of the race.) While serving as an FBI informant, Thiel bankrolled the campaign of now-Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance has made a number of false and disparaging claims about the FBI. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Masters, whose campaign received $20 million of support from Thiel, has endorsed the false conspiracy theory that undercover FBI agents fomented the January 6, 2021, insurrection and accused the FBI agents who executed a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago of \"going after President Trump because they hate him.\" (As with Vance, most but not all of Thiel's donations to Masters occurred before Masters made his most inflammatory and baseless statements during the later stages of his campaign.) Thiel is reportedly planning to sit on the sidelines of the 2024 election. Neither Trump, Masters, nor Vance responded to requests for comment. Doing business with the FBI Some of Thiel's business interests rely on the FBI and other government agencies as potential revenue sources. He retains a 10% stake in Palantir, a data company that has sold more than a billion dollars of software and related services to the federal government, including the Pentagon, the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the FBI. A $250 million contract with the US Army in September adds to the evidence that Palantir is essentially \"a government service provider,\" a financial analyst said. Advertisement Thiel also backed Boldend, a spyware company marketing itself as an American competitor to the Israeli NSO Group, Forbes reported last year. NSO's products have been bought and tested by the FBI. (Mithril Capital, another entity Thiel cofounded, was reportedly a subject of FBI interest in 2019, although nothing appears to have come of the inquiry. Mithril's co-founder did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI did not respond to a question regarding the Mithril matter.) Johnson, who revealed Thiel's FBI ties, is a tech investor and far-right agitator with long-standing ties to both Thiel and to the network of MAGA political operators surrounding Trump. He claims to have had a hand in founding Clearview, a facial-recognition startup, and Traitwell, a genomics company. According to Forbes, he worked with Thiel to help vet and select senior staffers for the Trump transition in 2017. Johnson claimed to be an FBI informant in a lawsuit he filed against Clearview's founders. He told Insider he recruited Thiel to serve as a CHS and introduced him to Buma, the FBI special agent who was Johnson's handler. Charles Johnson (left) with Rep. Matt Gaetz (right) and Gaetz's now-wife Ginger Gaetz (center), in 2021. Johnson told Insider that he brokered an introduction between Thiel and the FBI special agent who would become his handler. Charles Johnson It's unclear whether Thiel remains a CHS for the FBI. Johnson told Insider that he believes that the relationship has been severed but declined to offer details; Buma wrote in his statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was ordered to cease contact with all his sources in late 2022. Johnson's ties to Trump and Thiel are well-documented. But he is also a self-identified \"troll\" with a history of spreading false information and smearing his rivals. In this instance, his claims are corroborated by two additional sources, as well as supported in part by a third who says Thiel and Buma spoke occasionally. 'Join up or get crushed' Buma came forward in August as a whistleblower, alleging that the FBI under Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr shut down his efforts to determine whether Rudy Giuliani had been compromised by a Russian asset. Insider was the first news organization to report on his claims. In a statement prepared for the Senate Judiciary Committee, Buma said that FBI headquarters had closed his most valuable human sources, including one code-named \"Genius,\" who had reported on far-right figures involved with planning the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Johnson told Insider that \"Genius\" was his CHS code name. Insider was able to confirm Johnson's identity as \"Genius\" with two additional sources. The statement does not mention Thiel. Advertisement Thiel speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2016. He donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign in 2016. He backed MAGA-aligned congressional candidates in 2020 and 2022. He has said he will be staying on the sidelines of the 2024 presidential race. Alex Wong/Getty In a written statement to Insider, Johnson said he was stepping forward as a CHS to support Buma's effort as a whistleblower to bring about what Buma believes to be necessary reforms in how the FBI handles informants. Johnson said that he was exposing Thiel's work as a CHS as retribution for what Johnson perceives to be bad decision-making by the Founders Fund, Thiel's venture-capital firm. Johnson also told Insider he felt betrayed that Thiel did not invest in Johnson's own startups, which he had expected Thiel to do in exchange for introducing him to Buma. Johnson said that he told Thiel that by offering the FBI a window into his contacts with foreign governments, he could demonstrate his loyalty to the United States. He described Thiel's motivation for working with Buma as a kind of hedge in an environment where extravagant wealth no longer affords the safety it used to. He pointed to ProPublica's reporting on Thiel's income-tax avoidance and the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who had reportedly scheduled several meetings with Thiel. \"I told him to join up or get crushed,\" Johnson said. The FBI's recruitment of Thiel as a CHS puts him among the bureau's most prominent assets, but he is not alone among right-wing figures who have collaborated with the bureau. Trump himself offered to help the FBI fight organized crime in Atlantic City in the early 1980s. Truth Social, the Trump-owned social-media company, has quietly tipped the FBI off to users who threaten violence, even as it seeks to cash in on their anger. At least two of the rioters who showed up to storm the Capitol on January 6 were also FBI informants, as was Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other felonies stemming from the Capitol breach. Tarrio reportedly served as a source for federal and local law enforcement, assisting with the prosecution of more than a dozen people.

Thiel has publicly called on the FBI to investigate Google&#x27;s ties to the Chinese government.Seems like a lot of words to leave this comment buried in the middle of. The story seems like a soup of hopeful political operators trying to sow chaos, and since they&#x27;re all on the same side, the publisher is happy to oblige. Talking to the IC at all gives them the unlimited option to call you an informant if you ever get involved in something counter-establishment anyway.One gets the impression that part of America&#x27;s new class system is whether you are connected to the intelligence community somehow, as if you have a certain level of responsibility at all, someone who knows someone always seems to be in touch or within a degree of separation. reply silenced_trope 21 hours agoparentYikes is that really an \"FBI informant\"?It sounds logical, consider this news item from yesterday: \"Five Eyes intel chiefs warn China&#x27;s IP theft program now at &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; levels\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;five_eyes_china_espio...Should people here really just accept other nations blatantly stealing and \"infiltrating\"? reply papercrane 20 hours agorootparent> Yikes is that really an \"FBI informant\"?It pretty much is a textbook definition of an FBI informant.

Don&#x27;t want to be \"outed\" as gay? Perhaps don&#x27;t fill your social media with pictures of you partying on gay cruises.2.

He is a billionaire who bankrolled multiple people&#x27;s campaigns for federal office in the last few years. Your average HN commenter does not approach that level of power and influence and never will.The problem I see is that these people think that \"telling\" on criminals and international intelligence operations is wrong, for some reason. That&#x27;s weird and really negative for our country. reply oooyay 19 hours agorootparentThe kind of mental arm wrestling you just engaged in to explain that point is why \"punching up\", which usually involves some amount of drift from norms and ethics, is problematic.

It&#x27;s pretty simple: anyone \"taking shots\" at him on Hacker News is definitionally punching-up because Thiel has more power and privilege than anyone here, power and privilege he routinely exercises on local and national stages. I don&#x27;t have any issue with his actions working with the FBI here for what it&#x27;s worth. reply oooyay 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the timing. There&#x27;s a time for rife comments aimed at Peter Thiel; I have plenty of those. As I put it before, when a gay man is outted in explicitly stated retributive fashion for being a CHS informant for doing his duty as a defense contractor it starts to color the people who are doing the punching. The whole situation should give us pause, not the reflex to punch someone. reply HelloMcFly 15 hours agorootparentIf Alex Jones was in the news for carrying someone out of a burning building, I&#x27;d be acknowledging his good work while continuing to \"punch up\" on him due to his behavior that seemingly seeks to destroy civilized society (an exaggeration, but not a wild one). Someone doesn&#x27;t get a free pass from earned mockery on an article-by-article basis, Thiel&#x27;s civic duty to the FBI in this instance isn&#x27;t some temporary hall pass for his tangible support for fascistic policies and politicians.That&#x27;s he gay is only relevant to you in this conversation, the person critiquing the critique. Why does that somehow give him extra victim status? Thiel is not subject to the power or cultural dynamics individuals in marginalized groups often are. He&#x27;s being treated like Charles Koch would be were he to do the same thing - that&#x27;s equality, baby. reply anigbrowl 16 hours agorootparentprevNobody gives a shit about the fact that Peter Thiel is gay.It&#x27;s the palling around with fascists and having massive reach into the political and defense spheres that makes people dislike him. reply jonathankoren 12 hours agorootparentAnd let’s be honest about Thiel. He was in the glass closet. Literally everyone in SV knew he was gay. He didn’t hide it.

How does criticizing someone in a greater position of power involve drift from ethics? reply sva_ 12 hours agorootparentBecause it implies that the metaphorical &#x27;violence&#x27; against people you consider &#x27;up&#x27; is morally justified, which it is not. It is merely ideologically justified, in some limited circles. reply anigbrowl 4 hours agorootparentOh, you&#x27;re not allowed to express abstract opposition to people in positions of power now? Nonsense. American political language is awash in fighting metaphors. One of Thiel&#x27;s more famous investment, Anduril, is named after a fictional sword; if he gets to invoke the idea of weapons then you have no standing to complain about other people&#x27;s rhetorical selections.If you are looking for something to get upset about, try looking at people who send non-metaphorical threats of violence to librarians, schools, and the like on the regular. reply t-3 19 hours agorootparentprev> The problem I see is that these people think that \"telling\" on criminals and international intelligence operations is wrong, for some reason.

Not telling a teacher? Sure. Ragging on someone for telling the FBI about a murder?

It is not revealed who Thiel was informing on and 2. To the extent a target could guess, Thiel is very well equipped to protect himself from physical threats. Further, it doesn’t seem Johnson is implying physical retribution, it seems more like (arguably) he’s trying to expose what he sees as some sort of ideological hypocrisy. So any harm would be reputational (and debatable) if that’s the case.Many sources for news articles act out of self interest, whether to benefit themselves or hurt an enemy, so that would not be inherently disqualifying.(Not endorsing the presumed logic just describing it.) reply donkeyd 21 hours agoparentprevYou comment made me do a bit of research.

That is orthogonal to Thiel&#x27;s involvement.That being said, Gawker never \"outed\" Thiel. The man&#x27;s social media profile pictures and galleries were full of him shirtless on gay cruise liners. And whether you agree or not, courts have repeatedly held that billionaires are considered \"public figures\" by virtue of their \"outsized influence and impact on public affairs\".These are reasons Gawker was never successfully sued by Thiel.A fundamental concept of our legal system is the right to face your accuser. Thiel and his lawyers manipulated Hogan like a puppet:* Hogan had already settled with the person who leaked his video (for 1&#x2F;5000th of the amount he would later claim from Gawker).* Hogan had reached a tentative settlement with Gawker that would include part ownership of Gawker, and entitlements to profits.Then along come Thiel, and he offers to pay for lawyers, or use his lawyers (how that&#x27;s not a conflict, I don&#x27;t know - what if what Hogan wants conflicts with what Thiel, the person paying the bills, wants, how does your lawyer ethically reconcile that?)And when they do, damages were upped to ridiculous levels. Financial&#x2F;economic (note: NOT emotional distress, which was claimed separately) damages of fifty million dollars.Fun fact: Hogan&#x27;s net worth in 2007 at his divorce was $30M, and at the time of the video publication, $8M.I&#x27;m not sure how someone whose career earnings were estimated at $15M could claim, with a straight face, that the video being published cost him $50M in purely economic damages... from what? Did networks stop re-running old Wrestlemania episodes as a result? His burgeoning retirement celebrity endorsement income?And when everything was settled, Thiel&#x27;s lawyers had Hogan withdraw the one claim that would have allowed Gawker&#x27;s liability insurance to kick in.Weird, huh? You&#x27;re interested in owning a part of a media company, and getting a share of their profits, but \"your\" lawyers tell you to withdraw a claim, knowing that the only possible outcome of doing so will be immediate insolvency and bankruptcy.However reprehensible Gawker was in this, there absolutely a wide crevice where there are perfectly valid ethical questions about Thiel&#x27;s involvement and motivations in this whole debacle. reply marban 20 hours agoprevSilicon Valley meets The Blacklist reply WarOnPrivacy 12 hours agoprevMy first exposure to Thiel was from his revenge campaign to destroy Gawker.[a]Two lessons became cemented in unbreakable stone for me.1) Enough money will eventually bend any justice system to your will.[b]2) Threats to news orgs&#x27; existence will bloom after press gives a pass to the previous threats.[c][a] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;peter-thiels-plan-to-des...[b] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;billionaire-backer-palan...[c] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cjr.org&#x2F;first_person&#x2F;amazon-roy-price.php reply A_D_E_P_T 11 hours agoparent> Enough money will eventually bend any justice system to your will.[b]Not \"any.\" The US legal (don&#x27;t call it justice) system happens to be extremely corruptible, in a sort of \"de facto\" sense, because securing representation in court is extremely expensive, and everything secondary to representation -- depositions, expert witnesses, investigations, etc. -- is also extremely expensive. In the end, virtually all civil cases become wars of financial attrition.But it&#x27;s possible to imagine different systems that avoid this sorry outcome.It&#x27;s as simple as making trial lawyers, still called \"officers of the court,\" actual employees of the court. Assign them at random to litigants or defendants, just as judges are assigned. What one litigant gets (e.g. should one side request depositions or expert witnesses) the other also gets on an equal basis.You could pay &#x27;em out of taxpayer dollars, and it would hardly register a blip in civic&#x2F;state&#x2F;federal budgets.

Generally, libertarians believe in taxation only for essential government services, but policing is definitely considered essential to libertarians. It is central to the ideology.Colloquially, anarcho-capitalism is sometimes also referred to as libertarianism. Those who subscribe to anarcho-capitalism believe in stateless societies, of which taxation would be incompatible. However, Thiel purports to be a libertarian in the stricter sense.

Think of how profitable the oil companies with gas stations are. Tesla SuperChargers are miles better than the competition. If people are already going to buy and EV from the legacy automaker because of design or brand loyalty, etc. Tesla might as well make recurring revenue on selling them the energy to charge.Yes, on the margin some people might prefer to buy a non-Tesla car if they know they can use the supercharger network, but the positive experience of the Tesla charger will influence more people to buy a Tesla vehicle.The only downside is if there are queues at the superchargers because too many non-Teslas are charging too slowly…But then, as others have said, it just creates an incentive for Tesla to build more chargers and capture more charging infrastructure market share. reply resolutebat 4 hours agorootparent+1 to all that. Having experimented both with non-Tesla chargers and non-Tesla EVs, the Supercharger experience is just head and shoulders better. With a Tesla, plug in and go; with a non-Tesla at a Supercharger, select the bay from the app, plug in and go.But with non-Tesla chargers, half the time they&#x27;re down or fully occupied because there&#x27;s one or two stalls, not 4-96 like Superchargers. If you find a free one, you need to download some dinky app and validate your account and punch in your credit card details and then it fails half the time anyway. Gar! reply Corrado 2 hours agorootparentYour experience mirrors mine. On a recent trip to the UK we rented a Tesla Model 3 and the Supercharging experience was a breeze; no trouble at all. However, there was not a Supercharger near the hotel so I had to use another vendor and the experience was terrible. Not only did I have to download yet another app, I had to pre-load the account with money. That was even before having to find the charger, activate it, make sure it worked, change to the other one when it didn&#x27;t work, etc.The whole experience was horrible and helped me understand why some people don&#x27;t think electric cars will ever take off. In fact, I think that the non-Supercharging experience is so bad that it is actively harming EV adoption. So, the sooner that Supercharging can be adopted the better.NOTE: NACS is a charging standard and not limited to Tesla Superchargers. My hope is that when other companies (ChargePoint, EVAmerica, etc.) adopt the standard and start providing NACS charging locations they won&#x27;t screw it up as badly as they have with CCS. reply dabinat 10 hours agorootparentprevTesla was coming under pressure from the government and may have wanted to get ahead of potential regulation.

Tesla still can offer better UX in areas where they have a good coverage, but other manufacturers are catching up to that too.So maybe Tesla has realized their advantage won&#x27;t last forever?

Automakers did not build their own networks, so they must now contribute to have access to something required to encourage EV sales.Gas stations (very roughly speaking! lots of Superchargers are colocated at grocery stores, malls, and other places humans can comfortably dwell for 15-30 min) don&#x27;t want to front the hundreds of thousands of dollars per station for the equipment, so Tesla did. Paid for out of Model S and X margins early on, and more recently through profits from total sales. Remember, fuel sales are razor thin margins, pennies per gallon. The profit is on the snacks in the gas station store. Similar with fast DC charging, it is not a profit center due to demand charges (utility charges for pulling megawatts of power on demand) and charging infra capex [1] [2] [3]. But you must have this network to soothe range anxiety, as non Supercharger networks in the US are frankly garbage (as the Dept of Energy Secretary recently discovered on a PR EV roadtrip [4]).> “To dive deeper into this sum-of-the-parts valuation, we modeled & projected out Tesla’s supercharger network, taking into account access & revenues from other OEMs using stations across the United States.

Legacy auto is selling autos, and only autos. Charger access deals unlocks revenue for Tesla out of legacy auto&#x27;s pockets today while legacy auto has to figure out how to sell their own EVs in the future, and what choice do they have but to pay up if they want to sell EVs?> After a decade of being trounced by Tesla Inc., this was supposed to be the year that traditional automakers finally put up a fight for electric cars. General Motors was committing its biggest brands to a new line of electric models; Ford and Volkswagen were ramping up production of EVs designed for the masses. It was, many predicted, time for the automotive world order to re-assert itself.> Things haven’t turned out that way.

At the same time in the US the largest EV manufacturer is slowly taking shape without the federal government taking any action at all to standardize chargers. Now it&#x27;s 2023 - the Tesla connector is superior to the European standard, European EV companies still lag behind and the Tesla standard is being adapted by the industry without any government intervention. reply stetrain 8 hours agoparentThe connectors between the North American version of CCS (CCS Type 1) and the European version (CCS Type 2) are different. The NA connector had some clear disadvantages, mainly in its locking mechanism.The NACS standard uses CCS communication protocols. So it&#x27;s as related to European CCS as CCS Type 1 was.And in Europe Tesla uses CCS Type 2 without any discernible issues. In fact the Tesla&#x2F;NACS connector would be a significant downgrade for the European market because Europe frequently uses 3-phase AC for charging and Tesla&#x27;s connector does not have the pins to support that.Tesla opening their connector last year in the US, branding it as the North America charging standard, and working with other manufacturers to get their support was driven by government intervention, namely the Infrastructure Bill which requires use of a charging connector used by multiple brands to be eligible for federal funding to build chargers.I think Tesla&#x27;s connector is great but you&#x27;re missing a lot of context in your story. reply 616c 8 hours agorootparentThis context you provide is interesting.

It can&#x27;t support anywhere near the power delivery CCS 1 or 2 can, when 800v architecture cars are now commonplace.It&#x27;s sheer fantasy calling it better than CCS2. What should have happened is someone should have mandated CCS2 for the US.It&#x27;s not that Tesla&#x27;s connector is better (CCS1 has the same communication&#x2F;payment stuff Tesla&#x27;s does), it&#x27;s that the US used a installation grants and legal settlement to build out a bunch of charging infrastructure with no requirements for availability&#x2F;reliability. So, shockingly, lots of charging stations went in and nobody gives a shit about maintaining them.The only problem CCS1 has is the shitty mechanical design that can&#x27;t handle heavy cables. It&#x27;s a problem that could be worked around simply by installing a hanging arm that supports the cable or handle. But again, there&#x27;s no incentive to fix it. reply stetrain 8 hours agorootparentNACS supports up to 1000V charging, which can easily match CCS on total charging power for 800V+ cars. There has not yet been a large rollout of 800V+ NACS chargers but Tesla is about to begin installing them, and any other charge provider (ie Electrify America) that has said they are adopting NACS can also provide 800V+ charging at equivalent speeds to their existing CCS chargers.NACS is basically CCS Type 3 at this point. It&#x27;s a compact connector that is backwards-compatible with (most of) Tesla&#x27;s existing Supercharger network while being compatible with CCS on a voltage, power, and communications protocol level.Really the winning feature is less the connector, and more the install base of reliable chargers from Tesla (and the trajectory of their future buildout). reply mycall 7 hours agorootparentprevEEL ShorePower basically did the same thing for boats.

There’s not much to be told from the ‘sociotechnical’ perspective (users don’t really buy a car because of the way the plug feels or looks), but the regulatory aspect is fascinating.EU we’re well intentioned to regulate a standard as it drives efficiencies across infrastructure and provides some stability for manufacturers who might be nervous about entering an unproven market. However, it’s clear that they introduced it prematurely as the technology and requirements were yet to be ironed out.I would hold that there will be an easy fix to this problem - maybe a drop in replacement to support regional differences, or a power adaptor (similar to the travel adaptor market that supports the current list of 15 odd mains connectors)?At any rate, if the global market does need to be normalised, the transition period will no doubt be slow and somewhat inconvenient, potentially requiring support for multiple standards at both charger and vehicle.Edit: reading through the comments here, it seems that there is an sociotechnical angle in terms of ergonomics, as some cables can be bulky or difficult to handle. (Are they any worse than a bowser handle though, and do people actually have an opportunity to do AB testing in showrooms, which are often catered towards a single brand?) reply stetrain 7 hours agorootparentEurope seems to be doing just fine with their CCS Type 2 connectors and network. Tesla uses the CCS Type 2 connector in that market on all of their cars and chargers.If anything their public charging network is significantly denser and more interoperable than in North America.The US basically failed to achieve a workable public charging network, which has led to Tesla&#x27;s buildout lead and the current situation where they are opening their connector to become eligible for future federal funding and to bring the other manufacturers on board with their connector and network.I don&#x27;t think the story of this being a clear cut policy win of US vs EU checks out so cleanly as the commenter above is trying to make it. reply clouddrover 9 hours agoparentprev> Now it&#x27;s 2023 - the Tesla connector is superior to the European standard, European EV companies still lag behind and the Tesla standard is being adapted by the industry without any government intervention.This is a misunderstanding of the situation.

Most of what’s superior about owning a Tesla is that the chargers are better maintained and placed in more&#x2F;better locations. Heck, Electrify America wouldn’t even exist if the VW dieselgate scandal didn’t happen. The problem with CCS isn’t the connector, it’s that most companies who run US charging stations are doing it halfheartedly.I think it’s also in bad taste to have a main point that European-style regulations are inferior to the American laissez-faire system without very much commitment to the facts surrounding why those regulations are supposedly “bad.” I can’t think of many metrics where the US leads Europe in terms of transportation. It seems to me that EU regulations help do things like keep pedestrian deaths and average MPG&#x2F;emissions lower than the US.Heck, the EU has double the EV adoption rate of the US.

Coordination problem maybe. reply lchengify 7 hours agoparentTesla tried out battery swap stations about 7 years ago [1]. They assessed that demand wasn&#x27;t high enough. Basically, it cost money to do battery swaps (which paid for battery swap infrastructure), whereas supercharging was just the cost of electricity.On a first principles basis this kind of makes sense. Supercharging has effectively no moving parts. The plug doesn&#x27;t even have a tab. That&#x27;s less maintenance and pieces that can break over time. On the other hand, battery swapping has a ton of moving parts, and would require the car to have additional hardware.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tesla_battery_station reply ghayes 6 hours agorootparentIsn’t there also a concern on battery quality?

Another one is battery quality and care. When a battery pack has a high residual value, and you&#x27;re taking it with you, there is a real risk of quality mismatch, fraud, theft, and abuse in and around the battery swap. I may have a brand new car, with a near perfect battery; if I go on a trip and do a couple of battery swaps, I&#x27;m going to be pretty unhappy if the battery I get back at the end of the chain of swaps is 5 years old with only 75% original life.That&#x27;s even before the risk of malicious owners.

NACS&#x27;s communication protocol is the same as CCS, and adapters exist in both directions.NACS&#x27;s plug is smaller because the primary pins support both AC and DC. CCS uses separate pins for AC and DC. Also NACS locks the cable on the car side while CCS locks on both sides. That means with CCS, a malfunctioning cable can strand your car.The main downside of NACS is that it doesn&#x27;t support three-phase, but neither does CCS1, which is the version of the CCS standard used in North America and Japan (where household three-phase is rare).

Credit: NASA An international team of scientists has discovered a huge spike in radiocarbon levels 14,300 years ago by analyzing ancient tree-rings found in the French Alps. The radiocarbon spike was caused by a massive solar storm, the biggest ever identified. A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for modern technological society—potentially wiping out telecommunications and satellite systems, causing massive electricity grid blackouts, and costing us billions of pounds. The academics are warning of the importance of understanding such storms to protect our global communications and energy infrastructure for the future. The collaborative research, which was carried out by an international team of scientists, is published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences and reveals new insights into the sun's extreme behavior and the risks it poses to Earth. A team of researchers from the Collège de France, CEREGE, IMBE, Aix-Marseille University and the University of Leeds measured radiocarbon levels in ancient trees preserved within the eroded banks of the Drouzet River, near Gap, in the Southern French Alps.

Analysis of these individual rings identified an unprecedented spike in radiocarbon levels occurring precisely 14,300 years ago. By comparing this radiocarbon spike with measurements of beryllium, a chemical element found in Greenland ice cores, the team proposes that the spike was caused by a massive solar storm that would have ejected huge volumes of energetic particles into Earth's atmosphere. Edouard Bard, Professor of Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and CEREGE, and lead author of the study, said, \"Radiocarbon is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere through a chain of reactions initiated by cosmic rays. Recently, scientists have found that extreme solar events including solar flares and coronal mass ejections can also create short-term bursts of energetic particles which are preserved as huge spikes in radiocarbon production occurring over the course of just a single year.\" The researchers say that the occurrence of similar massive solar storms today could be catastrophic for modern technological society, potentially wiping out telecommunications, satellite systems and electricity grids—and costing us billions of pounds. They warn that it is critical to understand the future risks of events like this, to enable us to prepare, build resilience into our communications and energy systems and shield them from potential damage. Tim Heaton, Professor of Applied Statistics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, said, \"Extreme solar storms could have huge impacts on Earth. Such super storms could permanently damage the transformers in our electricity grids, resulting in huge and widespread blackouts lasting months. They could also result in permanent damage to the satellites that we all rely on for navigation and telecommunication, leaving them unusable. They would also create severe radiation risks to astronauts.\" Nine such extreme solar storms—known as Miyake Events—have now been identified as having occurred over the last 15,000 years. The most recent confirmed Miyake Events occurred in 993 AD and 774 AD. This newly-identified 14,300-year-old storm is, however, the largest that has ever been found—roughly twice the size of these two. Tree rings of a buried subfossil tree in the Drouzet river. Credit: Cécile Miramont The exact nature of these Miyake Events remains very poorly understood as they have never been directly observed instrumentally. They highlight that we still have much to learn about the behavior of the sun and the dangers it poses to society on Earth. We do not know what causes such extreme solar storms to occur, how frequently they might occur, or if we can somehow predict them. Professor Bard said, \"Direct instrumental measurements of solar activity only began in the 17th century with the counting of sunspots. Nowadays, we also obtain detailed records using ground-based observatories, space probes, and satellites. However, all these short-term instrumental records are insufficient for a complete understanding of the sun. Radiocarbon measured in tree-rings, used alongside beryllium in polar ice cores, provide the best way to understand the sun's behavior further back into the past.\" The largest, directly-observed, solar storm occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. It caused massive disruption on Earth—destroying telegraph machines and creating a night-time aurora so bright that birds began to sing, believing the sun had begun to rise. However, the Miyake Events (including the newly discovered 14,300-yr-old storm) would have been a staggering entire order-of-magnitude greater in size. Subfossil trees in the banks of the Drouzet river. Credit: Cécile Miramont Professor Heaton said, \"Radiocarbon provides a phenomenal way of studying Earth's history and reconstructing critical events that it has experienced. A precise understanding of our past is essential if we want to accurately predict our future and mitigate potential risks. We still have much to learn. Each new discovery not only helps answer existing key questions but can also generate new ones.\" Cécile Miramont, Associate Professor of Paleoenvironments and Paleoclimates at IMBE, Aix-en-Provence University, said, \"Finding such a collection of preserved trees was truly exceptional. By comparing the widths of the individual tree rings in the multiple tree trunks, we then carefully pieced together the separate trees to create a longer timeline using a method called dendrochronology. This allowed us to discover invaluable information on past environmental changes and measure radiocarbon over an uncharted period of solar activity.\" More information: Edouard Bard et al, A radiocarbon spike at 14,300 cal yr BP in subfossil trees provides the impulse response function of the global carbon cycle during the Late Glacial, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences (2023).

Choosing a single worst case for design is a product of manual design processes. With modern computer technology we can run multiple cases easily, so we can now use probabilistic engineering techniques.In the future it won’t be “this bridge is good for 1 in 100 year storm” but “this bridge has a 99.99% chance of surviving every storm during its design life.” That will include the very rare events beyond the 100 year horizon. reply ssnistfajen 7 hours agorootparentprevMitigation ≠ total preventionIt&#x27;s really not that hard to see this isn&#x27;t a binary choice. reply _3u10 7 hours agoparentprevWasn&#x27;t society supposed to collapse from Y2K too? The people doing this research need funding, and no one is going to give them funding unless, it&#x27;s to make sure that this won&#x27;t wipe out society.If the grid collapses in any meaningful way because of a solar storm, we&#x27;re all f&#x27;ed, try rebuilding the grid without a grid. Something tells me this won&#x27;t happen.I&#x27;m guessing what actually happens is a few breakers trip, the grid is out for a few days and we&#x27;re back up and running a few days later. reply bradgessler 7 hours agorootparentY2K supports the point that something should be done. The reason nothing terrible happened is because lots investment was made in remediating the issue. reply _3u10 7 hours agorootparentI doubt anything in the electrical grid or that mattered actually cared about the two digit year being 00.

Solar storms cause low-frequency fluctuations that can induce significant currents in very long conductors (like hundreds to thousands of kilometers). It&#x27;s a very big deal for large-scale electrical grids and any copper communication, but it doesn&#x27;t matter for anything that isn&#x27;t hooked up to such networks. reply deepmauka 10 hours agoparentprevI had a similar thought, if high energy particles damage&#x2F;affect DNA could these events contribute in some way to a period of more pronounced speciation? reply cyberax 7 hours agorootparentJust moving from a seashore to foothills of a mountain will have a vastly larger effect. reply dakial1 18 hours agoprev>A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for modern technological society—potentially wiping out telecommunications and satellite systems, causing massive electricity grid blackouts, and costing us billions of pounds.I wonder if any country has a disaster recovery plan for this kind on event. reply ryanblakeley 15 hours agoparentI interviewed a guy from the NOAA to ask about that. The gist is 1) the military has hardened satellites 2) they have a phone-tree system for alerting grid operators and 3) many high voltage transformers have back-up systems in hardened storage.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryanblakeley.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;solar-flare reply idiotsecant 9 hours agorootparentI won&#x27;t comment on 1 and 2 but 3) is laughably untrue. I guess the word &#x27;many&#x27; might be stretched to mean &#x27;a few&#x27; but I&#x27;ve worked at more than one very large utility directly as an engineer responsible for design of large generation and transmission interface systems and these transformers are not only not spare, they&#x27;re almost impossible to get quickly even at current market demand. If you toasted even 10 percent of the large generation and transmission transformers in North America it would be years before the grid would even come close to working again, and that&#x27;s if there was nation state level resources applied.These are specialized machines that require specialized labor and specialized materials from a specialized international supply chain to construct. I&#x27;d make the bet that total recovery would be decades. reply breezedream 12 minutes agorootparentAny thoughts on how the situation compares in Western Europe? Too many disparate systems, or…? reply foobarian 8 hours agorootparentprevThis keeps coming up and I keep wondering how in the world are large transformers that complicated to build.

Another way of thinking about it which might be helpful is. Hundreds or thousands of very talented engineers have been working non-stop for 150+ years in a transformer arms race.This has resulted in incredibly high performance designs and incredibly high requirements. reply callalex 17 hours agoparentprevWe could always fall back to running the internet with RFC1149https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1149 reply divan 17 hours agorootparentSome hope on Colapse OS [1] perhaps?[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;collapseos.org reply MisterTea 16 hours agorootparentThe only hope is one can find the now obsolete computing parts needed after the last modern computer stops working.

Even if a storm fries all electronics on one side of Earth, there will remain devices, networks, and factories on the other side, likely somehow protected by the bulk of the planet. reply btilly 15 hours agorootparentNot true.The flare itself is fairly fast. But the issue is charged particles that take longer to get us. And they are spread out in time.As https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;carrington-event describes, the Carrington Event was a solar flare lasting only 5 minutes.

There are ways to protect the system, but a captured Washington regulation system has not pushed for these simple steps.A hostile power aside, our expert guest tells us an EMP hit is “inevitable” within the time of those living now, because the Sun can also crash our electrical systems world-wide.A large solar storm, big enough to do it, was seen in 1859. It’s called the Carrington Event. If part of the Sun blows our way, all satellites are knocked out. The wires of our electric system act like antennae, receiving the deadly pulse.\"I doubt the doomsayer timetable but the industrial capacity and delivery concern is absolutely valid.If this actually happened, I think community solar would be choked as it gets ramped up everywhere at once and some neighborhoods would have power centers to go charge lithium ion portable power packs as the overall grids become decentralized. Shelf-stable, non-refrigerated food would become the norm and people would just make do with less electricity. We&#x27;d go back to a cash economy and things like night time entertainment that relied on sound systems and electric lights would become almost non-existent. Without street lights, nighttime in general would be dramatically quieterThe real problem would be people who have to use battery powered medical devices who don&#x27;t have convenient ways to charge.But yes, huge problem regardless reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentReturn of the gas lamps!Seriously though.

Ordered by Executive Order 13744 signed by President Obama in 2016. reply KMag 16 hours agorootparentI believe the FEMA plans are for Carrington event-level storms, not a once-in-15,000-years storm. reply KMag 17 hours agoparentprevBeing properly prepared for a once-in-15k-years storm would likely require such a cost over such a long time for the expected benefit that it&#x27;s not worth it. Hardening infrastructure against extremely rare disasters likely means less infrastructure, and probably fewer social programs.Sometimes the objective rational choice is to do nothing for the mega-disasters and instead just prepare&#x2F;harden for once-a-century or once-a-millennium event. reply mytailorisrich 16 hours agorootparentI believe that solar storms able to cause widespread havoc on our modern infrastructure are a much more frequent occurance.The Carrington event in 1859 caused serious damage to telegraphs, for instance.It&#x27;s a risk that is more once a century than once a millenium... so we may very possibly see one this century.Considering how reliant we are on electricity, if everything goes down for more than a couple of days at most there is bound to be extremely serious civil unrest on a global scale: just imagine no access to money and thus not being able to buy food, fuel, etc. and then supply chains shutting down anyway. reply KMag 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m aware of the Carrington event, which is why I mentioned being prepared for 100-year or 1,000-year events. The GP was specifically asking if any governments had plans for \"a similar storm today\", where the referenced storm is this one found in tree rings, not the Carrington event. reply mytailorisrich 16 hours agorootparentSimilar event has to be understood as meaning able to cause havoc because that&#x27;s what matters over the specific strength. reply KMag 16 hours agorootparent> because that&#x27;s what matters over the specific strength... but the specific strength does come into play when discussing the costs of hardening and mitigation.This event is twice as powerful as the previously known largest event. reply btilly 15 hours agorootparentAnd all of the events it is being compared about are at least an order of magnitude bigger than the Carrington event.This should not surprise us, by the way. I&#x27;d expect major solar storms to follow a Zipf&#x27;s law distribution: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zipf%27s_lawThat means that the power is inversely proportional to the frequency. This is common. You see it in word frequency, river length, population sizes of cities, etc.So over a 15,000 year period, the biggest solar flare should be about 2x as big as the next biggest. And random Miyake events, which we&#x27;ve had 9 of over roughly 50,000 years, should be about 10x as big as a once every 160 year event like the Carrington event probably was.All very rough, of course. But it may help give some intuition. reply chakalakasp 15 hours agorootparentprevThis event is twice as powerful as the previously known largest event, which is at least 10X as powerful as the largest event in recorded human history, back in the 1800s, which set telegraph poles on fire. So, yeah, it&#x27;s a big Twinkee. reply m_0x 15 hours agorootparentprev> if everything goes down for more than a couple of days at most there is bound to be extremely serious civil unrest on a global scaleForget about civil unrest. Chain of command in the military goes down and every unit is on it for themselves. Imagine generals not knowing if the President is still alive. reply sgu999 16 hours agorootparentprev> Hardening infrastructure against extremely rare disasters likely means less infrastructure, and probably fewer social programs.Or less dividends. This solar storm is a very extreme example, but we&#x27;ve all witnessed how greed got us very unprepared for a pandemic, climate changed induced weather events, new wars, etc. reply KMag 16 hours agorootparentBut lower dividend yields mean lower yielding retirement funds, with quality of life effects downstream from that.Now, there&#x27;s plenty to be said about the funding side of the equation to improve wealth inequality and&#x2F;or increase budgets, but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the spending-side necessary tradeoffs to harden against extremely rare disasters.In other words, supposing you had the political pull to get more money entirely from the richest 0.01%, 1%, or 5% (and putting aside that not everyone agrees that would be good), that extra money would probably still be better spent on more infrastructure and social programs, not on hardening against extremely rare events. reply TheOtherHobbes 16 hours agorootparentWhy does it have to be either&#x2F;or?Planetary GDP is around $85tn annually.The US military budget on its own is around $1tn.One-off mitigation costs followed by annual maintenance would barely be a rounding error on that.They&#x27;d have the added benefit of hardening systems against hostile EMP, which is a more likely threat. reply KMag 15 hours agorootparentEdit: simplified version of my assertion: current budgets are X. It would cost Y to harden infrastructure against an event 10 times as large as the Carrington event. Even if it were trivial to increase the budget from X to X+Y, it&#x27;s probably not a good use of money to perform such extreme hardening. This is true for all positive finite values for X and Y in a world where we still have cancer, heart disease, poverty, etc.If I read you correctly, you&#x27;re making an argument regarding the marginal effort to increase the budget by Y.My argument is about the millions of things we could do with Y that would be more beneficial to human flourishing. Even if it&#x27;s trivial to increase the budget by Y, that doesn&#x27;t imply that it&#x27;s trivial to increase the budget by Y enough times to run out of more important things to do.Q: Are governments prepared to handle a solar storm 10 times as big as the Carrington Event?A: Probably not, and that&#x27;s not something we should fault them for or worry about.Original (longer) argument:It&#x27;s possible that hardening against a Carrington-level event is a good use of money, but that&#x27;s not the original question. The original question is about an event 10 times as big, twice as big as the previously known largest event.If I understand your assertion, you&#x27;re asserting that the money could easily be raised with little downside. Maybe it can be. For the sake of argument, I&#x27;ll grant you that.But my assertion is that it&#x27;s not a question of if the money could be raised to harden against a 15k-year solar storm. My assertion is that even if the money were already in hand, hardening against such an extreme event is probably not worth the cost.Whatever the budget is, it will be finite. Given present technology, whatever that budget is, it won&#x27;t be sufficient to give all people worldwide a utopian lifestyle while fully funding all promising medical research, etc. Tradeoffs will need to be made. Hardening against a 15k-year event an order of magnitude more powerful than the Carrington event is probably not the best use of finite budget.If I could start a side gig in a polka band and sell plasma to raise enough money to make my Florida home polar bear proof, that wouldn&#x27;t have any bearing on the wisdom of polar-bear-proofing a home in Florida. Even assume that cost were the only downside to polar-bear-proofing a home, the availability of the money wouldn&#x27;t be the problem with the plan. The problem is that the other things I could do with my limited resources would be much more beneficial. Yes, all else being equal, a polar-bear-proof house in Florida is better than a non-bear-proof house in Florida. In the real world, all else is not equal.There is almost always a trade-off. Some risks aren&#x27;t worth mitigating, and we&#x27;re better off accepting them than either worrying ourselves over them or wasting limited resources on unwise mitigations.My point is that a lack of political will to come up with the funding isn&#x27;t the biggest obstacle to such extreme measures.Perfect safety is a bad goal, and worrying that we aren&#x27;t perfectly safe is unwise.Edit: if I&#x27;ve missed something and you&#x27;re talking about some hypothetical world where we&#x27;ve already solved cancer, heart disease, poverty, wealth inequality, climate change, polio, dementia, put basements &#x2F; tornado shelters in all of the houses and trailer parks in Tornado Alley, figured out why the laundry always contains an odd number of socks, etc. Sure, then if we could scrounge up enough money to harden against a solar storm 10 times as powerful as the Carrington event, then go for it. reply nickpeterson 11 hours agorootparentFlorida has enough crazy exotic animal people that I bet the polar bear example isn’t as far fetched as you think. reply KMag 9 hours agorootparentI picked polar bears assuming probability of zoo (public or private) escape or ice age over the next 15k years means there&#x27;s some real, but minuscule, risk. replyForHackernews 15 hours agoparentprevIn the UK, the National Grid Operator maintains \"black start\" plans[0] for rebooting the entire national electrical grid from a zero power situation, and they pay individual plants to conduct annual drills.

However these days there&#x27;s enough warning and contingencies to mitigate the worst of these effects; i.e. preemptively shut down vulnerable power systems. The grid \"crashing\" and needing to do a cold start is still very bad, but far better than also getting damaged.----Edit: I also want to point out that the above is specific to \"on the ground\" effects as we&#x27;re shielded by earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Satellites still get bombarded directly with heavy radiation&#x2F;particles, which is much closer to an EMP in terms of acute impact. reply ianburrell 10 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that solar storms and high-altitude EMPs have similar effects. Both energize the upper atmosphere which induces currents in long conductors. High-altitude EMP does not harm electronics.It is close-by EMP from nuclear blast that harms electronics. reply sjducb 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a reference for that difference in EMP and solar storm? I tried to research this once and couldn’t find anything reply _3u10 7 hours agorootparentprevHopefully one day we&#x27;ll have a grid designed to carry high voltages over long distances instead of using inefficient low voltage transmission which exposes the grid to these dangers. reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparentIs this supposed to be sarcastic? The grid does carry high voltages over long distances. The standard voltage in North America is 765kV, and for HVDC lines it can be 2MV. But that&#x27;s for long-distance transmission lines, not more local distribution lines, which are necessarily lower voltage (36kV I think) for practical and safety reasons. reply ortusdux 17 hours agoprev [–] The US needs to fund the Strategic Transformer Reserve! DOE estimated the cost would be $500m in 2017, but it would be a bargain at 4x the price.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;ceser&#x2F;articles&#x2F;strategic-transformer-... reply londons_explore 17 hours agoparent [–] I disagree.A large solar storm is unlikely to damage many transformers. Transformers have low impedance, yet solar storms have the biggest impact on high impedance systems (like copper telephone cables, especially when &#x27;on hook&#x27;).The only time a power network is high impedance is when it isn&#x27;t connected (ie. when part of the power network is switched off). Trivial operational changes could be made to ensure that offline parts of a power network are grounded during a solar storm.Reserve transformers might be a good plan for other reasons - eg. fast recovery after a war on US soil - transformers are usually early targets in war, and hard to defend. reply keepamovin 17 hours agorootparentEven a Carrington-level event, which refers to a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) observed in 1859, is indeed a concern for modern electrical infrastructure. During such an event, geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) could flow through electrical grids, potentially overheating transformers and causing them to fail. These GICs are particularly harmful to transformers because they can lead to half-cycle saturation, increasing the reactive power demand and causing internal hotspots.While transformers themselves may have low impedance, it’s the connectivity and expanse of the grid system that makes them vulnerable during geomagnetic disturbances. The longer the conductive path, the more susceptible the system is to GICs, regardless of the impedance characteristics of individual components like transformers.An X500-level solar flare would be many times more powerful than the Carrington event and could wreak havoc on our electrical infrastructure. Given our increasing reliance on electricity for everything from communications to transportation, the societal impact would be significant.Hence, the idea of a Strategic Transformer Reserve isn’t just about preparing for solar storms; it’s a multi-hazard approach that also considers other threats like cyber-attacks, terrorism, or even conventional warfare.The key question remains: do the potential catastrophic consequences justify the financial and logistical costs of maintaining a transformer reserve? From a risk-assessment standpoint, considering the dire impacts of a severe solar event or other threats, investment in a transformer reserve could be seen as a rational and scientifically justified precaution.Particularly when the lead time to manufacture such equipment is in the order of years. A grid outage of that duration would be biblically catastrophic: without electricity, we have no water, no gasoline, no communications. We’d survive, but the suffering is not something it seems wise to consider an acceptable cost. Especially at a time of enhanced geopolitical competition, the effect of a storm whose severest effects would likely be localized to the sun-facing hemisphere, seems important not to underestimate.I think it would be great if, instead of countries merely having arms races, they had preparedness races. I guess for us ape-brained humans, tribalism feels more compelling than a threat you can’t bite the face off. reply londons_explore 16 hours agorootparent> geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) could flow through electrical grids, potentially overheating transformers and causing them to fail.yes, but such currents are typically measured in milliamps or, during the biggest storms, amps. Most utility scale transformers would be needing DC currents of the order of thousands or tens of thousands of amperes before failure.Even then, overheat sensors would detect such a condition, and operationally the circuit could be de-energised and connected to earth to protect it.Also, where there are perhaps thousands of transformers connected to a particular distribution grid, the load from the GIC&#x27;s is shared amongst them, further reducing impact. reply keepamovin 7 hours agorootparentGeomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) are often measured in amps rather than milliamps, and their values can vary significantly depending on the specifics of the geomagnetic storm and the electrical grid. During the 1989 geomagnetic storm that led to the collapse of the Hydro-Québec power system, GICs of hundreds of amperes were measured. While transformers are designed to handle thousands of amperes of alternating current, they are generally not designed to handle direct current like GICs, which can lead to transformer saturation and increased reactive power demand.Now, let’s talk about resonances. The electric grid can have resonant frequencies due to the combination of inductive, capacitive, and resistive elements. Resonances can cause the system to magnify the effects of incoming disturbances, much like how a tuning fork resonates at its natural frequency. When a geomagnetic storm induces currents in the Earth, those currents generate a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic fields of transformers and transmission lines. If the frequency of these geomagnetic disturbances happens to match or come close to a resonant frequency of the electrical grid, the amplitude of the induced currents can be significantly magnified.To be specific, resonances can occur in multiple parts of the system:1. Transformer windings have their own resonant frequencies, at which the impedance becomes high, leading to larger voltage across the windings for the same amount of GICs.2. Long transmission lines can have characteristic impedances that interact with the impedances of transformers and other elements to create resonant circuits, thus amplifying the GICs in localized regions.3. Harmonic resonances can occur when nonlinear elements like transformers generate harmonics that coincide with resonant frequencies in the grid, thereby magnifying the effective GICs.So, even though individual transformers may be able to handle small DC currents without immediate failure, the presence of resonances and the cumulative effects across a large, interconnected grid make GICs a non-trivial concern. reply chakalakasp 15 hours agorootparentprevI dunno. The American Geophysical Union seemed to think it was a BFD in one of their conferences back in the 2000s. Had a whole presentation about how certain parts of the US grid would lose large transformers that would likely take months to years to replace as there are few spares and they have to be wound with miles and miles of copper by hand. Said that large swaths of the US would be without grid power for very long periods.Said that third world countries would fare pretty well though. reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparentIt sounds like they need some type of automatic or robotic winding system... Even without some catastrophe, they surely have to make new transformers from time to time, and winding miles of copper by hand sounds ridiculously inefficient for a manufacturing process. reply dinkblam 17 hours agorootparentprev> The key question remains: do the potential catastrophic consequences justify the financial and logistical costs of maintaining a transformer reserve?isn&#x27;t this something that can be trivially answered with game theory? you just need the cost and the probability. reply ortusdux 16 hours agorootparentprevIIRC, the main argument for spare transformers is that the lead time on them back in 2017 was 2+ years, and we have no domestic sources. I can&#x27;t imagine the covid era supply chain issues have improved things. If North America is facing the sun during a major event, many countries would be fighting for replacements, and it could easily take a decade to get everything back online. reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparent>we have no domestic sources.Where are they made? This sounds a bit like a national security failure. A country as large and world-dominating as the US should be able to manufacture its own electrical distribution infrastructure. reply izend 17 hours agorootparentprevThe 1989 solar storm did cause damage to some Quebec transformers:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;lights-out-in-quebec-the-198... reply londons_explore 16 hours agorootparent> The ground connections of Hydro-Québec’s transmission system of high-tension lines and transformers eventually started conducting some of these earth currents, and at 2:43 AM, protective circuit breakers tripped at the Chibougamau substation in central Québec. This caused an imbalance on a 750 kV transmission line, which tripped breakers 150 km away.> Within one minute, the cascading failures ...So the actual problem was that all their power grid was turned off... ie. disconnected... ie. high impedance... ie. the most vulnerable state.Operational changes could be made so that all &#x27;tripped breakers&#x27; lead to at least one or other side of the breaker being grounded rather than left open circuit, which would solve the problem. That only needs to be the case during a solar storm, and electrical power lines are frequently grounded during maintenance for safety anyway. reply pvg 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] transformers are usually early targets in war, and hard to defend early targets in war, and hard to defend.Not if they&#x27;re more than meets the eye, like, say, robots in disguise. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Instagram was auto-translating user bios that included “Palestinian” and an Arabic phrase that means “praise be to God” to say “Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom,” which the platform says it’s very sorry for. On TikTok, user ytkingkhan posted a video showing his Instagram bio, which contained the phrase \"Palestinian [Palestinian flag emoji] ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ\" In Arabic, “alhamdulillah” is a statement of praise to Allah, or God. When he pressed the “See translation” option, the phrase was replaced with \"Praise be to god, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.\" He tried it again with just the ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ portion of the phrase in the bio, without the word Palestinian or the flag emoji, and it translated to “Thank God.” ytkingkhan said on TikTok that while he isn’t Palestinian himself, a friend who didn’t want to be named flagged the glitch to him, so he wanted to test it himself. He noted that after he posted the glitch on Instagram, the bio started to translate to “Palestinian terrorists [Palestinian flag emoji] Praise be to Allah” instead — with Instagram inserting the word “terrorist” into the translation.

They don’t need to understand how it works to understand that it has limitations and it’s going to be occasionally wrong.The average person is well aware software isn’t perfect, things break all the time. This is no different.It’s not a leap to think people will start grasping what current AI can and can’t do simply through a) careful communication and mostly importantly b) using it themselves.Much of the talk about AI safety is just an elaborate dance around this idea that users will never understand the limitations and will freak out.

Just saying “ChatGPT” doesn’t mean much.It’s not very interesting at all to hear about ChatGPT-3.5 making mistakes, and an unlabeled reference to “ChatGPT” usually seems to mean ChatGPT-3.5. ChatGPT-4 is an entirely different level of product.ChatGPT-4 can make mistakes too, and those cases are much more interesting since it is among the best LLMs on the market, so it is more representative of what current LLMs can (and can’t) do.For reference, here is ChatGPT-4 discussing this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;f67600f5-7d36-49b7-b136-f77dcb...I don’t know that language, so I can’t say how accurate it is.

Ask the guy saying \"alhamdulillah\" if he means Allah or if he means God. reply adrian_b 14 hours agorootparentThat question is meaningless, because \"Allah\" is the translation into Arabic of the English word \"God\".Neither of these two words is a name of a god, which normally does not matter, because both the Christians and the Muslims believe that there exists only one god, so it is not necessary to have a proper name for that god.Obviously, whenever a Christian believer or a Muslim believer speaks about the \"God\", they speak about the only god they believe in, so it makes no sense to ask them which god they mean.A non-believer may speak about the God of the Muslims and about the God of the Christians, to make clear the intended meaning, and the latter phrase might be translated into Arabic with words meaning \"the Allah of the Christians\". reply throwaway2203 11 hours agorootparentThis is not completely correct. Allah is a name as much as it is a \"type\". One of the things Arabs will point out is that Allah is \"special\" because it cannot be pluralized and hence is a better name for the monotheistic God than English God or Persian Khuda (which can be).I&#x27;m a non-arabic speaking Muslim who prefers in non-liturgical context to use Khuda and have occasionally been \"corrected\" by well meaning folk. reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentAllah can no longer be pluralized now, but it could be pluralized in older Arabic, before the conversion to the Muslim religion.Remnants of that time can still be seen in the Christian&#x2F;Judaic Bible, where the plural of the cognate Hebrew word, i.e. \"Elohim\", can be encountered, though even there it has acquired in many places a singular meaning. reply jrh3 12 hours agorootparentprevThey are the same God though, for Christians and Muslims.

Levantine Christians and even some older Mizrahis will use Allah in daily parlance for \"God\" or \"Lord\". For example, in colloquial Hebrew, Yalla&#x2F;Ya Allah is a common expression similar to \"Oh God\" or \"Jesus\" or \"Come On\" when annoyed. reply bilalq 13 hours agorootparentThis comment was posted elsewhere in this thread, but I feel like the incorrect portion here begs correcting again.> \"Alhamdulillah\" [...] is used by Muslims nowadays as an alternative to Allah u Akbar, Takbir, or Narai-e-Takbir because those 3 terms have been co-opted by Jihadists.That&#x27;s just flat-out false. Allahuakbar is a phrase of critical religious significance and tied to one of the pillars of Islam (Salat). Alhamduillah has always been a common phrase. Both are used daily by Muslims globally, even those who are not religious. They are far too deeply rooted in the creed and traditions of Islam to be able to be co-opted. reply triceratops 13 hours agorootparentprev> Ask the guy saying \"alhamdulillah\" if he means Allah or if he means God.It&#x27;s like asking whether someone means cake or gateau.

There was a more poetic name for it, IIRC. It&#x27;s an old problem. reply gizmo686 14 hours agorootparentThis is an even more subtle point. In Arabic, Allah is simply the word for \"God\". As it turns out, Allah is also the English word for \"Muslim God\".To take an English example, imagine a Christian saying \"God is great\", with an option to translate it as either: \"God (generic) is great\"; or \"The Christian God is great\".Sure, he was probably thinking of the Christian God when he spoke, but making that explicit in the translation still changes the meaning. reply shashashasha___ 3 hours agoprevI assume translating in IG is based on ML based on users data and feedback. so its statistics and not bulletproof. in general its considered a very complex problem as languages are very different from each other.

JON BRODKIN - 10/19/2023, 11:43 AM Enlarge / FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr arrive to testify during a House committee hearing on March 31, 2022 in Washington, DC. Getty ImagesKevin Dietsch 105 WITH The Federal Communications Commission today voted to move ahead with a plan that would restore net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation of Internet service providers. In a 3-2 party-line vote, the FCC approved Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which seeks public comment on the broadband regulation plan. The comment period will officially open after the proposal is published in the Federal Register, but the docket is already active and can be found here. The proposal would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, a designation that allows the FCC to regulate ISPs under the common-carrier provisions in Title II of the Communications Act. The plan is essentially the same as what the FCC did in 2015 when it used Title II to prohibit fixed and mobile Internet providers from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment. The Obama-era net neutrality rules were eliminated during Trump's presidency when then-Chairman Ajit Pai led a repeal that reclassified broadband as an information service, returning it to the less strict regulatory regime of Title I. The current FCC likely would have acted much sooner but there was a 2-2 deadlock until last month when the Senate confirmed Biden nominee Anna Gomez to fill the empty spot. Advertisement After the comment period, the FCC is likely to finalize the rulemaking and put the 2015 rules back in place. The broadband industry will likely then sue the FCC in an attempt to nullify the rulemaking. Chair: Broadband needs “expert agency” \"Today, there is no expert agency ensuring that the Internet is fast, open, and fair... Today, we begin a process to make this right. We propose to reinstate enforceable, bright-line rules to prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization,\" Rosenworcel said at the commission meeting. Title II regulation isn't just about net neutrality, Rosenworcel said, arguing that the reclassification will give the FCC more authority to protect national security on broadband networks. \"When we stripped state-affiliated companies from China of their authority to operate in the United States, that action did not extend to broadband services, thanks to the retreat from Title II. This is a national security loophole that needs to be addressed,\" she said. Without Title II, the FCC has \"limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into our network policies,\" she said. The same is true of protecting privacy on broadband networks, she said. \"The law requires telecommunications providers to protect the confidentiality of the proprietary information of their customers,\" Rosenworcel said. \"That means that these providers cannot sell your location data, among other sensitive information. Those privacy protections currently extend to voice customers but not broadband subscribers. Does that really make sense? Do we want our broadband providers selling what we do online? Scraping our service for a payday from new artificial intelligence models? Doing any of this without our permission?\" Disputing claims that the FCC is overstepping its authority, Rosenworcel said the \"rules are legally sustainable because they track those that were upheld in court in 2016—from front to back.\" Page: 1 2 Next → READER COMMENTS 105 WITH JON BRODKIN Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a wide array of telecom and tech policy topics.

But what all an ISP has to do to offer different service plans in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona is to merely offer different terms to different people based off the State they reside in. That’s just paperwork (and you know, delivering on the agreed upon service for the agreed upon price), not automobiles.So I don’t really buy the argument that because California did a thing, ISPs couldn’t do all the supposed bad evil stuff they were going to immediately do once the FCC failed to “save the internet” anywhere else (although maybe other States also did the thing California did). reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentUsers in California may download from a service in New York. Users in New York may download from a service in California. I suspect it would be more expensive than it&#x27;s worth to have asymmetric infrastructure that would allow them to them to throttle the New Yorker without violating the law for the Californian.All that network management would require teams of engineers and specialized hardware, all for something that may change on a whim and be obsoleted. What if New York copies California law? Bam. That investment instantly evaporated. reply onlyrealcuzzo 15 hours agorootparent>50% of US GDP is in states that are almost certainly going to prevent traffic throttling: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.naruc.org&#x2F;nrri&#x2F;nrri-activities&#x2F;net-neutrality-tr...It&#x27;s probably not worth it to add in a whole bunch of BS just to try to make a bit more money in maybe Fl and Tx.Especially given the fact that it&#x27;s not as straightforward as it seems - and legal consequences could easily outweigh any benefits.On top of that, I&#x27;d be surprised if ISPs tried to throttle traffic even in Fl and Tx and people in those states didn&#x27;t pressure their government to ban it as well.Net neutrality is wildly popular with the public. reply SllX 15 hours agorootparent> Net neutrality is wildly popular with the public.I didn’t say it explicitly but I think this is the real reason that the ISPs largely haven’t changed their business practices independent of what the FCC says it can or can’t do. They don’t want the FCC in their shit, but they also don’t plan to do all of the worst case scenarios envisioned in say, this video from 2006: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cWt0XUocViEAnd one of the scenarios that did come to pass (high speed and slow speed lanes) was never even prohibited by the FCC back when it did pass net neutrality rules: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;netflix-is-so-bi...> Netflix ultimately paid ISPs for interconnection but the dispute had an impact on the FCC&#x27;s net neutrality proceedings. The FCC didn&#x27;t ban interconnection payments but set up a complaint process so that companies like Netflix can challenge specific payment demands as being \"unjust\" or \"unreasonable.\" There have been no major public disputes since then.So I mean, I get it. In 2006 it was easy to see how turning the Internet into cable TV would be terrible, but if that was ever a danger, it probably isn’t now? And the internet is so much more important now that if it ever did look like that was going to happen, we could pass a real law then. In the mean time I’m going to enjoy listening to the court proceedings when the FCC is sued because they said they didn’t have the power to govern ISPs when they had a different set of commissioners. reply joecool1029 15 hours agorootparentprev> Net neutrality is wildly popular with the public.In the tech bubble.Outside of the bubble you will be hard pressed to find people able to actually articulate what net neutrality is. And those people are easily swayed by partisan means: (&#x27;The democrats want more government regulation that&#x27;s going to increase your internet and wireless bills&#x27;) ISP&#x27;s only have to claim &#x27;your costs have gone up due to new government rules preventing us from selling discounted service&#x27; or something to that effect and you will find that &#x27;widespread&#x27; support eroding away. reply InSteady 14 hours agorootparentAverage Joe and Jane consumers are quite familiar with data limits, more expensive access to highspeed data, throttled data based on arbitrary stuff, etc. People may not have heard of net neutrality, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the basic concepts are over their head.\"AT&T could choose to throttle your streaming data when you don&#x27;t use their partnered app to watch sports on your phone\" cuts through the BS pretty directly. reply s3p 11 hours agorootparentprevThis did not happen. Net neutrality was supported by EVERYONE who was not in government at the time. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparentprev> What I’ve never understood is the argument that what California does regulating ISPs could actually affect the service plans in 49 other States.What I&#x27;ve never understood is the argument that what Europe does regarding privacy could actually affect the privacy of other countries.Sure, some websites detect your location and apply different rules to you but a lot end up just following GDPR and apply it universally because it is easier and cheaper to do that than do a \"means testing\" and apply specific rules. Creating all those rulesets makes for an increasingly complex system, makes it more prone to error (which includes doing those banned actions within California and resulting in a lawsuit), and just is overall more expensive. Determining country origin is presumably a lot easier than determining state origin too. Not to mention that California is the most populous state and the biggest tech sector. Pretty much the argument is ISPs have bigger fish to fry when they&#x27;re restricted from doing something to a large portion of their customers.No one and nothing are truly independent. That&#x27;s always been a lie being sold. Choices you make affect others and choices collectively made affect you. It&#x27;s literally the definition of a society. On HN we have these discussions about Chrome&#x27;s dominance allowing them to have control over how the internet is structured. We&#x27;ve had these discussion about Apple&#x27;s dominance influencing right to repair. And so on. Monolithic forces are never going to be stopped by single player boycotting. My usage of Firefox for over a decade never did anything to dethrone Chrome and I never expected it would, but hey, it also can&#x27;t happen without people like me. Just needs to happen at a larger scale. reply SllX 15 hours agorootparentExcept for the fact that the facts are different.When you sign up with an ISP, you’re signing up for a guaranteed service at a physical location with defined jurisdictional borders and laws governing it. My ISP throttling their New York customers who try to use Netflix isn’t going to affect me. Honestly throttling their Oregon customers wouldn’t either.This is factually different from Facebook who serves people independent of their location, residence or citizenship and don’t give a fig about who your ISP is because laws might cover someone based on any or all of those whereas a Californian who invades Texas is no longer covered by California-specific consumer protection laws, and to the extent that businesses choose to adhere to them in Texas is incidental. ISPs are very much bound by the location they setup infrastructure in in the way that the services you access through that connection are not as evidenced by the fact that they already take into account your residential address when determining 1. if they can service your location at all and 2. what services and what quality guarantees they can make to you.Also just to make a note on GDPR, one of the screwy things about it is that covers EU citizens. EU citizenship is a complicated enough thing, but there’s a lot of people with EU citizenship living elsewhere in the world. Fully complying with GDPR is a much more onerous requirement in terms of infrastructure and professionals you need to hire than ISPs complying with a net neutrality law in one State. I’m not saying there’s no additional overhead, it probably is easier to have contracts that are as standard across as many markets as possible, but ISPs are already skilled at working within local jurisdictional requirements. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparent> When you sign up with an ISP, you’re signing up for a guaranteed service at a physical location with defined jurisdictional bordersIt&#x27;s messier than that. This works if all NY, OR,gets its traffic distributed through a guaranteed hub in those locations. Specifically when you know the end point of the user. Let&#x27;s just take the simple case and say a Google employee sitting in a CA office is working with a Microsoft employee sitting in a WA office and assume OR has a throttling service. The hubs along the way are Seattle, Vancoover, Portland, Eugene, Redding, SF. Do the Portland and Eugene servers throttle? To do this they&#x27;d need to know: 1) the source destination, 2) the final destination, 3) the type of traffic, 4) the type of service, and so on. Are they going to have that? Probably not. And then it&#x27;d be trivial to get around if you start using encrypted traffic and encrypted DNS services. The ISPs just can&#x27;t do that wish such granularity that they don&#x27;t risk being sued by CA.> Also just to make a note on GDPR, one of the screwy things about it is that covers EU citizens.A note on the CA thing, the DOJ and several ISP lobby groups tried to get CA&#x27;s law overturned at a federal level immediately after it was passed. It&#x27;s been upheld. So they kinda already looked at a solution that strongly implies what the parent implied about other states likely implementing similar laws were the ISPs to start such fuckery.CA here isn&#x27;t just acting as a filter in that they do a thing and so having to work around them is more cost than its worth. They are _also_ an example, where they tried to get the laws overturned and failed. So they don&#x27;t want to get any more similar laws in other states because that will have even more of an effect and tighten what they can do even further. reply SllX 12 hours agorootparentISPs are already rate-limiting users based off the service tier they paid for. If you’re paying for 250 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up, you’re not getting the 1 Gbps down 5 Mbps up connection that your neighbor is offering. If you choose to upgrade to the 1 Gbps plan, you’re using the same equipment over the same wire.Choosing to then sell you an additional premium option where you get the full 1 Gbps you theoretically could get but don’t already pay for, but they’ll give it to you for a selection of curated services including their own is possible, and to incentivize you to not use a VPN, they won’t count it against your data cap when you access Netflix at 4K on 4 screens simultaneously because you’re now a VIP customer—all of that would violate the spirit of net neutrality. T-Mobile already does similar things as a “bonus” for their customers and technically, it’s not net neutral. There’s all kinds of ways to discriminate between paying customers, and that was the original fear of not having net neutrality: that the internet would become just like cable TV. That hasn’t happened with or without net neutrality as law (or as an FCC rule at least). Pretty much most markets have explicit data caps on some ISPs at least now, but the way it started was ISPs rolled that out slowly, over the course of years, market by market.You are correct that other States could pass similar laws. I don’t follow the politics of other States much, but if California can do it, so can they, but other States can’t rely solely on the fact that California did a thing and now they don’t have to bother taking any legislative action themselves, if it’s important anyway (and I’m not convinced this particular issue counts as important). California even won in Federal court, great! There’s precedent for it now, but that doesn’t mean ISPs would necessarily lose in a different circuit, and they could always force a circuit split in a friendlier district. reply mywittyname 14 hours agorootparentprevI know for a fact there are tech companies that build out separate systems for EU and US data pipelines. It&#x27;s not really a big deal to have a lawyer look over the data that&#x27;s being collected and flag stuff as can be collected in Europe, and can be migrated to the USA for processing. Companies generally run EU-specific infrastructure anyway. GDPR is honestly one of the easier aspects of operating in Europe. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparent> I know for a fact there are tech companies that build out separate systems for EU and US data pipelines.Great, me too. I thought it was clear in my first sentence...>> Sure, some websites detect your location and apply different rules to you but a lot end up just following GDPR and apply it universally because it is easier and cheaper to do reply tstrimple 7 hours agorootparentprevSame way California auto standards impact auto standards across the entire country. California is the most populous state with a higher disposable income. At some point, creating a product specifically for 12% of the US population with money to spend while maintaining a separate product for the rest of the country becomes too much of an economic burden and the standard gets applied across the board instead. reply dragonwriter 16 hours agorootparentprevThe lawsuits over the FCC repeal, the California law, proposed laws in other states, and the Presidential election and the expectation that the FCC would revisit the issue and readopt neutrality regulations (and that any major conduct violating the neutrality principles made that both more likely and would be specifically targeted in the new regulations) all contributed to restraint. reply l33t7332273 17 hours agorootparentprevI thought the internet was purely a federal law domain.It looks like this law was challenged on those grounds, but the challenge lasted until after Biden was elected and the suit dropped. reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentThe FCC declared that it didn&#x27;t have authority to regulate net neutrality. When they did, California declared that if it&#x27;s not in-scope for the FCC, then there&#x27;s no federal-state conflict in California regulating it themselves. reply bojo 17 hours agorootparentprevI think the point is that California, a sizable and notable state, implemented a law that affects everyone regardless of federal law. reply foota 17 hours agorootparentParent is saying that California may not have the legal authority to regulate the internet in that way, since some powers are given only to the federal government. reply connicpu 17 hours agorootparentWhether they do or do not have the authority isn&#x27;t something that can be answered by anything but speculation until it&#x27;s been tested in court, and I don&#x27;t think any of the ISPs had enough to gain through packet prioritization that it was worth the risk of going to court. reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s been tested and upheld in court. From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_Internet_Consumer_P...:\"Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in January 2022 that California&#x27;s net neutrality law may continue to be enforced and cannot be overridden by the FCC as, current as of the decision, Internet services were classified as information services.\" reply mywittyname 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s still one more higher court that can overturn that decision - SCOTUS. They could conceivably rule that no government agency, state or federal, has the ability to enforce such regulations. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair. SCOTUS is a roll of the dice lately, and there&#x27;s no way of telling what crazy rulings they might back. As far as I know, though, that ruling hasn&#x27;t been appealed. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentprevThat there was a hail mary appeal to the Supreme Court possible that they elected not to pursue does not negate that the issue is clearly not that the broadband ISPs didn’t see “enough to gain through packet prioritization that it was worth the risk of going to court”. reply wddkcs 16 hours agorootparentprevFunny if the benefit was that negligible when it seems like they fought for it so hard originally. reply connicpu 15 hours agorootparentLobbying can be extremely cheap when compared to actually fighting a court battle reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentThe broadband industry actually fought, and lost, a court battle on this, too. replyilyt 17 hours agorootparentprevAlso see emission standards. reply connicpu 17 hours agorootparentExactly. Even if their laws only technically apply within California, no car maker is going to build a car that cannot be legally sold in the single largest market in the US. It gets even more difficult with the internet as there are few internet providers who don&#x27;t have at least some kind of connection to California and therefore fall under its jurisdiction, and ensuring you only apply prioritization to packets that don&#x27;t involve California is extremely tough. reply mywittyname 14 hours agorootparentThese emissions regulations don&#x27;t cover just California, but most of New England, the Pacific, and the mid-Atlantic states as well. I think New York has a way to \"fast track\" new emissions laws from California, so that the states are kept in sync.\"California cars\" were a thing in the early days when emissions were difficult to comply with. Even modern cars come with a \"50-state compliant emissions\" line item on the window sticker.If California ratcheted up emissions standards too high, there&#x27;s the possibility that such segregation could emerge again, particularly when it comes to trucks. There are already several trim levels of trucks that are specific to Texas, because the market there is so big. I could see a truck coming with a sticker that says, \"RAM TRX can not be registered or sold in CA, WI, NY, [...] due to emissions restrictions.\" reply dragonwriter 16 hours agorootparentprev> I thought the internet was purely a federal law domainIt is not, there are plenty of state laws that have applied to the internet. On the specific issue of net neutrality, the FCC in 2019 lost in the D.C. Circuit in its attempt to assert that state law regulations for neutrality were preempted, specifically because the repeal rested on them reclassifying in a way which means they don’t have the power to preempt state regulations.> It looks like this law was challenged on those groundsIt was (EDIT: well, not on the broad “internet is a federal law domain” grounds, but the narrower “net neutrality regulations by the states were preempted by the terms of the FCC neutrality repeal” grounds), by multiple parties, and those challenges failed.> but the challenge lasted until after Biden was elected and the suit dropped.No, while the DoJ dropped its case then, the case making the same arguments by the broadband industry continued until the industry participants dropped it after the Ninth Circuit ruled (similar to what the D.C. Circuit had previously), that by reclassifying broadband under Title I in its net neutrality repeal, the FCC had removed its ability to restrict state regulations, which would only exist if it were regulated under Title II. reply ImJamal 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you think it was a federal law domain? The federal government is technically only allowed to do what is granted in the Constitution. The 10th amendment says anything else is left to the states. Last I checked nothing in the constitution mentioned the internet. Not that the federal government lets that stand in their way. reply l33t7332273 16 hours agorootparentLike the other comment said, the internet is basically as interstate as a thing can get by design.The interstate commerce clause is extremely broadly interpreted. It can, for example, be used to prevent a farmer from growing grain on their own farm to feed their own cattle that reside on that very farm(Wickard v. Filburn) reply thebradbain 16 hours agorootparentYet it can’t be used to stop California vehicle emission standards, which is why almost all car manufacturers in the US make cars up to California’s higher standards, because they’re so big. reply bigstrat2003 16 hours agorootparentIn fairness, while I detest that California&#x27;s laws become de facto national laws, it doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate to use the commerce clause there. California isn&#x27;t trying to regulate interstate commerce, it&#x27;s not their fault that manufacturers are too cheap to have different models that meet California&#x27;s standards while having a normal model for the rest of the country. reply l33t7332273 16 hours agorootparentprevRight but the internet is inherently an interstate enterprise. That’s why I feel it likely falls under the purview of congress. reply hn_acker 15 hours agorootparentprevNot a lawyer, but I found an explanation about why states can pass net neutrality laws. Communication over the internet has both interstate and intrastate components. More on the intrastate component later. The Commerce Clause gives Congress authority to pass legislation to regulate interstate commerce [1]. Congress can also delegate a portion of its authority to federal agencies such as the FCC.What happens when the FCC chooses to abandon its authority to regulate ISPs? More specifically, what happens when the FCC chooses to deregulate the ISPs by reclassifying broadband from Title II to Title I? Then the FCC cannot preempt state laws regarding telecom unless Congress gave it an authority to do so. In Mozilla Corp. v. FCC, 940 F. 3d 1 (D.C. Cir., 2019), the FCC tried to argue that it could preempt state net neutrality laws [2].Quoting the page 132 of the case text PDF (which you need to download to ctrl-F, since Justia&#x27;s PDF viewer messes up whitespace between words) [3][3.5]:> Third, the Commission points to 47 U.S.C. § 160(e). That provision says that “[a] State commission may not continue to apply or enforce any provision of [the Act] that the Commission has determined to forbear from applying under subsection (a).” Subsection (a), in turn, gives the Commission some flexibility to forbear from regulating technologies classified under Title II. Id. § 160(a).> That Title II provision has no work to do here because the 2018 Order took broadband out of Title II. So the Commission is not “forbear[ing] from applying any provision” of the Act to a Title-II technology. 47 U.S.C. § 160(e). On top of that, Section 160(e)—as a part of Title I—does not itself delegate any preemption authority to the Commission. People of State of Cal., 905 F.2d at 1240 n.35.In short, the FCC gave up its authority to preempt state net neutrality laws the moment the FCC reclassified broadband from Title II to Title I.There&#x27;s another important point which starts on page 134 and continues to page 135 [3.5]. (If you want to ctrl-F it, you&#x27;ll have to select just the first few words because page breaks in the PDF obstruct paragraphs.)> Not only is the Commission lacking in its own statutory authority to preempt, but its effort to kick the States out of intrastate broadband regulation also overlooks the Communications Act’s vision of dual federal-state authority and cooperation in this area specifically.Meanwhile, back on page 126 [3.5]:Section 152 of the Communications Act provides, as relevant here, that “nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to * * * regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier.” 47 U.S.C. § 152(b). That provision divides regulatory authority “into two separate components: interstate communications, which can be regulated by the [Commission]; and intrastate communications, which cannot.”Therefore, states actually have Congress&#x27;s blessing to regulate broadband to some degree: states have authority over communications confined within the respective states.So what about the Dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from \"passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce\" [1]? I don&#x27;t know whether courts have come to an answer about whether state net neutrality laws violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. So instead I&#x27;ll pose food for thought: To what degree do you think state net neutrality laws burden interstate commerce? Is the burden excessive? Net neutrality means that an ISP can&#x27;t restrict traffic on the grounds of content, senders, and recipients [4]. What kind of burden does that place on an ISP which offers internet in multiple states?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;commerce_clause[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mozilla_Corp._v._FCC[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;federal&#x2F;appellate-courts&#x2F;cadc&#x2F;1...[3.5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cases.justia.com&#x2F;federal&#x2F;appellate-courts&#x2F;cadc&#x2F;18-10...[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Net_neutrality reply ImJamal 16 hours agorootparentprevI think Wickard vs Filburn is one of the worst decided cases out there.

The states have Congress-given authority to regulate intrastate (not interstate) internet communications. Moreover, by reclassifying broadband from Title II to Title I, the FCC gave up the part of its authority that allowed it to preempt state net neutrality laws.

I don&#x27;t know for sure though.> It tests using a node 200+ miles away (they tell you where)\"200+ miles away\" from your physical location doesn&#x27;t mean \"outer internet outside your ISP\". It doesn&#x27;t mean \"far away from your ISP&#x27;s network\" either.For example, some mobile carriers may operate country-wide, but route everything through Important Central Connector To Outer Internet™ in the capital city. Consequently, internet services think that user&#x27;s phone is in capital city.So while you see \"City 200 miles away\" as a test node, it may actually be the closest one because your ISP&#x27;s network structure adds these mandatory 200 miles. ISP&#x27;s internet access node and speed test node may be literally across the street or in adjacent server racks.Not saying that it is certainly the case, just trying to explain why words on test screen may mean things different from the ones we assume.> AND it actually shows slow numbers when the pipe is slow. Turns out Amazon Video was the culpritFrom your words, it didn&#x27;t show you slow pipe. It showed you regular one that was busy with streaming video.Also, ability to watch streaming doesn&#x27;t necessary indicates actual internet speed since streaming services like Netflix can provide ISPs with the hardware for caching [1] and streaming from inner ISP network. Not sure if Amazon does that though.> Amazon Video was the culprit, somehow using 80% of a 100Mb connection for a single stream...Amazon streams with a higher bitrate than most of the competitors. 80 Mbps isn&#x27;t that surprising given that Bluray disks have 40 Mbps bitrate for 1080p video.

Even so, the reclassification of broadband from Title II to Title I formally removed much of the FCC&#x27;s authority to regulate ISPs at all [3]:> A big part of the FCC’s plan involves rolling back the FCC’s tailor-made authority over broadband providers, then shoveling all remaining government oversight to an FTC ill-equipped to handle it.> Why is that a problem? The FTC has no rule-making ability, and can only move to protect consumers after a violation has occurred. And that action can only occur if it’s painfully clear that an ISP engaged in “unfair and deceptive” behavior, something that’s easy for an ISP to dodge in the net neutrality era, where anti-competitive behavior is often buried under faux-technical jargon and claims that it was done only for the health and safety of the network.Federal net neutrality rules were significant but nonetheless were a fraction of the broadband consumer protection debate. You are correct that an apocalypse didn&#x27;t happen. Rather, the US already was mired in monopolization, fraud, and regulatory capture. These are problems net neutrality can provide only a bandage for.

Each \"side\" of the argument has had control of both houses and the presidential. Yet none of them got it done. Instead we are going to end up with more rubish and no real laws. Just made up interpretations that can change on a whim (and it will).Then both sides are pretending there is robust competition and not oligopoly&#x2F;monopoly pricing. When the reality is I used to be able to choose from 20 ISPs with different perks or whatever. I can now realistically pick between 2. They are then stepping in with a bunch of rules that make it even harder to make an ISP. That is by design and called regulatory capture.

This problem of monopolistic ISPs could be easily solved by enforcing the existing anti-trust laws that have long been on the books. Net neutrality essentially gives these monopolies a pass, so long as they make some vague promises about not throttling.Net neutrality is the convoluted nonsense regulation that gets written by politicians who are trying to balance the various sets of competing lobbying interests.The correct and proper solution would be to simply enforce existing anti-trust laws. reply slaymaker1907 13 hours agoparentprevSome applications want extremely low latency compared to pretty much anything else such as cloud gaming. Net neutrality rules might get in the way of a cloud gaming service negotiating with an ISP to route their traffic more efficiently. It&#x27;s kind of like how when ordering stuff online, sometimes you don&#x27;t care if it takes 3 weeks to arrive but other times you want same day shipping. It would be a bad experience if USPS was forced to only offer one priority class for delivery since people ok with slower delivery would be forced to pay for faster service than they need and people wanting faster delivery wouldn&#x27;t have that option.However, I think rules could be put in place to prevent the anti-competitive practices without limiting the legitimate use cases for going against net neutrality. reply hn_acker 12 hours agorootparent> Net neutrality rules might get in the way of a cloud gaming service negotiating with an ISP to route their traffic more efficiently.This is not convincing to me at all. ISPs could have supported low latency internet for everything, not just for gaming. If latency is too low then it&#x27;s because the large ISPs are purposefully doing a bad job of upgrading to fiber and expanding fiber to places without internet access. Fiber would allow ISPs to provide service for cheap and still profit in the long term [1]. Subsidy fraud is as normal as breathing among large telecom companies such as AT&T [2], Comcast [3], and Verizon [4].Internet bandwidth is not like shipping of physical goods.

Monopoly franchise agreements, rent-seeking, bundling of cable channels, lobbying for laws against net neutrality, lobbying for laws against municipal broadband and lobbying for laws against \"overbuilds\" in general.On top of that ISPs place significant hurdles over anyone who gets permission to build. This can be as simple as the process by which cables are strung up to poles. In some places each pole may require a separate planning application and existing cables may need to be moved. The owners may have 90 days to move their cables. They will take that. They may even take longer and just pay the fine. If several need to be moved they may be done serially so it may take 1-2 years just to get permission to put a cable up on a pole that the city technically owns.We have service blackspots where ISPs are given huge sums to roll out service and simply don&#x27;t. A lot of municipal broadband started because Comcat, AT&T, Spectrum or whoever simply refused to provide service or charged a ridiculous amount (eg $50k to connect).The best Internet in the US is municipal eg Chattanooga.Utilities are heavily regulated because we know what would happen if they weren&#x27;t: inelastic demand would simply result in providers jacking up prices to increase profit.

Our priority is to build the \"right thing\" not build a demo and get stuck with the wrong thing. My wild guess is that the language will be very usable for a lot of things in 18 months, but don&#x27;t hold me to that.It WILL be open-sourced, because Modular on its own isn&#x27;t big enough to build the whole ecosystem. reply rgbrgb 20 hours agoparentHard needle to thread. I understand the risk of getting community momentum in a direction you don&#x27;t want to go, but I&#x27;m also doubtful that much of the audience they want is interested in a closed source programming language. Hoping they can thread it because I think it&#x27;s a good idea and Swift is pretty nice. reply tzhenghao 11 hours agorootparentI think they&#x27;re just playing a larger distribution game to get people locked into Mojo then eventually pay for their Modular engine hosting services, just about the same as most open core, VC backed startups. reply rgbrgb 10 hours agorootparentI see what you&#x27;re saying, but it&#x27;s pretty different from an open core analytics product or something. This is a language&#x2F;dev environment and the bar is a lot higher because 1) I know it&#x27;s going to be a big investment to learn the language and ecosystem 2) I&#x27;m deeply locked-in technically by writing my stuff in this language 3) the competitors are open source and at this point I&#x27;m not worried about python, numpy, typescript etc going away. My feedback is basically that despite this project looking cool, I will not be writing any Mojo until it&#x27;s open source. reply BugsJustFindMe 19 hours agoparentprev> They do very much plan to open source Mojo.They do very much claim to plan. There&#x27;s a bit of difference. reply MR4D 19 hours agorootparentChris has a pretty solid reputation. I doubt he’d throw that away.Sometimes it’s okay to trust people in this space. To me, this is one of those times. reply subharmonicon 17 hours agorootparentWhat if it’s less his choice and more about convincing investors that it makes sense? reply shwaj 17 hours agorootparentThat shouldn’t be hard I think. My confident guess is that there will be multiple backends for the language, an open source bare bones one, and one which integrates with their “value add“ highly scalable backend, with optimization for distributing work across GPU farms or even custom hardware. reply cobrabyte 18 hours agoparentprevSo, it&#x27;s basically the same approach they took with Swift. It makes sense. reply sneak 16 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t. Free software is an ideology, not a license. You can’t be said to believe in software freedoms if you release nonfree software.An analogy would be that you don’t believe in human rights if only 10% of your business operations violate them.Software freedoms are important. Don’t release proprietary software. Doing so is bad and makes the world worse. reply DistractionRect 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard to fund development without releasing something, and at the same time, releasing it prematurely runs the risk of entrenching undesirable features&#x2F;behaviors&#x2F;etc that stifle development of something better.Releasing it closed source allows them to point to something that justifies further fund raising and allowing them to control the direction of development while getting user feedback.This isn&#x27;t some esoteric language where if mojo vanished you&#x27;d lose your whole project and have to rewrite it into something else. It&#x27;s python with some syntax sprinkled on top, so vendor lockin isn&#x27;t a huge concern. reply cobrabyte 16 hours agorootparentprevThey didn&#x27;t open source Swift out of the gate because they wanted to guide its development according to the features and plans they had for the language. Wanting to have a firm grasp of the language&#x27;s core features and implementation is reasonable. After all, I believe Lattner was unhappy with some early directions they took with Swift, but it was too late to change anything because libraries and such had already been written. I may be fuzzy on that, but that&#x27;s what I seem to recall.Also, I am not an absolutist where free software is concerned. It doesn&#x27;t make the world worse to release proprietary software. Especially if you have the stated goal of eventually open sourcing it. reply tiffanyh 15 hours agoparentprevThey should just open source it now, but closed to contributions (no PR).That’s how SQLite operates and it works well. reply janalsncm 17 hours agoprevMojo claims a 90,000x speedup over python for matrix multiplication. No one does matrix multiplication with for loops. What is the speedup over numpy? reply almostdigital 17 hours agoparentHere&#x27;s the same benchmark with np.matmul instead of native python (on M2 MBP) Python 4.216 GFLOPS Naive: 6.400 GFLOPS 1.52x faster than Python Vectorized: 22.232 GFLOPS 5.27x faster than Python Parallelized: 52.591 GFLOPS 12.47x faster than Python Tiled: 60.888 GFLOPS 14.44x faster than Python Unrolled: 62.514 GFLOPS 14.83x faster than Python Accumulated: 506.209 GFLOPS 120.07x faster than Python reply danieldk 16 hours agorootparentDoes that use Apple accelerate? Depending on the matrix size, that sees a bit low, even the M1 Pro can easily reach 2.2 TFLOPS. reply gyrovagueGeist 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat is your BLAS backend? reply andy99 15 hours agorootparentYeah this is confusing for me: I&#x27;m non an expert in numpy * but I had assumed that it would do most of those things - vectorize, unroll, etc, either when compiled or through any backend it&#x27;s using. I understand that numpy&#x27;s routines are fixed and that mojo might have more flexibility, but for straight up matrix multiplication I&#x27;d be very surprised if it&#x27;s really leaving that much performance on the table. Although I can appreciate that if it depends separately on what BLAS backend has been installed that is a barrier to getting default fast performance.* For context I do have done some experience experimenting on the gcc&#x2F;intel compiler options that are available for linear algebra, and even outside of BLAS, compiling with -o3 -ffast-math -funroll-loops etc does a lot of that, and for simple loops as in matrix vector multiplication, compilers can easily vectorize. I&#x27;m very curious if there is something I don&#x27;t know about that will result in a speedup. See e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;rbitr&#x2F;3b86154f78a0f0832e8bd171615236... for some basic playing around reply gyrovagueGeist 15 hours agorootparentEven OpenBLAS (the default iiuc) does all of that and more to optimize for different levels of the cache hierarchy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;~flame&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;GotoTOMS_revision.pdfI&#x27;m not sure where&#x2F;how they&#x27;d be squeezing out more performance unless its better compilation&#x2F;compatibility with Apple Silicon intrinsics.Edit: ..Is Mojo using more than 1 core? I&#x27;m not sure I understand their syntax and if they are parallel constructs.Edit2: Yeah Mojo seems to be parallelizing, so the comparison really isn&#x27;t fair. The np.config posted elsewhere shows that OpenBLAS is only compiled with MAX_THREADS=3 support, and its not clear what their OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS&#x2F;OPENMP_NUM_THREADS was set to at runtime. reply andy99 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not super familiar with Mac but I also notice that numpy here is using openblas64. I had thought the go-to was the Accelerate framework? Or is that part of it somehow? If so it would be interesting to see how that impacts performance. Of course it&#x27;s all kind of an argument for something like Mojo that gives better performance out of the box. Also an argument for why Mojo would be way more interesting if it was open source. reply almostdigital 15 hours agorootparentprevJust whatever you get by default with pip install numpy... Changing the benchmark to run with a 1024x1024x1024 matrix instead of a 128x128x128 does speed up numpy significantly though Python 119.189 GFLOPS Naive: 6.275 GFLOPS 0.05x faster than Python Vectorized: 22.259 GFLOPS 0.19x faster than Python Parallelized: 50.258 GFLOPS 0.42x faster than Python Tiled: 59.692 GFLOPS 0.50x faster than Python Unrolled: 62.165 GFLOPS 0.52x faster than Python Accumulated: 565.240 GFLOPS 4.74x faster than Pythonnp.__config__: Build Dependencies: blas: detection method: pkgconfig found: true include directory: &#x2F;opt&#x2F;arm64-builds&#x2F;include lib directory: &#x2F;opt&#x2F;arm64-builds&#x2F;lib name: openblas64 openblas configuration: USE_64BITINT=1 DYNAMIC_ARCH=1 DYNAMIC_OLDER= NO_CBLAS= NO_LAPACK= NO_LAPACKE= NO_AFFINITY=1 USE_OPENMP= SANDYBRIDGE MAX_THREADS=3 pc file directory: &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;lib&#x2F;pkgconfig version: 0.3.23.dev lapack: detection method: internal found: true include directory: unknown lib directory: unknown name: dep4364960240 openblas configuration: unknown pc file directory: unknown version: 1.26.1 Compilers: c: commands: cc linker: ld64 name: clang version: 14.0.0 c++: commands: c++ linker: ld64 name: clang version: 14.0.0 cython: commands: cython linker: cython name: cython version: 3.0.3 Machine Information: build: cpu: aarch64 endian: little family: aarch64 system: darwin host: cpu: aarch64 endian: little family: aarch64 system: darwin Python Information: path: &#x2F;private&#x2F;var&#x2F;folders&#x2F;76&#x2F;zy5ktkns50v6gt5g8r0sf6sc0000gn&#x2F;T&#x2F;cibw-run-27utctq_&#x2F;cp310-macosx_arm64&#x2F;build&#x2F;venv&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python version: &#x27;3.10&#x27; SIMD Extensions: baseline: - NEON - NEON_FP16 - NEON_VFPV4 - ASIMD found: - ASIMDHP not found: - ASIMDFHM reply elashri 8 hours agorootparentIf you are looking for improved performance, you will always go with NumPy + vectorization. That&#x27;s what is important. So I don&#x27;t know what is the argument here, am I missing something? reply fkyoureadthedoc 16 hours agoparentprev> No one does matrix multiplication with for loopsBecause it&#x27;s slow as dirt right? Isn&#x27;t the point that they are trying to make is that one could with Mojo? reply riscy 8 hours agorootparentIf you take a look at the optimized Mojo code doing the matrix multiply [1], it takes an expert to understand. It’s not just some simple for-loops in Mojo they’re comparing against.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;modularml&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5ce18c47a27c0c4123de1... reply janalsncm 13 hours agorootparentprevSlower and less convenient. If I have two matrices and want to get a dot product I’d rather just call np.dot than zip and iterate. reply hansvm 16 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;ll definitely be faster (less latency for a single matmul) than numpy since you&#x27;re using all the cores (and from the throughput measurements, fairly efficiently). Better algorithms (like Strassens) don&#x27;t take over till the sizes involved are much greater than this benchmark is doing.In a single-threaded comparison to numpy (or just measuring total throughput -- many applications have lots of slightly smaller matmuls they can do which make it trivially to parallelize without having to parallelize each matmul, and throughput increases slightly when you do so) though, the details start to matter. Numpy is bad with small dimensions (hasn&#x27;t optimized for them at all really, and overhead moving data from a Python context to a Numpy context starts to dominate), and performance can vary 10-50x just based on whether you&#x27;ve set up an optimized BLAS library for it to link to or not. Mojo side-steps some of that because it provides the fast primitives you need in the language itself and doesn&#x27;t present the opportunity to execute more slowly. Single-core Mojo shouldn&#x27;t be meaningfully faster than a properly installed single-core Numpy on large matmuls, and the given implementation should be meaningfully slower on large enough problems.I don&#x27;t really care for the benchmark though. It&#x27;s potentially okay at showing how easy it can be to write fast code, but it comes across as being presented to show how much faster mojo is than Python. That latter is misleading for at least a couple reasons:- By some magic, my $300 old dev laptop (swift 3) is 6x faster than their brand new m2 pro max with a vanilla Python triple for loop. Is Mojo adding some overhead as it runs that benchmark? Is something wrong with their Python installation?- Many of the optimizations they applied in Mojo apply just as well in vanilla Python. Tiling, parallelization, ... Some of those have a higher ratio of improvement in Python than Mojo (depending on some fiddly GC details) because their purpose is to cut back on cache&#x2F;page&#x2F;... misses enough to make the problem compute-bound rather than IO-bound, and the Python representation takes enough extra space that the benefits accumulate faster. The serialization overhead for stdlib parallelization is dwarfed by the matmul cost, so it doesn&#x27;t wind up mattering much that you have slow copies all over the place, and you really do find yourself bound by the interpreters rate of interpreting.Like, it&#x27;s still faster than Vanilla Python by a lot, and it&#x27;s neat that the code is so easy to write, but 90k isn&#x27;t the speedup I&#x27;d headline with.To be fair, I think their point is just that you can write fast code easily in Mojo, and matmul is something easy to understand, so it makes a good case study. The optimization primitives are fairly intuitive, so presumably you should be able to apply the same naive approach (code it, slap on optimization primitives) and get decent speedups in less well studied domains. reply scoopr 20 hours agoprevSo it seems to be behind a sign-up. Is this just a temporary measure to have some notion of \"control\" while its still being developed, or is this how they are positing it as? Is it interesting project enough that people will jump through hoops to get it? I didn&#x27;t sign up, but I&#x27;m hazarding a guess that its binary-only also? reply beoberha 19 hours agoprevHas anyone here actually used mojo? I’m curious to hear people’s experiences who don’t have a vested interest in its success :) reply dsharlet 17 hours agoparentI tried it out and compared it to C++ at the last release. Here was what I found: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dsharlet&#x2F;mojo_commentsSome of the issues I pointed out there are pretty low hanging fruit for LLVM, so they may have improved a lot in more current releases. reply snowAbstraction 16 hours agorootparentI skimmed your post and I wonder if mojo is focusing on such small 512x512 matrices? What is your thinking on generalizing your results for larger matrices? reply dsharlet 16 hours agorootparentI think for a compiler it makes sense to focus on small matrix multiplies, which are a building block of larger matrix multiplies anyways. Small matrix multiplies emphasize the compiler&#x2F;code generation quality. Even vanilla python overhead might be insignificant when gluing small-ish matrix multiplies together to do a big multiply. reply mark_l_watson 17 hours agoprevExcept for having to follow their \"manual installation\" directions, everything is working great on my Apple Silicon Mac.I have had some frustration with Mojo in that their standard libraries, as far as I have found, lack a lot of general programming support, like file I&#x2F;O, etc. Are we meant to import the Python package and just use that?That said, I love the idea of Mojo. reply CalChris 17 hours agoparentYes, you are meant to import the Python package and just use that. Mojo is a Python superset. It speeds up math but then relies on CPython for grunt work. reply mark_l_watson 16 hours agorootparentThank you. I will adjust to that. reply kelsey9876543 20 hours agoprevfor anyone else wondering this is apparently a programming language? reply cbarrick 18 hours agoparentA programming language created by Chris Lattner, creator of LLVM and Swift. Mojo uses the MLIR infrastructure of LLVM. reply riffic 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know why providing basic context is so hard for some submitters here. reply steezeburger 18 hours agorootparentThe site could also do a much better job. If doesn&#x27;t mention what Mojo is it all on the linked page. reply orangetuba 20 hours agoparentprevIt is a closed source programming language, yes. reply WendyTheWillow 18 hours agorootparentCompiled using electricity from coal power, yes. reply jpetrucc 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been following for a while - I eagerly await when I can build this from source, or install without an auth token!This is a blocker for me to ever adopt this as more than a toy language. These days, if I can&#x27;t use Nix to build + deploy the whole set of requirements (I&#x27;m fine building out the packages themselves), it&#x27;s basically a non-starter!I know they are claiming that it will eventually be open-sourced. Just a bit sad that there&#x27;s no timeline on that reply icapybara 20 hours agoprevDoes “90,000x speed up over pure python” with matrix multiplication mean vs using numpy arrays in python? reply viraptor 20 hours agoparentNo, plain python code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;modularml&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5ce18c47a27c0c4123de1...I&#x27;d like to know how fast numpy is here, but they didn&#x27;t compare... which is weird because that&#x27;s what almost everyone would use. reply riscy 19 hours agorootparentIt’s not just weird, it’s an intentionally dishonest evaluation to build hype around their language.If you ask your average Python programmer what “pure Python” means they’d think numpy is included.Their Mojo code just does the same optimizations numpy certainly has. reply __mharrison__ 19 hours agorootparentMy experience is that most Python programmers would consider \"pure Python\" to basically be using the standard library.There&#x27;s also the issue of doing complicated work with NumPy and you start looping and revert back to slow (pure) Python because you are crossing the NumPy&#x2F; Python interface. Tools like Cython, Numba, and probably Mojo help to solve this. reply gcr 18 hours agorootparentFor scientific users like they&#x27;re targeting, `numpy` effectively _is_ part of the standard library. reply pseudalopex 15 hours agorootparentprevPure Python means written wholly in Python to most Python programmers in my experience. For some Python programmers this excludes the 3rd party libraries they care about. reply ska 17 hours agorootparentprevThe python&#x2F;numpy boundary is a problem, which is sort of the value proposition of efforts like mojo or julia - no argument.But nobody doing any significant numeric work would ever consider a \"pure\" python matrix multiply meaningful. It&#x27;s disingenuous to present that as your comparison, at least without also including the way it&#x27;s actually done in practice.Honestly, it undermines their presentation with anyone involved in the area. reply mirekrusin 18 hours agorootparentprevThe difference and the whole sales pitch is based on that detail - that you write everything in one language; there is no high level and low level language switch, everything is written in one langauge. reply gcr 18 hours agorootparentprevAI developers expect these sorts of comparisons to be taken against accelerated code anyways. Modern Python NN frameworks don&#x27;t spend significant time in the Python interpreter, so that&#x27;s not where users would expect the bottleneck to be for their comparison.It&#x27;s like claiming that your code is faster than MATLAB&#x27;s for loops. Why write gemm yourself?Even if this language is a good idea, I worry that they don&#x27;t seem to understand the audience. reply silok 12 hours agorootparentprevBut that is basically the core value proposition of mojo. You don’t need to drop down into another language to do low level, high performance kernels, you can do it all in mojo. Scalable in terms of target domains, (somewhat similar in that regard to swift). reply subharmonicon 17 hours agorootparentprev> It’s not just weird, it’s an intentionally dishonest evaluation to build hype around their language.Not too dissimilar to Swift, which was launched as being faster than C&#x2F;C++. reply kaycebasques 19 hours agorootparentprevI skimmed the linked code. Is there enough info there to run the same benchmark with numpy? And then if we find out that numpy is also 90000X faster then it&#x27;s fair to conclude that numpy and Mojo have the same performance on this task? I&#x27;m a benchmarking n00b, go easy on me. Just trying to see if my basic understanding is correct... reply elashri 20 hours agoparentprevI think it is just pure pythonI don&#x27;t know about mojo, but they seem to import python module for this benchmark. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;modularml&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5ce18c47a27c0c4123de1...And for some reason they don&#x27;t compare against NumPy https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;modularml&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5ce18c47a27c0c4123de1...What would be more interesting is to use NumPy and do the vectorized opreations. reply almostdigital 17 hours agorootparentI did just that, it&#x27;s 120x faster than numpy. See my comment to OP. reply rdedev 18 hours agoparentprevI really don&#x27;t understand why they do this. I was really excited for the compilation and type checking features but this whole speedup thing is pretty dumb. And I know the people developing mojo knows that too. Kind of seems like some marketing team is pushing them to do all this but their core customers are people who knows what python and numpy is and this kind of talk puts just feels weirdI think that mojo in it&#x27;s current form is not on par with numpy performance (if it was they would be saying that). Even if the performance is same I would still give it a try. Their whole marketing though is making me reconsider reply mirekrusin 18 hours agorootparentThey do this because they want to showcase writing code in single language that can do things that other languages can&#x27;t. Other langauges are either low level or slow, but they are high level and fast. reply oddthink 17 hours agorootparentNaive question, but how do they distinguish themselves from Julia, which is also in that space? reply mirekrusin 16 hours agorootparentThere is large overlap with julia, yes. Both are addressing two-language problem.Mojo is python syntax first where they want to be proper superset, which gives them access to wide python ecosystem and community. If executed well, this alone can absorb community similarly to how ie. typescript absorbed javascript community. Also similar thing happened with objective-c -> swift - also led by Chris, which gives a lot of credibility to the whole initiative.Julia is proper new language you need to learn, use new tooling around it, ecosystem is quite academia skewed, ie. writing web services is probably not the best idea etc.Additionally Julia suffers from \"time to first plot\" problem, which alienates a lot of newcomers who are not familiar or simply don&#x27;t want to switch to programming mode where it becomes less of a problem (repl&#x2F;notebook style where runtime is always active).Both are very interesting languages, but mojo&#x27;s starting point and trajectory seem to be at different level, ie. adoption may be very sharp. reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentJulia can cache JIT code between executions nowadays. reply orbifold 15 hours agorootparentprevJulia is a language that was developed by academics, with not the best aesthetics in the implementation. I see a lot of value in starting with a clean, well engineered layered approach.

Stuff like self-driving labs, process modules in factories and so on.And the idea that you will do everything with a conda package at every point is laughable. You need a compilable language, where code can be ported over from Python very rapidly, and where ML&#x2F;AI tools such as differentiability is a first class citizen. That language doesn&#x27;t really exist today, but multiple billions of actual industrial applications need it.In fact, what the negativity shows here is how skewed Hacker News is towards the bit folks, and how little they talk to the atoms side of things. reply leetharris 20 hours agoprevAnyone else find this Mojo hype and release cycle strange?

In the latest Lex Fridman interview with Chris Lattner [0] when he talks about his ideas behind Mojo it pretty much sounds like he&#x27;s describing Nim. Ok fair, he wants Mojo to be a full superset of Python, but honestly with nimpy [1] our Python interop is about as seamless as it can really be (without being a superset, which Mojo clearly is not yet). Even the syntax of Mojo looks a damn lot like Nim imo. Anyway, I guess he has the ability to raise enough funds to hire enough people to write his own language within ~2 years so as not have to follow random peoples whim about where to take the language. So I guess I can&#x27;t blame him. But as someone who&#x27;s pretty invested in the Nim community it&#x27;s quite a shame to see such a hyped language receive so much attention by people who should really check out Nim. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;pdJQ8iVTwj8?si=LfPSNDq8UKKIsJd3[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yglukhov&#x2F;nimpy reply dom96 20 hours agorootparentprevFor what it&#x27;s worth, I think what Mojo does do better is that it&#x27;s trying to be a better Python.

That&#x27;s much more than $100k.Chapel is also just one of many other projects broadly interested in developing new programming languages for \"high performance\" programming. Out of that large field, Chapel is not especially related to the specific ideas or design goals of Mojo. Much more related are things like Codon (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exaloop.io), and the metaprogramming models in Terra (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terralang.org), Nim (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org), and Zig (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org).But Chapel is great!

I&#x27;m still not convinced Steve Jobs would have given Swift a go-ahead (release).From the start, Swift felt like, as a language, that it didn&#x27;t know what it wanted to say, with a big part of that coming from having just taken a kitchen sink approach to syntax and features. Looking at their same code, 4 lines of python becomes like 12+ lines. I&#x27;m not sure who this attracts.More importantly, he clashed at Tesla. He left a gaping hole in the Swift Tensorflow stuff at Google. He also left Apple and promised that he would still be involved in Swift, until he got pushed out.It&#x27;s not that he isn&#x27;t productive or brilliant, I&#x27;m just not sure I trust someone with a track record of being volatile as a great maintainer of a platform.Overall, this appears to have the same markings of the Cappuccino web framework project. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentSteve was still around when Swift started as a toy project, and most likely gave it a go.Objective-C 2.0 was released in 2006, and Steve Jobs died in 2011.As per Chris Lattner interviews, Objective-C 2.0 and latter improvements were the ground work to have a good interoperability story between Objective-C and the new language prototype that would be eventually be known as Swift in 2014.Note that Apple already toyed with Java as possible Objective-C replacement, when they weren&#x27;t sure if Apple folks educated in Object Pascal and C++ would be keen in adopting Objective-C, latter tried with Ruby (MacRuby) which didn&#x27;t went anywhere, and the develoeprs left Apple founding RubyMotion still going on. reply sa-code 18 hours agoparentprevTheir keynote at the llvm conference looked quite substantial reply redog 17 hours agorootparentYou never met a salesman who believes in the product they&#x27;re hired to sell?A lot of life&#x27;s bullshit is people convinced of their own bullshit.I know I&#x27;m likely to be very wrong here... and they may easily remedy that, I hope they do because I really like the idea&#x27;s they&#x27;ve presented. reply brap 19 hours agoprevSomething about Mojo and the company behind it really rubs me the wrong way. reply tambourine_man 20 hours agoprev“Let’s run a matrix multiplication example using matmul.mojo. On My Apple MacBook Pro M2 Max, I get about 90,000x speedup over pure Python” reply carbocation 19 hours agoparentA very unfortunate choice of comparison on their end. People use numpy, they don&#x27;t write matrix multiplications in pure python. This feels like an own-goal, because bad benchmarks reduce trust. reply jillesvangurp 19 hours agorootparentActually, the point here is that with Mojo, you no longer need to use C&#x2F;C++ libraries for things that are performance critical since it will just compile down to native speed if you need it to. So you can write nice python code (well with the Mojo additions) and it can be fast and optimized and use things like GPUs, multiple cpu cores and it won&#x27;t be bogged down by things like the global interpreter lock. Kind of nice.The point of this benchmark is making it clear that things you wouldn&#x27;t dream of doing with python are fine in mojo.People use numpy because python is stupidly slow. Mojo isn&#x27;t. You can still use numpy of course. But you don&#x27;t have to. reply carbocation 18 hours agorootparentI see your point but respectfully disagree with the conclusion. Comparing to numpy, not native python, would be the right move. Again, I don&#x27;t write matmuls in pure python. I do compute matmuls in numpy. I don&#x27;t actually know whether numpy is 90,000x faster than pure python, so this benchmark is not useful for me.If they want to show all 3: mojo, numpy, and pure python, then that might be the best of all worlds. They could brag about being 90,000x faster than python, while at the same time showing the actual slowdown of using a pure python-like language (mojo) compared to a compiled numpy library. Let&#x27;s say the mojo code ends up being 0.5x as fast as numpy; that would still be a pretty great tradeoff for being able to do it all in one language. If you&#x27;re a python programmer and want to do something that isn&#x27;t possible with the existing compiled libraries, this would be a good sell. To me, that&#x27;s still the real comparison of interest. reply vmchale 18 hours agorootparentprev> People use numpy because python is stupidly slow.People use Python because numpy isn&#x27;t slow!

Numpy is rather slow relative to what you can build with a pure C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Fortran&#x2F;Rust pipeline. Its API usually prevents memory reuse, putting memory allocations on the critical path. You can&#x27;t fuse operators. And, all of its operations aside from calls into BLAS (for example it&#x27;s ufunc elementwise processing) are single threaded.People use numpy bc of the python ecosystem and all the domain specific libraries it is compatible with. It very fast relative to Python and provides aa stable, easy to use, array API. reply foooorsyth 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s cool, but this runs contrary to the drop-in interop they&#x27;re touting. It&#x27;s a pretty confusing initial benchmark to show off. On the Mojo Overview page, they show some numpy+Python using np.max, then they...rewrite np.max using their SIMD parallel map magic?So is this meant to replace vanilla python matmul (which nobody uses IRL)? No? That was just a benchmark to show off their compiler tricks? Okay, how does it fare against numpy (which is actually used)? Well, it&#x27;s faster? But I have to write little wrappers around basic functions like np.max to parallelize them myself? Shouldn&#x27;t that just be in your std lib &#x2F; invisible to the programmer? I thought it was supposed to be a drop-in speed improvement...I don&#x27;t really get it. Am I stupid?
