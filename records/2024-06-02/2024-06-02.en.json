    "commentBody": "Signal: Will leave the EU market rather than undermine our privacy guarantees (twitter.com/mer__edith)514 points by doener 14 hours agohidepastfavorite500 comments somenameforme 13 hours agoThat Tweet links to this [1] description which, in glancing at the text, seems to indeed be accurate: ---- According to the latest draft regulation dated 28 May (Council document 9093/24), which is presented as “upload moderation”, users of apps and services with chat functions are to be asked whether they accept the indiscriminate and error-prone scanning and possibly reporting of their privately shared images, photos and videos. Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before. Probably as a concession to France, the chats of employees of security authorities and the military are also to be exempted from chat control. ---- Strange times we live in. Entertaining, but strange.

Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Bugging communications by investigators with special approval is already an exception to this principle. Government bodies that make sure that laws conform to the constitution should veto any exception broader than that, so this draft should basically be pointless. It feels like there are social/political mechanisms at work that allow that to however happen. They pave the road to Hell little by little, one stone at a time, and this is neither strange nor entertaining. To me, the beginning of this century has similarities with the beginning of the previous, which is quite worrying. reply billywhizz 6 hours agorootparentagreed. i feel the real motivation is much more sinister and much more to do with the geopolitical situation than anything else. the reality is, if anyone is seriously determined to commit what they know are crimes then there are many solutions, of admittedly varying quality, for having private communications outside of the mainstream apps available on the app store. even signal itself has an apk you can install on android from their website. so, it's unlikely this will indeed help in the fight against CSAM or whatever else is purportedly motivating this legislation. the end result will be mass surveillance 24/7 on the vast majority of the population who aren't commiting any crimes at all. it seems to me like big brother's wet dream. ironic that this is exactly the thing the US/EU political leadership have been bashing the chinese for since forever. reply jjmarr 47 minutes agorootparentAny intelligent criminal will just meet face-to-face to discuss their criminal activities.

Seems kind of ridiculous. Seems to be targeting platforms. Will it be illegal to send encrypted texts, what is keeping anyone from using crypto on top of existing messaging? While I do not want to dive into any details on adverse effects of such stupidities, the EU seems to be actually taking a strange road to tech dependent overengineered regulation. It seems that this mostly driven by lobbyists that want to sell compliance services. Also it seems that there is more value in creating regulation rather than making sure it is enforcible. reply xorcist 7 hours agorootparentIf you are in the business of selling SMIME clients as a service to other people, then yes, you would need to implement this if the law passes. Maybe there's an unintended upside to all this regressive business legislation. With all the focus on the \"platforms\", then maybe, just maybe, this will be yet another nail among the thousands of nails needed to finally kill them off. reply riedel 3 hours agorootparentSignal is not selling anything. So my guess is that distribution is enough. So my guess this would also apply to e.g. Thunderbird then. reply DEADMINCE 10 hours agorootparentprev> Will my email client using SMIME have to implement this? Seems kind of ridiculous.

It's been decades by now. And the problem keeps getting worse. So either it's just not working whatsoever and this is useless and should stop. Or it's never really about child exploitation. Just like \"temporary measures\" against terrorism which have been temporary for 30+ years now (no, it didn't start on 9/11). Almost like it was never about terrorism. reply Hizonner 4 hours agorootparent> And the problem keeps getting worse. You're swallowing the propaganda. The problem hasn't changed to speak of. reply lenkite 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy should everyone have to suffer so that state's job in catching criminals is made dead easy ? Such criminals are a microscopic minority of the population. Governments - esp in the west - have disinvested in traditional investigation and moved to using mass surveillance as their default operating strategy. And citizens are being made to pay the price. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agorootparentprevThe bad stuff will just move somewhere else as it always has done. Compromising everyone's privacy will eventually mostly affect innocent people. Or even cause the platforms to cease existing altogether, which looks like a real possibility with Signal. Pedos will just move on to whatever service isn't compromised yet. You can outlaw or hamper secure encryption in some jurisdictions, but due to the generic nature of computers you can't in principle stop people from using secure encryption. reply generic92034 8 hours agorootparent> but due to the generic nature of computers This might only be a temporary state, though. Smartphones are, in that sense, not generic. PC might follow. reply LocalH 1 hour agorootparentSmartphones are general-purpose computers with a bunch of little digital locks, that while strong, are not impervious. Such locks, when used to protect a device owner, are good. The same type of locks, when used to deny a device owner full rights to use their device as they see fit (absent harm done to others), are evil. reply scrps 58 minutes agorootparentprevmtl is saying computers are big boxes of math and you can't ban math. Though given how incredibly clueless politicians have become I wouldn't be shocked if they tried. reply _rm 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you take their motives at face value? Obviously, the moment these platforms lose privacy, the criminals cease communication on them immediately. So they're the last group this is aimed at. The solution to crime is the same investigation and detective work and anonymous tip offs and so on that it's always been. People going undercover and infiltrating these groups and then bringing them down. By chasing the criminals off this platforms, all that happens is the detective work gets harder. Now they've got to go find where to start their infiltration, all over again. This outcome is so obvious that the only conclusions available are that the lawmakers are either IQ 60 morons, or that they have malicious intent. reply okr 1 hour agorootparentI read it somewhere, but most of the crime is done by people with low IQ. So it makes work for the police actually easier. Well, we went in billions to these chat apps. The state just follows. As sceptical as i am, i think, i want the state to resolve online crimes. reply effie 8 hours agorootparentprev> what else are governments going to do One way that would put down lots of exploitation and support privacy of adults would be video and online surveillance of all children when not alone, using a parent-controlled computer to detect bad things happening. This could start in kindergarden and school and gradually expand to all spaces that are not home. Children have some right to privacy, but not as strong as adults. On the 16-th year, if the child wants so, surveillance gets turned off and he/she is granted more privacy. Like with age limits on car driving or working, at some point the state says, you are old enough to take responsibility, we won't protect you from harsh life anymore. This is a targeted, reasonable solution with little collateral damage, that upholds the right to privacy for adults. It's what parents would want, instead of the bureaucrats. And who really, actually cares about safety of the children, parents or bureaucrats? reply Hizonner 5 hours agorootparentI hope you're not a parent. reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparentprev> support privacy of adults > video and online surveillance of all children when not alone So, you want children to have no privacy just to get a tiny bit more privacy to adults? Are adults really this horrible towards children, do you really think you would like this as a child? > Children have some right to privacy, but not as strong as adults. Why the hell not? Do you really think it is ok that your daughter gets constantly video surveilled all throughout puberty? Do you really think that is a lesser evil than your text messages being scanned for some keywords? Would you be happy if there was a camera constantly watching you as you jerked off as a kid? reply effie 2 hours agorootparent> Are adults really this horrible towards children, do you really think you would like this as a child? Only parents would have access to surveillance records. Children often do not like stuff their parents make them do, and their power over them, this would be one more thing, with great benefits. > Why the hell not? Because they are children, they do not have full responsibility for their actions, and they are more vulnerable to abuse, and protecting their safety is more important than protecting their privacy. I want to keep the status quo, where children are protected, and adults have rights. The way stuff is going, we're all getting more like children with one parent called Big Brother. > Would you be happy if there was a camera constantly watching you as you jerked off as a kid? That is not what I'm suggesting. I'm talking about public spaces (including online) where adults are present. If the kid wants to jerk off, or two or more kids want to make love, they can go home or use some private space like a bathroom. reply Jensson 11 minutes agorootparent> Only parents would have access to surveillance records You do realize parents create a lot of the CP out there? Especially if you include non-biological parents, who are legally parents. > That is not what I'm suggesting. I'm talking about public spaces (including online) where adults are present. So you wouldn't stop basically anything? What kind of child porn do you expect to catch using this? It isn't like anyone is creating child porn in public, they do it in the privacy of homes. I assumed you would suggest something that could stop child porn, not just cameras in public places. reply sunshowers 1 hour agorootparentprevBeing under constant surveillance during the most formative years of your life can leave you extremely mentally unwell. reply xorcist 7 hours agorootparentprevThis argument is more thought provoking than people may think. What we see is a shift of power. Electronic communications started out as private enterprises, then mostly taken over by states because of the need centralization, and now almost completely taken over by private enterprises one layer above. Governments are still trying to make sense of what happened and find their role in this new world. Platforms are centralization at work, and it's not that far fetched to think that states could do a better job than Twitter or Facebook. Platforms have immense power. After all, we mostly agree that Facebook very literally facilitating genocide was not good for society. What we disagree on is how much they knew and how much was circumstantial. There is also this idea that jurisdictions matter for platforms. The Chinese connections with Tiktok owners are problematic since we know for a fact that they have the power to influence elections. The American ownership of Facebook is not similarly problematic, largely because the CIA and other institutions interests mostly align with ours. It would not surprise me if the Saudi money financing Twitter/X would turn out to be just as important as the financing of 9/11. In light of that, it should not be surprising that EU states wants to play the game too, even if it will have very little practical effect. reply hellojesus 2 hours agorootparentStates can already play the game. But this isn't playing the game via competition. This is just stealing data via lawfare reply einpoklum 6 hours agorootparentprevJust put the entire population in jail, I'm sure you'll be able to prevent a lot of crime that way. reply bitcharmer 9 hours agorootparentprevYour argument makes as much sense as banning knives because they are sometimes misused to attack people. What about alcohol? Some people drink and drive, we should ban alcohol too! reply cuu508 7 hours agorootparentBanning sale of alcohol in gas stations would not be unreasonable. reply bitcharmer 6 hours agorootparentIt would reply fuzzfactor 1 hour agorootparentLots of them will probably be selling alcohol years after they are no longer selling gasoline. reply Krasnol 9 hours agorootparentprevNeither Whatsapp nor Signal can do anything about it, since they don't know the content of the messages. That is the whole point of their protocol. That is the whole point of privacy. Nobody falls for that crap. We all know that CP is being presented as a scapegoat here because, \"how can you be against something that MIGHT help against CP!?!?!\" while in fact and in the end it'll be used to spy on everything. reply xorcist 7 hours agorootparentNonsense. Whatsapp owns both endpoints. They could know perfectly well what you write, when you write it, to whom, and anything their heart desires by way of their analytics. The messages themselves contains no business value to them. They could send it by carrier pigeon for all they care as long as the client is their product. reply Hizonner 5 hours agorootparentNo. A user owns each endpoint. Whatsapp provides a service to the owners of the endpoints. Yes, Whatsapp is in a position to act unethically and steal information, but that does not make Whatsapp the owner of anything. reply xorcist 4 hours agorootparentWhatsapp is not something you can compile or inspect easily. They own the endpoint, in that specific meaning. They may not have root access on the device, but inside the client nothing is out of scope. It is their client. Any data you enter into the client is data they 0wn. reply sunshowers 1 hour agorootparentYou can definitely decompile WhatsApp on Android to inspect it. I'm sure security researchers do this regularly, including those looking for a bug bounty that could be life-changing. reply benfortuna 4 hours agorootparentprevThey don't have to steal information in order to block inappropriate content. The app itself can detect and block without external intervention. reply hellojesus 2 hours agorootparentPresumably they would use edge based hash scans or ai models to detect unsavory content. But if the content is so extreme as to be unsavory, likely they will be legally required to report it to leo. The next steps are leo seizing your device(s) or leo having WhatsApp start sending all your messages to them for review. What happens when leo adds the hash of a state-loathed meme? reply Krasnol 6 hours agorootparentprevThey \"could\" maybe. But since you seem to not have more information, we have to remain on the assumption that they're still using Signal protocol and can't see what the messange contents are. reply tcfhgj 5 hours agorootparentThey could use the signal protocol AND see the contents reply hellojesus 2 hours agorootparentprevSignal could still see the contents of your messages. Anything you enter into their app could be scanned or sent back in plaintext to some server, all prior to actual transmission via their protocol. The only way to ensure that can't happen is to inspect the code and compile it yourself, or at least validate the hash of the binary you're installing. But we've also recently learned with the xz fiasco that you'll need to be sure to add checks all the way down. Of course, you could always encrypt before entering the text into signal, but at that point why use signal? reply throwaway290 9 hours agorootparentprevYou're right. But apparently every time this topic comes up we cry that this is abuse of our freedom. Tech is not good or bad but it does have unintended consequences and open new ways for abuse. This is tough to swallow for us who work in tech but is obvious to everyone else. If we stay in denial and do not volunteer to help use tech smartly to compensate for bad side effects, they will vote in some dumb law and some bad guys will exploit it for surveillance later. reply Hizonner 5 hours agorootparentThere is in fact no \"smart\" way to compensate for this particular \"bad side effect\". Either your communications are spied on to weed out unapproved material, or they're not. And there is no way to make the system architecture care about which material is allowed to be \"unapproved\". The right answer here is just to accept that, beyond a certain point, further reducing the amount of circulating child porn requires unacceptable tradeoffs. Then stop whining and wishing for impossible technical solutions. reply benfortuna 4 hours agorootparentThere is in fact. You could build AI directly into the app to detect inappropriate content and block it. The app has thus not violated end-to-end encryption, nor has that content been exposed to external parties. Platforms could definitely do more. reply shinryuu 2 hours agorootparentAnd how do you deal with all false positives. That will just be deemed collateral damage? reply hellojesus 1 hour agorootparentTo add to your excellent point, who gets to validate the models efficacy? How do we know the state hadn't trained it to report users talking about maga, or Isreal, or for those with Chinese national lovers? reply BurningFrog 8 hours agorootparentprevGovernment recording all our conversations also has have \"unintended\" consequences. The track record of such societies is rather terrifying. reply throwaway290 8 hours agorootparentYou think I disagree? My point is almost exactly the same, we should stop that (by promoting a saner solution). reply heroprotagonist 12 hours agoparentprevSeriously, who are they expecting to pay for that? AI vision detection run against _every image every person sends to anyone_, among other things, will get ridiculously expensive. Half of the reason Microsoft is pushing \"AI PCs\" with special hardware is so they can push their spying to on-device and reduce all the extra costs the data processing they're imagining for things like automatic-screenshot-analysis-every-x-seconds will need. And they're pretty much experts on spying on users. They've been collecting so much data for so long that apparently they've found a way to utilize what they collect in a way that makes the costs balance out in the end. Whether thats with government access, preferential antitrust treatment, or some actual financial method that directly affects the bottom line, I don't know. Somehow it's worthwhile for them. BUT -- when even Microsoft is looking for more efficient ways to spy on people, and forcing new hardware to support that effort, you know the data collection and analysis technique is definitely not ready to be made a legal mandate. It doesn't make sense at all for some EU decision makers to decide it's acceptable for their citizens to bear the cost of so much data processing. ....wait, how much do large players in AI contribute to these politicians campaigns? Or if not them, who is really pushing this? It seems like someone should really try following the money on this one. reply yard2010 10 hours agorootparentLet me take the other side here. The western world couldn't make it without sovereignty. I do realize that it sounds bad that few states would have such power. But make no mistake - if they won't do it, other actors would, I think that your interests reconcile with a democratic state much more than the other crooked actors. It's just a matter of lesser evil in my humble opinion. reply rightbyte 9 hours agorootparentE2E encryption would prevent anyone from intercepting texts by mathematic certainty. At least on a mass scale, if we worry about back doors. This SaaS fad is the underlying technical enabler of the spying and need to go away. I guess Google is the main culprit by making P2P coms hard.

Especially since you're beside the point, so let me rephrase with the help of my lawyer: the EU does not say anything about how much consumers should be charged for text messages by their operator (i.e. \"cost\"). This was clear from my previous comment... reply vasco 10 hours agorootparent> If you continue to spend more time abroad than you do at home and your roaming consumption continues to exceed your domestic usage your operator may start charging you extra for your roaming use.

Nowhere. They are free to say texts are free (included in plan), or texts are charged at 10 euros each, whatever. The EU only limits surcharges when roaming to other EU countries. Jeez, guys. Edit: I am not backing away from anything, I was rephrasing to sustain your strange cross-examination. You guys are being unecessarily aggressive and argumentative over a simple point. \"Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize.

You can just send anyone you want an encrypted e-mail or message, but Signal can't facilitate that without the required provisions set out in those laws. If these dumb laws get enacted, Signal cannot get away with just pretending you are sending gibberish whilst providing true end-to-end encryption without any client-side scanning or whatever to you, but you are well within your rights do so yourself on top of Signal (if that's even possible); they just can't provide an automated means to do that for you. reply eterps 10 hours agorootparent> they just can't provide an automated means to do that for you What I'm wondering is whether two separate applications can be set up to communicate automatically, with one handling messaging and the other being responsible for encrypting and decrypting the data. What would be against the law in that case? The messaging app? The encryption app? Or the interaction you are doing in that moment? reply Freak_NL 9 hours agorootparentStep one would be determining if anyone actually uses those two apps together. A handful of people? No one cares. Is it now the default way you install Signal (or its two components) and do hundreds of thousands of users do this? Then the next question asked is who is facilitating it and how is that done? Does the backdoored Signal have a plug-in that allows this kind of use? Does Android facilitate that? Those people will likely find themselves in legal trouble. Of course these laws are dumb, but that doesn't mean they can't be (mis)used to get the desired effect. reply effie 8 hours agorootparent> A handful of people? No one cares. Actually police and various agencies do, because when most people aren't encrypting, the few that do are suddenly interesting.

Does Android facilitates IPC and services? reply Freak_NL 8 hours agorootparentThat's not what the law cares about. Being able to encrypt stuff end-to-end, is not what is being targetted — it is not realistically possible. What is being targetted is millions of people getting private, true end-to-end secure communication with no content scanning of any kind through some service. Are you providing that service to millions like Signal is? This law applies. Are you the size of Meta and are you implementing some 'clever' two-component solution to sidestep this law? Expect legal trouble. You can already install a mail client with PGP-support. Will K-9 Mail get in to trouble if a million users in the EU started privately exchanging keys and using GPG with K-9 Mail? Who knows. These laws are not about such practical details. This is about unlocking massive amounts of signal intelligence to do… who knows what, and those large communication platforms are juicy targets. All it needs is a law to coerce them to cooperate. Don't expect reasonable arguments from the proponents of such laws, and don't expect to be able to avoid them for millions of users with clever tricks; you'll still fall foul of the spirit of the law, if not the letter. reply mfiro 9 hours agorootparentprev> The encryption app? That might be the next step. Banning encryption. We live in a strange world right now. reply Freak_NL 9 hours agorootparentThe EU does not want to ban encryption, because it is the backbone of e-commerce and banking. There are plenty of public references that show the EU's explicit support of strong encryption. What some law-and-order types (globally) want, is the means to scan, peek, or otherwise access private communication, especially if that communication is provided by a service used by millions. You can encrypt all you like, but if you use WhatsApp or Signal, laws like these force those services to create a way to eavesdrop. How is probably not defined in the law. Client-side scanning before encryption, having those services act as men-in-the-middle for each conversation; this is all fine, and can use encryption as usual.

It’s not an arm’s race, it’s fundamentally impossible. reply Freak_NL 9 hours agorootparentYou don't seem to understand the point of these laws. It is not about stopping anyone with enough technical know-how from encrypting their communications. This is possible today, and not something which can be easily legislated away without resorting to a much heavier class of draconian laws (at which point you won't be living in a democracy any longer in any case). This is about making it hard (or impossible) for some perceived group of miscreants to communicate privately. People sharing CSAM (however you define that) or dealing drugs, and stuff like that. Anyone can encrypt their communication, but most people don't do this consciously; the masses just use WhatsApp and Signal and what have you. You and your special keyboard are not of interest, and unless you start selling these along with a service to route the encrypted messages to thousands of users, you are not the target of this legislation. Take away Signal and WhatsApp and sending an end-to-end encrypted message to your drug dealer without exchanging keys and agreeing on a protocol suddenly isn't as easy as just opening an app. That's the point of this law. It's a dumb law, but you won't make it go away by playing silly semantic games. reply huygens6363 3 hours agorootparentCriminals are using specialty phones or should I say, were using, because this was recently cracked and thus became useless.

Other examples are playing with the sounds of words, or using memes or rapidly-changing euphemisms.[3] It's too difficult to automatically censor stuff where people have taken a normal word such as \"chair\" and send each other images of chairs as a sign of protest. An image of a chair and a birthday cake with a number of candles could indicate a date of protest. Or a chair in a picture with a number of ducks in the background, or a number of chairs stacked on top of each other.

The picture is probably slightly different in more urbanized places, but, in those, it probably boils down more to a question of money. I'm not sure what to make of your \"a quarter are immigrant\" statistic. Do you mean they live there, without being citizens? Is that number high precisely because the path to naturalization is so difficult? The number of non-citizen permanent residents, for example, is also extremely high in certain rich Arab countries (like the UAE), but they are effectively an underclass of indentured servants. So \"immigration-friendly\" is not what that kind of a statistic is saying at all. reply mft_ 8 hours agorootparent(From personal experience) there's a large proportion of people living in the big Swiss cities as 'ex-pats', working for (mostly large) employers who support/sponsor their immigration and ongoing employment. (Such people are well-paid and equally-treated, and certainly not \"an underclass of indentured servants\".) If one stays employed in the long term, citizenship is not needed, and IME only a small proportion of ex-pats attempt to achieve it - either because their career and life plans are likely to eventually lead them to move elsewhere, or because there's no incentive in their personal case, or disinterest, or because of the perceived difficulties. You're right that parts of the system for achieving citizenship may sometimes be problematic, and the Swiss have somewhat of a reputation for racism, especially in the less metropolitan areas. (Of course, you could also say the same for many countries.). There have been anecdotes of people repeatedly failing to achieve citizenship through exactly the issue you originally raised. That said, the overall approach to citizenship taken by the Swiss is mostly praiseworthy, as some of the more impressive aspects of Switzerland (e.g. its direct democracy, and the engagement of citizens in politics and the democratic process) are embedded within the shared culture of its citizens, and the citizenship process takes a decent shot at preserving this culture - requiring, for example, proof of significant language skills and knowledge of current affairs and politics. reply mtrovo 6 hours agorootparentReminds me of a friend that married a German. In order to become himself a German citizen he had to pass an integration exam with questions about history, law and culture.

Stick to your position. No irony or sarcasm, there is only one reason to use signal and these rules undermine it's integrity and purpose. reply newaccount74 12 hours agoparentI don't agree with this. Encryption is a feature of Signal, but it's not the only reason to use it. The bigger reason to use it is that it is independent from Meta, so you can use it without having Facebook track you. I don't rely on Signals encryption, since there is no way to verify that it works in the way that it does, and even if, there is no way to know that the recipients are as careful as you are. If there is something I don't want others to find out, I just don't write it down. No encryption is fool proof. reply superb_dev 12 hours agorootparentMatrix, IRC, Discord, Telegram, SMS, etc. You’ve got plenty of options to get away from Meta. Privacy and E2E encryption are Signal’s killer features reply lambdaxyzw 10 hours agorootparentI agree, and that's a major part of why I use Signal, but I just want to say that most of my friends (and even family) use Signal, so at this point it's also a network effect for me. reply adastra22 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you just want to be independent of Meta, send an SMS.

[2] Documentary: \"The Great Hack\" (2019) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4736550/ reply newaccount74 11 hours agorootparentprevIs that a joke? Any data that is stored about you can be used against you. We know that Meta tracks everything you do in a pretty invasive manner. We know they use this data to target ads, and while they claim not to share data with advertisers, we do know that people have figured out ways to leak some of that data. Since they share data with a lot of 3rd party tracking companies, we would have to trust all of them to keep our data safe. It is highly likely that some of these companies employ malicious actors. Now, maybe you think you have nothing to hide. But the political landscape changes all the time, and things that were legal one day might be criminalised the next day, or some terrorist organisation gets a hand on your data and figures that you are an enemy of their god for some reason, ... The only way to protect against these things is to not store the data in the first place. reply baxtr 11 hours agorootparentNo it’s not a joke. Outside of tyrannies it’s ok to ask questions. Specifically, I am interested in tangible examples. The one thing I got from your post is: Meta can target you to deliver better ads. If you have other specific examples of what else can happen, please elaborate. I am curious reply lambdaxyzw 10 hours agorootparent>Outside of tyrannies it’s ok to ask questions. Ok, a specific example: by a weird twist of fate, my country outlawed abortion (in most cases). Currently it's easy for affected women to travel somewhere and get help. Some people don't like it. With widespread tracking, it will be possible to target and punish women for breaking the law by getting abortion. reply anonzzzies 11 hours agorootparentprevI worry about future use of my data. If it’s not e2e encrypted, future despots (or, less extreme, insurance companies, which tend to be only slightly less evil than despots anyway) can mine it (with not very good AI) to see if I am a good servant to the state , even though my remarks might be from 15 years ago and not related. reply baxtr 11 hours agorootparentOk understood, so a vague fear of being punished for what you said today in the future by governments or insurance companies. I can see that happening in the future albeit with a low probability in the Western World at least. Of course you never know reply realo 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is no such thing (for me) as a \"good\" ad. I want no ads in my life, ever. When I need to buy something I look for research, reviews, competition, people who actually used the thing for some time and comment on the thing's weaknesses. I want to control when I start being interested in something, and when I stop also. When I need to buy something I need knowledge (weaknesses) and control. Advertisements are exactly the opposite of that. So... no ad can ever be a good ad for me. Period. reply af78 10 hours agorootparentprevI’d like to add that it is not just about governments (democratic or otherwise). Large corporations wield disproportionate powers, in comparison with individuals, and may have a presence across countries and continents. Even if they don’t use the data directly, they may pass it to some other entity. I’m not comfortable with the idea that anything I read or write today may be made available one day to my current or future employer, customers, providers etc. ... In a way I have already internalized this idea. These days every time I use an electronic device I behave as if an unintended recipient was peeking above my shoulder. So my behavior isn’t as free is it was, say, in the 90s, before networked communication was so ubiquitous. reply inamorty 11 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a front door to your house? Why? What can happen? reply baxtr 11 hours agorootparentJust answer the question if you have the answer. reply freetanga 10 hours agorootparentI remind you Turings fate by his own government for being gay not 60 years ago. Today being gay or straight is a non issue in most countries, and Turing life would have been different. My take is the following: we have governments because we tolerate them. Constitutions are nothing more than a social agreement, and they could be torn apart and remade at any point in time. Politicians are our employees - we hire them, we pay them, we can fire them. Sadly in the past 80 years we have started seeing them as our saviors and forgot their power emanates from us. I don’t want my employee (the government) telling me what to do and tracking me. It’s irrelevant whether I have or not something to hide. reply baxtr 10 hours agorootparentI understand this stance and it makes sense. The OP, and that’s how it started, said he switched to signal due to “data harvesters” like Meta. I feel like the conversation here diverged from that to something different. PS: I absolutely follow the logic of restricting politicians. Unfortunately these people are versed with power and how to use it. Otherwise they would have not ended at the top… reply stoperaticless 10 hours agorootparentprevParallel with front door was appropriate answer: 1. This is default expectation (to have privacy, to have doors) 2. If you go abstract, it’s not too useful (its good to have of control of information sharing/ it’s good having control who access your house) 3. It seems impractical to go into details, due to very many different scenarios, details, expectations. Take a set of different “motivations” (incompetence+personal gain+for terror+for ideology push), multiply it by types of actors (phone manufacturer, government, enemy state, criminals), mix in the possibility that law and approach can be changed/ expanded, while keeping in mind that motivations and actors will change year to year. (One thing when such tool is available for consertive gov., other thing when such tool is available for extreeme right/left gov.) Parallels do diverge eventually, with door if somebody breaks it you most probably can see it immediately. While negative effects of privacy breach can take years to surface. reply baxtr 10 hours agorootparentFor me it’s a very bad analogy avoiding to give an answer. Doors and how they’re used is highly cultural and has evolved. There’s nothing “fundamental” you can derive from your mental model of today. Same goes with bike locks and the like. I used to live in a student town where people simply never locked their bikes. It was a custom of that time and place. reply n_ary 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, nothing interesting can happen in short-term, but not sure about long-term given how much surveillance is being built under our noses. Currently, only issue I face is, due to unlimited text/calls benefit in Germany, I also receive a lot of scam/phishing sms or random sales sms about some random agency offering digital marketing, webdev, wordpress etc irrelevant service unsolicited. I noticed that, somehow when such sms arrives, I am very proactive in immediately blocking those numbers, but may be by evening, I start seeing adverts all around the web creepily related to those same sms(mostly different vendors but related business area). Thanks to the garbage that LLM is, now I suspect Google SMS as well as other Android based sms apps are also scanned and profiled to feed to advertisers, which I can't prove but my experience above is definitely not the Frequency Fallacy. reply baxtr 11 hours agorootparentThanks.

The interaction between two people is nobody's business except the two people. reply djaychela 11 hours agorootparentprevRich messaging with images and videos is not universally available without signal or WhatsApp etc... And it's very easy (at least here in the UK) to end up sending an mms message which still costs an arm and a leg. reply adastra22 4 hours agorootparentInteresting. In the USA at least MMS is zero cost on every plan I’m aware of, and the user experience of Signal is pretty much the same as MMS on iOS. Usually the rest of the world is ahead of North America on these sorts of things, so I thought the era of being charged for a SMS/MMS was behind us. reply saulrh 12 hours agorootparentprev> there is no way to verify that it works in the way that it does Since we're specifically talking about Signal, I think that it's worth mentioning that Signal is uniquely predictable here. They published their entire cryptosystem, it's been extensively inspected by the cryptography community, there are multiple open-source implementations that agree with the published mathematics, and I strongly suspect that more than a few people have sat down to verify that the bytes coming out of the app are actually produced by the published protocols. Claiming that that's not \"working the way it does\" is reaching out into territory along the lines of Trusting Trust, the unproven existence of trapdoor functions, and the Problem of Induction. reply newaccount74 6 hours agorootparentRight. There is no way for me to verify that the Signal app isn't actually a trojan created by a US agency with a clever marketing team. It sounds far fetched, but it wouldn't be the first secure messenger that was later revealed to be a covert spying device. I still use the app, because I trust Signal more than Facebook, but the encryption isn't why I trust them. reply nullc 52 minutes agorootparentprev> there are multiple open-source implementations No. Signal locks not not just third party software but also builds of their own \"open source\" code via timebombed forced updates. It's somewhat impractical to use signal except via blinding accepting updates from them. As a result every signal user is sadly quite vulnerable to getting pushed a bad update, particular since app store policy changed to require the app store itself being able to sign updates. Signal could mitigate this by allowing third party clients and/or not timebombing support. reply prophesi 10 hours agorootparentprev> I don't rely on Signals encryption, since there is no way to verify that it works in the way that it does Totally. Not everyone is a cryptographer to review the code and ensure the app they're downloading is what was compiled by the aforementioned vetted code. That's what F-Droid and cybersecurity audits attempt to solve (and Apple's vetting process, though I think their mandatory $100/yr developer license is what drives malware off the platform). The one reason to use Signal is privacy, and its replacement of Meta apps is under that umbrella. reply illiac786 11 hours agorootparentprevHow do you deal with passwords? You got to have a lot of critical passwords which are hence not written down, it’s really hard to memorise this. reply newaccount74 11 hours agorootparentI use iCloud Keychain for passwords. It's a trade-off between security and convenience. Passwords aren't as critical in my opinion, because I can always change them. Sure, it would suck if someone broke into my hosting account or my bank account, but I could probably fix it somehow. I was more thinking about secrets that I don't want people to find out, because there is no way to make people forget something they learned about me that I wanted to hide. reply illiac786 11 hours agorootparentSome secrets are worthless without communications. Think of the poor extortionists. They took a compromising pictures, they would have to sent it via mail without proper encryption. How retrograde. I’m joking around but I did get your point. I just think secrets cannot be categorised simply in “stuff I don’t want anyone ever to learn about” (why would someone use signal for that though) and “stuff I don’t care if anyone learns about”. 99% of the information I send over signal is actually neither, it’s in-between. I don’t want the whole world to see pictures and names of my family. I do want other members of my family to have them. Hence I use Signal for this, because I trust them most (or I distrust them least, depending on the point of view). It’s all about trade-offs, as you said. reply newaccount74 6 hours agorootparentI agree. What I was trying to say was that encryption was not the most important part for me. Facebook or Twitter DMs would be secure enough for family photos in my opinion, if they didn't use invasive ad tracking. The fact that Signal is independent is why I use it, not because of superior encryption. reply slowmotiony 11 hours agorootparentprevThat one's easy, he just gives all his passwords to Apple Inc. reply 231 more comments...

    "originBody": "Parable of the Sofa Search When Lauren was pregnant with a child who’s now turning 25, we purchased a comfy dark-brown leather sofa which fits our living room nicely. What with kids and relatives and employees and cats and Standards Comittees and friends and book clubs and socials, the butt-support cushions had, a quarter century later, worn out. So we had them replaced, at a fair price, by a small local business. Which is something that modern capitalism is trying to make impossible. I’ll be honest; when we realized how ratty the sofa was getting, my first thought was “crap, gonna have to buy a sofa”. But Lauren said “No, because new sofas are junk. Also, Luxcious.” I’ll get to Luxcious in a bit, but it turns out that new sofas, by and large, really are. Why would that be? Well, check out Why Are (Most) Sofas So Bad? in Dwell magazine which has a weirdly-intermittent paywall, here’s another version. From early in the piece: “Sofas made in the past 15 years or so are absolute garbage, constructed of sawdust compressed and bonded with cheap glue, simple brackets in place of proper joinery, substandard spring design, flimsy foam, and a lot of staples.” It’s excellent, well-written, and will take you some surprising places. But the subtext is drearily familiar. Globalization: Check. Cheap-labor arbitrage: Check. Tax engineering: Check. High profits: Check. Flat-packing: Check. Late Capitalism: Check check fucking check. But, quality furniture is expensive to make, and should be, but doesn’t wear out fast, thus deserves extended maintenance. Luxcious · Its Web site (“Breathe new life into old furniture”) is way prettier than its location, in an old and extremely miscellaneous high-traffic zone: auto-body shops, hipster lounges, self-storage, beauty supplies… They’re family-run and idiosyncratic. You have to know how to find the sketchy rear parking lot and walk in the back door. But they’re friendly and competent. Here’s the new leather they bought for the cushions. And here’s the sofa with the re-covered cushions in place. Yes, from this angle, the new cushions make the sofa’s back look shabby, but it’s not as obvious to the naked eye and after a decade or so we’ll never notice it. The whole job cost us $1100 Canadian. Given that the sofa cost three-thousand-plus 1999 dollars and new leather sofas of the “not flat-packed sawdust and glue” variety quickly get into five figures, the choice was a no-brainer. “Lifestyle” · This kind of transaction is exactly what modern capitalism is trying to stamp out. A single-location family-owned business that provides a living for a few people? With no plans to load up on debt or other financial engineering? Or for growth into unicorn status? No GenAI dimension? No marketing or public-relations people? In conversation with venture capitalists, you hear the phrase “lifestyle business”, meaning one that is doing nicely and rewarding the people who run it and which isn’t planning for unbounded growth. The words “lifestyle business” are always, of course, uttered in a voice dripping with contempt. Luxcious is a lifestyle business. It seems blindingly obvious that an economy with a higher proportion of lifestyle businesses is going to be more resilient, more humane, and immensely more pleasant than the one that the Leaders Of Industry are trying to build. How would we get there from here? I’m not smart enough to figure out what the regulatory regime is that would ban most of what private-equity does and tilt the playing field in favor of resilient lifestyle businesses. But I’d sure vote for a political party that convinced me it was trying to achieve that. Updated: 2024/06/02 Contributions Comment feed for ongoing: From: Kegan (Jun 02 2024, at 01:09) >But I’d sure vote for a political party that convinced me it was trying to achieve that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Solidarity_Party [link] From: Raphael (Jun 02 2024, at 03:37) Just a small suggestion for making the text a little bit easier to parse: I initially parsed this sentence: > \"Given that the sofa cost three-thousand-plus 1999 dollars\" as \"3000 + 1999 dollars\", wondered for a second why you would write it this way, and then understood the correct meaning. Less ambiguous variants might be: > Given that the sofa cost more than $ 3000 in 1999 or > Given that the sofa cost $3000+ in 1999 dollars [link] From: Terry Braun (Jun 02 2024, at 07:22) Micro Payments. Tracking advertisements are nice words for \"lies\". The business model of the current internet is targeted dishonesty. The corollary is the crucial part. This is the megaphone effect. Since Google (and others) show dishonest results, honest results get drowned out. Someone has to pay for the internet. But more importantly the business model of the internet determines what it CANNOT do. There are other dimensions that I find quite scary. Twitter had code \"if democrat then\" & \"if republican then\". In effect then, targeted dishonesty destroys community. And we see that now. I think we have missed the significance of Sapir Whorf. If we do not limit it to verbal language or to just thinking, the result is that our modes of interaction determine our society. (See Twitter and Teargas). I'm a big fan of John Holland's \"Hidden Order\" because it made me think about constructing artificial gestalts. I worked on an implementation of the early RIP routing protocol and recognized that it was odd and only later realized it is an artificial gestalt. I'm still working on Webkeycard.com & billzly.com - both of which sometimes work. And now Aroostookian.com. A prototype local community site. Best Terry [link] From: Chris R (Jun 02 2024, at 08:06) I think the thing I truly hate about furniture right now is that I have no way at all of knowing if I'm buying good furniture or globalization-killed flat pack shit, and no sense of how to start to find it. [link] From: Karen Breakey (Jun 02 2024, at 10:08) “ I’d sure vote for a political party that convinced me it was trying to achieve that.” Me too. Great discussion of a decades-old business. But, do you think lifestyle businesses created today can be profitable enough for the owners and employees to live decent lives and become homeowners in this neofeudal economy without family money behind them? Trying to be optimistic (I don’t have family money and I yearn for a walkable world). But I have my doubts [link] From: Rob (Jun 02 2024, at 10:50) Part of this is not just rapacious late stage capitalism. Part of it is market-driven environmentalism. Wood of any kind, be it construction lumber or finer furniture quality, is ridiculously expensive. It was bad enough pre-pandemic; now it is unbelievable. In North America at any rate, this (along with NIMBYism of course), is one of the drivers of the housing crisis-- my organization has been trying to build things for a couple of years now, but construction costs are off the charts. This is not entirely a bad thing, we need to protect and grow our forests, not chop them all down. But mdf/particle board (often covered with veneer, which is where a lot of the precious actual wood is going-- veneer-making is a magical and beautiful Black Art) is what almost everything is made of these days. Its heavy as Scandinavian black metal, as fragile as Donald Trump's ego, and as impossible to repair as a Middle East peace process. Lovely stuff. I dunno, I am very uncertain about the economic & environmental trade-offs of super-expensive but long-lasting, vs cheap and crappy disposable furniture. But I do know buying furniture of any quality is a lot like buying a car from a super sleazy high pressure used car dealership. Those places are, of course, hotbeds of usurious financing schemes exploiting the poor and the optimistic. I do think we might all be a lot better off on all counts buying used stuff from Goodwill or equivalent, and employing shops like Luxicious to rehab it.

Small business (or “lifestyle business”) vs big brand is often framed about being high quality vs cheap price, because in practice it often is. But in theory the two things are completely unrelated. Yes fixing stuff is good for the planet. But big brands could offer customer service just fine if people wanted it. Small business vs big brand is a problem of predictability. If you have many independent small businesses, NOT all of them will be good. It will be a mixed bag what you get in your area. OP has felt so fortunate with his local highly-skilled asian-owned small business that he felt compelled to write about it on the internet. Not everyone will be this lucky. And in a world where information travels very fast (this is really the key point) this system is unsustainable, as there are really only 2 options: either people accept the fact that some neighbourhoods are served worse than others, or the take the car and make the travel up to the nice asian shop they read about on the internet, because that’s apparently worth it. But, surprise, this second option doesn't scale. Because as soon as the nice asian shop goes viral, they realise they can’t keep up with the demand at all. And so they will probably refuse lots of customers. (Note, I’m not even considering the option they might increase prices) In this sense, the derogatory “lifestyle business” comment makes sense, since I think it’s meant to highlight how elitist it is. It doesn't scale in the sense that it creates a race for who is able to cop the best option. When I need a sofa, I want to be able to “just” get a sofa. Simple and predictable. If the sofa is good quality, even better. reply alerighi 4 hours agoparent> Yes fixing stuff is good for the planet. But big brands could offer customer service just fine if people wanted it. They could but they won't. Because they realized (and probably all agreed) that it's far more profitable to sell the customer a new product, rather than fixing the old one. And since they are the big brands, and they have practically a monopoly (think about big tech companies) they make the rules. They even have the power to sue the crap to which small business tries to fix their products, like Apple did multiple times. The repair culture is not something sustainable for a big business, that to stay in the market has to increase year after year their sales, and the only way to do so is... making consumers buy new products, even if they don't need them. How to do so? Decrease the quality of the products, make them impossible to repair. No big business would stay alive if they sold you a couch that lasts a century. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentI must have hallucinated that I went to an auto dealer for warranty service last week. Enterprise software companies have consulting and support services. At the consumer level though, most people aren't willing to pay for the cost of the manufacturer or retailer repairing clothing and other relatively low cost items. As in this article, there are local businesses that do such things but it can be really hard to justify for lower cost items. I have had shoes resoled and otherwise repaired but haven't done it in years and probably most recently a pair of very expensive custom hiking boots that were made to be repairable. (And the repair was probably $200 or so.) reply wholinator2 2 hours agorootparentWhile i do take your point, i think a big problem with discussions about \"big businesses\" is that they are completely different most of the time. A sofa =/= a car =/= enterprise software. But then how do discussions happen? A sofa is just a thing to sit on at home, you undoubtedly have other things to sit on. Needing to repair a sofa is not catastrophic to survival. Needing to repair a family car can be catastrophic to an individual or family. Needing to repair enterprise software can be catastrophic to a large business itself. There's hugely different consequence scales here, which i guess correlates with how willing a \"large\" company is to provide the desired support reply brewdad 2 hours agorootparentprevAt the consumer level it frequently doesn't make sense to repair an item. My son had a part fail on his luggage last winter. It might be covered under warranty (the manufacturer wouldn't commit until inspecting the product) but the repair would require shipping the suitcase to them and paying for return shipping. It was going to cost about $150 minimum to have it repaired on a piece that is already a decade old and could be replaced for $200 on sale. I have seen this repeated many times across products. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentI've had minor clothing repairs/alterations done at a local dry cleaner for a fairly nominal sum.

Things I might have taken in to be repaired 25 years ago like a laser printer just don't make sense to do so today. reply beowulfey 5 hours agoparentprevThe point of the article is that the big business model is \"continued growth\", which depends on constantly increasing sales, which means products necessarily get shittier so that they must be replaced more frequently. Small \"lifestyle\" businesses do not operate under this principle and encourage reuse and renewal. They represent opposing philosophies. Whether you can \"just\" get a sofa from big business or not, that is precisely what they hope for, and ideally you should be purchasing a sofa more frequently than you already do to further support this notion. reply photon_lines 4 hours agorootparent'The point of the article is that the big business model is \"continued growth\", which depends on constantly increasing sales, which means products necessarily get shittier so that they must be replaced more frequently.' - Sorry to interject here, but this is extremely wrong and nowhere did I find this take-away from the posted article. There are massive businesses that do sell extremely high-quality products - in fact, Japan went through a transition where their businesses went from producing absolute junk (i.e. just like the stuff we import from China today) to producing extremely high quality products (see Juran, Crosby, and cost of quality measures etc...). The key point of the article is that consumers today choose low-priced products since the market gives it to them. If you allow a person to buy a $800 sofa which looks great on the outside and is made in China albeit with extremely low quality materials vs. a sofa which looks almost exactly the same but is priced at $1500 but is of much higher quality - most consumers will obviously choose the $800 dollar sofa vs the $1500 since that's how the free-market functions. Is this rational though? Well - the consumer will need to buy 4 of the $800 dollar sofas just from having to replace them throughout a 20 year period vs. having the ability to buy one (the $1500) one but that's not obvious to the consumer and it's not clear how to even make this type of judgment. Which sofa really costs the most to you given the information I just provided? The high-quality $1500 one or the $800 dollar one? To a rational person having all of the above information - the more costly one is cheaper - but to an average consumer not having this information the clearly cheaply made product is the better choice. People also are prone to more short-term thinking in many societies which also doesn't help things but the takeaway in general which you posted there is very wrong: mass production and scale usually result in higher-quality products not lower quality ones. reply drrotmos 3 hours agorootparent> If you allow a person to buy a $800 sofa which looks great on the outside and is made in China albeit with extremely low quality materials vs. a sofa which looks almost exactly the same but is priced at $1500 but is of much higher quality - most consumers will obviously choose the $800 dollar sofa vs the $1500 since that's how the free-market functions.

In my experience, the choices tend to be the $800 low quality sofa, the $3000 low quality but with a name brand sofa, and the $6000 low quality but with an even fancier name brand sofa. Presumably there are some manufacturers that still produce furniture that's actually made of massive wood rather than cardboard and veneer, but it's becoming increasingly rare. reply photon_lines 33 minutes agorootparentI don't disagree with you - but this also explains the determining factor in which product wins and why today's markets or sofas are lower quality than they were 30+ years ago. If price doesn't matter - what's going to be the driving force in buying behavior? Consumer behavior in other words is no longer driven by quality or long-term cost: today, people will simply choose the lowest cost items and deal with the pain of having to replace it every X years. This drives the market to place a premium on what then? LOWEST COST. Lowest cost = the manufacturers that cut corners and reduce quality, so the market driving force (consumers) lead to a game where the lowest cost producers win and thus saturate the marketplace with junk. reply brewdad 2 hours agorootparentprevI bought a sofa from a local builder a few years ago for around $2500. The frame is well built but the cushions lost their original shape within 6 months.

You alluded to another point yourself: > Looks great on the outside Consumers aren't often equipped to evaluate quality, partly due to skill issues, partly because the corners are cut in places which are hard to spot before purchase. Price doesn't work as a discriminating factor (except to filter out a portion of the worst inventory) because of the number of brands explicitly trying to pass off junk as high-quality luxuries. If you really can't tell which one is better, and you're as likely to get scammed buying something expensive, why not put less money on the line for something that has a chance of being good enough? reply PaulDavisThe1st 1 hour agorootparent> Consumers aren't often equipped to evaluate quality, partly due to skill issues Maybe, maybe not. But regardless, in parallel to this, we have corporations whose modus operandi is at worst to lie to consumers about quality, and at best to mislead. And not just about specific products, but about quality as a general concept. reply hansvm 1 hour agorootparentI'm pretty sure we're in total agreement. E.g., with the right training you can tell the difference between the sort of particle board flooring that will balloon up and be destroyed when a drop of water lands on it, the sort of particle board flooring that resists minor water infiltration, and various grades of \"real\" floors, but most people don't have that training. Separately (and I _think_ my messaging was clear about this -- talking about the corners being cut being ones that are hard to discover and describing the companies doing that shit as scammers), yes I totally agree; corporations are absolutely not passive participants in consumers being unable to make educated decisions. Even major brands will actively defraud consumers (e.g., Garmin revoking a bunch of lifetime licenses on Navionics software and trying to whitewash public opinion by claiming it was for the customers' own good, or Atlassian blatantly ignoring the CCPA because it's a fairly toothless law), and there exists a plethora of maybe-legal-but-obviously-wrong behavior from most successful companies, including but not limited to \"lies, or at best misleadings.\" reply wanderingstan 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is a key factor: businesses have learned to “optimize” by cutting corners wherever people can’t perceive the deficit. The product just has to last long enough. reply hansvm 45 minutes agorootparentIn the off-chance this is a good place to ask, how does a consumer (or, ideally, the existing governing body) fight back? I'll briefly walk through a hypothetical scenario to have something concrete to talk about, then ask about the normal alternatives? Say you have an IoT device. It's marketed as a device capable of doing a task (e.g., scanning car OBD codes). That task can be done offline. The device initially does that task offline. The app had a backdoor, and the owning company used that backdoor to force logins on previously happy users. Later, they restrict functionality-which-could-be-completely-offline-and-used-to-work to people who pay for a monthly subscription, or maybe they go out of business or otherwise just decide to shut down the servers (see the recent Spotify debacle). With that backdrop: - The ToS usually ban class actions and require arbitration. - The fraud in question is on the order of $20-$200 -- not worth being pursued for most people. - The ToS are somehow magically invoked when you buy the product, regardless of whether you even saw a warning message suggesting that there might exist a legal agreement which you should read. The usual outcomes are (1) you get a default judgement and are unable to exercise it because the company goes bankrupt or does some sort of shenanigan which requires a lawyer costing more than the damage in question (a common solution is spinning off a subsidiary owning all the bad debt and responsibilities, keeping the assets elsewhere, kind of like what Johnson and Johnson tried after the talc/cancer debacle), (2) despite the company's best efforts you get a class-action judgement, and the company settles for much less harm than they inflicted, happily pocketing the difference, (3) other more complicated and/or less desirable situations. What does an individual do to limit their liability in a world where that sort of fraud seems to be condoned, and what options do we have as a society to reduce the overall problem? reply kmoser 31 minutes agorootparentprev> Well - the consumer will need to buy 4 of the $800 dollar sofas just from having to replace them throughout a 20 year period vs. having the ability to buy one (the $1500) one Even an $800 sofa will probably last much longer than five years. An added benefit to disposable items is that when you move and/or your tastes change, it's easier to abandon the old sofa and buy a new one than to take the old one with you. (With a little luck and perseverance you may even be able to recoup a few bucks by selling the old one.) reply borski 4 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that sofas haven’t come down significantly in price. These shittier products aren’t actually much cheaper than, for example, a custom made sofa. I know this because I just bought a custom made sofa. But the quality is incomparable. reply photon_lines 4 hours agorootparentYes but this is once again where the free-markets and economics come in: if the mass-produced ones match the custom-made ones in price, consumers will start switching to custom-made sofas. The mass-production suppliers will either have to 1) lower the price of their sofas or 2) increase the quality of production to match the quality of the custom-made ones. Both 1 and 2 are great for consumers and this is why competition is so great :). Notice that all of this is driven by the choices the CONSUMER (me and you) make. reply jprete 3 hours agorootparentThis is a very theoretical argument but I don't think it happens that way in reality, because of all the ways that real human beings are not economically perfect agents. Particularly the information asymmetries - it's much harder to gauge the reputation of a small business vs. a big one. reply borski 3 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not quite true, because many people don’t have good custom sofa makers near them. Moreover, because they are small businesses, they don’t have the same capacity for marketing as big brands; most of their business is word of mouth. Also, custom sofas take time to build - not much, but 2-4 weeks or so. So there are a lot of reasons big brands are convenient. But you pay for that convenience in quality. reply brewdad 2 hours agorootparentNot sure about sofas but when I bought a bed and some bookcases and nightstands last year all from national retailers, the lead time was 4-12 weeks depending on the product.

Every business supports the lifestyle of its employees, by providing them with money and (sometimes) benefits. But that doesn’t mean every business is a “lifestyle business.” What makes a “lifestyle business” is that the owner picks the lifestyle they want first, then designs a business around that. For example someone who wants to go rock climbing all the time is not going to consider a furniture repair shop in a big city to be a “lifestyle business.” Probably few people would consider furniture repair to be a lifestyle business, unless your preferred lifestyle is to do manual labor in a crappy warehouse every day with few vacations. Lifestyle businesses usually take one of a few shapes: - Monetizing the lifestyle directly: for example Instagram influencers who make a business out of their personal travel, fashion, outdoor adventure, etc. - Running a high-leverage business at a low intensity: for example a highly automated SaaS business that is kept small and easy to run, so the owner can spend most of their time doing other things. This is usually what VCs look down on, because they seek out high leverage business models and consider anything less than max intensity to be a wasted opportunity. - Optional businesses: for example low-intensity “consulting” gigs that independently wealthy people operate to keep from being bored, or for tax advantage. reply po 7 hours agoprev> How would we get there from here?

And they are in crappy little out of the way places because that’s where real estate is cheap, and they don’t need foot traffic. Customers come find them when they need furniture repaired. Furniture repair is also not a “lifestyle business.” That phrase is not a synonym for small business. Furniture repair is hard work and low margin. Customers are intermittent so it’s hard to take time off (because you risk losing a significant project). A lifestyle business is a business that people set up who are trying to fund their preferred lifestyle. For example, a single person SaaS that creates monthly passive income, like half the people here on HN are trying to set up. I worked for a lifestyle business: the owner was an entrepreneur with 2 successful exits and did not need to work. But he had set up a tech consultancy so he could work on a few interesting projects a year and funnel all his favorite expenses (new tech gadgets, cars, travel, etc) through a tax-advantaged business entity. He picked his lifestyle and then built the business around that.

So you might get totally ripped off. Whereas if you pay $800 for the IKEA sofa every 5 years, you know you're actually getting what you're paying for. Plus people move apartments, move houses, move cities. Sometimes every 5 years or even more often. The sofa that fit in the old apartment is too wide for the new one. Or the style that made sense in your prewar apartment looks silly in your modernist one. Or now you have kids and you need it to be stain-resistant. Or what felt like a cool trendy leather couch when you were 25 now looks tacky and vulgar to you when you're 34. For a lot of people, a sofa that's a fifth the price, that lasts a fifth as long, isn't a bug -- it's a feature. Quite simply, your sofa needs change. reply atopal 4 hours agorootparentI don't understand where the idea comes from that IKEA sofas fall apart after 5 years.

Their more expensive ones come with a 25 year warranty and still only cost $2,500: https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/stockholm-sofa-seglora-natural-... reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentIt is a very \"limited\" warranty: https://www.ikea.com/us/en/files/pdf/40/04/4004a9de/seating_... If the sofa breaks, then sure it's covered. But it explicitly doesn't cover fabric or leather coverings -- and good luck trying to convince them that the foam padding has gone all flat. Whereas in my experience, how long a sofa lasts is determined precisely by how long the coverings and cushions last. (I've never in my life seen a sofa break.) So the IKEA warranty is irrelevant there. Your UPPLAND sofa may work great for 30 years in a guest room where it's sat on 5 times a year. But good luck getting it to last 10 years in the living room where the whole family is using it every day and kids are climbing all over it. (Of course, more expensive IKEA sofas do tend to last longer than the cheapest ones -- people are usually talking about the cheap ones.) reply tanepiper 2 hours agorootparentNo sofa has a 25 year warranty on fabric, that wouldn't make sense - but you can of course by insurance for it and usually most non-IKEA sofa shops will offer you Scotchguard cover usually for 3 to 5 years. Depending on the Sofa you can or course get one that has IKEA+ which is replaceable covers, which you can't do with most other sofas. (Disclosure: I work at IKEA, although I only found out the 25 year cover a few weeks ago) reply ric2b 2 hours agorootparentprevThe stuff that isn't covered is the stuff that will naturally wear out with use and can be easily replaced, so I don't see the problem. reply crazygringo 5 minutes agorootparentThe point is cheap stuff wears out a lot more quickly, and it's not easy or cheap to replace fabric and padding, and may not even be financially worth it. The point is that having a 10 year warranty doesn't mean your cheap sofa is going to last as long as an expensive one.

I'm at a loss for scenarios that would raise the bar for the sofa game. A shabby sofa could signal something about the owner that might be indirectly relevant to the mating success.

What I think is a big part of the difference is that back then, US was fighting with peer powers and it was possible for it to lose. Over time, it transitioned to only fighting wars with much weaker opponents - wars with no \"lose\" condition, where the only variable is how much money the US is going to spend on any particular conflict before getting bored and recalling soldiers home.

None of them involve deceiving partners into pretending higher level of fitness. Thinking about this it becomes a little clearer why this is. When you're buying a sofa the seller usually doesn't buy a sofa made by you. So there is an assymmetry. The sofa dealer not only monopolizes most information about the deal (factual quality, costs; competitors are shared information). Also, the dealer can influence what you think. Economies of scale at play both in advertising and production. Secondly, only if those two sofas you exchanged were to be used to produce the next generation of sofas and only if those newly merged sofa designs would be the sole base of contemporary sofa design would this comparison hold. Then it becomes clear that if both parties engage in deceiving each other the species as the hypthetical owner of all evolving sofa designs must lose. reply card_zero 6 hours agorootparentIf you don't mind another Wikipedia page, there's the (biology) theory of honest and dishonest signals in general: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory reply nakedneuron 4 hours agorootparentI don't mind at all.

I think emotionally non loaded interactions are possible here. VCs are in the business of risky business. Their objective is to fund businesses that will grow very large or collapse very fast and where there is lots of uncertainty as to which and where money increases the likelihood of the former outcome. That's the thing they do. The mechanism that they typically use is a note that converts to equity when a certain raise condition is met either by the private or public market. Someone who goes to them and offers equity in a profitable business that has no intention to attempt to rocketship or IPO is making a mistake. What exactly do you expect them to do here? Give you money in exchange for incredibly illiquid private stock that doesn't pay out? That sounds like a dumb deal. Only a moron would give you money on terms like that. But that doesn't mean you can't get money. Small business financing is available from banks and the government. And you can do the typical thing of starting successful businesses and selling them off and climbing the ladder. Every day small businesses are sold for values from $1k to tens of millions. They're not valued the same as venture-backed startups because they don't have the same cone of possibility as them. If you're going to a VC to fund a Ford dealership in Golden, CO you have to be an imbecile. Not because starting Ford dealerships is dumb, but because you're going to a basketball coach and asking him to teach you tennis. Entrepreneurial people are rare. So when you go to this coach, and he sees you're athletic, he's more likely to say \"Why not basketball?\" and give you a hundred reasons you should play basketball. That doesn't mean tennis is a dumb sport. Or even that you wouldn't have a better chance with tennis. It means you went to a basketball coach and he wants you to play basketball because your success is also his. For someone with this guy's reputation, he could easily run the business himself. And it's the same for geohot. He doesn't need venture funding to sell $1 million worth of AI at home devices. It's not contempt from the VC.

If they encourage a thousand lifestyle business bloom, one might turn into a boot-strapped \"unicorn\" that didn't take their money, so it's in their own interest to make lifestyle businesses seem like a terrible idea. The more talented people are convinced the only way to start a business is with VC, the higher a value VCs can extract from talented people.

Though I think there could be more to it than that: (1) the full development of that site would have required cooperation from the news industry that isn’t easy to get and (2) I don’t think they got the word out well because despite star-studded founders and investors and my being interested in that sort of thing (to the extent of doing market research and product analysis for that kind of thing) I never heard about it until the last week…. And that’s for a business much more interesting and innovative that the comparable Threads or Bluesky. From the outside though it seems like 1.5 years is not a lot of time to exhaust the possibilities of growth for a site like that. (As I see it Reddit took more like 3 years for subreddits to become what we know) On the other hand there are the zombie unicorns. I have been watching Temu: I saw the ads, I bought what could be most of my halloween costume this year and two rolls of fox stickers (not sure if that was a mistake or a dark pattern) and a dragon figurine.

Even at American prices, $25 billion could have built a lot of subway or light rail but Uber won’t leave such a legacy. Or if it does it will be breaking the economics of both chain and independent restaurants who have reshaped their businesses around a delivery business for which the economics doesn’t really work.

When we're discussing capitalism, people seem to get it in their head that it's either what we have now, or you can fuck off to North Korea. How I would characterize my ideal economy is one where the feedback loop works: people can make reasonable guesses about what a product is, how long it will work for, and what its cost is. They can adjust their purchases according to their needs, which tells us which products should exist and which should not. Businesses do not trick the customers into thinking a thing has more value than it actually does. A very large part of this economy is accurate information, and a very large part of accurate information is trust. After all nobody is going to know more about the product than the people who made it, and they will always have an interest in representing their product in the most positive light. Lemon problem. The thing that seems to characterize the economy now is that businesses will violate your trust in order to make money. They know that you won't read the license agreement when you sign up for a service, and they will use that. They know that you won't be checking what kind of joins your sofa has. They know that you won't get as much value from their items as the adverts say. All of these abuses can be done within the law, perhaps because these same businesses are involved with shaping the law. The feedback loop is broken, and this leads to the same problem as what the Soviet Union had. Their problem wasn't that people were lazy and didn't go to work. Their problem was that they made the wrong stuff. Things that nobody wanted, often with the same quality issues as what you get these days buying an item from a market economy. Note that GDP figures will still not know this, it just sees all the crap and counts the money paid for it. Often we pick on MBAs when it comes to this sort of critique, and there's some merit to it. If your only goal is to make money, and the economy is riddled with loopholes where you can make money without providing value, then we will have an economy that doesn't provide a lot of value, because MBAs are really good at finding these types of things. reply temporarely 9 hours agoparentThe political system angle is a red herring, imo. The issue is how is money created, who gets to create it, and what sort of political economy then grows around it. Our system is based on private entities creating money out of thin air and then charging interest on it. Everybody else must service these debts so continual \"growth\" is baked into the system. IMF (surprisingly) allowed two economists to take a look at an alternative.

Irving Fischer is associated with it, and Fischer was a mentor/inspiration to Milton Friedman, who, amongst other things, gave us: > The Friedman doctrine, also called shareholder theory, is a normative theory of business ethics advanced by economist Milton Friedman which holds that the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.[1] This shareholder primacy approach views shareholders as the economic engine of the organization and the only group to which the firm is socially responsible. As such, the goal of the firm is to increase its profits and maximize returns to shareholders.[1] Friedman argues that the shareholders can then decide for themselves what social initiatives to take part in, rather than have an executive whom the shareholders appointed explicitly for business purposes decide such matters for them.[2] * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine You know, the philosophy that Boeing's management has been following the last decade or so. The post that you are replying to wrote: > The thing that seems to characterize the economy now is that businesses will violate your trust in order to make money. Under the ideology of Fischer and Friedman this is just fine. So I'm not sure putting forward an economic idea (\"Chicago plan\") by them would really help in preventing/reducing/rolling back 'Late Stage Capitalism' (or whatever) or accelerate its effects more. Probably the latter. reply temporarely 4 hours agorootparentThere is an abstract in the paper which is more authoritative than wikipedia. You should read the paper. Also whatever Friedman said or did is entirely irrelevant to the so-called Chicago Plan - it's not called the Friedman plan after all : At the height of the Great Depression a number of leading U.S. economists advanced a proposal for monetary reform that became known as the Chicago Plan. It envisaged the separation of the monetary and credit functions of the banking system, by requiring 100% reserve backing for deposits. Irving Fisher (1936) claimed the following advantages for this plan: (1) Much better control of a major source of business cycle fluctuations, sudden increases and contractions of bank credit and of the supply of bank-created money. (2) Complete elimination of bank runs. (3) Dramatic reduction of the (net) public debt. (4) Dramatic reduction of private debt, as money creation no longer requires simultaneous debt creation. We study these claims by embedding a comprehensive and carefully calibrated model of the banking system in a DSGE model of the U.S. economy. We find support for all four of Fisher's claims. Furthermore, output gains approach 10 percent, and steady state inflation can drop to zero without posing problems for the conduct of monetary policy. reply solidasparagus 9 hours agoparentprevThat leaves a market gap and then a better company can fill it, unlike centralized economies. Is that happening? I would say yes, at least in some cases. High-quality, direct-to-consumer brands are great. I rely on purchasing guides for many of my buys and those point me to brands whose primary attribute is quality (or cost effectiveness) instead of marketing or historic adoption. That's great for me and great for the company! But many people haven't adapted to ecommerce like that. I think that will change as people learn to have more suspicion and place more of their trust in neutral third parties (historically how you made purchases when everything was local and your community gossiped about which places were good and bad). Yeah, there will be issues when those third parties turn out not to be trustworthy (like Yelp), but I think overall the ability to make well-informed purchasing decisions has never been higher.

We know that a system like North Korea's is possible. We know a system like ours is possible. We don't have any evidence that any other system is actually possible. Sure you could imagine something better. But such a system could very easily have fatal flaws you didn't imagine. In fact, North Korea started as just such a utopian ideal. You could also argue that we used to have a system that was better than this. But if that system ultimately became this one, than reverting to the previous state would likely at some point result in the current state occurring again. So in a sense \"Do you want to live in North Korea?\" is the only valid question. reply thrance 6 hours agorootparentI think North Korea was always an authoritarian state from the get go, it was built by the soviets over the ruins of the Korean war. It's just coated in a socialist paintjob just like many other dictatorships. You're right in that reverting to a previous system will always be a temporary solution, but I don't believe there is any perfect system able to endure until the end of times. \"Do you want to live in North Korea?\" should never be used as an argument against any kind of reforms deemed \"socialist\" by the Right. As a start, would it be so bad to implement a carbon tax? Tighter control of human rights on foreign imports? Stronger social nets? The list goes on... reply buffalobuffalo 4 hours agorootparentSure. I agree Many of those things would be a net benefit. So why don't we have them? It seems to me, the main reason is that representatives won't vote for them. Why not? Mainly because their financial and political incentives are structured in such a way that they can't. Why are these incentives like this? You can keep peeling back layers of the onion like this forever, but as some point you realize it's just due to structures of the system that will recreate themselves in any similar system. Like how wings evolved separately in different evolutionary branches but all conform to a similar structure. Any capitalist economic system will have methods for vested interests to inhibit many types of positive change. reply thrance 3 hours agorootparentHumm sure, I agree with most of what you said.

While not good for American workers, off-shoring and outsourcing have lifted over a billion people out of poverty since the 1980s. China had the fastest growing middle class in the world, so much so, that as a buying market they’re absorbing the entire stock of many categories of high quality or luxury goods that are preferred by the middle class. The Chinese worker making my phone may hate their job for similar or different reasons than the investment banker, both who famously have jumped from buildings due to work stress, both famously faces of capitalism. But, that Chinese worker is now able to provide for their family including their education and onward advancement in a way that wasn’t possible before. Since the 1980s China has been speed running the Industrial Revolution, with massive cities forming of people who were almost entirely in rural areas previously in abject poverty and doing subsistence agriculture, all of whom now work jobs that have elevated them out of that poverty. You can say a lot of truthful negative things about capitalism but pointing to manufacturing jobs in China is completely missing the thread. reply thrance 3 hours agorootparentEconomic growth by itself means nothing for the working class. Without redistribution it amounts to exactly zero improvement of their living conditions.

    "title": "Cambridge's Controllable 'Third Thumb' Enhances Hand Functionality in Diverse Users",
    "originLink": "https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/third-thumb",
    "originBody": "Getting to grips with an extra thumb It's easier than you might think By Craig Brierley Members of the public have little trouble in learning very quickly how to use a third thumb – a controllable, prosthetic extra thumb – to pick up and manipulate objects. Cambridge researchers tested their robotic device on a diverse range of participants, which they say is essential for ensuring new technologies are inclusive and can work for everyone. An emerging area of future technology is motor augmentation – using motorised wearable devices such as exoskeletons or extra robotic body parts to advance our motor capabilities beyond current biological limitations. While such devices could improve the quality of life for healthy individuals who want to enhance their productivity, the same technologies can also provide people with disabilities new ways to interact with their environment. Professor Tamar Makin from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge said: \"Technology is changing our very definition of what it means to be human, with machines increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives, and even our minds and bodies. \"These technologies open up exciting new opportunities that can benefit society, but it’s vital that we consider how they can help all people equally, especially marginalised communities who are often excluded from innovation research and development. \"To ensure everyone will have the opportunity to participate and benefit from these exciting advances, we need to explicitly integrate and measure inclusivity during the earliest possible stages of the research and development process.\" Dani Clode, a collaborator within Professor Makin’s lab, has developed the Third Thumb, an extra robotic thumb aimed at increasing the wearer’s range of movement, enhancing their grasping capability and expanding the carrying capacity of the hand. This allows the user to perform tasks that might be otherwise challenging or impossible to complete with one hand or to perform complex multi-handed tasks without having to coordinate with other people. The Third Thumb is worn on the opposite side of the palm to the biological thumb and controlled by a pressure sensor placed under each big toe or foot. Pressure from the right toe pulls the Thumb across the hand, while the pressure exerted with the left toe pulls the Thumb up toward the fingers. The extent of the Thumb’s movement is proportional to the pressure applied, and releasing pressure moves it back to its original position. In 2022, the team had the opportunity to test the Third Thumb at the annual Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, where members of the public of all ages were able to use the device during different tasks. The results are published today in Science Robotics. Over the course of five days, the team tested 596 participants, ranging in age from three to 96 years old and from a wide range of demographic backgrounds. Of these, only four were unable to use the Third Thumb, either because it did not fit their hand securely, or because they were unable to control it with their feet (the pressure sensors developed specifically for the exhibition were not suitable for very lightweight children). The Third Thumb team at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition Participants were given up to a minute to familiarise themselves with the device, during which time the team explained how to perform one of two tasks. The first task involved picking up pegs from a pegboard one at a time with just the Third Thumb and placing them in a basket. Participants were asked to move as many pegs as possible in 60 seconds. 333 participants completed this task. The second task involved using the Third Thumb together with the wearer’s biological hand to manipulate and move five or six different foam objects. The objects were of various shapes that required different manipulations to be used, increasing the dexterity of the task. Again, participants were asked to move as many objects as they could into the basket within a maximum of 60 seconds. 246 participants completed this task. Almost everyone was able to use the device straightaway. 98% of participants were able to successfully manipulate objects using the Third Thumb during the first minute of use, with only 13 participants unable to perform the task. Ability levels between participants were varied, but there were no differences in performance between genders, nor did handedness change performance – despite the Thumb always being worn on the right hand. There was no definitive evidence that people who might be considered ‘good with their hands’ – for example, they were learning to play a musical instrument, or their jobs involved manual dexterity – were any better at the tasks. Older and younger adults had a similar level of ability when using the new technology, though further investigation just within the older adults age bracket revealed a decline in performance with increasing age. The researchers say this effect could be due to the general degradation in sensorimotor and cognitive abilities that are associated with ageing and may also reflect a generational relationship to technology. Performance was generally poorer among younger children. Six out of the 13 participants that could not complete the task were below the age of 10 years old, and of those that did complete the task, the youngest children tended to perform worse compared to older children. But even older children (aged 12-16 years) struggled more than young adults. Dani Clode said: \"Augmentation is about designing a new relationship with technology—creating something that extends beyond being merely a tool to becoming an extension of the body itself. \"Given the diversity of bodies, it's crucial that the design stage of wearable technology is as inclusive as possible. It's equally important that these devices are accessible and functional for a wide range of users. Additionally, they should be easy for people to learn and use quickly.\" Co-author Lucy Dowdall, also from the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit, added: \"If motor augmentation – and even broader human-machine interactions – are to be successful, they’ll need to integrate seamlessly with the user’s motor and cognitive abilities. \"We’ll need to factor in different ages, genders, weight, lifestyles, disabilities – as well as people’s cultural, financial backgrounds, and even likes or dislikes of technology. Physical testing of large and diverse groups of individuals is essential to achieve this goal.\" When technology isn't inclusive There are countless examples of where a lack of inclusive design considerations has led to technological failure: Automated speech recognition systems that convert spoken language to text have been shown to perform better listening to white voices over Black voices. Some augmented reality technologies have been found to be less effective for users with darker skin tones. Women face a higher health risk from car accidents, due to car seats and seatbelts being primarily designed to accommodate ‘average’ male-sized dummies during crash testing. Hazardous power and industrial tools designed for a right-hand dominant use or grip have resulted in more accidents when operated by left-handers forced to use their non-dominant hand.

How hard was it to relearn? at first I'd try to move my toe and something else would move, it felt weird - but doctor's orders were essentially don't do anything for 3 months, bed rest and keep the leg raised - all the muscles turned to jelly ... then months of physio, in the pool and then in the gym - at that point, once I started moving stuff again my brain had adjusted - that muscle moves my foot, not my toe - I didn't have to do anything explicitly to make it change, it just did reply deaddodo 5 hours agoparentI think if you just exit your subjective perspective, this type of adaptation becomes obvious. What is using a game controller, keyboard + mouse, bicycle handlebars, snowboard, etc but augmentation. Yeah, it's designed to be ergonomic from the outset, but that doesn't change the fact that it is an augment. reply unshavedyak 21 minutes agorootparentAgreed. Furthermore, it feels uniquely weird when a scenario comes up where these \"external augmentations\" don't behave correctly. I often experience this when putting my laptop in the center of my normal desk setup. I'll instinctively go to move my laptop's mouse cursor via my desk mouse, and suddenly it doesn't work.

Just do it, focus on the outcome, stay relaxed and the body will figure it out. I've been through enough learning cycles to appreciate this but this was a real hurdle for me when I was young because my default was to rely on systems and rules. Ironically as a swimmer my biggest breakthroughs in speed and technique as a teenager were intuition borne out through thousands of hours of repetition but it took me many many more years and a very good piano teacher to conceptualise the art of not conceptualising. reply jcul 4 hours agorootparentMaybe not really the same thing, but for some reason it reminds me of learning to roll your Rs, when learning Spanish or Italian as an English speaker.

But then after a while it just happens as you don't think about and are just speaking with natives. reply resonious 6 hours agorootparentprevSimilar here. For a very long time, I thought that being good at something was knowing the system and rules, and applying them consciously every time. It's funny because I legit thought that that's what I was doing while playing video games or doing martial arts (the only things I was reasonably good at for quite awhile). It turns out the learning and doing processes are both deeply subconscious; very little goes on in the conscious mind during both. reply smogcutter 4 hours agorootparentDeveloping that automaticity with a physical skill also unlocks the brain to do other parts that are conscious. After a game, Lebron James can explain what happened in a play moment by moment for every player on the floor, and everything he was thinking and planning as the play developed. He’s done it in post game press conferences off the top of his head. Granted he’s maybe the all time greatest, but it’s illustrative. He’s not thinking at all about how his body is going to do what it does. That’s completely automatic. He’s thinking a lot about the higher level strategy of the game. reply cromulent 1 hour agorootparentConsistent with many technical sports such as Formula One motor racing.

It's both super nerdy and practical (i.e., based on practitioners' empiric experience). Basically, it sees the body as a complex system of organs/tissues/cells that tries to solve movement problem under the pressure of different constraints. In a simple words, coaching then is the art of creating/manipulating constraints in order to optimize that search for the solution to the movement problem. In a way, it's way deeper than \"subconscious\". A large portion of the science behind CLA is based on Nikolai Bernstein's works from the 1930-s (the guy who coined the term \"biomechanics\"). He wrote about the hierarchical model of motor control, where 5 different systems (that evolutionary are completely different) must work in synergy to solve the movement problem. There is a great book that explains the science behind CLA called \"How we learn to move\" by Rob Gray. reply Taniwha 11 hours agoparentprevBTW - if you ever find yourself in a situation like this - do the physio work, own doing it, no one's going to tell you to do it more than you, and a good physio will give you a plan to follow - in my case having access to a hot physio pool was the big thing, an hour a day every day effectively I crawled in and eventually walked away to the gym reply cwillu 10 hours agorootparentI had surgery to repair a shattered wrist; after the cast came off, the surgeon said he'd follow up in 3 months to start physio, but in the mean time as much as it hurts, I can't break it by stretching.

I stared at it for a bit, and then my brain adjusted and when I looked away, it affected what I looked at. I think my realization was that my brain didn't just do simple things, it did complex in many dimensions to adapt and fix things. The same thing goes with your foot, and it goes way deeper than we realize. It's probably not that one muscle, it is ALL the muscles in the area working together to help you walk.

It's named after the ramps at intersections that were mandated by the ADA for folks in wheelchairs, but they turned out to be really good ideas in general and helped folks with strollers, on bicycles, and more. Similar things happened with closed captioning. Lots of other examples. I bring it up because I wonder if this isn't the opposite of that. You come up with a technology aimed at healthy people, study how healthy people can adapt to using it, and maybe popularize it one day with healthy people. Because there are so many more people whose digits all work, it's a much broader audience. But once it's productionized and popular, I bet it'd probably do a lot of good for folks who'd need it. reply saulrh 12 hours agoparentThis is absolutely the case - in software, accessibility features are in many cases identical to power user and engineering quality features. Color-theme support is necessary functionality for color vision deficiency modes, labels and tags on UI elements enable screen-readers just as much as they enable automated testing suites, configurable keybindings make it easier to get your app working with assistive input devices. It's such a strong relationship that even bigcorps know it's a thing; I got talks about it during Google employee trainings. reply spanktheuser 3 hours agorootparentIf anyone needs further convincing, remember that the journey from power user to experiencing disability is inevitable (age-related sensory & skeletal-muscular decline) and in some cases, abrupt (traffic accident, keyboard/mouse related RSI).

If you ever thought it was annoying to have to spend two hours on the phone to get Comcast to cancel your internet, imagine how much it would suck to try to do that with a sign language interpreter sitting next to you, or with text-to-speech and speech-to-text systems in the loop. reply readams 14 hours agoparentprevThere are some lucky circumstances where this is true, but most such accommodations are not like that. Usually some trade-off must be made, in cost or in functionality. For example, with those same cut curbs, we now need to put a bumpy panel to allow blind and visually impaired people to feel the transition from curb to street, but these make the cut much worse for anything with wheels. reply whoistraitor 12 hours agorootparentI would say actually in the vast majority of cases of accessibility interventions, it benefits everyone. Everyone is, at various points in their lives, a varying degree of disabled (defined in terms of functional deficits). Whether injured, pregnant, chronically ill, a wheelchair user, elderly, or — heh — even intoxicated, thinking broadly about users of the spaces and tools we design is always going to yield more positive than negative externalities imho. In cases where this is not true, I’d challenge designers and engineers to find more novel designs that can genuinely be used by anyone and not cost too much inconvenience. This can sometimes mean starting from scratch and questioning our assumptions. Eg. Even the need for a curb-to-street indicator presupposes a street that is used by both big metal vehicles and pedestrians, whereas perhaps there’s a solution that means those paths never cross. Ie. More fundamental urban and transport design instead of band-aiding atop legacy systems. reply clipsy 14 hours agorootparentprev> but these make the cut much worse for anything with wheels.

Have you thought about trying something similar using Android? Taking the compass and doing small short vibration blips, you can also pair them with sound and light for testing or reinforcing it. Although I can imagine that the compass is not very accurate and the vibration control on Android is probably all over the place in terms of consistency between devices. But being able to have it as something compact that you probably already carry around could make it real-life useful.

How to acquire and manage an extra set of eyes? How to install a mini-map capability onto your daily person? I'm thinking about cameras connected to a network where a server computer performs as the central hub for information and control. The set of cameras are mounted on drones or something and you have to control the drones (since artificial intelligence is still a tricky problem to solve). The problem to solve is getting over not just control but constantly receiving new information types and pathways. Instead of the photo receptors in the human eyeballs, you now have in addition to your old eyes digital information from an array of cameras. You have the drones for taking the cameras with you everywhere you go. A whole lot of new stuff gets dumped on you and you're now basically undergoing physical therapy for a new organism or species. Maybe twitching your tongue becomes a new daily occurrence? Or how about some hand signals forming to trigger indexed movements (a mapping between signals and output responses stored in the networked system's central database)? This is maybe how commands are sent. And that means you need an increase in power production for supporting the new infrastructure of your new lifestyle. And it will look like a gross hack in the end. Not that clean and sleek looking stuff you see in the movies. I guess pioneering is rough and rugged like that? Sending commands is the easy part. But reading information, on top of the baseline of daily living, seems to create an information overload situation, yes?

    "originBody": "David Thompson About Blog Projects Lisp: Icing or Cake? June 01, 2024 Tags: lisp scheme guile gamedev gamejam chickadee The Spring Lisp Game Jam 2024 ended one week ago. 48 games were submitted, a new record for the jam! This past week has been a time for participants to play and rate each other’s games. As I explored the entries, I noticed two distinct meta-patterns in how people approached building games with Lisp. I think these patterns apply more broadly to all applications of Lisp. Let’s talk about these patterns in some detail, with examples. But first! Here’s the breakdown of the jam submissions by language: lang entries % (rounded) ---- ------- ----------- guile 15 31 fennel 10 21 clojure 5 10 cl 5 10 racket 4 8 elisp 4 8 s7 3 6 kawa 1 2 owl 1 2 I haven’t rolled up the various Schemes (Guile, Racket, S7, Kawa) into a general scheme category because Scheme is so minimally specified and they are all very distinct implementations for different purposes, not to mention that Racket has a lot more going on than just Scheme. For the first time ever, Guile came out on top with the most submissions! There’s a very specific reason for this outcome. 11 out of the 15 Guile games were built for the web with Hoot, a Scheme-to-WebAssembly compiler that I work on at the Spritely Institute. 2 of those 11 were official Spritely projects. We put out a call for people to try making games with Hoot before the jam started, and a lot of people took us up on it! Very cool! The next most popular language, which is typically the most popular language in these jams, is Fennel. Fennel is a Lisp that compiles to Lua. It’s very cool, too! Also of note, at least to me as a Schemer, is that three games used S7. Hmm, there might be something relevant to this post going on there. The patterns I’m about to talk about could sort of be framed as “The Guile Way vs. The Fennel Way”, but I don’t want to do that. It's not an “us vs. them” thing. It’s wonderful that there are so many flavors of Lisp these days that anyone can find a great implementation that suits their preferences. Not only that, but many of these implementations can be used to make games that anyone can easily play in their web browser! That was not the case several years ago. Incredible! I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that both patterns are valid, and while I prefer one over the other, that is not to say that the other is inferior. I'll also show how these patterns can be thought of as two ends of a spectrum and how, in the end, compromises must be made. Okay, let’s get into it! Lisp as icing The icing pattern is using Lisp as a “scripting” language on top of a cake that is made from C, Rust, and other static languages. The typical way to do this is by embedding a Lisp interpreter into the larger program. If you’re most interested in writing the high-level parts of an application in Lisp then this pattern is the fastest way to get there. All you need is a suitable interpreter/compiler and a way to add the necessary hooks into your application. Since the program is mainly C/Rust/whatever, you can then use emscripten to compile it to WebAssembly and deploy to the web. Instant gratification, but strongly tied to static languages and their toolchains. S7 is an example of an embeddable Scheme. Guile is also used for extending C programs, though typically that involves dynamically linking to libguile rather than embedding the interpreter into the program’s executable. Fennel takes a different approach, recognizing that there are many existing applications that are already extensible through Lua, and provides a lispy language that compiles to Lua. Lisp as cake The cake pattern is using Lisp to implement as much of the software stack as possible. It’s Lisp all the way down... sorta. Rather than embedding Lisp into a non-Lisp program, the cake pattern does the inverse: the majority of the program is written in Lisp. When necessary, shared libraries can be called via a foreign function interface, but this should be kept to a minimum. This approach takes longer to yield results. Time is spent implementing missing libraries for your Lisp of choice and writing wrappers around the C shared libraries you can’t avoid using. Web deployment gets trickier, too, since the project is not so easily emscriptenable. (You may recognize this as the classic embed vs. extend debate. You’re correct! I'm just adding my own thoughts and applying it specifically to some real-world Lisp projects.) I mentioned Guile as an option for icing, but Guile really shines best as cake. The initial vision for Guile was to Emacsify other programs by adding a Scheme interpreter to them. These days, the best practice is to write your program in Scheme to begin with. Common Lisp is probably the best example, though. Implementations like SBCL have good C FFIs and can compile efficient native executables, minimizing the desire to use some C for performance reasons. Case studies Let’s take a look at some of the languages and libraries used for the Lisp Game Jam and evaluate their icing/cake-ness. Fennel + love2d love2d has been a popular choice for solo or small team game development for many years. It is a C++ program that embeds a Lua interpreter, which means it’s a perfect target for Fennel. Most Linux distributions package love2d, so it’s easy to run .love files natively. Additionally, thanks to emscripten, love2d games can be deployed to the web. Thus most Fennel games use love2d. ./soko.bin and Gnomic Vengeance are two games that use this stack. Fennel + love2d is a perfect example of Lisp as icing. Fennel sits at the very top of the stack, but there’s not really a path to spread Lisp into the layers below. It is also the most successful Lisp game development stack to date. S7 + raylib This stack is new to me, but two games used it this time around: GhostHop and Life Predictor. (You really gotta play GhostHop, btw. It’s a great little puzzle game and it is playable on mobile devices.) Raylib is a C library with bindings for many higher-level languages that has become quite popular in recent years. S7 is also implemented in C and is easily embeddable. This makes the combination easy to deploy on the web with emscripten. S7 + raylib is another example of Lisp as icing. I’m curious to see if this stack becomes more popular in future jams. Guile + Chickadee This is the stack that I helped build. Chickadee is a game library for Guile that implements almost all of the interesting parts in Scheme, including rendering. Two games were built with Chickadee in the most recent jam: Turbo Racer 3000 and Bloatrunner. Guile + Chickadee is an example of Lisp as cake. Chickadee wraps some C libraries for low-level tasks such as loading images, audio, and fonts, but it is written in pure Scheme. All the matrix and vector math is in Scheme. Chickadee comes with a set of rendering primitives comparable to love2d and raylib but they’re all implemented in Scheme. I’ve even made progress on rendering vector graphics with Scheme, whereas most other Lisp game libraries use a C library such as nanosvg. Chickadee has pushed the limits of Guile’s compiler and virtual machine, and Guile has been improved as a result. But it’s the long road. Chickadee is mostly developed by me, alone, in my very limited spare time. It is taking a long time to reach feature parity with more popular game development libraries, but it works quite well for what it is. Hoot + HTML5 canvas I also helped build this one. Hoot is a Scheme-to-WebAssembly compiler. Rather than compile the Guile VM (written in C) to Wasm using emscripten, Hoot implements a complete Wasm toolchain and a new backend for Guile’s compiler that emits Wasm directly. Hoot is written entirely in Scheme. Unlike C programs compiled with emscripten that target Wasm 1.0 with linear memory, Hoot targets Wasm 2.0 with GC managed heap types. This gives Hoot a significant advantage: Hoot binaries do not ship a garbage collector and thus are much smaller than Lisp runtimes compiled via emscripten. The Wasm binary for my game weighs in at < 2MiB whereas the love2d game I checked had a nearly 6MiB love.wasm. Hoot programs can also easily interoperate with JavaScript. Scheme objects can easily be passed to JavaScript, and vice versa, as they are managed in the same heap. With all of the browser APIs just a Wasm import away, an obvious choice for games was the built-in HTML5 canvas API for easy 2D rendering. 11 games used Hoot in the jam, including (shameless plug) Cirkoban and Lambda Dungeon. Hoot + HTML5 canvas is mostly dense cake with a bit of icing. On one hand, it took a year and significant funding to boot Hoot. We said “no” to emscripten, built our own toolchain, and extended Guile’s compiler. It's Lisp all the way until you hit the browser runtime! We even have a Wasm interpreter that runs on the Guile VM! Hoot rules! It was a risk but it paid off. On the other hand, the canvas API is very high-level. The more cake thing to do would be to use Hoot’s JS FFI to call WebGL and/or WebGPU. Indeed, this is the plan for the future! Wasm GC needs some improvements to make this feasible, but my personal goal is to get Chickadee ported to Hoot. I want Chickadee games to be easy to play natively and in browsers, just like love2d games. The cake/icing spectrum I must acknowledge the limitations of the cake approach. We’re not living in a world of Lisp machines, but a world of glorified PDP-11s. Even the tallest of Lisp cakes sits atop an even larger cake made mostly of C. All modern Lisp systems bottom out at some point. Emacs rests on a C core. Guile’s VM is written in C. Hoot runs on mammoth JavaScript engines written in C++ like V8. Games on Hoot currently render with HTML5 canvas rather than WebGL/WebGPU. Good luck using OpenGL without libGL; Chickadee uses guile-opengl which uses the C FFI to call into libGL. Then there’s libpng, FreeType, and more. Who the heck wants to rewrite all this in Lisp? Who even has the resources? Does spending all this time taking the scenic route matter at all, or are we just deluding ourselves because we have fun writing Lisp code? I think it does matter. Every piece of the stack that can be reclaimed from the likes of C is a small victory. The parts written in Lisp are much easier to hack on, and some of those things become live hackable while our programs are running. They are also memory safe, typically, thanks to GC managed runtimes. Less FFI calls means less overhead from traversing the Lisp/C boundary and more safety. As more of the stack becomes Lisp, it starts looking less like icing and more like cake. Moving beyond games, we can look to the Guix project as a great example of just how tasty the cake can get. Guix took the functional packaging model from the Nix project and made a fresh implementation, replacing the Nix language with Guile. Why? For code staging, code sharing, and improved hackability. Guix also uses an init system written in Guile rather than systemd. Why? For code staging, code sharing, and improved hackability. These are real advantages that make the trade-off of not using the industry-standard thing worth it. I’ve been using Guix since the early days, and back then it was easy to make the argument that Guix was just reinventing wheels for no reason. But now, over 10 years later, the insistence on maximizing the usage of Lisp has been key to the success of the project. As a user, once you learn the Guix idioms and a bit of Guile, you unlock extraordinary power to craft your OS to your liking. It’s the closest thing you can get to a Lisp machine on modern hardware. The cake approach paid off for Guix, and it could pay off for other projects, too. If Common Lisp is more your thing, and even if it isn’t, you’ll be amazed by the Trial game engine and how much of it is implemented in Common Lisp rather than wrapping C libraries. There’s also projects like Pre-Scheme that give me hope that one day the layers below the managed GC runtime can be implemented in Lisp. Pre-Scheme was developed and successfully used for Scheme 48 and I am looking forward to a modern revival of it thanks to an NLnet grant. I'm a cake boy That’s right, I said it: I’m a cake boy. I want to see projects continue to push the boundaries of what Lisp can do. When it comes to the Lisp Game Jam, what excites me most are not the games themselves, but the small advances made to reclaim another little slice of the cake from stale, dry C. I intend to keep pushing the limits for Guile game development with my Chickadee project. It’s not a piece of cake to bake a lispy cake, and the way is often hazy, but I know we can’t be lazy and just do the cooking by the book. Rewrite it in Rust? No way!

I used it as the Scheme for Scheme for Max, an open source extension to the Max/MSP computer music environment that puts a Scheme interpreter in Max, and I love it. It occupies a space somewhere between Guile, Clojure, and CL, while being very minimal, and is dead easy to embed. It is also much more liberally licensed (BSD) than Guile. If you like CL macros with first class environments, you will probably like s7. It's also dead easy to use in WASM, which I am doing for a music pedagogy project. It's using the icing approach, but I would say the cake is 3/4 icing. Notably, it was not difficult to make generic functions for calling JS functions from Scheme and vice versa, which has made things very smooth. A ganache perhaps. :-) reply mikemee 22 minutes agoparentAnother vote for s7. We successfully embedded it and SQLite as the (non graphics) engine for otherwise native apps on iOS and Android. Super fast. Great FFI. Reliable. Small. Huge benefits from shared code across our mobile apps, insanely fast unit tests and a clean set of tooling. Ultimately we switched to Fennel as a more pragmatic Lisp for mobile. AFAIK we were alone using s7 on mobile whereas Lua especially is a common mobile extension. Partly also this reflected the state of r7rs Scheme compatibility. We were running Guile on the desktop for development while shipping s7 and subtle incompatibilities would bite us regularly (a fun one was parameter evaluation order). Thumbs up to both s7 and fennel for their great projects and community. reply runlaszlorun 5 hours agoprevNice piece.

I mean it is valid to use it for the fun of it, just wondering. Lua is already more or less a Scheme clothed in a more conventional syntax.

And even the \"untagged memory\" bit might not hold; with things like CHERI, a LispM style architecture is due for a major comeback. reply imachine1980_ 12 hours agorootparentHi I think is in the hypothesis (I'm not sure) of that we have edition made by the pdp 11 keyboard developer and tooling that's old and design whiout introspection in mind showcase in this video, the video is really cool but little bit long https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s?si=FdwCbmRnU1gJIXJx reply pjmlp 56 minutes agorootparentprevOr SPARC ADI and ARM MTE, already around, only Intel and AMD keep failing to deliver something that actually works, e.g. iAPX 432 and MPX. reply coliveira 5 hours agoparentprevLisp is unsuitable for modern CPUs because of memory hierarchy. Lisp operates primarily with lists, which can have pointers all over memory. This was not a problem on earlier CPUs because all memory was the same with similar random access time. Modern CPUs cannot access pointers in memory with the same speed, they need to follow locality rules for performance. This means that an algorithm using something like C or Fortran arrays will always be faster than a Lisp list based version. reply pjmlp 54 minutes agorootparentApparently some people keep being stuck in 1960, when Lisp 1.5 manual was published. Since the 1980's that modern Lisps support all common data structures. reply lispm 3 hours agorootparentprevModern CPUs can execute Lisp just fine, like they execute languages like Java and Javascript, which also use a lot of pointers. Just like those, Lisp offers vectors, strings, hash tables, structures/records and objects. > This was not a problem on earlier CPUs because all memory was the same with similar access time. That's not true. Many early systems had small RAM sizes (example: a DEC VAX 11/780 had a few Megabytes and often served dozens of users) and 10 (or more) times larger slow virtual memory. Lisp systems then tried to deal with that with the first generational garbage collectors, often also compacting (related objects stayed near in memory). Ephemeral GCs watched for changed memory in RAM. reply dwringer 4 hours agorootparentprevCommon Lisp allows one to use arrays or other structures, and can even be used to inline assembly. So despite lists being a major part of the ecosystem and code representation itself, they are not mandatory for implementing an algorithm, or necessarily a performance drawback to using lisp. By the same token, it's easy for people to accidentally use lists and pointers to implement algorithms just as inefficiently in other languages - Python comes to mind. A standard approach in Python is to lean on external libraries for high performance computation, and this can be done just the same way in Lisp - but Lisp can also be used directly to write efficient low level algorithms by making a conscious effort not to use the list- and pointer-based functions to do so. reply f1shy 3 hours agorootparentprevDepending on the implementation for short list they can be optimized (just as strings in C++). You may be right with C and Fortran. But tbh in an era where the tiniest thing has an OS with MMU, I really prefer GC when the performance is not a problem. If it is just a performance concern, then ASM will always beat C… Like everything in engineering is about the right trade off. reply rscho 2 hours agorootparentprevPlease try one of the big Lisp/Scheme yourself instead of spreading uninformed opinions. reply shawn_w 4 hours agorootparentprevLuckily, lisp has arrays too, and a bunch of other data structures besides lists. reply wtetzner 4 hours agorootparentprevIf the cons cells are allocated linearly it's fine.

Dunnet was originally written by Ron Schnell in 1982, as a Maclisp program running under TOPS-20. [1] In 1992, he ported it to Emacs Lisp; however, the Emacs Lisp version is more than just a simple port of the original, it extends the game with new rooms/items/puzzles, but also removes MIT-centric content–e.g. the \"endgame\" computer at the end of the game was originally named MIT-SALLY, was located at MIT, and was accessed via Chaosnet–the GNU Emacs version removes all those (dated) MIT references–although the GNU Emacs version contains (obviously intentionally) equally dated (albeit more widely recognisable) content such as a VAX 11/780 [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnet_(video_game) [1] Original is here: https://github.com/Quogic/DunnetPredecessor/blob/master/foo.... reply stevekemp 13 hours agorootparentI've been an Emacs user for 20+ years and had never stumbled across that game, thanks for highlighting it!

    "originBody": "SCIENCE ETHICS Internal messages show how the new head of one of the world’s oldest universities organized a citation cartel For years, Professor Juan Manuel Corchado demanded that his collaborators include up to 20 references to his own work in their papers. On Friday he took office as the new rector of Salamanca University in Spain Juan Manuel Corchado, center, received a standing ovation after winning the elections for rector in which he was the only candidate, on May 7. RAQUEL J. SANTOS (USAL) MANUEL ANSEDE Madrid - MAY 31, 2024 - 19:16CEST Three years ago, Juan Manuel Corchado boasted of being the fourth best scientist in Spain and one of the 250 best on the planet in the field of computing, but he achieved this brilliant rise in the rankings by cheating on an industrial scale. The academic official, who has just been appointed rector of the University of Salamanca (the equivalent of university president in the U.S.), became one of the most cited scientists in the world because, among other fraudulent practices, he organized what is known as a citation cartel: a group of scientists colluding to cite one another in their papers. EL PAÍS has had access to internal messages from Corchado’s group that reveal their bad practices. Their tricks are so crude that anyone who takes a look can easily spot them. In science, references included at the end of papers work like currency. The more other scientists cite you in their work, the greater your prestige, which leads to promotions, salary increases and even million-dollar projects. Corchado is quoted a lot, but only by a few close collaborators. On January 9, 2019, the mathematician Roberto Casado Vara signed a paper on computer security in electrical distribution networks, and 94% of the references (29 out of 31) were citations of Corchado’s work, even if it had nothing to do with the paper’s subject matter: the references included studies on the risk of bladder cancer, CO₂ in the ocean, oil spills, and red tides of microalgae. For years, Corchado has been instructing his workers to include in each publication references to himself or to the journal that he edits: Advances in Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence Journal (ADCAIJ). In this way he falsified his own scientific impact and that of his journal in the rankings. On June 7, 2017, one of Corchado’s assistants wrote this message to her subordinates: “Collect everything you have (master’s thesis, final projects, dissertations, etc.) and include in them 20 references from among those that I have attached in the Word document as well as 10 articles from ADCAIJ.” The attached file included almost 50 Corchado publications. The aide later insisted: “As I know that we are all working hard now, to make it easier, I am attaching the references to just copy and paste.” Similar messages were constant. On July 26, 2017, a different aide wrote to the group: “Hello everyone. Please, Juan Manuel tells me that we should reference these articles of his in the next papers that we send to magazines or conferences. I’ve attached the list here, don’t forget to add some.” Next, she attached a list of Corchado’s works, headed by one about oil spills. On January 9, 2019, Roberto Casado Vara published three papers in which between 97% and 100% of his references cited Corchado or ADCAIJ. Corchado, born in Salamanca 53 years ago, is one of the most cited scientists in the world according to Stanford University’s annual list. The most surprising thing is that Casado Vara, who is much younger, also entered that prestigious classification in 2022, just three years after defending his doctoral dissertation with Corchado as his research supervisor. This newspaper has asked both about these practices, without receiving a response. The messages were often multitudinous. On February 1, 2018, the instructions from one of the assistants was: “Corchado has asked me to tell you to cite articles from ADCAIJ when you write your articles, whatever they are (conferences, master’s final projects, magazine articles, etc.). On March 12, 2018, one of the professor’s closest collaborators sent an email message to 40 people with instructions to manipulate publications from recent conferences organized by themselves: “We will tell you this week what acknowledgments, references and final authors you have to upload in the Camera_ready [print-ready] versions.” Corchado was in copy in all these messages. Dozens of the recipients, many of whom felt coerced, ended up leaving the group. The mathematician Roberto Casado Vara authored a publication on computer security in electrical distribution networks, in which 94% of the references (29 out of 31) are citations to works by Corchado, including some on cancer and ocean CO₂. The professor used the conference records published by the Springer publishing house as a way to include strings of self-quotes. Informed by this newspaper, Springer Nature’s Research Integrity Director, Chris Graf, stated that they are going to “very carefully” examine the case of the Salamanca professor. “If appropriate, we will take editorial action once this investigation has concluded,” Graf said. Another publisher, Elsevier, has already retracted a study published by Corchado and three collaborators in 2019 for plagiarizing a master’s thesis. The researcher cheated in different ways to rig various rankings. He published documents full of self-citations in the scientific repository of the University of Salamanca, so that they would be indexed by the Google Scholar search engine, which in turn feeds rankings such as Guide2Research, in which Corchado was close to the top position at the national level. “Occupying fourth place in Spain and 247th worldwide fills me with pride, as it represents the good work we are doing as a group,” he posted on May 25, 2021 on his social media accounts. Corchado once published a single paragraph with 227 self-quotes and another 139 references to his magazine ADCAIJ. After EL PAÍS began publishing news stories about his practices in March, the Spanish Research Ethics Committee opened an investigation into Corchado, as announced on Friday, May 17, by the Ministry of Science. That same day, Corchado used the official channel of the University of Salamanca to issue an unsigned statement, at 10:22 p.m., in which he defended his “honorability and scientific integrity” and encouraged people to assess the impact of his publications in two of the databases most widely used by the scientific community: Scopus, from the Dutch publisher Elsevier, and Web of Science, from the London multinational Clarivate. An analysis of who cites Corchado in Scopus reveals that in only 75 publications, his collaborators mentioned the Salamanca professor almost 1,700 times and referenced his magazine ADCAIJ 520 times. One of these papers is signed by Pedro Tomás Nevado-Batalla, who teaches law at the University of Salamanca and is a former regional government official of the Spanish region of Extremadura, where he served under a Popular Party (PP) administration. In his study, which dealt with the need to modernize public administration, there were 42 citations to Corchado’s work and seven to ADCAIJ, including studies on bladder cancer, oil spills and microalgae tides. Fully 92% of the citations in that paper are to Corchado’s work or else to his magazine. Nevado-Batalla has stated that he was unaware that these references had been added to his work, and said that he is going to request clarification. “There must necessarily be some explanation for something so extravagant as this,” he said. Juan Manuel Corchado, wearing glasses, standing next to Salamanca Mayor Carlos García Carbayo (right), at a public event in that city on May 23. RAQUEL J. SANTOS / USAL The mathematician Domingo Docampo, former rector of the University of Vigo and an expert in citation cartels, expresses indignation. “It is petty and despicable. “They are insubstantial publications, without any real content, that constitute vehicles for citations in a network that clearly shows the pyramidal nature of a citation farm headed by someone who has influence over those who sign the papers,” he laments. “Corchado should never have run for a position of this category, to represent an institution as prestigious as the University of Salamanca,” he says about an institution that was founded in 1218. The solemn inauguration ceremony of the new rector took place on Friday at the university auditorium. Corchado won the elections on May 7, after taking advantage of the strange surprise resignation of the previous rector, and presenting himself as the only candidate. He received the support of 6.5% of the 33,000 university members who were called to vote, with half of the faculty voting blank as a sign of protest. In 2018, the professor created the AIR Institute, a private entity that manages projects worth millions of euros awarded by the regional government of Castilla y León. Docampo urges the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, academic authorities and individuals responsible for scientific journals to take action. “We have a serious problem. We must protect the careers of the youngest students, who can be contaminated. This is happening worldwide,” he warns. The epidemiologist Alberto Ruano, an expert in scientific misconduct, is adamant: “This is a textbook case of a citation cartel.” Ruano, a professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela, also urges Corchado to resign. “It is likely that he will have to resign, because he is damaging the institution he represents, a damage that affects the credibility of the University of Salamanca and is also affecting all Spanish university professors,” says the epidemiologist, who urges the Ministry and the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) to take measures to avoid cases like this one. This is a textbook case of a citation cartel Alberto Ruano, professor at University of Santiago de Compostela In addition to adding thousands of self-citations to his own publications and requiring his workers to also cite him, Corchado has benefited from a multitude of false online accounts of non-existent scientists, such as Devika Rout and Marcus Ress, dedicated to compulsively mentioning Corchado’s studies in the ResearchGate repository. Since March, Corchado has carried out a massive deletion of these fraudulent profiles, and he has also deleted the publications with obvious tricks that he had uploaded to the Gredos scientific repository of the University of Salamanca. Since April 23, Corchado has denied multiple requests from EL PAÍS to explain his practices, but on March 13 he did grant an interview to this newspaper. In that telephone conversation, the professor from Salamanca stated that there were “20 or 30” false online accounts dedicated to citing him and, in just two minutes, he offered two contradictory explanations: that they had been created by former disgruntled workers to harm him, and that “a young man” had created them to demonstrate that ResearchGate could be rigged. Next, Corchado assured that he had deleted those profiles thanks to his knowledge in cybersecurity. A ResearchGate spokesperson, however, explained that they are not aware of any computer attack and that only the creator of a profile can delete it with their password. One of the international leaders in scientific evaluation methods, Ismael Ràfols, points to the system. “This corruption occurs because there is an evaluation system that values publishing a lot and being cited often. In Europe we have started a reform process and Spain still has a lot of work ahead of it,” says Ràfols, from the University of Leiden (Netherlands). The watchdog agency of the Spanish university system is the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA), directed for a year now by a new director, Pilar Paneque, who is promoting changes to stop measuring researchers based on production volume. “ANECA is going in the right direction, but it faces resistance from traditional professors who have reached the top, like this man. The Corchado case is like a parody, and it shows that it is necessary to reform the evaluation system that generates the corruption,” says Ràfols. Pilar Paneque herself believes that her reforms will discourage bad practices and reduce pressure on researchers, especially the younger ones. “We have a lot of progress to make towards scientific integrity and ethics in research, and everything has to start with the commitment and control of each institution. Every university knows perfectly well what each of its researchers produces and can easily detect any type of anomalous behavior,” says Paneque. In the case of Corchado, Friday was his coronation as rector of the University of Salamanca.

There are a million solutions. The problem is someone having or finding the power to implement them. I think sometimes that people like algorithmic answers to problems because it is sort of replacement for actual power. If you can't imagine finding the power fix something that's bad yourself, at least you can contrive a logical structure that might fix it automatically. A lot of technologists would, I think, have a much larger impact if they concerned themselves with finding political power instead. reply aleph_minus_one 2 hours agorootparent> A lot of technologists would, I think, have a much larger impact if they concerned themselves with finding political power instead. The problem is rather that many great programmers are \"insanely bad politicians\". Programming is about working hard against all the resistance to do \"the right thing\", wheras politics is about \"reading the room\", not antagonizing important people, making phoney compromises, corrupting yourself, ... So such programmers will hardly ever get the political power to change anything. reply AlbertCory 2 hours agorootparentprevRelevant to that : every month or so HN'ers rant about \"patents and how we need to fix them.\" Ranting is all that ever happens. They're uninterested in what it would take to actually do that. reply ajkjk 1 hour agorootparentWell they are interested in it. But they are not part of that system and don't know much about it, and even if they were how can anybody change it? That's pretty much a universal experience in the modern world: feeling disenfranchised because everything is way too complicated and overwhelming the engage constructively with. I would like to see the mindset around here's shift from 'hacking' solutions to what problems can be hacked, to actually trying to 'solve' problems by doing the long work to figure out how to do it. It's much harder, but that's why it would be good for lots of people to be working on them. Enacting large change involves things like journalism, activism, starting social movements, starting political clubs and parties...things that we think of anachronistic now. Certainly they're not normal. But... Probably they need to come back. reply ambicapter 1 hour agorootparentprevI mean, even with political power, you would still need to find an organization structure that doesn't long-term trend towards this sort of behavior. Solving that probably requires similar type of thinking to algorithmically solving problems, it's just a different system. Of course you couldn't implement it without political power, but it is required nonetheless. reply MrBuddyCasino 3 hours agoparentprevnext [6 more] [flagged] leereeves 3 hours agorootparentThe world is far more complex today, and many more professions require an advanced education.

Because of the glut of degrees, many jobs now use a college degree as a filtering mechanism. This is not at all indicative that a degree is needed to be successful at the job. Likewise some professions do the same. A doctor does not need a college degree; they need a medical school degree; medical schools force them to get both. Same for law school (side note: it is possible to practice law in a few US states without a law degree but you must effectively apprentice for a period of time). For most of human history the primary way people learned job skills was apprenticeships; I think we would be wise to return to this model. reply MrBuddyCasino 1 hour agorootparentCollege decrees are used as a filtering mechanism because that is one of the last remaining methods that have not been made illegal by Civil Rights Law. https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-the-origins-of-... reply cmrdporcupine 2 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, and just in population terms the scale isn't even comparable anymore. Consider the 1920s, 1930s etc when academia produced famous luminaries like e.g. Bertrand Russell or Tolkien or Wittgenstein or Gödel or Whitehead or Heidegger or etc. etc. etc. The population of the world was 1/4 of what it is now -- but even more so the world of academia was closed to probably 99% of that world population ... if you lived outside Europe or North America ... forget it. If you were a woman? Nope. Not from a northern European ethnic background? Not upper class? Also forget it. So in reality the pool of possible candidates was very small who could rise up through this \"meritocracy.\" It was a very defined small fish tank. Easy to look into the tank and see the biggest fishes. reply MrBuddyCasino 37 minutes agorootparentNote how you have no trouble enumerating famous academics from pre-1960s. Shouldn’t we have much more such famous people, if your theory is true that institutional obstacles kept a lot of geniuses out? What are the „luminaries like e.g. Bertrand Russell or Tolkien or Wittgenstein or Gödel or Whitehead or Heidegger“ of today? There should be many more! The progress of science should speed up, the number of groundbreaking papers should grow. Yet the opposite is true [0]. Could it instead be that progress in science is driven by a few geniuses, and 95% of academia nowadays is just a mechanism of turning grants into (often fraudulent) papers [1], suffocating the institution of university as a byproduct?

E.g., there is no clear line between an implicit citation cartel and a group of thought-leaders in a small community. And once you are a thought-leader in a small community, it's much easier to gain broader visibility, to obtain funding, and to influence behind-the-scenes decision making. In a way, Corchado is relatively harmless because everybody knows he is a clown. He does not have much to say in the European AI community. The real issues are in the grey areas (and the people thriving in them) that affect and taint everyone. reply progbits 4 hours agoprevCan someone please explain how this is tolerated?

Unless there is an explicit suspicion, nobody is going to systematically check all your citations and papers. There are simply too many of these things to do that systematically, for every researcher, grad student or professor. The universities don't have resources for something like that - that would mean hiring multiple people doing just work like that full time. And it still wouldn't uncover the slightly more sophisticated cases, such as the professor getting a \"mandatory citation\" on every paper produced by the students working in their lab. How do you think can a professor publish 20-30 journal papers a year (that's both a very common number and still quite low) when getting a single paper written and shepherded through the review process takes months in the best case and could take even 2 years in the worst for the large journals? Yes, all the work is done by the grad students and assistant profs - and the professor's name gets added to the list of authors as a sign of respect (in the best case) or because they were told to do that (in the worst one). This is an extremely common practice. I have personally witnessed one guy build essentially an entire fake academic career like this, by pushing grad students to credit him for work he didn't do - and he almost got away with it. He didn't obtain a tenured position at a prestigious European university only because one of the professors in the tenure committee worked with him before and knew how did he obtain those (on paper) stellar research credentials - and vetoed it. Moreover, most of the metrics like impact factor are just a number. You can't see what they have been calculated from. Research has always been built on individual integrity and honesty. And there will always be bad apples that abuse it. The motivations and what is on stake (your career, job, grants, etc.) are so skewed that a lot of people feel pushed into cheating like this. reply leereeves 3 hours agorootparent> all the work is done by the grad students and assistant profs - and the professor's name gets added to the list of authors as a sign of respect (in the best case) or because they were told to do that (in the worst one). This is an extremely common practice. Just recently, Yann LeCun bragged on Twitter about publishing over 80 papers in two years. I wondered who he thought he was impressing.

If you are maybe two or three research groups in the works that use a particular method to try to solve a particular problem, of course you are all going to cite each other excessively. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're going to get a lot of false positives with such a simplistic approach. Sometimes the same group of researchers legitimately cites each other over and over because they're working on similar topics and collaborating. AI can help to reduce the false positives by looking at content to identify citations that might be out of place.

Citation count is therefore already not a major factor in whether a grant is awarded or not, at least in engineering. Citation counts are considered by promotion committees though. In this case, committee members are often from different fields and have less ability to judge the quality of the applicants' work for themselves. None of the above matters in this particular case though—the problem is that Corchado was the only candidate on the ballot: \"… taking advantage of the strange surprise resignation of the previous rector, and presenting himself as the only candidate. He received the support of 6.5% of the 33,000 university members who were called to vote, with half of the faculty voting blank as a sign of protest. \" reply Maken 3 hours agorootparentprevThe ones in charge are usually more concerned about shielding themselves from fraud accusations than actually preventing fraud.

There is also no \"technically within the rules\", because there are generally no specific rules. Research rules essentially are \"Don't do anything unethical\", in a research ethics course you would then be given examples, like don't falsify data, dont misrepresented data, acknowledge previous work... And while I believe the vast majority of academics follow the principles, because the rules are unspecified there is a gray zone (I believe that is a good thing we don't need to bog down scientific research by even more administration). reply CoastalCoder 2 hours agorootparent> Not true, citation cartels are unethical research practices, there is no question about it. Perhaps this is obvious to others, but could you articulate the ethical principle that this violates? reply cycomanic 2 hours agorootparentWell I was trying to say that there are not clear cut don't do this or that, but instead act ethically. I would say citation stacking broadly falls under misrepresenting your research (as well as other research).

Ran unopposed, elected on 6.5% of the vote. reply ambicapter 1 hour agorootparent> voting blank as a sign of protest. This move will never cease to annoy the fuck out of me. Unless the election is somehow invalidated or recalled by the number of blank votes, it is completely counter-productive. reply lambdaxyzw 22 minutes agorootparentWould it be better if he got 100% of votes for him?

Shouldn't other staff members be jumping at the chance?? There should be lots of candidates, no? reply PeterisP 18 minutes agorootparentNah, that's often how it works - sure, becoming a rector would mean a pay increase, but it would require you to become an administrator and stop doing what you love, most likely permanently (as the gap of being away from your field of research for multiple years makes it hard to become productive again - returning to active science is definitely possible, but rarely happens), switching your career for an entirely different one as far as day-to-day tasks go. And if you're already somewhat comfortable as a professor, why would you do that to yourself? I've literally seen faculty 'drawing straws' as of who'll agree to be the sole candidate for a particular elected administrative position, because it's clear that one of them has to do it for the university to function, but no one wanted to. reply Der_Einzige 2 hours agorootparentprevWait until you see how many districts for even important positions like state representative have candidates who run unopposed.

As I’ve gotten older, and had more of an opportunity to interact with these players, and read articles such as these, I now have the perspective that a lot of these folks are monsters and are some of the craziest, narcissistic, abusive people on the face of the earth. They run fiefdoms and hold power over money and prestige and those under them and because they are brilliant people, they have the ability to damage so many more people around them as they do their work. reply neilv 1 hour agoparentIf it helps to hear it, there definitely are amazing figures, including ones that not only do brilliant work, but are exceptionally great as fellow humans (especially humble, thoughtful, altruistic, etc.). I don't have a complete perspective, but have heard from people at many universities. (Including from someone who'd made their way up one university, and remarked they weren't impressed by recent faculty hires there, \"but I'd take a bullet for\" a particular all-around great professor there.) I think most academics are closer to the normal distributions of just people. Better educated (at least in a niche, and possibly generally) than your average person, and maybe smarter than average in some regards, but probably not a superhuman intelligence, and AFAICT not any more likely to be saintly than any other human. There's also a lot of hustle required of many professors, so they have less time, energy, and power, for the benevolent and wise elder citizen of the university model society role, which I once imagined professors would tend to embrace. There are also some more unfortunate dynamics going on, some places, and with some individuals especially. And there are facets of some universities that behave like maybe the most internally toxic corporation you can imagine -- except arguably worse, because the institution or individuals tend to be held less to account. reply TrackerFF 2 hours agoparentprevIt kind of depends on how prestigious and competitive the field is. There are plenty of fields that are \"boring\" and \"unattractive\", where work and community is very chill and by-the-numbers. On the other hand you have very hot and competitive fields, that will attract a certain kind of people. And plenty of toxic / abrasive scientists get to reign free, if it just happens that they're producing the desired results. reply Bluestein 3 hours agoparentprev> are monsters and are some of the craziest, narcissistic, abusive people on the face of the earth With what might be, I am sure, obvious exceptions, I have reached the personal conclusion that academia, universities, colleges, are cespits of the absolute worst, most treachearous, most cunning worst that human nature has to offer. Far from being a meritocracy, scum \"floats\" to the top in these environments.- I am really curious how this fact ties into the - recently discussed here - lack of value that people more and more perceive in college degrees.- reply jfengel 3 hours agorootparentI've found that to be true of practically every human endeavor. The ones who achieve the most prominent positions are the ones who work the system to their advantage. It's not merely that cheaters win. It's that they are selected for it: people want them to cheat on their behalf. And they may not even be wrong about that. reply ProjectArcturis 3 hours agorootparentprevI've spent 15 years in academia and 10 in industry. Academia isn't worse on a per capita basis. Leaders' flaws are rawer, mainly because hardly anyone gets leadership training. And they often have more severe consequences, especially for grad students who are put in a subordinate, dependent position for an extended period of time. But IME you're at least equally likely to find psychopaths at the top of businesses. reply tristor 3 hours agorootparentYou’re right. Plenty of research has shown C-suite execs tend to have psychopathic tendencies. The thing about academia, though, is that there is no escape. Not only is this behavior everywhere in the academy, economics dictates with very few exceptions you are stuck in the system and have to become part of it just to subsist and participate in research. Meanwhile in the business world it’s relatively a simple matter to quit and work elsewhere when you end up with a psycho boss, and if you’re clever it is relatively simple to be compensated in a way that makes it possible to split away and start your own business or otherwise attain a significant level of control over your own livelihood and career goals. As the saying goes, “the only way to win is not to play” when it comes to academia. Unfortunately that just further concentrates the worst characteristics. As someone who escaped academia it isn’t lost on me that academics almost universally love communism, a system that rigidly enforces equality such that it’s impossible to excel and break away from the system. One of the wonderful things about business is you can earn enough to eventually step away. reply matthewdgreen 3 hours agorootparentAcademia is much less centralized. My lab is basically unconstrained as long as I bring in enough funding, and although I have a department chair he has limited power to make me do things. Similarly I have almost no power over my fellow faculty members, aside from bugging them to do things. A bad PI can make their students’ and post-docs’ lives miserable, and can irritate their colleagues. But they have nothing near the power that a C-suite executive (or hell a VP) in a corporation does, simply because they don’t have the same number of people under them. And no, you don’t see maniacal behavior everywhere. You hear a lot about the 5% who behave terribly because they draw a lot of complaints and make up approximately 100% of the reports you see on sites like RetractionWatch. reply BirAdam 2 hours agorootparentprevAny time there is power to be had, the worst people are the most incentivized to seize it. It is the nature of power and of humans. reply FpUser 3 hours agorootparentprevI used to be a scientist back in USSR.

Modern corporations however from my experience are quite fitting. reply cmrdporcupine 3 hours agorootparentprevI suspect you'll find at the top of all self-styled \"meritocracies\" are people who have socially engineered the definition of \"merit\" to be them and their empire. And this is the profound problem with all \"meritocratic\" structures. They might start out on a small scale selecting for some genuine skill, but measuring humans can be easily gamed. A game which narcissists win and reinforces their narcissism by telling them what they want to hear about themselves. reply cbg0 3 hours agoprevThese guys were stupid enough to put it in writing, but this happens in lots of places where you either get quid pro quo citations or just get put on an article as an author even though you contributed nothing.

They seem frivolous and arbitrary, and most of the genuine ones are discovered by search, so maybe we could publish without citations, and let the search be automated. The more useful element of a paper is the unique claims that it makes, and these probably should be denoted explicitly. reply alpinisme 2 hours agoparentOne large motivation for looking at citations is as a proxy for the importance or value of your claims. More productive research claims will beget more productive research, whereas trivial or dead end or uninteresting claims will just float off into the archival void. So if you want to exclude citations you need another way to measure importance quickly and impersonally across entire fields in more or less real time. reply moltar 3 hours agoprevSEO backlinks IRL reply rc_kas 20 minutes agoparentThe problem with building any system is that someone will always abuse it eventually. reply YWall39 4 hours agoprevAsked a Spanish professor of computer science, and he said the system is so corrupt that nobody cares.

That's not the case for the people who are in the key phase of establishing themselves as academics and who are generally not on permanent contracts. And for tenured staff, performance decides access to resources that may be as mundane as one's own research time. Conversely, the problem is a mix of extremely shallow performance metrics and a paper-pusher system in which most people get bogged down by bureaucracy by the time they get tenure (or even earlier). This means that very few people have the peace of mind that allows them to focus on high-risk fundamental research. In European AI and CS, I would claim that the ones who manage to maintain focus essentially do this in their free time and get little reward for this; the alternative, i.e., building a strong franchise, is more rewarding in terms of performance metrics. reply cess11 3 hours agoprevHere's a short article with some more links about this person: https://forbetterscience.com/2024/05/03/schneider-shorts-3-0...

    "title": "LLMs Evolve Beyond Internet Training with Custom and Specialized Data",
    "originLink": "https://allenpike.com/2024/llms-trained-on-internet",
    "originBody": "Allen Pike Articles About Follow LLMs Aren’t Just “Trained On the Internet” Anymore A path to continued model improvement. May 31, 2024 • 5 min read I often see a misconception when people try to reason about the capability of LLMs, and in particular how much future improvement to expect. It’s frequently said that that LLMs are “trained on the internet,” and so they’ll always be bad at producing content that is rare on the web. A recent example from Hacker News: LLMs are mostly trained on Internet posts, so they are Internet simulators. Wikipedia also frames LLM training this way: LLMs are trained on increasingly large corpora of text largely scraped from the web. Even former Apple SVP of Engineering – and famously sharp computer scientist – Bertrand Serlet explains them thus, in his recent video Why AI Works: [An LLM has] been trained on the entire internet, so it has packed all this knowledge that’s in the internet, but also all the reasoning patterns that can be found [there.] Admittedly, this used to be true! And is still mostly true. But it’s increasingly becoming less true. Because it’s becoming less true, the idea of an “internet simulator” is not a useful way to predict how GPT-5 and beyond will work. New models are already exceeding this definition, and the shift is only beginning. The Data Wall Way back in 2020, OpenAI’s GPT-3 paper described their training dataset in some detail. GPT-3 was, basically, trained on the internet. An artifact from a bygone era, when frontier AI was open. By 2022, LLMs were being trained to follow instructions using custom human feedback. Since then, frontier model labs like OpenAI have gotten very cagey about what they’re adding to their training datasets. We don’t know what GPT-4o was trained on, let alone Sora or GPT-5. But we do know it’s not just the internet. Recently, LLM trainers have hit a “data wall”. More data generally improves model training, but OpenAI already has roughly all the data on the web – even inconvenient-to-access data like Youtube video transcriptions. So other than training ever-larger models on the same internet data, how can they make better LLMs? The answer, for labs with money, is acquiring and creating non-public data. At first, their focus was making existing training data more useful, or adding existing non-public data to the training pool. For example: Annotation and filtering: Researchers have been creating annotations for their training data for years. Good annotations let them focus LLM training on the highest value data, which allows for better (or smaller) models. RLHF: Labs also have humans rate model outputs. They use this data to fine-tune the models, and encourage useful behaviours like instruction-following and refusing to say naughty things. Usage data: ChatGPT is said to generate on the order of 10 billion tokens of data per day – even before they opened their more compelling GPT-4o model to free users. Data acquisition: While a lot of humanity’s data is on the internet, much of it is not. Emails, chat logs, proprietary manuals and procedures, JIRA tickets, phone recordings, internal reports, and contracts are all useful data. While examples exist on the internet, model trainers can cut deals to add more of these to their training data. So that’s all helpful. But none of these techniques are a complete solution to a famous weakness of current models: the “LLMs suck at producing outputs that don’t look like existing data” problem. Here are some of the many things that LLMs are bad at doing, in part because there isn’t a lot of text online that demonstrates them: Expressing doubt or uncertainty in one’s answer Having long conversations without repeating phrasings or looping Making high-level plans for LLM agents to pursue Reasoning like a Principal Engineer about a massive legacy codebase Reliably following extremely long or complex prompts While improved architectures and more parameters might help with these limitations, you can bet your butt that OpenAI, Meta, Google, and/or Microsoft are paying big money to fill some of these gaps in a simpler way: creating novel examples to train on. LLMs are now being trained on custom data A recent example of the rise of custom data is Microsoft’s Phi-3 Technical Report, published in April. phi-3-mini is only 3.8 billion parameters – a waif in LLM terms – but claims performance competitive with the impressive but much-heavier Mixtral model. The paper credits some of this improvement to including high-quality synthetic data, generated by larger LLMs, in the training data. Synthetic data allows them to fill gaps in the internet-sourced data, and improves model performance for a given size. Now, synthetic data is a hot topic in LLM research. It’s not yet clear how far you can go with training LLMs on their own output before things go horribly wrong, like a giant neural snake eating its own tail. At the minimum, though, synthetic data will help fill the kind of gaps that arise simply from LLMs behaving like “internet simulators.” For example, if your model is hallucinating because you don’t have enough training examples of people expressing uncertainty, or biased because it has unrepresentative data, then generate some better examples! Still, creating great synthetic data with LLMs is a challenging problem, and will have its limits. That’s why there’s one last huge source of non-internet data inbound: Humans. How much data can you create for $1B/yr? It turns out that if you pay people money, they’re willing to make data for you. Scale.ai, which bills itself as “the data foundry for AI,” operates a service where labs pay humans to do just this. Reportedly, AI companies are paying more than $1B a year for Scale’s services already. While some of this is for annotation and ratings on data that came from the web or LLMs, they also create new training data whole-hog: The company has shifted its focus to more highly-specialized workers such as Ph.D-level academics, lawyers, accountants, poets, authors, and those fluent in specific languages. These workers, who help train and test models for companies from OpenAI and Cohere to Anthropic and Google, also work through a third-party, often another Scale subsidiary called Outlier, but are paid higher hourly wages. Not only can companies like OpenAI pay to have professionals create new, good data that fills holes in the internet-sourced data, they then keep that data to train subsequent models. A dataset like “50,000 examples of Ph.Ds expressing thoughtful uncertainty when asked questions they don’t know the answer to” could be worth a lot more than it costs to produce. So yes, LLMs were originally trained on the internet. Yes, we can understand a lot of their early weaknesses as stemming from the foibles of whatever crap people post on the web. However. As the size and impact of custom training data increases, we should expect LLMs to markedly exceed “internet simulation”. In particular, they’ll continue to get better at things that aren’t on the internet, but can be demonstrated in $1B+ of custom data creation. That is to say: this train will keep rollin’ for a while yet. Latest in the series Large Language Models. Liked this? Follow along to see what's next.

    "commentBody": "LLMs aren't \"trained on the internet\" anymore (allenpike.com)175 points by ingve 22 hours agohidepastfavorite106 comments benreesman 21 hours agoI think this post makes a few good points, certainly the parabolic trajectory Scale seems to be on is at least suggestive if not conclusive that there’s a lot more going on now than just big text crawls. And Phi-3 is something else, even from relatively limited time playing with it, so that’s useful signal for anyone who hadn’t looked at it yet. Wildly cool stuff. It seems weird to not mention Anthropic or Mistral or FAIR pretty much at all: they’re all pretty clearly on more modern architectures at least as concerns capability per weight and Instruct-style stuff. I’m part of a now nontrivial group who regards Opus as basically shattering GPT-4-{0125, 1106}-Preview (which is basically the same as 4o for pure language modalities) on basically everything I care about, and LLaMA3 is just about there as well, maybe not quite Opus, comparable if you ignore trivially gamed metrics like MMLU. And I have no idea why we’re talking about GPT-5 when there’s little if any verifiable evidence it even exists as a training run tracking to completion. Maybe it is, maybe not, but let’s get a look at it rather than just assume that it’s going to lap the labs that are currently pushing the pace now? reply ein0p 20 hours agoparentHave you actually tried using Opus side by side with GPT4 on “work” related stuff? GPT4 is way better in my experience, to the point where I cancelled my Opus subscription after just a couple of months. reply benreesman 20 hours agorootparentI make an effort to use both and several high-capability open tunes every day (it’s not literally every day but I have keyboard shortcuts for all of them). Opus historically had issues with minor typographical errors, though recently that seems to not happen often, lots of very sharp people at Anthropic. So a month ago if I wanted something from Opus I’d run it through a cleanup pass courtesy of one of the other ones, but even my old standby dolphin-8x7 can clean up typos. 1106 can as well, but all else equal I don’t want to be sending my stuff to any black box data warehouse and I’m always surprised so many other sophisticated people don’t share the preference. My personal eyeball capability check is to posit a gauge symmetry and ask what it thinks the implied conserved quantity is, and I’ve yet to see Opus not crush that relative to anything else, including real footnotes. On coding I usually hand it a Prisma schema and ask for a proto3/gRPC definition that is a good way to interact with it, Opus in my personal experience also dominates there. If you have an example of a task that represents a counter example I’d be grateful for another little integration test for my personal ad-hoc model card. I want to know the best tool for every job. reply refulgentis 14 hours agorootparentOpus hasn't changed. I really don't like how condescending your root comment is, I don't have any idea how all these extra things you're disappointed in are relevant at all to the actual topic. reply virgildotcodes 19 hours agorootparentprevI feel like Opus is much better at creative writing in terms of sounding more natural and less formulaic, but GPT4 does beat it on just about everything else. reply benreesman 19 hours agorootparentI replied to a sibling with a few of my ad-hoc tasks. I’d likewise be grateful if you’d lend me an example or two that should be on my little ad-hoc task set. reply CSMastermind 19 hours agorootparentWhich direction are you looking for? Ones where GPT-4o does better or ones where Opus does better? Assuming the former, here's an example I had yesterday where Opus was never able to formulate a correct response even with multiple follow-ups but GPT-4o got it with only two follow ups: > I have a postgres database with a table called projects. On that table is a column called designs that is of json type and is nullable as well as a column called id that is of type text. The data in the designs column will be an array of objects (assuming it's not null). Each object in the array will have a field called price that will be a string. Most of these prices will be in the format $#,### where # is a number. However some will be in the format # ### US$. This second format where the numbers are separated by spaces instead of commas and the dollar sign appears at the end of the string instead of the beginning with an extraneous US is incorrect. What SQL can I run to migrate all prices that are incorrectly formatted to the correct format? Alternatively, this is a non-tech related one that GPT-4 gets correct that no other model does: > In 388 BC, the boxer Eupolus of Thessaly defeated three opponents at the ancient Olympics. Funded by the men involved, several bronze statues of Zeus were erected, with inscriptions detailing the events. Why did the four men prefer not to have the statues around? I like that one because Opus will tell you that you're wrong and mistaken, which is pretty funny while GPT-4 answer correctly with the actual context. reply ppsreejith 17 hours agorootparentVery interesting prompt regarding the boxer Eupolus of Thessaly. Gemini Advanced gets this wrong as well as Llama 3 70b (as run on groq.com). However, if I start with: \"What is the earliest record of cheating in the olympic games?\" Then all models get the question right. It's surprising that GPT-4 gets it right on the first go. reply refulgentis 14 hours agorootparentprevGetting a larger sample won't make your opinion objective reply Zambyte 19 hours agorootparentprevThat's really interesting to me. I've been using both through my Kagi subscription, but I always find myself favoring the quality of Opus. I generally use GPT 4o if I don't want to wait for a slow response from Opus, and I use Opus when I want the highest quality. reply benreesman 19 hours agorootparentIt’s likewise my experience that on e.g. TTFT is higher on Anthropic’s API. But it’s not by a ton, and it could be just less hyper-scale network infrastructure. I don’t recall what Anthropic has raised but IIRC it wasn’t “peer with everyone” levels. reply seanhunter 3 hours agorootparentI think they've raised just over $5B, consisting of $1B from everyone other than amazon (750m at [1] and 450m at [2]) and then $4B from amazon[3].

But this is not the reality of modern LLMs by a long shot, they are trained in increasingly large parts from custom built datasets that are created by countless paid individuals, hidden behind stringent NDAs. The author here seems to see that as a strength, an opportunity for unbounded growth and potential, I think this is the opposite, this approach is close to a gigantic whack a mole game, effectively unbounded, but in the wrong way. reply preommr 18 hours agoparent> countless paid individuals, hidden behind stringent NDAs. If this is so prevalent, wouldn't there be a proportional amount of data leaks? If there any particular evidence, even of doubtful authenticity, of this being the case? reply solidasparagus 18 hours agorootparentWhat sort of leak? I've seen data labeler/generation teams hired. I've never heard anyone describe the existence of these teams as a secret. No one hides the existence of Scale AI. People talk about which providers are better for different scenarios and when you need to inhouse and which companies are good at helping you build an inhouse team. Are you talking about leaks of the actual training data? The secret sauce of modern LLMs? That is like leaking the google3 source code or the recipe for Coca Cola - a ludicrously risky move. And for what gain? reply navigate8310 16 hours agorootparentCan you give an example of these datasets and how they look like? Do they ask PhD to explain root of negative 1 and why is it complex? Is it like Quora but private only and high quality answers by top researchers in their respective field? reply solidasparagus 14 hours agorootparentHmm, I don't want to talk specifics about my experience, but maybe check out some of the case studies on Surge's website - https://www.surgehq.ai/ (about halfway down the page). > Do they ask PhD to explain root of negative 1 and why is it complex? This isn't necessarily impossible, but I would consider it to be infeasible with existing labelling workforces. Of course if you really needed a dataset like this and you were sufficiently resourced and willing to spend, you could maybe make it work (I would question whether you really needed PhDs though, that might be hard to swing at any price point). But the core idea behind your question is correct - this is what a dataset might look like and hiring/contracting appropriately-skilled people and asking them to do repetitive tasks with some guidance is how you would go about getting it. Depending on the need, it can be quite a bit more complex too - if you needed self-driving car driving behavior data maybe you build a simulator and hire people to drive in the simulator and use that as training data (made up and probably crap example, but it illustrates the possibilities). Some people think that labelling workforces are all low skill and there is a lot of good things low skill workforces can do well (visual stuff, basic language and emotion tasks), but you might be surprised at the ability to get skilled labelers. There are lots of smart/educated people around the world and there is ridiculous amounts of money flowing into this space. reply Jensson 18 hours agorootparentprevThose individuals just create data, they don't have access to it, think mechanical turk workers. All modern AI is powered by many such workers. LLM is the most funded modern AI, they have massive numbers of such workers for sure. reply apike 19 hours agoparentprevYeah this is an interesting point. Other threads make the point about the \"bitter lesson\", and how expert-trained ML has historically not scaled, and human-generated LLM training data may just be repeating that dead end. Maybe so. Something that is new this time around, AFAIK, is that we haven’t previously had general ML systems that businesses and consumers are paying billions of dollars a year to use. So if, say, 10% of revenue goes back in to making better data sets every year, I can imagine continued improvement on certain economically valuable use cases – though likely with diminishing returns. reply jackblemming 20 hours agoparentprevReminds me of the same issues with self driving. Seems like we need a completely different approach to solve these class of problems. reply surfingdino 20 hours agoprev> For example, if your model is hallucinating because you don’t have enough training examples of people expressing uncertainty, or biased because it has unrepresentative data, then generate some better examples! Or, as the case may be... humans are biased? Also \"generate some better examples\" sounds like fudging data to fit the expected outcome. It smells of clutching at straws hoping to come up with something before the world looses interests and investor money runs out. If you want to see how LLMs fail at coming up with original responses ask your favourite hallucinating bot to come up with fifty different ways of encouraging people to \"Click the Subscribe button\" in a YT video. Not only it will not come up with anything original, but it will simply start repeating itself (well, not itself, it will start repeating phrases found in YT video transcripts). reply apike 19 hours agoparent> Also \"generate some better examples\" sounds like fudging data to fit the expected outcome. LLMs are tools. As a tool author, you have certain desired outcomes for certain use cases. If the current data you’re training on isn’t giving you those outcomes, it is absolutely reasonable to \"fudge\" the data. This might mean reducing bias, or adding bias, or any number of nudges. Training an LLM is not a scientific study, it’s a product development effort. reply surfingdino 12 hours agorootparentAgreed. However, you are then giving your tools to people who have none of that experience and understanding and apply it to the problems they are trying to solve without then taking a pause and checking the results against facts. There is a lot of trust in the outputs and little vigilance. A common reply to such concerns is \"well, you should be able to spot incorrect information in the outputs\" which is tricky if we are talking about education where by definition students are yet to learn correct answers or lower levels of career development, very much similar to education when they are learning on the job. The lack of ability to quote and trace sources of information used to construct output by an LLM is a major red flag for me, sensitive information leakage is another. They way LLMs are sold is irresponsible, they are sold as tools to solve problems, not as a thousand monkeys trying to type up the whole works of Shakespeare, which isv where we are at the moment. reply sdfgtr 20 hours agoprev> While some of this is for annotation and ratings on data that came from the web or LLMs, they also create new training data whole-hog: The article states that this human data is PhDs, poets, and other experts but my recollection from some info about programming LLM training is that there was a small army of low paid Indian programmers feeding it with data.

The bottleneck here is not the lack of data imo. reply zer00eyz 21 hours agoprevYou sir get an F in history and the industry does too. Does no one remember why expert systems fell apart? Because you have to keep paying experts to feed the beast. Because they are bound to the whims and limitations of experts.

MS gets everthin up to AGI... IF you thought you were close, if you thought that you were going to get there with a bigger model and more data then you MIGHT want MS's money. And MS had its own ML folks publish papers with \"hints of AGI\", The google engineer saying \"it's AGI\" before getting laughed at... I suspect that everyone at OpenAI was high on their own supply. That they thought AGI would emerge, or sapience, or sentience if they shoved enough data at it. I think the safety minding folks leaving points to the fact that they found the practical limitations.

Many of the current generation of AI experts mostly either did not pay great attention to the history of AI or they believe this time is completely different. They would do well to spend more time learning about history. However, your view doesn't strike me as correct either. Expert system fell apart because the world was more complex than researchers realized and enumeration was essentially discovered to be infeasible (more or less as you say). But the impossibility of enumerating the world isn't news, everyone knows \"the bitter lesson\". And this isn't the past - now everyone on earth carries around a computer, a video camera and a microphone. They talk to each other through the internet. Remote workers screens' are recorded. Billions of vehicles with absurd numbers of sensors are roaming around the world. More of the arenas that matter to humanity are digital and thus effective domains for automated exploration and data generation.

I'm sure I could read all the information for an astrophysics course in a relatively short time.

But large transformers seem pretty good at learning from datasets (of more or less any modality) to they extent that they can create useful new datapoints and allow you to work with existing datapoints in useful, structured ways. reply Jensson 18 hours agorootparentTransformers main usefulness is translation, including translations from technical lingo to natural languages and vice versa, or code to natural language etc. That was their targeted usecase when originally made and that is what most people use them for. This is what you use them for that doesn't require hallucinating. They don't understand so they can't replace technical experts, they can just translate a bit back and forth but you still need an expert who understands the domain since translations isn't enough for a layperson to replace an expert. The other use case is to make them hallucinate tropey stories and concepts for brainstorming, this isn't nearly as useful though due to it adding so much low quality stuff here when it hallucinates. reply zer00eyz 20 hours agorootparentprev> The information about how the world operates exists or can be generated The hubris of mathematics. At what scale does whether prediction become 100 percent accurate? How large of a model do you need, and how big of a computer to run it?

But think about the intelligence of an average human. Can we beat that? At least along some collection of concrete axes, enough to create a form of intelligence that can rightfully be called general? It remains to be seen, but the days where I scoffed at that idea are firmly in the past where they belong. Today we are building machines with intelligence high enough that it is forcing us to reconsider and redefine what intelligence is. And there is a huge amount of progress just sitting in front of us, waiting to be fed into models. reply sainez 19 hours agorootparentEven AGI as a whole is overhyped. It's a valuable goal, but AI that beats humans on narrow metrics is still economically valuable because of scale. reply ambicapter 19 hours agorootparentprevAre you arguing that weather prediction isn't very good right now? Within a day or two it's very, very good, no? reply YeGoblynQueenne 19 hours agoparentprev>> Does no one remember why expert systems fell apart? There were many reasons. One of them was the \"Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck\", but that was not about the cost of paying experts, rather the cost of creating and maintaining a potentially very large knowledge base (i.e. one big mother of a database of production rules). Also, the fact that many experts' knowledge is tacit and not easily formalisable. Modern machine learning began in the 1980's as an effort to overcome the Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck. Accordingly many early machine learning approaches were designed to learn production rules for expert systems. Decision trees, one of the staple classifiers in data science, come from that era; you can tell, because decision trees are a symbolic, logic-based \"model\". There were other problems with expert systems, e.g. their infamous \"brittleness\". But modern, statistical machine learning systems, are also criticised for \"brittleness\" too. There were also purely political reasons and nothing to do with science or technology considerations. Then there was the 5th Generation Computer Project, and the AI winter, and then there were no more expert systems. The journal of Expert Systems with Applications is still alive and well, on the other hand, although it mostly publishes on machine learning and neural nets these days.

Too tired to look for links now, sorry. reply fnordpiglet 13 hours agoparentprevExperts weren’t the bottleneck on expert systems it was the systems weren’t particularly adaptive, were too rigid, weren’t able to make abductive conclusions, and the user interfaces were way too difficult in situ. LLMs actually tackle quite a lot of these issues FWIW but I wouldn’t look at them as a replacement for expert systems. Instead they’re probably what will make them useful by providing a natural human interface and a way of providing an abductive “reasoning” ability ontop of traditional expert systems. reply sebzim4500 21 hours agoparentprevThey aren't going to show you any papers at all, they like money. reply numpad0 16 hours agoparentprevI've seen some infographics that shows LLMs practically need to see same data 4 times or less, and once is fine too(trained for one epoch).

Our labelers prefer outputs from our 1.3B InstructGPT model over outputs from a 175B GPT-3 model, despite having more than 100x fewer parameters. At the same time, we show that we don’t have to compromise on GPT-3’s capabilities, as measured by our model’s performance on academic NLP evaluations. > One way of thinking about this process is that it “unlocks” capabilities that GPT-3 already had, but were difficult to elicit through prompt engineering alone Note about the mention of a 1.3B InstructGPT: They trained InstructGPT in a few different sizes including 1.3B, 6B and 175B [1] From Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback March 4, 2022 [1] > We start with a pretrained language model, a distribution of prompts on which we want our model to produce aligned outputs, and a team of trained human labelers. We then apply the following three steps: > Step 1: Collect demonstration data, and train a supervised policy. Our labelers provide demonstrations of the desired behavior on the input prompt distribution. We then fine-tune a pretrained GPT-3 model on this data using supervised learning. > Step 2: Collect comparison data, and train a reward model. We collect a dataset of comparisons between model outputs, where labelers indicate which output they prefer for a given input. We then train a reward model to predict the human-preferred output. > Step 3: Optimize a policy against the reward model using PPO. We use the output of the RM as a scalar reward. We fine-tune the supervised policy to optimize this reward using the PPO algorithm > Steps 2 and 3 can be iterated continuously; more comparison data is collected on the current best policy, which is used to train a new RM and then a new policy > The cost of increasing model alignment is modest relative to pretraining. The cost of collecting our data and the compute for training runs, including experimental runs is a fraction of what was spent to train GPT-3: training our 175B SFT model requires 4.9 petaflops/s-days and training our 175B PPO-ptx model requires 60 petaflops/s-days, compared to 3,640 petaflops/s-days for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). At the same time, our results show that RLHF is very effective at making language models more helpful to users, more so than a 100x model size increase. From Introducing ChatGPT November 30, 2022 [2] > We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format. > To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process. > ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. In all likelihood, the usage data collected from ChatGPT is being used to continuously train and update a reward model which is being used to continue fine-tuning and improve performance. As for sources of new data, the article lays those out pretty clearly. I agree with the article that models like Phi3 show that higher quality data is more important than simple volume of data and that paying experts to produce, edit and/or grade data will get you much further ahead than only focusing on increasing token count especially when RLHF can 100x the effectiveness of that data. The main reason for finding more sources of training data would be to increase the breadth of knowledge and fill in larger gaps that can't be tackled by a small number of experts. More internet slop won't do that so the contribution of scraped web data can be expected to steadily decrease.

A \"realistic-sounding, 80% correct version of an expert opinion\" only costs US$20/month–and if you are willing to compromise a bit on correctness and/or privacy, you can even get it for free. No way you are getting a real expert at that price. Whereas, pool $20/month across millions of subscribers, and suddenly you have enough money – and, more importantly, future revenue growth prospects with which to convince investors to give you even more money – to afford roomfuls of real experts to try to get that \"80% correct\" percentage higher. reply relativ575 17 hours agorootparentprevPeople pay for expert opinion all the time.

Who is willing to give up billions of dollars just 'cuz? Even if you can't run a company, one of the big companies will happily pay you for access to that data.

Smith: Steering Council Expenditures Update Emily Morehouse: Councils and Working Groups Update Thomas Wouters: Overview of Python 3.13 Dinner and Ice Cream Monday Until Next Time Intro¶ Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorgan Chase & Co. PyCon US 2024 was truly incredible. If you ever have the chance to attend, I highly recommend it. I am thankful for and proud of my friend Mariatta (PyCon US Chair) who oversaw it. This was my second time attending an in-person PyCon US. My first one was in 2019. I remember being awestruck by the ocean of people. I was glad that I had already attended DjangoCon US and some regional conferences. I recognized some people in the crowd, and it made it feel like a smaller event. This time, I was better prepared. I knew what to expect and leveraged my time better, all while having a ton of fun. 🔝 back to top Wednesday¶ Sightseeing Downtown¶ I arrived on Wednesday, settled in, and immediately took some time to see the David L. Lawrence Convention Center and the downtown. This was my first time in Pittsburgh, and I didn’t know what to expect. Downtown Pittsburgh, with its many steel bridges and brick buildings surrounded by riverfront, was a surprisingly gorgeous scene. David L. Lawrence Convention Center Rooftop Terrace 10th Street Water Feature 🔝 back to top Allegheny Riverfront¶ Standing on a bridge on the Allegheny River with a view of the downtown and one of the many other bridges 🔝 back to top Fig and Ash¶ After a busy day, I was tempted to get some cheap takeaway for supper, but I thought twice, and decided I should enjoy the best this city has to offer. So, I googled “best restaurant in Pittsburgh.” The top result was Fig & Ash, a short walk away. I went there and had an incredible meal. Spaghetti with Maine lobster cream, crab, nantucket bay scallops, arugula A piping hot cast iron Kahlua fudge brownie with coffee ice cream and sea salt for dessert 🔝 back to top Thursday¶ I took the day off to sightsee. As I was walking down the riverfront, I saw a man taking photos. He looked familiar. I was pretty sure we had been following each other on social media for a while. I couldn’t resist approaching him. It was Peter Wang (Anaconda Co-founder). It was really fun to meet him, and I found out that he and my friend Andy Fundinger had been consultants at JPMorgan Chase years ago. 🔝 back to top Noticeable Sightings at the Conference Center¶ I couldn’t resist stopping at the convention center to see what was going on. Once inside, I soon saw Guido van Rossum (Python Creator and BDFL) walking nearby. He sat down next to me, and I had the chance to chat with him about life and work. I thanked him for spending the time, and he thanked me. I’ve had the chance to spend time with him at three conferences now, and it’s always fun. The Python community is lucky to have a BDFL who actively engages with us and cares. I was thrilled to catch up with some of my DjangoCon US friends: Afi Gbagado (DjangoCon US), Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe (Technology Chief of Staff and Open Source Founder), Noah Alorwu (Marygold and Co.), Felipe de Morais (AfroPython), Jeff Triplett (RevSys, DEFNA Board Member), Eric Matthes (Author of Python Crash Course), and Trey Hunner (Python Trainer, Python Morsels). I made a new friend Amanda Viera (AfroPython). Me and Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe As usual, Trey had an interesting gaggle of people around him that included Marie Roald and Yngve Mardal Moe (Turtle Thread) and Rodrigo Girão Serrão (Python Math Teacher). It was good to chat with Mason Eggers (PyTexas Chair), Kevin Horn (Dallas Fortworth Pythoneers Co-founder and PyTexas Organizer), Josh Schneider (PyTexas Organizer), Andy Fundinger (Bloomberg), and Heather Crawford (Bloomberg) again so soon after seeing them at the wonderful PyTexas conference I attended in April. Andy and I first met at PyGotham, another one of my favorite conferences. Inspired by Andy, Mason and I later talked PyTexas sponsorships. Although they were hard at work, I also got to see Deb Nicholson (Python Software Foundation Executive Director) for the first time again since DjangoCon US 2023, Ee Durbin (PSF Director of Infrastructure), Christopher Ngeuebauer (PSF Board Member), and Mariatta. :) 🔝 back to top Andy Warhol Museum¶ On the way to the Andy Warhol Museum, I saw my friend Andy Knight (Automation Panda), and we walked there together. Andy had given a tutorial “def test_crash_course_with_pytest():”. Andy wearing an Andy Warhol-inspired shirt A favorite from the Andy Warhol Museum 🔝 back to top Heinz History Center¶ When I heard that the Heinz History Center has the Mister Rogers set, I had to go. Mr. Rogers Neighborhood set 🔝 back to top Duquesne Incline¶ I had all of my travel plans in place to attend PyCon US 2020 in Pittsburgh and planned to ride the Duquesne Incline, but the in-person conference was canceled due to Covid. I finally had the chance to ride it! View from the station at the bottom View from the Duquesne Incline Observation Deck 🔝 back to top Opening Reception at the Expo Hall¶ I gave my first conference talk at the first conference I ever attended. It was DjangoCon US 2017 in Spokane, Washington. I distinctly remember that Roger Masse (United States Senate) and Mark Lavin (Nvidia) attended my talk. At the PyCon US 2024 opening reception, while catching up with Jon Banafato (PyGotham Chair), I saw Mark walking by and couldn’t resist stopping him to introduce myself and thank him years later for going to my first talk. :) After years of following each other on social media, it was wonderful to meet Anthony Shaw (Microsoft) in person. Along with Iqbal Abdullah (LaLoka Labs, PyCon JP), we talked about the CPython Internals book Anthony wrote and my desire to understand CPython better. Anthony later suggested that I submit to the CfP next year, and I have to admit that it’s tempting. It was a pleasure to chat with Simon Willison (Django Co-founder) again briefly before he left to work on his keynote. I knew he would nail it. I got to hang out with Meagan Voss (Wagtail) and Nic James (DjangoCon US 2019 Chair) and talk about our work. It was so good to see my friend Jess Garson (Elastic, formerly Twitter) at the Elastic booth and meet Philip Krenn (Elastic). Jess and I first met at PyGotham 2019, and she introduced me to many aspects of the Twitter Developer Program. :) The night finished with a bear hug from Carol Willing (CPython Core Developer, Python Steering Committee) who told me I am awesome. :) Expo Hall in full swing 🔝 back to top Expo Hall Booths Thursday and Friday¶ In the Expo hall, I did a tour of database companies and other fun tools. At Datadog booth, Julian Levi Hernandez (Datadog, formerly CockroachDB) gave me a demo of a dashboard using Cockroach audit logs to further drill down into metrics. At the Edge DB booth, Yury Selivanov (Edge DB Co-founder) told me that Django will be supported in a few months and showed me the impressive performance improvement created by Edge DB. Looking forward to learning more! At the Oracle booth, Gary Brenner (Oracle Senior Cloud Engineer) told me about Oracle Cloud and self-managing Oracle databases. At MongoDB booth, I caught up with my friend Mark Smith (MongoDB) and obtained some learning resources from Rita Rodrigues (Director of Developer Relations at MongoDB). At Snowflake booth, I learned about Snowflake Quickstarts and using Snowflake tasks for orchestration. At the Crunch Data booth, I met Elizabeth Garrett Christensen. I know of Elizabeth through the talks she has given at DjangoCon US: “How to Be a Postgres DBA in a Pinch” and “Postgres Performance: From Slow to Pro”. Crunch Data provides Enterprise PostgreSQL support, including fully managed Postgres as a Service. As a fellow Lawrence native, Elizabeth seems to be hoping for a Lawrence Django conference as much as I am. :) I missed the Lawrence Technology Conference this year, but hope to make it next year at least, if there is one. At the PostgreSQL community booth, I obtained some learning resources, including a paper version of PostgreSQL FAQs. At the Coiled booth, I learned about using Dask for parallel computing. Dask was a projects cited in the Measuring the performance of CPython. EdgeDB, Oracle, Dask, Streamlit socks, MongoDB socks? 🔝 back to top Friday¶ Breakfast¶ At breakfast, I met Loren Crary (PSF) for the first time after following each other on social media for quite some time and saw Al Sweigart (Author of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python), one of my favorite authors and presenters, again. I also finally met Tania Allard (Quansight, formerly Microsoft) and learned more about her work, including consulting at JPMorgan Chase. It was a pleasure to meet Daniel Graham (SauceLabs) and Jing Cao (National Microbiome Data Collaborative), too. 🔝 back to top K. Jay Miller Keynote¶ Jay knows two staff developer advocates who are Black and he is one of them. When he sees another Black developer on stage, it’s not just another Pythonista. Jay talked about beautiful moments from DjangoCon US 2023 in Durham, North Carolina: Black leaders, from all around the world, getting on stage, getting in front of their booths. They showed up and showed out for who they were. Black Python Devs at DjangoCon US 2023 Jay was happy to not be the first Black person keynoting PyCon US. But, at PyCon US 2022, Jay counted only 12 Black people among thousands. He talked to them. They had to have a reason to be there. He thought of the keynoters who came before him. They came, they spoke, they left. He wondered if “the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze.” Many people go to conferences to hang out with their friends. If you don’t have that kind of experience, there’s no reason to attend. Jay asked, how do we get more black people to experience the PyCon community, build friendship, and become repeat attendees? Jay decided to create something that would serve as a Wakanda for Black Python devs. Something that would be worth staying for. It’s called Black Python Devs. Jay listened to people in the community who had experience running non-profits, starting communities, running conferences: Marlene, Dawn, Kojo. He needed to make the community safe, equitable, accessible. This goes beyond a code of conduct to issues that Black people think about everyday like physical safety in public. He also wants to prevent burnout. Jay started working behind the scenes to get as many Black people as possible to PyCon US 2023. There were 3x more than in 2022. They were able to be in the same room together and talk about the experiences they have as Black Python devs that others can’t comprehend, not about how to increase diversity. 3x attendance at PyCon US 2022 Five members launched a discord. There are 427 members now. Their only plan was to be there for each other. They are now officially a non-profit powered by the GNOME Foundation. The leadership model is “diversity by inclusion.” Global leaders are represented at the table: from many countries, speaking different languages, 50/50 gender parity. It’s members are people who are already around you in PSF, DFS, Djangonauts, Pylades, DjangoGirls. Because the community came from Africa, its leaders do too. “Your reach may extend beyond your grasp.” Kojo Idressa The Python community can extend the reach further and Black Python Devs can help change perceptions in communities. A few examples of solidarity Facilitating four leaders traveling to their first PyCon US Converting community sponsorship into tickets for first time attendees who are Black Python Devs members Providing 75 student tickets to Python Nigeria Convening leaders from across the globe at conference lunchtime to help understand the situation happening in Africa and what could be done to assist Helped Vice Chair Velda Kiara on stage when her laptop didn’t work Supporting a Django Girls event that gave not just Black women devs, but Black girls a wonderful first interaction with the Python community “Say it loud.” Everything they do is out in the open, proudly showing up for each other, saying, we’ve got this, and celebrating. Black Python devs had a goal of sponsoring seven local conferences in Black communities and hoped to raise $5,000 at PyCon US. They raised over $15,300 from 282 donations. Things you can do to help Donate money Donate time, mentor Connect with Black Python Devs Open doors, have conversations, make connections 🔝 back to top Hallway Track and Expo Hall¶ At PyCon US 2019, Pablo Galindo Salgado (CPython Release Manager, Bloomberg) was one of the first people I met as a wide-eyed newcomer. It was the Thursday night before the conference talks began, and I was at the conference hall for the swag stuffing, which is a great place to meet people. Scientists had recently photographed a black hole for the first time. Pablo, a physicist, invited me to a table nearby where he demoed some Python astronomy software for me. I later met Barry Warsaw (Python Steering Committee, Nvidia) at the sprints and talked to him about my career. At the time, I was a part-time open source maintainer of Pinax. I saw Pablo and Barry together at the PyCon US 2024 Opening Reception. It was wonderful to be able to share with them five years later how my career has taken off. It was great to see Andrew Godwin (Django Async Architecture) and Dave Forgac (PyOhio) again. I had the chance to say hello to Sarah Kuchinsky (PyCon US Organizer) for the first time since PyCon US 2019. She was recently the technical reviewer for Al Sweigart’s great book about recursion called “The Recursive Book of Recursion”. I really enjoyed it! I found out that Julia Ferraioli (AWS Open Source) was at the conference. I was ecstatic and hurried over to meet her. I had hoped to meet Julia in person for years. In March of 2021, I reached the final round of a Twitter Open Source Program Manager interview process. I was disappointed when I was not offered the job, but later found out that I had been considered alongside Julie and was honored. In a twist of fate, in August of 2022, Julia kindly met with me via Zoom and gave me excellent career advice. It was also a pleasure to meet Brianne Wilhelmi (Springboard) and Aaron Clark (Hamilton Beach) at lunch, and see Ashia Zawaduk (Muck Rack) again after PyCascades 2020. 🔝 back to top Photos and Tea¶ Earlier this year, I created a page of favorite conference snapshots. Benedict Kofi Amofah (Python Ghana, DjangoCon US) tweeted to me that he’d be in the gallery soon. I took him up on it. :) Me and Benedict Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer (Python Usergroup of Mauritius (PyMUG)) and I have been following each other on social media for quite some time, but I didn’t know what he looked like. Fortunately, he found me and gave me a wonderful gift of Chartreuse tea, the best selling tea in Mauritius. Thank you! Chartreuse Tea! 🔝 back to top Condado Tacos¶ After my incredible meal on Thursday night at Fig and Ash, I wanted to do something simple for supper. Based on a tip from another conference attendee, I ended up across the street from the convention center at Condado Tacos. The food was pretty good, but the best part was sitting and chatting with Bloomberg Python Trainers Heather Crawford and Scott Irwin. I met Scott at PyGotham 2018 where I attended a talk he gave “Dataclasses are here. Now what?”. I met Heather at PyTexas 2024 where she did an awesome talk “Python Code Versus Pythonic Code: What Experienced Developers Find Challenging About Learning Python”, which she also gave at PyCon US. 🔝 back to top Saturday¶ Breakfast¶ Koushik Krishnan (Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB Engineer) gave his talk “Rest Easy with Jupyrest: Deploy notebooks as web services” at PyTexas. When I saw during the talk that he works on Microsoft Azure Cosmo DB, I was keen to meet him and did. He gave the talk at PyCon US too. It was a pleasure to have the chance to chat with him about different databases over breakfast. I also had the chance to promote Bar Camp Philly, organized by Tim Allen and now Dawn Wages’ wife. 🔝 back to top Simon Willison Keynote¶ Simon talked about Large Language Models such as Chat GPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and Llama. He does not think of them as Artificial Intelligence. He thinks of them as Imitation Intelligence. They predict the next word in a sentence. When they get good at that, it’s spooky what they can do. He acknowledged that they are flawed, but just because a tool is flawed, doesn’t mean it’s not useful. When evaluating a new technology, Simon asks, what can I build with this that I couldn’t have built with it before? LLMs open up new options unlike anything he has ever seen. How can we tell which of these models works best? Vibes. Simon recommends using LMSYS Org Chatbot Arena. You vote on which model gave the best response to a prompt, then they are scored using Elo rating system. Simon is relieved, because “openly” licensed models are beginning to rank. LLMs can be run on smartphones now, even with no internet connection. An app called MLC Chat will give you access to Mistral, one of the best openly licensed models. Simon has deep respect for what is known as prompt engineering. It’s not easy to get LLMs to do what you want them to do. Building something simple is easy. Building something production ready can take months and is much harder than people expect. A few tricks Chat prompting Retrieval Augmented Generate (RAG) Function calling (“tools”) in a loop Simon coined the term “Prompt Injection” after SQL Injection. He believes that we are not seeing digital assistants, because no one knows how to build them securely. 99% effective isn’t good enough. Never mix untrusted text with access to tools. Simon showed how he gave the LLM a GeoJSON file with different line segments and prompted it to turn it into a single polygon. This “side project” took 3 1/2 minutes to complete Simon showed how he had created a counter that incremented each time he said AI or artificial intelligence. It took 6 minutes to get to prototype and 20 minutes to get it polished. Simon walked through how he passed structured data from the PSF Board Resolutions page into an LLM to parse it into a structured data table that could be filtered. He used a plugin he had been developing called llm.datasette.io. Simon has been able to use LLM to more quickly build things that he couldn’t justify spending the time to build by hand. Tips Ask it to give options (it’s more likely to give a better answer) It will rarely get the answer right. Ask it to “do better.” LLMs make mistakes. It’s up to you to verify. The tool gets you 90% of the way there. Rather than Generative AI, Simon likes to think of these tools as Transformative AI. Personal AI ethics: Simon came across the term “slop” and likes it. Similar to spam, ask yourself, am I creating unwanted junk or am I using these tools in a responsible way? Simon pondered if using LLMs is cheating. We care if students cheat, because it hurts them and they have an unfair advantage. LLMs feel different. Simon’s whole career has been about getting things done more quickly, including by using open source code. A few rules of thumb Never commit any code that you couldn’t actively explain to someone else LLMs are good at explaining code. Give it code in a language you don’t understand and it will explain it with 90% accuracy Then, help people understand how you did it! He said software engineers are uniquely positioned to take advantage of LLMs, because LLMs are good at generating code, and you can check the code by running it. Simon is optimistic. You need to have a CS degree or spend a lot of time learning to do the simplest of computer tasks. LLMs opens programming up to a much wider community. Simon believes that we have a responsibility to not leave anyone behind. 🔝 back to top Hallway Track¶ It was wonderful to see Moshe Zadka at PyTexas where he gave a talk “Iterate, iterate, iterate” and again at PyCon US where he gave me a Moleskin journal from Anthropic for recording convo starters for next-generation AI assistant Claude. Moleskin from Moshe At DjangoCon US 2023, Marc Gibbons gave a wonderful talk called “Empathetic testing: Developing with compassion and humility”. Not only was it his first conference talk, but after 44 chemo treatments, 15 fractions of radiation, and a stem cell transplant to treat Hodgkin Lymphoma, he had been given a clean bill of health the week before. It was wonderful to have the chance to catch up with him at PyCon US. 🔝 back to top Overcoming GIL with subinterpreters and immutability¶ Yury Selivanov showed a screen with a single Python process running 10 async IO event loops saturating the 10 CPU cores on his laptop, all sharing memory and exchanging values between them from 1 million keys and values and done fairly efficiently. Yury said it is possible to build fast things with Python. Yury kind of likes the GIL. When he tries to do free-threading or multi-thread programming, bad things happen. Free-threading will take a couple of years to be stable. Python subinterpreters are relatively new. You can run these subinterpreters in the same process, side-by-side, isolated from each other, each with its own GIL and occupying one CPU core, sharing the same memory space. One of the subinterpreters will be the main one and will spawn workers and perhaps can have queues between workers and spawn tasks. What if we could safety share state between the subinterpreters with the potential for lots of it and without using pickle, because it’s slow? Safe shared state… no pickle Yury has created a minimal library called memhive that enables efficient data sharing between isolated subinterpreters. He showed a code snippet. Architecture Level 1: simple protocol that enables you to send Python data across subinterpreter boundary Level 2: higher level API (queues and sychronization primitives) Level 3: async IO bridge Create memhive and define the async workers that will be running in each separate subinterpreter, each with its own async IO loop. They can access shared state, listen to messages, send messages, spawn worker subinterpreters. The main interpreter will initialize the shared state, broadcast signals to all subinterpreters, push work so that one starts working on a task, listen to messages. Rather than how it works, Yury felt it was more important to talk about how it’s implemented. 3 things to talk about Immutability Efficient immutability How we can benefit from it Immutability Python has immutable types: str, int, floates, bytes, tuples You cannot change an existing object. You have to create a new object out of the existing object. There is no immutable dictionary or mapping in CPython, which Yury says is a shame. Efficient immutability Creating a new tuple out of an existing one is efficient (O(n)), but you are not usually dealing with a lot of records. The same inefficiency would be very bad for a dictionary, because we are potentially putting millions of items in them. Dictionaries can be used as caches, but rebuilding it every time would be unacceptably slow. Fortunately smart people created a nice algorithm that can implement this with O(log n) The trick Yury would show used trees behind the scenes. As keys and values are added to an empty root node of the tree, when a key conflict happens, another node on the second level is created and the key is added to it instead. The tree will get bigger and bigger as items are added. Linking a second level node by reference Imagine that we want to mutate this tree. We run the algorithm to figure out where to put the key, then need to copy the root node (it’s immutable, so we can’t mutate it). This is where the magic happens. We don’t have to copy the second level of the tree. We can re-use it. We just need the reference. In a mapping with billions of keys, perhaps five nodes out of 10,000 change. This is called structured sharing. The algorithm is called HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie). Yury implemented it in the Python Standard Library. It can be found in contextvars module. The hamt.c file has a 200 line comment explaining in detail how this data structure works. How we can benefit from it All subinterpreters run in the same OS process so they share the same memory space If we want to access this tree from the main subinterpreter, we just look into the memory directly. It is immutable and will not change. If we want to add a key, we don’t have to copy the entire tree, we just create the missing new branches and reference others If we have a tree with billions of keys, we just create a couple of tree nodes in a worker subinterpreter, the rest can be re-used. Key: using immutable things, we can access the underlying memory safely without locks, as long as we can guarantee that the data would not be garbage collected. memcopy is used and is really fast. Create tree nodes in the worker subintrepreter and re-use the rest Yury performed a benchmark. Structured sharing is significantly faster than using pickle, potentially 6x to 150,000x faster. Yury talked about some of the implementation details icluding incref and decref. incref keeps Python objects alive when the ref count goes to zero. The data sharing mechanism has to guarantee safety. The hard part of this is implemented in memhive, but some bugs need to be fixed. Do not use it in production. Yury is building this for Edge DB to optimize cloud deployments. 🔝 back to top Measuring the performance of CPython¶ “Measuring the Performance of CPython” by Michael Droettboom (Microsoft CPython Performance Engineering Team, Faster CPython Team) I did not watch this full talk, because I left early to go to the PSF Members Luncheon. A few key takeaways from what I did watch: The Faster CPython Team has made Python 3.11 20-60% faster depending on what you are doing This talk was born out of a need to benchmark in order to determine if they were working on the right things to impact Python performance In the Python world, benchmarks are in pyperformance suite (a little over 100 benchmarks, some 30 or 40 years old) Not all benchmarks are created equal Other projects that have aimed to make faster Pythons over the years Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach has a useful chapter for looking at benchmarks and categorizing what they are useful for Toy benchmarks: simple, less than 100 lines of code, cool, but not a common use case Real applications: take some code that runs in production, maybe on a massive scale and running it in a benchmark suite Microbenchmarks (not in the textbook): measuring a narrow feature of the language Sub-topics of real applications benchmarks: Modified application: change it slightly to make it better as a benchmark Application kernel: taking one subsystem of application and benchmarking that specifically 🔝 back to top PSF Members Luncheon¶ I attended the PSF Members Luncheon. I sat at a table that included Naomi Cedar (Author of The Quick Python Book), Tres Seaver (Zope), Chris Brousseau (PyBay), and Phebe Polk (PyBay Piggies). I really enjoyed the presentation. At the luncheon, I had the chance to chat with Jannis Leidel (Anaconda) again. At PyCon US 2019, I met him serendipitously while I was working at the PyLadies booth. Once upon a time, he worked on Pinax, an open source library that I later helped maintained. I was able to learn more about the history of the project from him. I later went over to Hynek Schlawack (prolific open source maintainer) who remembered we had met at PyGotham 2019 where I attended a talk he gave! While chatting with him, he introduced me to Hugo van Kemenade, the CPython 3.14 and 3.15 Release Manager. It was very cool to meet him, and it turns out that he maintains Pillow package. I am a big fan of Pillow. I used it to create my Twitter art bot which is very special to me. :) 🔝 back to top Profile Pic¶ My friend Melanie Arbor (O’Reilly Media) takes great profile pics. At DjangoCon US 2017, she took my pic, and I loved it. I’ve used it as my social media profile pic since then, but it’s getting a bit dated. I saw her at PyCon US and asked her if she would be willing to take a new profile pic of me. It turned out that she had already created a “Profile Pic Palooza” open space for Saturday at 3 pm. As a bonus, I got to catch up with Chalmer Lowe (Google) for the first time since PyCon 2019. New profile pic :) 🔝 back to top Juggling¶ Not only does Ned Batchelder (coverage.py Maintainer) maintain a powerful Python package and give popular conference talks (check out People: The API User’s Guide), he is also a juggling enthusiast. When I saw his juggling open space in progress, I couldn’t resist stopping. I juggled for the first time in probably decades! It was also great to catch up with Paul Ganssle (Google, CPython Core Dev, pytz maintainer), and meet Rob Ludwick (Bank of NY Mellon) and William Higgins (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). Video of me juggling! 🔝 back to top Hallway Track and Expo Hall¶ It was great to see Jacob Kaplan-Moss (early Django Engineer) and Frank Wiles (RevSys, former DSF President) again. I saw Glyph Kefkowitz’s badge and immediately knew he was probably the same Glyph (Twisted Project Leader) I’d come across on social media. I learned more about Twisted when Amber Brown gave a keynote at DjangoCon US US 2019 “The Natural State of Computers”. Glyph and I talked about the role of Twisted in the async world and the possibility of using Twisted for async orchestration. Speaking of my DjangoCon US 2017 talk, Russell Keith-Magee (Beeware Founder, former DSF President, prolific public speaker) was my speaker mentor at the time. At PyCon US 2024, I had the chance to catch up with him before the PyLadies Auction. I congratulated him on the acceptance of PEP 730: Adding iOS as a supported platform. Python now runs on iOS without a patch! Russell’s Beeware Project enables you to write an app in Python and release it on multiple platforms, including desktop and mobile! Check out his PyCon US 2019 Python Black Swans Keynote) and many Beeware talks. 🔝 back to top PyLadies Auction¶ The PyLadies Auction is always a roaring good time. Not long after I sat down, I was excited to see Reuven Lerner (Python Trainer) walking past. He sat down next to me, and it was a pleasure to get to know him. I also enjoyed chatting with Danielle Casper (Amazon) about systems engineering and with Scott Karlin (Princeton). A cuckoo clock donated by Capital One sold for $3,400. A “stupid” pen sold for $700. The auction raised $60,000, $15,000 more than it ever had before. The community showed up in a big way! CPython Release Stream participants showing off their hats A miniature cutout of Guido for selfies and rubber duck debugging :) Thank you to my friends Jackie Kazil (Bana Solutions, Project Mesa), Lorena Mesa (Netflix, PyLadies Chicago), and Lynn Root (Spotify) for all of the hard work they put into the auction this year and every year, and to Doug Napoleone for emceeing and Kushal Das for taking pics! A PyLadies Grant helped me attend PyCon US 2019. Me and Jackie Kazil :) 🔝 back to top Sunday¶ Posters¶ I started Sunday morning by checking out all of the posters. 🔝 back to top Ethan Smith¶ Ethan Smith (Nvidia, formerly Sentry) and I have been following each other on social media for a while. We met in person and talked about his packaging work at Nvidia. He was working on a draft Packaging PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) “Supporting Symlinks in Wheels” sponsored by Barry Warsaw. 🔝 back to top PyLadies Lunch¶ On Sunday, I attended the PyLadies Luncheon. It was wonderful, as usual. Thank you to Marie Roald, Sydney Runkle (Pydantic), Kim Tendulkar, Erika Ambrosio (Tampa Bay Lightning), Sierra Brown, Grace (Muck Rack) (and a few others whose names I did not catch) for a really wonderful conversation over lunch. I learned from Sydney who leads open source at Pydantic that Pydantic is often used with Django Rest Framework. I am looking forward to learning more! Check out Sydney’s PyCon US talk “Pydantic Power-up: Performance Tips for Lightning-Fast Python Applications”. Lynn Root, PyLadies Global Council, addressing the crowd PyLadies Booth in the Expo Hall Beautiful PyLadies t-shirt :) 🔝 back to top Building a JIT compiler for CPython¶ Brandt Bucher (Microsoft CPython Performance Engineering Team) Updates that provided the foundation for a copy and patch JIT Compiler. In Python 3.13, a JIT Compiler was implemented. This was only possible, because of the work done in Python 3.11 and 3.12. In Python 3.11, a Specializing Adaptive Interpreter was implemented that brought a 25% performance improvement on average. At PyCon US 2023, Brandt gave a talk about it “Inside CPython 3.11’s new specializing, adaptive interpreter”. In Python 3.12, infrastructure was implemented to automatically generate an interpreter from a DSL spec. This allowed for some repetitive, tedious, error-prone boilerplate to be removed from the main interpreter loop and different bytecode instructions to be analyzed. In Python 3.13, a second “micro-op” interpreter was implemented. It’s an entirely separate execution pipeline that detects hot code paths and lowers them to a new bytecode format called “micro-ops.” They are optimized and executed in another dedicated interpreter. Brandt showed how the pipeline works using a Fibonacci function as an example. He showed the code, the code’s bytecode, and the stack. Fibonacci code This is where specialized bytecode comes in. If the operation is generalized to accommodate many use cases, but the code’s actual use case is simple, the bytecode can be “specialized” to fit that simpler use case. The resulting bytecode instructions are more specific to the the actual values, types of the code. Implementing specialized bytecode These instructions will now be broken down into smaller, more easily optimized parts called “micro-op traces.” Instructions that are necessary in some cases, but not this case, can be removed. The result will be the essential instructions to execute the code. “micro-op traces” Unfortunately, this new instruction format is more complex than basic bytecode instruction. Although each instruction is doing less work, there are more instructions. This is 20% slower than if we’d done nothing. Decoding each individual instruction in the micro-op interpreter is a lot more expensive. That is where JIT compilation comes in. Rather than decoding individual instructions in the interpreter, we can compile these optimized traces directly into machine code. Just-in-time compilation Python frame objects live out in heap memory. Instead, the stack can be moved to the register where it is immediately available and there is no latency. Rather than having a generic interpreter that needs to handle every possible micro-op, the hot code path can be transformed in a straight line sequence of the exact code needed. Although we want to make the faster, we need to trade peak performance for implementation simplicity that can enable Python to run in many places with few runtime dependencies and be easily maintained, improved, and extended upon by volunteers. While JIT compilers are historically complex, copy and patch compilation meets these requirements satisfying way. The technique is explained in a 30 page paper “Copy and Patch Compilation” and a blog post “Building a baseline JIT for Lua” by the same author. In a nutshell, it’s a way of automatically turning a C interpreter into a fast template JIT compiler Copy and patch can enable us to take a sequence of bytecode instructions and translate it into fast machine code as quickly as possible. At runtime, walk over a sequence of bytecode instructions. For each, we can do something we have long been able to do when linking or reloading a relocatable object file Copy some static, pre-compiled machine code into executable memory Patch up instructions that need to have runtime data encoded into them (things like relocation records for extern symbols) Brandt walked through an example of how to go from micro op instruction to code we JIT at runtime. At build time, when we are building the Python interpreter, the body of the instruction is extracted. It is put inside of its own function to be compiled in isolation. It won’t compile yet, because we are accessing objects with no values. These can be dynamically passed into the function as arguments. In terms of the “undefined locals” that will be the same once JIT-ed, and the frame and pointer that needs to be passed on so that we can JIT any additional micro-ops that we are JIT-ing, copy and patch gives an elegant solution for handling these: externs. Externs are similar to Python imports. You trust them to be defined at runtime. externs When compile this in Clang, the ELF file will have the raw bytes of machine code to execute the micro-op instruction and exactly where and how to patch values. We then have the opportunity to perform some localized optimizations until it is the essential micro-op. This can be parsed out of the ELF file and put directly into code generated in a C header file. We have a function that can be called and it will JIT the instruction for us by copying bytes and patching the load. This is super fast. Because LLVM is used, there is a lot of platform support out of the box. In order to build this yourself, you need to have LLVM 18 installed and follow the instructions in the CPython repo. 🔝 back to top Unlocking the Parallel Universe: Subinterpreters and Free-Threading in Python 3.13¶ Anthony Shaw created a gist with the excellent pre-requisites for his talk. Parallel execution options in Python; In concurrency, multiple tasks share the same resource, while in parallelism, multiple resources execute multiple tasks. In Python 3.11, the GIL lived in the interpreter and we had one GIL per Python process. Multi-processing was used to achieve parallel code execution. If a task were split in half, it would take twice as long, because only one process could run at a time. In Python 3.12, because of a new API, the GIL is per interpreter. We can have multiple interpreters running at the same time with multiple threads. The operating system will figure out which core is available and schedule so they run in parallel. Speed differences Quick conclusion: a subinterpreter is like “multiprocessing with less overhead and shared memory” In Python 3.13, we can disable the GIL and have a single interpreter running multiple threads at the same time. A task split in half will run more quickly now, because it will run in parallel. Steps to remove GIL Free-threading introduces a new ABI that requires special wheels and a special build for CPython, creating compatibility issues. The ABI (application binary interface) is used to load a module that is being compiled in a language like C. The GIL exists for thread-safety. We need to fix all of the C code that assumed the GIL existed and is not thread safe. If everything is in pure Python, the Python team has full control over the interpreter. C extension compatibility poses a major challenge. Ironically, we have so many C extensions, because people optimized code, because they couldn’t run it in parallel. At the moment, disabling the GIL generally makes Python code run slower. There are optimizations that have been disabled when the GIL is turned off, because they need to be made thread-safe before they can be used. Anthony gave a demo followed by some closing thoughts with Terms and Conditions.

It was wonderful to see her in her element at PyCon US 2024, on stage talking about Python packaging. From 2017 to 2022, Sumana was a paid packaging project manager. She worked on things we use a lot, like pip. Key takeaways A chance meeting led Sumana to help obtain funding from Mozilla and overhall PyPI to Warehouse, finishing on time and on budget and unblocking more improvements The strength of weak ties, cross pollination are possible because of the kind of conversations that happen at places like PyCon US Infrastructure is hard, it’s often invisible. People depend on it, but don’t know that they depend on it. Sumana compared it to being a water user. If volunteers try to get the word out about changes and even ask for your feedback, treat them like people. We are all in this together. When PSF gets funding, it gets results (see a list in the PyPI sponsors page) Organizations that rely on this infrastructure (and may have entitled opinions) can do a lot more to help What seems like failure can prepare the ground for success: building organization, networks, knowledge, skill can be crucial for future successes you can’t foresee at the time Sumana revised a bill to the NY City Council until it passed: The HEART Act to make Automated External Defibrillators more accessible to New Yorkers. She wasn’t a Python packaging expert, but also wasn’t a public health expert. She planned and asked the right question until she got an answer.

I got to say hello after the keynote and also had the chance to meet her husband Leonard Richardson, who authored Beautiful Soup, another one of my favorite packages. :) Leonard handed me a mini-zine called “Tool Safety” that he had written. After I got home and started looking through it, I saw that it had a beautiful message. You can see the online version here.

Smith (To be determined) 🔝 back to top Barry Warsaw: Steering Council Overview¶ The steering council is a five-person elected governance body responsible for the technical direction of Python: the evolution of the Python language, the CPython interpreter, and standard library. Elections happen annually, roughly aligned with Python releases. Steering council members serve for one year and can run for re-election with no term limits. They are typically nominated and elected by CPython Core Devs, but you don’t have to be a CPython Core Dev to serve. No more than two members can work for the same company. The steering council meets almost every week for 90 minutes. They are regularly joined by Deb Nicholson and Łukasz Langa. They discuss many topics which often come to their attention through the public GitHub tracker. A few of their important tasks: determining release cycle, choosing next release manager, pronouncing PEPs. The steering council has the final say on PEPs. PEP 13 outlines how the Python Steering Council operates. 🔝 back to top Gregory P.

It feels like we went from Brett Cannon’s “put up or shut up” to this pretty quickly, lol. 🔝 back to top Dinner and Ice Cream¶ After the conference ended on Sunday night, I found myself chatting with a group of old friends and new friends. They invited me to dinner, and I decided to join. It was a wonderful time, as you can tell from the photo. :) Tammy Do (Code Fellows), Velda Kiara (DEFNA Board Member, Python Steering Council Secretary), Jim Anderson (Motorola Solutions, Real Python), Ngazetungue Muheue (LaLoka Labs, DjangoCon Africa), Kudzayi Bamhare, Benedict Kofi Amofah, me, Afi Gbagado, and Catherine Devlin (Corning, formerly Disney) Chocolate bar made by a Ghanian company and given to me by Afi :) PyCon US had a challenge. You could get points for completing certain activities and redeem them for an ice cream card. I was able to complete the challenge, because I had organized a Python-related conference (DjangoCon US 2023) and attended a regional Python conference (PyTexas 2024) since last PyCon US. After dinner, I went to Milley’s Homemade Ice Cream at Market Square and used the ice cream card. I had Best Chocolate. Yummy! Best Chocolate :) 🔝 back to top Monday¶ At PyCon US 2019, on my last night in Cleveland, I spontaneously joined Sviatoslav Sydorenko (Ansible Core Developer), Stéphane Wirtel (CPython Core Developer), and a few other conference attendees at Flannery’s Pub for dinner. It was magical. On the first day of the PyCon US 2024 Sprints, Sviatoslav Sydorenko and I found each other for a catch up. I suddenly made the connection that he is a core developer of Ansible, a tool that I use. Mind blown. :) He gave me some insight about being a programmer versus engineer and distributed systems. It was a very enlightening conversation for me. I also met Seth Michael Larson (PSF Security Developer in Residence) in person in the packaging sprints room. I have been following his security work, which has included Visualizing the CPython release process, making CPython source release Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) available, and getting the PSF set up as a CVE Numbering Authority. He told me more about his background and work. His blog is an awesome source of info, and I highly recommend following him for news!

Plenty of the names dropped here are people I admire and follow on social media, but I would think myself terribly rude to introduce myself to them as I'm just an irrelevant developer. reply reuven 4 hours agorootparentI have something of a following (newsletters, social media), gave two talks at PyCon, and even had a booth advertising my training services. So at the risk of sounding like a total egomaniac just for responding, let me say a few things: 1. I absolutely, positively love meeting new people at PyCon, regardless of their background, level, etc. I learn new things from just about everyone I meet, and that's a huge part of the fun for me. I'm frustrated that I don't get a chance to just meet and chat with more people during the conference, and actively try to eat meals with people I don't yet know so that I can get to know them. 2. Part of the greatness of the Python community is that we realize other people, regardless of their fame, are just that -- people. They were unknown at some point, and people were nice to them. So they'll probably be nice to you, too. 3. Every community has jerks, Python included. If someone famous isn't nice to you, then just ignore them from that point on, and concentrate on the numerous nice people. It's not worth getting riled up or upset about it. reply scubbo 4 hours agorootparentThis is a helpful perspective, thank you! reply th 1 hour agorootparentprevAl Sweigart, Eric Matthes, Reuven Lerner (also in this comment section), and so many folks who've made blog posts, books, code, or something else that's inspired you really do love it when you tell them. I know I'm always please when someone who likes something I've done introduces themselves and says so. We're all just people. Meeting someone in-person who enjoys something you've done is enjoyable for nearly everyone. Fawning is a bit much, but a \"thank you for what you do\" is really lovely. If you're not sure how to \"break in\": keep the Pac-Man rule that's often embraced at PyCon in mind. If there's an open spot in a huddled group or if the group seems to notice you eyeing them and make a spot for you, join the group. Feel free to just fish bowl the conversation. Most of the time I've seen this happen, eventually someone chats with whoever just joined the conversation. Don't be afraid to either keep fish bowling or walk away if the conversation isn't what you were expecting. Either are acceptable. You noted that you're afraid of being rude. That means you're exactly the person most folks would love to chat with since you're probably both humble and kind. :) reply KatiMichel 5 hours agorootparentprevYou shouldn't feel that way at all. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience meeting people at a conference. It has actually been the opposite. Many people are there to make connections (and have their own doubts as well). You might be surprised at how receptive they will be. Also, many conferences actively promote inclusion. See the \"Pac Man Rule\" attributed to Eric Holscher which was referenced at PyCon US. https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-con... reply scubbo 4 hours agorootparentThat's a lovely idea - thank you for sharing! reply greenie_beans 3 hours agorootparentprevjust introduce yourself and tell them that you appreciate their work. don't try to smooze. reply KatiMichel 5 hours agoparentprevIt was a huge number of people, but I already know a lot of people from being a conference regular for quite a few years. reply smitty1e 6 hours agoparentprevMy first, too. I went ahead and joined the PSF on the strength of the experience. reply zitterbewegung 1 hour agoprevSo some actually did a talk about knitting and obviously knitting has looping (repetition) and possibly conditional evaluation. They have a way to make an \"open space\" or use some meeting rooms for whatever you want. I made one for \"advanced knitting theory\" and I was having trouble understanding if you could do conditional branching that would break a loop because the stopping of knitting is used to end the knitting. More about knitting notation can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting_abbreviations reply cr125rider 6 hours agoprevThese seem like great posts to reflect on a conference experience.

I see myself building on these experiences over time. reply rishab_kokate 2 hours agoprevHi, this was such a delightful post to read. Im currently a comp sci college student and I had no clue there was even an event called pycon lol. But reading your blog makes me think it was so much fun. Quick question, is there a criteria to attend the event such as part of a specific company or organization? Or is it for anyone who uses python? reply nomdep 2 hours agoparentAnyone can attend, but not everyone can afford to (is not free, you have to buy a ticket plus all the travel expenses). That’s why many who attend do it by convincing their company to pay for the the trip and the ticket reply simonw 1 hour agorootparentThere's a generous travel grant program to help people attend who might not be able to afford to otherwise. https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/03/TravelGrantsReport2024.ht... reply KatiMichel 2 hours agoparentprevGlad you enjoyed it!

In fact when I saw this post (the top-level) about PyCon 2024 I went and re-checked to see if they had published any videos. Like you I see \"144 unavailable videos are hidden\" and only 9 videos available to watch. I'm looking forward to watching some of the content when they do publish :) reply th 1 hour agoprevThis is such a thorough post. Thanks Kati! I think this post will be great for PyCon newcomers. Getting the chance to experience a play-by-play of a past PyCon before attending your first PyCon might be even more useful than reading the various \"how to have a great first PyCon\" posts that many of us have written.

What is Pycon's policy on releasing talks to Youtube? reply reuven 5 hours agoparentAll talks are put on YouTube (unless the speaker specifically opted out of recording), but it usually takes 2-3 months for them to be put up. reply chx 5 hours agoprevThis does not mention PyCon US 2024 was one of the extremely, extremely few conferences which did the right thing and had a mask mandate. > We are nice people and many of us and our fellow community members can’t attend without health and safety guidelines in place. We want PyCon US to be an event that everyone feels safe attending. PyCon US is exceptional in that we have people attending from all over the world—last year we had people attending from 75 different countries! We love that people bring their unique perspectives… but they also bring their local germs and Covid strains. We’re masking to keep our immuno-compromised friends safe at PyCon US and to ensure that those of us who share their homes with immuno-compromised people can also consider joining us without quarantining when they return home. I salute you. I wish more conferences did this. I am quite bitter about how after all the inclusion and diversity talk over the years most open source conferences do not do this. Even Fosdem didn't have one despite 1. volunteer driven so free from financial pressure from anti vaxxer owned companies (not all communities were so lucky) 2. famous for being crowded 3. is not in the US -- where this is most politicized Edit: please read https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/unmitigated-covid-is-overwhel... if you think we are past the pandemic. reply reuven 4 hours agoparentI think we can all agree that masking is super annoying. We can also agree that if everyone were to mask 100% of the time, then we would be in a safer world, with less spread of disease. But we all live with some level of risk. Keeping the risk level at or near zero isn't realistic, or something that most people want. We cross the street, travel in cars, etc. I find it weird that PyCon had a mandatory masking policy, when medical conferences staffed by doctors and disease experts don't have such a policy any more. And I'm guessing that PyCon's policy was made by well-meaning people who aren't doctors or medical experts. My suggestion -- and yes, I wrote this in my PyCon follow-up survey -- is that our masking policy follow whatever the CDC, AMA, or a similar body is doing for its conferences at the time PyCon takes place. If the experts require masking, then we should do so, also. And if they don't, then we should encourage people to mask if they need or want to, but we shouldn't force it upon everyone. In other words: PyCon should make decisions about the conference and Python-related things. Medical decisions should be left to outside experts. reply ongy 4 hours agorootparentSince you attended how much did people actually follow the mandate? I looked through the pictures, and it seems to be ~not at all for picture/social situation, and maye 50% for general? reply reuven 3 hours agorootparentIn talks, in hallways, and at the expo (i.e., company booths), I'd say adherence was at least 90 percent. But whenever there was a chance to take the mask off, people did. If there was food around, people immediately ditched the masks and stayed with food or drink in their hand to justify keeping the masks off. I was at one small (10-person) session where everyone agreed to keep masks off, gingerly making sure that no one objected. We then all made sure to have drinks in front of us to \"justify\" doing so. And when people went outside, the masks were off. At the PSF member lunch, where we ate together, masks were off as soon as we got food. At the PyLadies auction, where we (again) ate together, people were also without masks. I'll note that the auction took place in the same room where talks had taken place several hours earlier, with strict mask enforcement (and adherence). Bottom line, people were generally willing to follow the rules. But there was a lot of grumbling about why there should be a mask mandate in 2024, and what the justification was for having one. reply emddudley 1 hour agorootparentprevI attended and I would say there was 98% compliance. The policy was that masks off was OK outside, while presenting, while eating, and briefly when posing for photos. reply NathanaelRea 3 hours agorootparentprevAbout 100% inside the conference, except while eating or speakers. People can take their masks off outside. reply finolex1 5 hours agoparentprevIf you are immuno-compromised or living with someone who is, shouldn't you not be travelling thousands of miles to a large, packed conference anyway? Since masks are not 100% effective. To each their own, but I personally will not be attending PyCon next year because it was exhausting to wear a mask for 5 days straight. reply chx 5 hours agorootparentSo let's exclude those people from society, that's what you are saying. It's not just traveling thousands of miles, it's boarding a bus or entering any indoor space with unmasked people. And yes, that exclusion is the reality most of us face. This has echoes of how people with AIDS were considered back then. reply jamwil 3 hours agorootparentBut even with a mask mandate, a large conference is probably not an acceptable risk for someone in that position. Masks help, but they aren’t a complete solution, especially when folks remove them to eat and take photos. reply yyggvbb 4 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who’s disabled, yes I have accept people can’t always accommodate me. reply throwaway63467 5 hours agoparentprevI guess you have to find a balance between being able to have a “normal” event where people can meet each other without special medical precautions and accommodating immuno-compromised and health-anxious people. I’m really glad there’s a sense of normalcy after the pandemic again and I would not be willing to wear a mask to all such events all the time, I don’t mind wearing one to accommodate people in smaller groups or when having closer contact though. reply chx 5 hours agorootparent> I’m really glad there’s a sense of normalcy after the pandemic again Except we are not after the pandemic, it's made up by politicians and the rich. The second highest measured covid ratio in wastewater across the United States was in 2023 December-January. It's just the virus now kills a lot less people but its long term effects, named \"long covid\" is a debilitating disability that people prefer to pretend not existing. reply sgt 5 hours agoparentprevSounds like a recommendation, not a mask mandate. Plenty of people in those photos without masks. reply th 1 hour agorootparentSomething important to note: many folks take their masks off for a picture, then put their masks back on. This leads non-candid photos having far few masks in them. reply VagabundoP 1 hour agoparentprevI would have completely agreed with you two+ years ago but not any longer. With vaccines and other ways of dealing with Covid infections it does not seem reasonable to have to do this anymore. And I doubt it’s very effective anyway, people are notorious terrible at wearing masks. There is zero mask wearing in my country now and it’s mandated until nearly everyone was vaccinated. Now it’s no longer used as a Covid prevention measure here. reply twixfel 5 hours agoparentprevTo each their own but I'm pretty glad masks are on their way out. I wore one when I had to during the pandemic and I'm quite happy that I didn't have to wear one to any of the conferences I've been to since the pandemic ended. reply chx 5 hours agorootparentThanks for excluding me from the conferences you attend. I am astounded that four years in we still need to explain that a) masks are effective in stopping community transmission b) masks worn by the source are more effective or, in other words, your mask protects me while my mask protects you. How is this new? No, your stance is absolutely selfish -- not uncommon of course, but it is selfish. reply elteto 5 hours agorootparentThere is no need to label him selfish. You don’t know him. He isn’t any more selfish than you are, traveling to a crowded conference while living with an immuno-compromised person, and on top of that expecting people to bend over to your requirements. reply sgt 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat's selfish is actually demanding that society changes for you (or a minority of immuno-compromised individuals). COVID was one thing, but we're way past it now and society had to go back to the normal way of things. reply chx 5 hours agorootparentDid you check covid wastewater statistic over the last year when you parroted the pandemic is over? reply sgt 1 hour agorootparentDid you check that Sweden (as an example) had no mask mandate and no vaccinations, and came off better than many nations? reply twixfel 5 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that I don't want to wear a mask. I tolerated it during the pandemic because it was an extreme situation. The pandemic is now over, so I no longer wear a mask. If that makes me selfish, then I'm OK with that. It is arguably no less selfish to force everyone else to wear a mask. I am not going to argue that point though because I don't even particularly care, I just don't want to wear a mask, that's all. reply chx 5 hours agorootparentDid you check covid wastewater statistic over the last year when you parroted the pandemic is over? reply twixfel 4 hours agorootparentIdk man life feels pretty normal to me and has felt pretty normal for about 2 years now. I guess you can try and convince me to care, but I just don't. I go days or even weeks without thinking about this pandemic tbh. Feels good. So if the wastewater is telling you something, but life is so normal, maybe the wastewater statistics don't mean what you think they mean. reply kennethreitz 5 hours agoprevI didn’t get to attend, but I enjoyed living vicariously through this post :-) reply KatiMichel 5 hours agoparentAwesome!

Disponibile anche in Italiano. Click to start or simply scroll down. 1 Introduction Midlife crisis Midlife crisis I understand that you may be feeling a bit perplexed at this point, so let me begin anew, or at least with the medical condition I’ve self-diagnosed to rationalize everything: the midlife crisis. I acknowledge that, at “only” 36 years old, with the advancements in scientific progress extending the average life expectancy well beyond 70 years, It may seem premature to begin contemplating about it. However, I contend that the relentless pace of our lives has accelerated this moment of reflection, prompting us to nostalgically revisit past moments and rediscover the allure of childhood possessions — whether acquired, lost, or long-dreamt of. In my case, I can affirm that I was enticed by the notion of an improbable mission: the restoration and repair of an iconic computer from the past, armed with no specific technical expertise other than a robust and innate passion for computers. The chosen endeavor revolved around a genuine instant classic in the realms of computer science and industrial design: the original Macintosh. The Macintosh Originally overseen by Jef Raskin, the “Macintosh” project was envisioned as Apple’s inaugural computer, specifically targeted at families and marketed with a price tag below $1,000 01. However, the trajectory took an unexpected turn in 1980 when Apple, citing Steve Jobs’ intense perfectionism and limited team-building skills, decided to reassign him from the helm of the flagship “Lisa” project. Apple’s strategy was to shift Jobs to a project of lesser prominence like the Macintosh, one deemed less pivotal to the company’s future, where his disposition could be more constrained. Jobs found himself transitioning from the design of a groundbreaking computer like the Lisa, Apple’s first professional workstation featuring an operating system with an iconographic interface and mouse-operable windows — to the Macintosh, a more traditional, budget-friendly computer with a text-based operating system, targeting families. Jobs’s leadership Under Jobs’s leadership, his initial response was to distance Raskin and decisively reshape the project. While the Macintosh was intended to be an economically accessible computer, Jobs believed it couldn’t be solely from a financial perspective. Recognizing the need to cater to individuals unfamiliar with computers, the Macintosh couldn’t compromise on the user-friendly experience offered by a graphical interface and a mouse. Jobs envisioned the computer being prominently displayed in homes, akin to any other household appliance, and insisted on a design that was nothing short of “insanely great”. This new trajectory, coupled with an exceptional marketing campaign, propelled the project into unprecedented levels of hype 01. However, it also led to a substantial increase in the costs associated with design, production, and promotion. Apple “1984” Super Bowl Commercial directed by Ridley Scott © All original content Copyright & TM Retro Recipes™ LLC 1988-present. Via YouTube Retro Recipes Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh © All original content copyright and Computer History Museum. Via YouTube Computer History Museum The Macintosh made its debut on January 24, 1984 02, hitting American shelves with a price tag of $2,495. Despite its competitive pricing, especially when considering the initial positioning of the Lisa at $9,995 and the incorporation of numerous new technologies and features inherited from it, the Macintosh still entailed hardware compromises. Its placement in that price range proved challenging for the average American family. While the goal of bringing the concept of a graphical interface and mouse to a broad user base was partially achieved, thanks to widespread promotion and adoption of the Macintosh in educational (schools, universities) and professional environments (constituting 90% of total sales), it fell short of reaching the intended consumer market 02 03. The Macintosh became a topic of conversation for everyone, but it was not yet accessible to everyone, and sales never fully met expectations. Jobs bore the brunt of this setback, to the extent that he was ousted from the company he co-founded before the year’s end. Steve Jobs (Book) - Walter Isaacson (2011) When the Mac Came to Market Street - LeBow College of Business Drexel University (2014) Computer makers find rich market in schools - New York Times (1984) 2 The right one Let the search begin Let the search begin Okay, let’s begin with the obvious. The original Macintosh (128K 04) hasn’t been available for over three decades. Obtaining one now requires finding someone willing to part with it or, as my wife puts it, “to get rid of it”. While I’m sure there are numerous sales channels and opportunities in the United States, in Italy, aside from a stroke of luck at a vintage electronics market, the primary option is eBay. Key considerations I must concede that I may have overstated in the introduction: even at the time, 128KB of RAM wasn’t quite sufficient, a realization users came to fairly quickly 05. A few months later, Apple took evasive action by quadrupling the RAM with the 512K model. Many early adopters opted to upgrade, undergoing a complete motherboard replacement as the RAM was soldered onto the PCB. This approach proved more cost-effective than the alternative, which involved bearing the expense of RAM in addition to specialized labor for individually replacing all (16) chips. Despite being a mass-produced industrial product on a global scale, with hundreds of thousands in circulation, the rush to upgrade (justifiable at the time) and the subsequent need for maintenance or component replacement over the years have rendered intact units a rarity. The market Machines that remain entirely original and operational are currently being sold at prices ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 06. This extensive range is frequently attributed to the aesthetic state of different components, the production week indicated by the serial number, and the inclusion of accessories and accompanying software. Fortunately, the value experiences a sharp decline when, under similar conditions and equipment, the computer is marketed as non-functional, often due to a problem identified to varying degrees by the seller. Impatience, oil on canvas When’s it gonna get here?! Knock on the door Will there really be a Macintosh in here? How beautiful! Macintosh 128K front view. What a beauty! Macintosh 128K Rear View. The right problem The notion of acquiring one for restoration, akin to reviving an old vintage car that no longer runs, intrigued me. The immediate allure of substantial cost savings persuaded me to delve deeper (unaware that I would eventually spend the equivalent of obtaining a fully operational unit in the ensuing months). My requirements were: A Macintosh with a commonly documented issue. A problem complex enough to require attention but not beyond my capabilities. An issue seemingly confined and identifiable through a photograph or an error code. A Macintosh complete with essential accessories: keyboard, mouse, power cable, and boot floppy. An aesthetically pleasing Macintosh, serving as a paperweight decorative item if repair proved unsuccessful. After months of research and numerous rejected purchase proposals, I found the ideal synthesis of these requirements in an eBay auction by a vintage electronics store in Tucson, Arizona. Adding to the myriad variables inherent in acquiring a non-functioning item from almost four decades ago was the challenge of an intercontinental journey. Despite the uncertainties, I decided to take the leap: a deep breath, closed eyes, and a click on the “Buy it now” button 03. Over the ensuing three weeks, I cycled through various emotions, from pure excitement to regret and occasional despair. Then, it arrived. Finally, the courier at the door. Unboxing time. Yes! That’s it! What a beauty! 05-06. Admittedly, it’s a bit dirty with signs of weathering, but try spending three decades in an attic, crossing a continent, and presenting yourself like this for a first date.

First boot Sad Mac 3 Sad Mac We have a problem. We have a problem. Okay, the initial attempt to boot didn’t go as planned, but I shouldn’t have expected anything different. After swiftly unpacking, connecting a voltage reducer to the socket, and powering up the computer 07, I hear a familiar [beep], as anticipated from all the repair videos on YouTube that I’ve watched to prepare myself. The Devil’s Interval This is the renowned Apple boot sound, still present in the current lineup across all Mac products. However, the complete and reassuring sound we hear in today’s Macs is the result of subsequent work 07 initiated in 1988 by Jim Reekes, a sound engineer. In 1984, hardware limitations prevented achieving such sophisticated sounds. Consequently, it had to be simplified into something much more basic: a three-note chord with sounds that were far from soothing, historically known even in the 1800s as the “devil’s interval” 07. First tests Failed boot attempt and Sad Mac. Motherboard detail Location of RAM chips inside the motherboard. Sad Mac Displayed on the screen is the Sad Mac, one of the legendary icons from the original set designed by Susan Kare specifically for the first Macintosh. While it stands as a genuine pixel art manifesto 08, unfortunately, in my case, this icon identifies an error, and a big one at that. During this boot phase, the computer conducts tests on various components, and the memory is filled with data for a subsequent consistency check. The failure of this test indicates a hardware malfunction, identified by a specific error code displayed immediately below the Sad Mac icon. The code I won is 04040A. In the 80s and 90s, detailed information to decipher these error codes wasn’t extensively provided even in the technical service manuals for installers and repairers 09. For Sad Mac, the suggested generic process often involved replacing the entire logic board. Fortunately, with the advent of the Internet, Apple has digitized and publicly shared more detailed indications, allowing users to interpret the code comprehensively and pinpoint the problem to more specific components. The table at this link serves as my Rosetta Stone for decoding the error. It’s a memory trap! Finally, the code is “clear”. The first two characters (04) represent the type of failed test, “Memory Mod3 test”, while each of the next four characters (040A) identifies the status of a set composed of four memory chips, totaling 16 chips. The specific damaged chips within a set are identified by a number (1, 2, 4, or 8), corresponding to a pair of coordinates with a letter (F or G) and a number (from 5 to 12), determining their precise location on the motherboard 08. 0 4 0 A 1G9 1G5 1F9 1F5 2G10 2G6 2F10 2F6 4G11 4G7 4F11 4F7 8G12 8G8 8F12 8F8 If you’ve stuck with me this far, under the assumption that each character can only have a value of 1, 2, 4, or 8, the question you’ve likely pondered is: why the hell is there an A in my error code? The answer came to light through the experience of a user on the 68kmla.org forum, who, like me, encountered an error code with an unexpected character. Each character identifies the faulty chip within a set of 4 chips. However, when more than one defective chip exists in the same set, the character corresponds to the sum of each in hexadecimal format. The A (10 in decimal format) in the last character of my error code, therefore, represents the sum of the 2 + 8 chips, corresponding to positions F6 and F8 inside the motherboard.

We can do it We have successfully identified the three malfunctioning memory chips and their locations on the motherboard. These are the MT4264 10, a 64Kbit DRAM chip manufactured by Micron Technology, which was practically a standard in computers of that era, albeit under various names and codes depending on the manufacturer 11. This integrated circuit, no longer in production for many years, is now only obtainable through private sellers offering used parts or from suppliers specializing in vintage components. Despite numerous eBay auctions being geographically closer, I chose to rely on Jameco 12, a well-known Californian retailer. This decision was influenced by recommendations from specialized forums during my preliminary research 11. Removing damaged chips Dissolving and removing tin from the board. Motherboard cleaning Removing tin residue from the board. RAM new chips New 4264 chips just arrived. Motherboard detail New 4264 chips installed on the board. Beautiful! Macintosh waiting for boot disk. Let’s open it! Okay, I understand that the disassembly process might look straightforward and quick on this animation, but the reality involves dealing with screws, cables, dust, and cathode ray tubes that can hold extremely high electrical voltages (up to 10kV), even several minutes after being powered off 13. As the first computer created with non-professional users in mind, the Macintosh 128K was deliberately designed to discourage self-repair, thereby making even the simple act of opening its casing a significant challenge. For its exterior, Torx T15 security screws, which were quite rare at that time, were used. These screws were deeply set near the upper “handle”, necessitating the use of an extendable or sufficiently long screwdriver for access 14. Unlike any other computer of its era, the Macintosh was deliberately “armored”. However, as of 2024, the situation has greatly simplified. All necessary tools are readily available in hardware stores. With basic manual skills, removing the motherboard and its damaged chips is straightforward, especially with detailed guides like the iFixit detailed teardown available. Open heart surgery At this juncture, I’d love to claim that I channeled my inner MacGyver and replaced the damaged chips on the board using nothing more than a banana and a paperclip. However, my modest soldering skills dissuaded me from attempting repairs on a board that is not only older than myself but also holds great sentimental value. Yes, I cheated. My family includes several individuals far more adept with hardware than I am, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to entrust the task to my cousin, Luca Giorgi. Luca is a professional electronic designer and has always been accommodating of my caprices. With patience and precision, Luca desoldered each pin, using a tin suction pump to carefully remove the solder, thereby liberating each damaged chip from its position 09. Following the thorough cleaning of the area 10, he skillfully resoldered the 16-pin sockets onto the board and installed the newly acquired chips 12. Now, the moment of truth: crossing our fingers and attempting to power it on once more. The boot sound remains that familiar, uncomforting tone, but this time, the monitor shows signs of life. Contrary to the previous “Sad Mac” screen of darkness, we are greeted with a lit screen, revealing the full luminosity of the monitor for the first time. The central icon confirms a successful start-up, indicating that the system is awaiting a floppy disk to proceed. We might not be fully prepared for this stage yet, but the most crucial problem has been resolved. The only word that comes to mind is “bellissimo” ~ “beautiful” 13.

Which hard disk? Hard disk? Which hard disk? I’m sure that when asked, “How much memory do you need today?” you might immediately think of the capacity of your hard drive, SSD, or your general permanent storage device. Here’s an interesting fact: Apart from a small ROM for basic software, the Macintosh 128K has no permanent storage. Beyond its 128KB of RAM, there’s no additional internal memory capable of preserving data through a computer restart. This makes the floppy drive exceedingly important, as it’s essentially the only means not only for saving your work but also for simply loading the operating system to start a Macintosh. Floppy drive The 3.5-inch floppy drive featured in the Macintosh 128K was groundbreaking at the time. Apple was one of the pioneers in adopting this new format, which would later become the standard across the whole computer industry. Sony OA-D34V Floppy drive installed on every 128K Macintosh. Drive maintenance Removal and cleaning of solidified lubrication grease. Drive maintenance Relubrication of mechanical components with new grease. DIY Testing Manual disc ejection test. Hallelujah (spoiler) First successful boot of the operating system. Eject disk Disk ejection successful! The compact size and sturdy casing of the floppy disk not only protected its integrity and surface from accidental damage but also transformed it into an aesthetically pleasing object and a “perfect example of good design” 15. However, this initial version had its limitations. While the new standard by Sony already allowed for double-sided floppies with a formatted capacity of 720KB, the drive could only read and write on one side, effectively reducing its total capacity by half. Additionally, Apple introduced a unique hardware formatting standard that enabled saving up to 400KB on a single side, but this format was incompatible with any other systems 16. Maintenance Amidst the sea of uncertainties that come with restoring a retro computer, there’s one thing you can count on: your floppy drive will require maintenance. Distinct from the purely electronic components inside the machine, the drive is primarily made up of mechanical parts that are responsible for sliding, housing, and ejecting the disk. These elements require proper lubrication to function correctly, and there is nothing worse than a lubricating grease left to dry in an attic for 40 years, as it can completely obstruct their functionality. My Macintosh was no exception. The first floppy disk I attempted to insert struggled to even pass the entry threshold. Let’s get our hands dirty Once the Macintosh casing is opened, the disassembly of the floppy drive is almost immediate: just unscrewing a couple of screws releases the unit from its lower support, which also houses the motherboard. As expected, what is in front of us is a drive whose side guides are completely jammed by the now solidified 1984 lubricating grease. Despite the daunting appearance, restoring the mobility of all mechanical components was straightforward: Cleaning each joint of the solidified lubricating grease with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol 15 Reapplying fresh lubricating grease 16 Manually testing the mechanical sliding movement 17 Simple, right? Especially when you have access to a step-by-step video guide like the one JDW created on their YouTube channel. Now, all that’s left is to reassemble the computer, insert the boot floppy 18, and once again, cross our fingers...

Not old. Vintage. I must admit, this chapter was not originally part of my plan. For a while, I had considered my restoration project complete: All the damaged components were repaired. The computer was operational and usable. I had found the ideal furniture at Ikea to showcase and use the Macintosh, occupying minimal space in the house and thereby avoiding being kicked out by my wife. Additionally, I had just discovered the Floppy Emu, a floppy emulator that would enable me to explore all the software ever created for the Macintosh 128K without further financial strain. So, what more could I have asked for? Yes, it’s true, the casing was still somewhat dirty and had yellowed over time, but wasn’t this a perfect reflection of its history and the character of this iconic machine? For a while, I convinced myself of this romanticized view and thought it unnecessary to risk reopening and completely disassembling a Macintosh that had just begun working again, merely for cosmetic reasons. That was until my timeline started to be filled with articles and videos about retrobright, and a new doubt started to take root in my mind. Retrobright This mixture was developed by Dave Stevenson, an English chemist with a passion for retrocomputers 18. Its purpose is to restore the original color of ABS plastics 19, a material extensively used in the casings of various electronic devices over the past 50 years. Stevenson hypothesized that the yellowing was not due to the ABS itself, but rather to bromine, an element added to ABS for its flame-retardant properties. When exposed to UV rays from the sun, bromine naturally tends to revert to its original brown color, thereby causing the entire plastic to yellow 20.

Retrobright Gel coated on plastics and exposed to the sun. Disaster White spots and streaks on the surface. Disaster White spots and streaks on the surface. Retrobright #2 Let’s try to fix with controlled artificial light. The Retrobright formula was made public in 2008 and consists of a blend of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide (10%–15%), active oxygen, and thickeners to create a spreadable product. The outcome of this formula is a gel. When applied to plastics and exposed to UV rays, it is intended to return the oxygen molecule to the bromine, thereby it should reverse the yellowing process. I use the conditional tense because, since 2008, the community of enthusiasts has continuously experimented with and modified the compound, leading to the creation of numerous variations 21. Over the years, there have been documented instances of failures and long-term effects on plastics. These findings have raised questions about both the role of bromine and UV rays in the yellowing process, as well as the effectiveness and safety of the mixture and method itself 22. I confess that despite the wealth of information available for research, my complete lack of knowledge in chemistry, combined with the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, led me to overlook any potential risks or negative aspects. I wanted had to try! Everything under control For my experiment, I selected one of the brightest (and hottest) days of the year, considering the significance of UV rays in the process. Prior to starting, I removed any labels, logos, or tags that might get damaged 20. Each piece of plastic was thoroughly washed to eliminate any dirt or dust residue from the surface 21-22. I prepared about a liter of Retrobright and gradually transferred it to a basin for application on each plastic piece 23. To prevent the mixture from evaporating quickly under the sun, I followed several tutorial suggestions and covered each piece with a film 24. In hindsight, this was the first of many mistakes. After approximately 2 hours of exposure, I decided to check the results of this initial attempt, and that’s when I encountered my first major setback. Despite the film covering, the gel had almost entirely evaporated and had done so unevenly, following the creases of the film. The outcome was disheartening. The gel had only managed to lighten certain areas of the plastic, creating stains and streaks across all surfaces 25-26. Panic Following that setback, I embarked on a series of hasty attempts, hoping that another application might even out the coloration. Initially, I repeated the process without the film, refreshing the mixture every 20 minutes throughout an entire morning to prevent evaporation. Subsequently, I replicated the procedure in an environment with controlled UV light 27. In both instances, I managed only to lighten the different areas proportionally. The darker parts became lighter, but so did the already light areas, which further intensified and essentially preserved the initial streaks. Plan B It dawned on me that any further attempts would be futile, only serving to further degrade plastics already stressed by various treatments. This realization was followed by a few weeks of discouragement, during which I hesitantly returned to eBay to browse through auctions for exorbitantly priced spare parts. Eventually, I settled on the only viable option: painting the plastics. Interestingly, Apple had abandoned the practice of painting plastics with the introduction of the Macintosh. They believed that using ABS plastic already colored appropriately would prevent the natural variation in paint color when exposed to sunlight. Ironically, the opposite occurred: all the painted plastics from earlier models withstood the test of time much better 23. Plastic painting Professional back plastic painting. Plastic painting Professional plastic painting on the front, keyboard and mouse. Before yellowing state before retrobrighting and repainting. After Yellowing status after repainting. This time, thank God, I decided it was best to directly consult professionals. My sole task was to find the correct color reference 24. I entrusted the job to a local body shop specializing in plastic painting, and they executed the work with great precision and care 28-29. What can I say? The Macintosh had not only become “presentable” but had almost turned into a showpiece 31, and I had finally run out of ways to potentially compromise its safety again. The restoration could at last be considered complete. Just in time to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Mac!

    "originBody": "Computers and Networks computers and networks solution Unlocking the Duron and Athlon Using the Pencil Unlocking the Duron and Athlon Using the Pencil Introduction The best and most stable way to overclock your Athlon and Duron CPU is through changing the CPU clock multiplier. Overclocking can be done by changing the FSB (front side bus) of the motherboard, but the Athlon doesn't respond well to overclocking that particular way. To get your Athlon CPU ready to be overclocked requires a slight modification of the CPU called \"The Pencil Trick\". The Pencil Trick unlocks the full potential of your CPU. Overclocking the Intel series of CPUs is different than that of an Athlon, and was done mainly by tweaking the FSB of the CPU on the motherboard. FSB overclocking methods, such as running your 300A Celeron set to run at 450MHz by setting the FSB to 100MHz x 4.5 instead of the factory setting of 4.5 x 66MHz, were done very easily. This resulted in a stable overclocked CPU at 450MHz. If you tried overclocking your Athlon in such a way, your system would never POST because the Athlon is not designed like the Intel chip to be compatible at the higher frequencies of an increased FSB. The only drawback to this is that the potential for customers to be ripped of by untrustworthy dealers selling overclocked CPUs to the public at the price of the actual CPU speed is increased by a large margin. Intel long ago locked the multiplier of their CPUs to keep such things from happening with their processors. So with the Intel, chip adjustment of the FSB was the only available option for overclocking. The Athlon CPU is not designed to handle a high frequency FSB, but will allow you to reconnect the L1 bridges, allowing the processor to be set at any clock frequency, making overclocking an easy task. In the first releases of the Athlon/Duron motherboards you had to not only modify the processor, but you had to modify the motherboard to be able to adjust the Vcore and voltage settings to get a stable overclocked system. But manufacturers soon got the point and started to include those features on their motherboards, making the CPU the only modification you need to make. This works, and is very risk free. The room for error is not great, so even the not-so-mechanically-inclined can take on this task and be successful. I have always been against too much modification, because it can result in the loss of equipment. I wholeheartedly believe in this procedure, as the modification is very minimal and the chance of ruining your equipment is almost zero. Contents 1. Introduction 2. Setup 3. Step 1 4. Step 2 5. Step 3 6. Conclusion Setup You will need a very small-tip pencil, preferably a 0.5mm-type mechanical pencil such as the one made by Ritter, as the tool for this procedure. People think this is absolutely a crazy idea, but it actually works great, and is very easy to do. Lead will not burn at the frequencies running along it, so there is no fear of that happening, as is suggested by some. The L1 Bridges on The Athlon/Duron CPUs are the bridges that lock the multiplier. These bridges are cut off by laser at the factory to lock the CPU at a certain clock frequency, but can be reconnected by using the graphite of the pencil lead to conduct electricity across the bridge, effectively unlocking a locked processor. This is safe and relatively simple to do. Just take your time and follow a few simple procedures Step 1 Remove your processor from your system and find a well-lit and flat working area. Set your CPU on something that won't damage the pins of the processor. Locate the L1 bridges on the CPU and get your mechanical pencil ready for action. Both the Athlon and Duron processors have the same L1 connecting bridges and are done in the same way. Step 2 Hold your CPU in your left hand and look very closely at the CPU, so as to clearly see the L1 bridges. Use a business card to separate the bridges so that you do not connect the L1 bridges to each other. Work your way across the bridges from left to right (using a business card as a separation tool) and connect the bridges by rubbing the pencil back and forth over the bridges about twenty times until it is dark black, not the normal gold color. Make sure that all the bridges are reconnected, but not touching each other, and you are on your way. I know it sounds incredible, but that is actually all there is to it. Your processor, if done correctly, is ready to be overclocked. It can now be set to run at different clock frequencies, eliminating the need to increase the FSB. Step 3 Reinstall your processor back into your system. Make sure you use a good cooling solution, such as the Silver Orb by Thermaltake or an equivalent, as the CPU will need to have better cooling in an overclocked state. Use thermal grease if you have it, preferably a silver-based compound. You can see some good stuff at www.arcticsilver.com. It is messy, but it is very necessary when you are overclocking your CPU, as it makes a seal with the cooling solution for better heat dissipation. You may need to adjust the voltage in order to obtain a stable overclocked CPU. I had to increase the voltage by .05 percent, but then everything ran stable. I was able to run a 650MHz Duron at 800MHz and a 700MHz Athlon at 900MHz just by using a pencil and a few BIOS adjustments. This is a very easy task and can be done by just about anyone who has access to a pencil. I like the mechanical pencil, but a sharp There are many motherboards out currently on the market that support overclocking and have good features to insure you have a properly running, stable system. Conclusion This is the simplest and easiest way to modify a CPU that I have ever seen. You can gain a significant amount of increased processor power for the cost of about five cents of pencil lead. Those who are still reluctant, let me tell you I was too, until one day I just gave it a shot, and it was so simple I had to laugh at myself for waiting so long to try it. The Athlon and Duron Processors respond very well to this, and can be set to run at many different speeds with the right combination of settings. All I have to say in closure is take a chance. Grab your Athlon/Duron processor, get a pencil, and unlock that CPU of yours. Then you can get the most performance out of it.

Sorry for the tangent. There was a local retailer and warehouse that turned out to be ran by Russian mobsters (I didn’t know, I was a naive teen), but they had everything under the sun and the prices were (probably literally) a steal, although retail packaging was curiously rare. The guy behind the counter had a box full of loose 300As and let me pick my pair, and I went back and forth between home and the warehouse a couple of times until I had a stable pair. Seeing two of those things hit 450 stable with just a flip of a BIOS setting, for only $100something a piece felt like I had pulled the wool over the world’s eyes. That was my first SMP system, running NT4. Ended up hosting Starsiege: Tribes, Q3, and a bunch of other stuff (often simultaneously) at college. However, I dropped out after my first year and couldn’t host at home, so the machine was largely unused, and I sold it. I regret that. reply gigatexal 6 hours agoprevI was way into computers around this time. I remember the race to 1ghz. I remember the monumental change when AMD put the memory controller on die. Such awesome memories. I had durons, coppermines, slotted CPUs, dual Celerons hacked to work all sorts of fun. Heck I was around when you could take a 300A and set the multi to 4.5 and the fsb to 100mhz and get a 150% OC! My first PC was a Commodore 64, then my dad’s hand me down 486. What a beautiful time to be a nerd. 10k 9.1GB loud and hot SCSI drives. Such cool stuff back then reply yokoprime 3 hours agoparentI had a 300A@450MHz running for years. Those were great! reply rmellow 5 hours agoprevThis reminds me of the time XBox 360s were hacked by drilling the processor at a precise location, at a precise depth [1]. At some point, a tool was made to signal if you drilled far enough.

Sometimes I wonder how these sorts of exploits are discovered. It must take some serious in-depth knowledge of the target system and a lot of trial and error. reply theginger 8 hours agoprev> The only drawback to this is that the potential for customers to be ripped of by untrustworthy dealers selling overclocked CPUs to the public at the price of the actual CPU speed is increased by a large margin. Intel long ago locked the multiplier of their CPUs to keep such things from happening with their processors Is the author being charitable or do people really believe this was to protect consumers rather than constrain them? reply deaddodo 6 hours agoparentThe constraint was real, sure. But also, making lower binned/spec'd chips act like faster ones and then selling them for the same price, that was also something that happened. If someone paid $500, they should get the $500 chip, not a $220 made to work like the $500 one. So both things can be true. reply nebulous1 4 hours agorootparentLying about the chip (ie saying that it's a $500 intel chip when it's actually an overclocked $200 chip), is clearly unethical. That said the realities of chip binning make this weird, as you could also argue that it's unethical and wasteful to artificially lock down some hardware's potential. It's not only chips that suffer from this, like when BMW tried to apply a monthly subscriptions for using the heated seats that came with your car. reply deaddodo 1 hour agorootparentOr you can think of it in the opposite manner, they could just sell all of the $500 spec'd chips as $500 chips and miss out on an entire market of people that could use a lower spec'd chip at $200. But that's besides the point. If I'm buying a $500 chip, I want that chip. The one that passed, qualified and is guaranteed at that speed by the manufacturer. I don't want a $200 chip that you hacked to happen to be able to run at that speed. If you want to buy that $200 chip and hack it to run at $500 speeds go for it, there's nothing wrong with that. reply dagmx 3 hours agorootparentprevsaying that chip binning is unethical assumes the binning is truly for purely artificial reasons. What if the binning is genuinely because hardware is failing the required QC? Wouldn’t it be ethical to sell a unit that isn’t at risk of breaking/corrupting data etc and reusing the same units that have already been made? Binning is a pragmatic approach to reducing waste while providing products at different price points. reply justin66 1 hour agoparentprevI bought a counterfeit Athlon XP (one modded to look like a 3200+) and spent some time troubleshooting its problems before dealing with getting my money back (from my credit card company - the vendor has already disappeared). There are definitely some advantages for the consumer in making counterfeiting difficult. reply coobird 12 hours agoprevIIRC, the Athlon XP processors also had these contacts, but it required an additional step to fill a gap dug between the contacts with super glue. (Probably possible because previous processors used a ceramic package while the newer ones used organic plastic.) reply DeathArrow 7 hours agoprevIn Core 2 Duo days I overclocked the FSB of my E2160 Pentium CPU by 50%. This boosted the frequency from 1.8 to 2.7. These days I am happy I got my 14700K boost to 6200 MHz on single and dual core loads and to 5600Mhz P-cores and 4400 E-cores in multi-core loads. According to benchmarks this means about 10% performance gains. But it took me a week fiddling with BIOS settings and testing. reply kinow 3 hours agoprevI remember doing that back by the beginning of 2000s, unlocking one processor, and losing another identical one trying the same (guess I went too far ahead). I didn't work, and my father was not really happy to have to buy a new CPU because of some graphite (but he understood the curiosity!). reply SunlitCat 4 hours agoprevMaybe my memory is a bit hazy, but wasn't this already possible with the Athlon processors since ~2001? reply BearOso 4 hours agoparentYeah, the sub-1GHz Athlon and Durons were 1999, so this article is a little late. reply IndrekR 2 hours agorootparent1999 was first gen, Slot A based. Second generation (Thunderbird) Socket A based Athlons (and Durons) described here were released 2000. reply SunlitCat 1 hour agorootparentHah! Was it 2000 already! Got one in 2001 and I was so proud of my AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1400 that I even accepted that loud noise from the cooler I used. Although in hindsight, the money I spend for that luxury would have been better invested in other stuff, improving my life a bit more then a loud and noisy airplane turbine. reply bluedino 4 hours agoprevI remember doing this along with a co-worker, I think my Duron was $60 or $80? Saved me a ton of money vs a P3 and board.

I remember trying to find the exact right type numbers on online forums, to find the ones that could be overclocked the most. Never mind that I was about 13 and didn’t have the money to buy one but I could dream ;) reply smcl 8 hours agorootparentYeah I was only a couple of years older than you and barely had the money, hence the overclocking :D Tbh it was fun even to be on a forum talking about it and checking benchmarks etc, some guys had very cool watercooling setups that I was very envious of reply RamRodification 9 hours agoprevHere's a nice relaxing video that I like, of a guy soldering the pins instead, which is a lot of work but more reliable: https://youtu.be/Lkuf9hckV08 reply dangero 11 hours agoprevI thought mechanical pencils used graphite not lead reply new299 11 hours agoparentNo pencils use “lead”. It’s just called lead because the original material used looks similar to lead ore. See manufacturing section here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil reply bdcravens 11 hours agorootparentThe words we use are funny. I had a conversation with my wife yesterday explaining to her that \"gas\" (gasoline) wasn't a gas. (it can become one, but that's not where the name comes from) reply Wowfunhappy 4 hours agorootparentWell, but in this case they're just homonyms, like how the word \"bank\" can refer to the edge of a river or a financial institution. The gas in your car is short for \"gasoline\"; you wouldn't call oxygen a type of gasoline, it's a gas. reply lallysingh 4 hours agorootparentI think the original financial institutions were actually on the rivers to handle the business around river-transported cargo. reply a1369209993 1 hour agorootparentprevActually, \"bank\" isn't just homonyms; both senses derive from circa-Proto-Germanic benc/bank: a bench or other raised area (either a bank counter or the raised ground adjacent to a riverbed). (And yes, this etymology is also shared with \"bench\".) reply lukan 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd if you push the gas pedal, it does not mean more gasoline comes in, but more air (which then makes more gasoline comes in). And people fear, that soon too many of the undividable atoms will be divided. reply bdcravens 9 hours agorootparentI was watching a YouTube video the other day that called the accelerator the \"gas pedal\" - which makes sense, except it was a video about an EV. I wonder if that term will one day become disconnected from the original meaning, like \"hang up\" or the floppy save icon. reply Daneel_ 5 hours agorootparentMost of the other terms are global ones (hang up, save icon, etc), but gas pedal is pretty specific to the US as far as I know, so it’s much less likely to hang around like that. Here in Australia it’s the accelerator, or accelerator pedal. reply IndrekR 2 hours agorootparentEstonian word is “gaasipedaal”, which pretty much means “gas pedal”. Gasoline is “bensiin”, no relation to that. The word for pedal comes from accelerator regulating gas-mixture valve (throttle) in carburettor. “Gas-mixture” here is air mixed with atomised fuel. reply lukan 9 hours agorootparentprevAt least in german I saw EV cars described having a \"strom pedal\" (electricity/power pedal). More correct I guess, but also a bit odd. We will see, whether it will stick. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentIn Greek we call it \"γκάζι\", which means \"natural gas\", so it's already wrong. I'm fine with that persisting in EVs reply parpfish 5 hours agorootparentprevUnless it’s diesel, because there the accelerator causes more fuel to squirt in rather than opening the throttle body. But can do you call diesel gas? reply AnotherGoodName 3 hours agorootparentLikewise anything new. The idea that it allows more air in that then allows more fuel is true for carbureted based engines. But they don’t actually exist outside of lawnmowers/chainsaws anymore. Everything from the timing to fuel injection and air intake is computer controlled. reply garaetjjte 1 hour agorootparentFuel injected engines doesn't necessarily have electronically controlled throttle. And even when they do, injection amount isn't derived directly from pedal position. What's important is amount of air sucked into the cylinder, which is calculated from manifold air pressure or mass air flow sensor readings. reply parpfish 2 hours agorootparentprevReally? My new-ish car (2019) just has the pedal connected to the throttle body with a cable. I’d assume that other changes to fuel injection would happen because it sensed more air coming in reply pfortuny 5 hours agorootparentprevWe do in Spain (“voy a echar gasolina” is both used for diesel and gasoline)… reply parpfish 5 hours agorootparentIn the US it’s context dependent. If you’re running low on diesel you’d say “I need to get some gas” and you’d get it from a gas station But if you’re talking about tractors saying that something has a “gas engine” specifically means it is not diesel reply NotYourLawyer 3 hours agoparentprevGraphite is pretty conductive too. reply Twirrim 13 hours agoprev2007! I forgot about the pencil trick, but never had a relevant generation of AMD chip to do that to. reply elric 11 hours agoparentI did the overclocking and overvolting thing (with a pencil) for a bit, but then I became obsessed with silent computers and went the other way: undervolting. Trying to keep it running at the lowest possible voltage without reducing the clock speed too much. Those were fun experiments. Could do passive air cooling when the overclockers were getting into water cooling. Aside from undervolting to reduce cooling needs and thus fan noise, suspending disks on sturby rubber bands greatly reduced vibration noises, same with mounting fans with plastic plugs instead of metal screws. Getting bigger, slower fans also helped a lot. PCs now tend to be pretty quiet these days, but loud fans and rattling still bug me from time to time. reply Aeolos 6 minutes agorootparentWord for word the same here. I remember spending hours and hours in the silentpcreview forums looking for the latest and greatest in silent fan technology. reply Daneel_ 5 hours agorootparentprevI split the difference. I went with an overkill watercooling set up with quietness in mind, just so I could have nearly-passive cooling at high clock speeds. I’m currently using 2x 360x360mm radiators stacked together, with 4x 180mm 300rpm fans. It’s virtually silent yet keeps my CPU and GPU quite cool, even when gaming. reply dainiusse 13 hours agoparentprevI did that with duron 600->900mhz, but it was so long ago that I don't remember exact date reply AnotherGoodName 3 hours agorootparentSure you didn’t just flip the 100->133mhz fsb setting in the motherboard? The low end durons didn’t really need the multiplier changed as they had a 100mhz fsb when the athlon 1000 had a 133mhz fsb and used the same motherboards. You could just flip the bios setting and get that exact stated overlock without the pencil trick. reply timschmidt 13 hours agorootparentprevMy Duron 600 ran Windows 98 SE at 950mhz, on an Abit motherboard. What ever happened to Abit? Miss those mad geniuses. reply teruakohatu 13 hours agorootparentThey had financial problems and a class action lawsuit against them in early 2000s. The company was sold and then eventually shutdown or folded into the parent. reply spockz 12 hours agorootparentprevThose were the times. Unlocking a lot more performance just by tweaking. These days everything is locked down. I suppose this is more efficient. The last time in felt the same awe, although not by my own handiwork, was when I moved to an M1 MacBook and when I installed Fedora on my desktop. Everything was so fast and silent. Really amazing. reply Panzer04 8 hours agorootparentMore like these days everything is already clocked hard by default. There's basically no point overclocking modern unlocked chips, they are already clocked to 90% of their max speed. Compare that to the above example with 600 vs 900 Mhz (50%! faster) Some locked chips are clocked pretty slow, but that's normal segmentation :( reply timschmidt 12 hours agorootparentprevI feel like a lot of the tweaking features popularized by Abit are now available on any \"gamer\" board from one of the major manufacturers, Intel and AMD now even make chipsets targeted at that segment, and there are a lot more bins for CPUs these days, most of which come \"pre-overclocked\" even dynamically so with turbo-boost and the like. The Athlons and Durons of this era had exposed dies, just a few SKUs, no built-in thermal throttling or speed boosting at all, and oversized high-cfm heatsinks and fans felt like a new thing. reply jtwaleson 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat made them mad geniuses? I saw their equipment from time to time in catalogs but was too young to realize they had some kind of special reputation. reply timschmidt 1 hour agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABIT_BP6 is a great example. It was the first motherboard to allow the use of two unmodified Intel Celeron processors in dual Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration. Not only did this cost drastically less than purchasing two CPUs certified for SMP from Intel at the time, Celerons of the era were the first Intel chips with on-chip L2 cache which was clocked at the full speed of the CPU as opposed to the off-chip L2 cache's half-CPU clock on the Pentium II. Abit was also one of the first companies to include jumperless overclocking features in the BIOS. If you look close, you can even see the blue thermal sensors Abit placed in the center of the CPU sockets (CPUs had no built-in thermal sensor at the time) which greatly eased overclocking. In short, they made boards that gave you the full range of what was possible, not just what was on the marketing sheet for the CPU. reply sedatk 11 hours agorootparentprevI had tried that with Duron 600 but couldn’t overclock it. I don’t remember what went wrong. Maybe the motherboard didn’t support it. reply AnotherGoodName 3 hours agorootparentThe best way to overclock the lower clocked durons was simply to change the fsb in the bios settings. You didn’t really need the pencil trick as they had 100mhz fsbs in an era where 133 was more common. reply xorl 13 hours agorootparentprevSame! Dad and I did this a few times, got around having to upgrade to get more performance when we could still get much more out of the current system. reply kristopolous 9 hours agoparentprevI've probably still got one I should throw away.

Back then I used this trick and paired it with an non-laser-locked modded Geforce 6800 AGP card for some gaming.

These employees analyze new markets and discern trends, both tasks a computer could do more efficiently. They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions — and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine? Finally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable. The chief executive is increasingly imperiled by A.I., just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites. This is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an A.I. leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise. A.I. has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put MSNlt;/a>29 billion last year into generative A.I. and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership. “In struggling companies, you’ll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,” said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, “the change delivered by A.I. in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.” Chief executives themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect — or maybe just fatalistic. EdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc., surveyed hundreds of chief executives and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called “a small monetary incentive” to do so. The response was striking. Nearly half — 47 percent — of the executives surveyed said they believed “most” or “all” of the chief executive role should be completely automated or replaced by A.I. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age. When Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of M.I.T.’s Computer Science and A.I. Lab, first saw the 47 percent, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely. “My first instinct is they would say, ‘Replace all the employees but not me,’” he said. “But I thought more deeply and would say 80 percent of the work that a C.E.O. does can be replaced by A.I.” That includes writing, synthesizing, exhorting the employees. More subtly, A.I. — if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising — will democratize the job of top management even while scaling it back. “There used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,” Mr. Agarwal said. “Then the calculator came along and was the great equalizer. I believe A.I. will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be C.E.O.” Working for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase “robot-boss” was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support. “Remember,” the robot-boss says, “my photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don’t try to get away.” Many science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42 percent said they would be “comfortable” taking orders from a computer. Long before the current A.I. boom, Jack Ma, then the chief executive of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years “a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best C.E.O.” He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger. The Chinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an “A.I.-driven rotating C.E.O.” named Tang Yu in 2022. “We believe A.I. is the future of corporate management,” said the company’s founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon’s move into the “metaverse-based working community.” Tang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon’s management team, but the company announced last month that she had won “the coveted title of ‘China’s Best Virtual Employee of the Year’” at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon’s A.I. employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says. On the other side of the world, the upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an A.I. humanoid C.E.O., Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was “devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization’s best interests.” Executives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend — if only to deny it — but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a “contact us” prompt received no reply. A.I. experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression. “We’ve always outsourced effort. Now we’re outsourcing intelligence,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global A.I. practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that “while you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership.” For one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. “A.I. may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,” said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. “At what point does it become culpable for a mistake?” “Never” was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline’s site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives — including a chatbot. The judge ruled against the airline and in favor of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company’s arguing that its own A.I. could not be trusted did not bode well for A.I. management teams. Air Canada declined to comment. Much of the discussion over the last year about A.I. in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs — without, of course, letting their jobs become A.I. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers. Now the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers. “Someone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,” said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. “In that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.” The pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It’s just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn’t have a person at the other end of it. “Some people like the social aspects of having a human boss,” Ms. Moore said. “But after Covid, many are also fine with not having one.”\" }window.isSSREnabled=true;window.markTTSR=function

programs shake up the office, potentially making millions of jobs obsolete, one group of perpetually stressed workers seems especially vulnerable. These employees analyze new markets and discern trends, both tasks a computer could do more efficiently. They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions — and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine? Finally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable. The chief executive is increasingly imperiled by A.I., just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites. This is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an A.I. leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise. A.I. has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put $29 billion last year into generative A.I. and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership. “In struggling companies, you’ll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,” said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, “the change delivered by A.I. in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.” Chief executives themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect — or maybe just fatalistic. EdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc., surveyed hundreds of chief executives and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called “a small monetary incentive” to do so. The response was striking. Nearly half — 47 percent — of the executives surveyed said they believed “most” or “all” of the chief executive role should be completely automated or replaced by A.I. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age. When Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of M.I.T.’s Computer Science and A.I. Lab, first saw the 47 percent, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely. “My first instinct is they would say, ‘Replace all the employees but not me,’” he said. “But I thought more deeply and would say 80 percent of the work that a C.E.O. does can be replaced by A.I.” That includes writing, synthesizing, exhorting the employees. More subtly, A.I. — if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising — will democratize the job of top management even while scaling it back. “There used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,” Mr. Agarwal said. “Then the calculator came along and was the great equalizer. I believe A.I. will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be C.E.O.” Working for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase “robot-boss” was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support. “Remember,” the robot-boss says, “my photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don’t try to get away.” Many science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42 percent said they would be “comfortable” taking orders from a computer. Long before the current A.I. boom, Jack Ma, then the chief executive of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years “a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best C.E.O.” He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger. The Chinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an “A.I.-driven rotating C.E.O.” named Tang Yu in 2022. “We believe A.I. is the future of corporate management,” said the company’s founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon’s move into the “metaverse-based working community.” Tang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon’s management team, but the company announced last month that she had won “the coveted title of ‘China’s Best Virtual Employee of the Year’” at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon’s A.I. employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says. On the other side of the world, the upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an A.I. humanoid C.E.O., Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was “devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization’s best interests.” Executives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend — if only to deny it — but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a “contact us” prompt received no reply. A.I. experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression. “We’ve always outsourced effort. Now we’re outsourcing intelligence,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global A.I. practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that “while you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership.” For one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. “A.I. may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,” said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. “At what point does it become culpable for a mistake?” “Never” was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline’s site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives — including a chatbot. The judge ruled against the airline and in favor of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company’s arguing that its own A.I. could not be trusted did not bode well for A.I. management teams. Air Canada declined to comment. Much of the discussion over the last year about A.I. in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs — without, of course, letting their jobs become A.I. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers. Now the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers. “Someone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,” said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. “In that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.” The pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It’s just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn’t have a person at the other end of it. “Some people like the social aspects of having a human boss,” Ms. Moore said. “But after Covid, many are also fine with not having one.” :host{background-color:var(--fill-color);color:var(--neutral-foreground-rest)}.article-image-container{position:relative;margin:20px 0 36px 0;width:100%;height:100%}.article-image-height-wrapper{width:inherit;display:block;object-fit:cover}.article-image-height-wrapper-new{width:inherit;display:block;position:relative;overflow:hidden;border-radius:6px}.article-image{width:inherit;border-radius:6px 6px 0px 0px}.article-image-new{position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:50%;transform:translateX(-50%);vertical-align:middle;object-fit:contain;width:auto !important;max-width:100%;border-radius:0px !important}.article-image.clickable{width:inherit;cursor:pointer}.image-attribution{padding-bottom:4px;opacity:65%}.image-caption{font-weight:normal}.image-caption *{all:unset}.image-caption-container{display:flex;font-size:12px;line-height:16px;padding:12px 16px 8px 24px;flex-flow:column}.articlewc-image-caption-container:{margin-top:0px}.article-image-container.image-small{width:270px}.article-image-container:first-child{margin-top:0}.image-caption-container:before{position:absolute;display:inline-block;height:11px;width:11px;border-left:1px solid #0078D4;border-bottom:1px solid #0078D4;left:-1px;content:\"\"}.articlewc-image-caption-container:before{left:0px}.image-caption-container.image-webtoon{display:none}.article-image-container.image-webtoon{margin:0px}.article-image.article-image-ux-impr{border-radius:6px;background:#F2F2F2}.article-sub-heading{font-family:'Eb Garamond' font-size:30px;font-weight:500;margin-top:48px;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:38px;position:relative}.article-sub-heading::before{content:'';position:absolute;width:48px;height:4px;left:0;right:0;top:-14px;background:var(--accent-fill-rest)}.image-webtoon .article-image{border-radius:0px;display:block}.image-webtoon .article-image-height-wrapper-new{margin-bottom:unset;border-radius:unset}.in-table.image-webtoon .article-image-new{position:relative;margin-top:5px} @keyframes zoom-in{from{left:var(--initial-x);top:var(--initial-y);transform:unset;-webkit-transform:unset;-moz-transform:unset}to{left:var(--final-x);top:var(--final-y);transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio));-webkit-transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio));-moz-transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio))}}@keyframes zoom-out{from{position:fixed;left:var(--final-x);top:var(--final-y);z-index:1000;transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio));-webkit-transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio));-moz-transform:scale(var(--scale-ratio))}to{position:fixed;left:var(--initial-x);top:var(--initial-y);z-index:1000;transform:unset;-webkit-transform:unset;-moz-transform:unset}}.image-fullscreen-overlay{position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100vw;height:100vh;z-index:1000;scroll-behavior:smooth;background:rgba(255,255,255,0.8);backdrop-filter:blur(25px);-webkit-backdrop-filter:blur(25px)}.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable{cursor:zoom-in}.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{cursor:zoom-out}.article-image.expandable{transform-origin:0 0;-webkit-transform-origin:0 0}.article-image.expandable.fullscreen{position:fixed;max-width:100%;background:transparent;z-index:1000;animation:300ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.25,1) zoom-in forwards;-webkit-animation:300ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.25,1) zoom-in forwards;-moz-animation:300ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.25,1) zoom-in forwards;width:var(--initial-width) !important;border-radius:6px !important}.article-image.expandable.close-fullscreen{animation:200ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.2,1) zoom-out;-webkit-animation:200ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.2,1) zoom-out;-moz-animation:200ms cubic-bezier(0.5,0,0.2,1) zoom-out;width:var(--initial-width) !important}@media (max-width: -1px){.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{max-width:NaNpx}}@media (min-width: 1304px){.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{max-width:1304px}}@media (min-width: 980px) and (max-width: 1303px){.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{max-width:980px}}@media (min-width: 656px) and (max-width: 979px){.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{max-width:656px}}@media (max-width: 655px){.article-image-height-wrapper.expandable.fullscreen{max-width:0px}} @media (max-width: 655px){.article-image{border-radius:6px;background:#F2F2F2}.article-image-container{margin:16px 0px}} .article-image-container.image-small{float:left;margin-right:24px}If A.I.

The amount of business advice GPT-4 has given me is immeasurable. I'd say I'm getting 10x more non technical business advice in multiple areas than I'm getting with the technical stuff. Kind of like an AI CEO advising me on what to do next. reply Jensson 5 hours agoparent> I'd say I'm getting 10x more non technical business advice in multiple areas than I'm getting with the technical stuff. Probably in large part because you can't verify when its wrong since that isn't your area of expertise, so those advice looks better to you. You should assume your org will be the same quality as a program written by a non-technical person using an LLM if you do it that way. reply tossandthrow 5 hours agorootparentI was speaking to a fellow software engineer the other day. She has a tech lead on their team. She reports that he is really nice, but some times he is insisting that he knows the working of some part of the system and is giving advice based on his understanding. Only thing is that he is wrong. The software engineer needs to \"de-hallucinate\" him in order to get a proper answer. I think we are at a time where we need not to categorically be critical about these things. Yes, preciseness is an issue. But there is a good chance that the LLM advice is on par with a random dude from a local accelerator. reply oxfordmale 3 hours agorootparentThe current generation of ChatGPT hallucinates far more systematically than that. The problem is that it can regurgitate what the random dudes from local accelerators have written in their blog posts. We all know blog posts are often a sales pitch and don't include useful advice, because you can charge for the useful advice you give. reply tossandthrow 3 hours agorootparent> The problem is that it can regurgitate what the random dudes from local accelerators have written in their blog posts. This is not how modern training pipelines work. The models are trained on proprietary alignments that ensure factuality. Regardless, that random dude from a local accelerator probably regurgitates those blog articles himself. reply shmel 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's a good point, but I think it's important to critically analyze any information you find online. Anything I read online might be bullshit, and yet I've learned a lot from internet. And many other people have as well. I personally see ChatGPT as a better and faster search engine. If I need something basic, it's often on point and almost instant. If I need intricate advanced details about a niche topic, yes, it can be wrong. So are other people. While I lack expertise outside of my main areas to verify it, I usually have enough to judge whether it's a basic knowledge for experts in this area. At very least, ChatGPT doesn't intentionally try to mislead me to sell me something (yet). reply greg_V 4 hours agorootparentprevI had the \"pleasure\" of working for someone who would take the AI's word over mine in my domain of expertise. It was a hair-ripping experience to say the least and I'm while I'm not there anymore, from what I can see they hadn't improved in that area by an inch... reply williamcotton 5 hours agorootparentprevBusiness ideas can be tested so this epistemic haze isn’t as much of an issue as you’re making it out to be especially when error rates are taken into consideration. I have a friend who has business experience and has been getting verifiably helpful marketing advice from LLMs. Sales are up. That’s all that matters for any set of instructions: does it lead to the expected end result. These “do LLMs always hallucinate” questions are in the category of “do humans have a soul”. This is fine and dandy but the conversation doesn’t always need to go there as there is practical utility to discuss as well. reply goshx 5 hours agorootparentprevThe same can be said for a human CEO. reply latexr 5 hours agorootparentprev> Probably in large part because you can't verify when its wrong since that isn't your area of expertise, so those advice looks better to you.

Whenever I ask an LLM about a topic I’m knowledgeable about, I can detect that it spews a load of nonsense. Talking to people in other fields, e.g., history and literature, they say it’s the same for them. LLMs are only useful if you know the topic you’re asking questions about. Otherwise, they generate so much nonsense that you cannot verify, that trusting it becomes a liability. reply sebzim4500 5 hours agorootparentDepends what the topic is. IME it hallucines rarely when asked practical programming questions but basically constantly when asked math questions beyond basic calculus. reply TheNewsIsHere 5 hours agorootparentThe more abstract or nuanced something is, the less capable it seems to be unless you have a domain specific LLM trained on a corpus of quality data. As a business owner with both applied experience and formal education on both the tech and the business sides, I wouldn’t trust random LLM-generated advice on business. There are nuances and a certain humanity in good business that an LLM is unlikely to pick up. And the Internet is filled with horrible advice and useless insight on running a business that it can’t distinguish from good advice and valuable insight. My advice to anyone seriously considering a business is that a course or reading a good survey text on business will pay off in ways that ChatGPT can’t (yet?) give you. reply mirsadm 5 hours agorootparentprevIt constantly invents functions that don't exist. reply timnetworks 5 hours agorootparentDeal with it like Wolfram, implement those functions! It's picking up on something. :D reply idopmstuff 5 hours agorootparentprev> LLMs are only useful if you know the topic you’re asking questions about. Not true, and you're missing a key point for the topic at hand. LLMs are useful if you know the topic OR if you have measurable outcomes. If you want to increase sales, and you ask an LLM how to increase sales, you will know if its ideas work if they result in increased sales. Think of it like AlphaGo - it learned to play Go by playing with an AI despite having no knowledge of Go strategy, because it could determine what was effective based on outcomes. reply mstolpm 3 hours agorootparentBut I would only know about the result for my sales in some weeks or months. I have to trust the LLM in the meantime - and your example implies that the LLM answer could be proven wrong. How is that different from asking a complete stranger about better sales strategies for my business? Or even throw a dice? reply beryilma 5 hours agorootparentprevThis seems like a good example of Gell-Mann amnesia as it applies to LLMs instead of journalism. People are falling into the same trap of accepting authoritative sounding advice as true in an area they are not experts in. reply lelag 5 hours agoparentprevThe way I see the current crop of AI is that it has mastery of language and a very wide set of knowledge on many different areas but no deep understanding. Ask it about anything you are not very familiar with, and you will get something that looks like a really good answer. Yet, as soon as you try to poke it around subjects you do master, you quickly see its limits and shortcomings. A few months ago, I tested its knowledge on precision machining, and not knowing much about the subject, I got what felt like really solid advice: I felt like it knew everything. Yet, when I reviewed what it told me with my dad, who used to work in the industry, he was not impressed: the answers were missing important bits of information or were sometimes plain wrong. I do feel the current crop of AI is a game changer, but unless there is another breakthrough increasing its reasoning capabilities, I don't think human experts are at risk of losing their jobs anytime soon. The current crop is disrupting occupations that deal purely with language: copywriters, translators... Software engineers are probably very safe, but I believe that language specialists whose main skill is to deeply know a software stack will soon be hurting. I predict that software architecture and computer science skills mastery will become much more valuable than knowing a computer language syntax and associated API in depth. The AI will always be better than you at syntax now. The place I see transformer-based models changing everything is human-computer interaction: voice and multimodality will soon become the main way humans interact with computers rather than mouse and keyboard, and this is huge. However, I don't believe any GenAI model will be up to the task of running a company anytime soon, and I think that advice from a real CEO might prove immensely more useful than whatever GPT-4 is telling you. GPT-4 is probably telling you the obvious—things you could have read on blog spam sites by googling your question. An experienced CEO would probably have unobvious and valuable insights that I don't believe you can get from ChatGPT at the moment. reply thih9 5 hours agoparentprevCan you give a specific example? I’m curious if it was useful because of the AI’s skills, or perhaps it was the conversation itself that helped, like in rubber duck debugging[1] or journaling. In any case, interested to hear more details. [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging reply shmel 5 hours agorootparentI find ChatGPT incredibly useful to learn the vocabulary of an unfamiliar area. Often basic information in the area I know very little about can be found easily once you know the right keywords. Even if ChatGPT gets something wrong, it does pattern matching well enough to tell me something like \"yes, there is a well-known concept that matches your vague noob description, it is called X\". It works well in CS where I have an intuition there must be a mathematical abstraction/algorithm that solves my problem, but I don't know the name. Once I learn the keywords, I sometimes find an open-source library for that or at least a high-level description of the algorithm. It is also great at answering stupid questions. Sometimes I read a wikipedia article and don't understand enough to make sense of it. If I was in uni, I would have asked a prof: \"Sorry, it is probably a very stupid question, but why X? and what is Y actually?\" ChatGPT can give me ELI5 at pretty much anything and is faster than googling. reply thih9 4 hours agorootparentThat is CS though; I’m not sure that would work with business advice, where problems can be less tangible or there can be no single or verifiable solution (nor library/algorithm). Unless this approach also helps in the context of business advice? reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 2 hours agorootparentThey're not necessarily good for advice, but you need a decent amount of business knowledge to run even a small business, and LLMs can help with all the noob questions you'll have if you're starting a company and never went to business school. \"What's the difference between amortization and depreciation?\" types of things. You could Google them, but you have to waste time skimming through a couple blogspam articles, but LLMs can explain the concept in an easy to digest way much faster. reply thih9 2 hours agorootparentAre you using LLMs yourself like this in this context? reply shmel 4 hours agorootparentprevI've never used it for business advice. But it is still useful to learn expert jargon if you want to find relevant discussions. For example, I use it to learn about DJing recently and yes, often it answers \"it depends on your personal taste and the party you are playing, you can choose to do X, Y, Z, etc\". Then I know that there is no right answer. ChatGPT learned to handle such multimodality to an extent, often it doesn't want to answer \"just do X\" in these situations even if I push it. Sometimes it gets a lot more precise if I give more context, like - How to compose a mix? What parts of the tracks should I play and what should I skip? - It depends on lots of factors . There is no one size fits all answer. - Ok, suppose I am playing an early morning set of melodic techno at a houseparty for friends. What would you suggest? - Then your friends will probably be tired by the morning so it makes sense to insert more breakdowns, melodic techno is usually structured this way, hence blah blah blah. Or you can ask for examples. I often struggle with distinguishing closely related EDM subgenres: - Can you explain the difference between psybass and psybreaks? -- I still don't get it. Can you give me 5 iconic tracks in both? - Sure thing, here is the list:Besides, there are open research problems in CS as well where there is no single solution. Then I learn the vocabulary and google recent papers on this subject. I think fundamentally we have a lot more information available than a single person can ever handle. I find ChatGPT incredibly useful at navigating and summarizing this sea of information. reply antihero 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen learning a new thing it’s very good for compiling knowledge from lots of sources and laying it out in a good format. As long as it’s easy to verify when it screws up. reply coldtea 5 hours agoparentprev>Kind of like an AI CEO advising me on what to do next.

Why do you think it is anti-curiosity to use LLMs? The original commenter did not say they used it for producing content, so and auto complete is not really precise, is it? You could say that it is an advanced, stochastic knowledge-retrieval system. Does the workings of such merit your curiosity? Does the workings of compression algorithms merit your curiosity? Or are you merely and ignorant person already left behind due to your own inability to be curious? reply coldtea 4 hours agorootparent>Why do you think it is anti-curiosity to use LLMs? \"Don't need to study and trial/error to learn about business, I can get business advice in a box\". It's Stack Overflow copy-pasting MkII. reply tossandthrow 4 hours agorootparentThis reads like a comment from a person who has not tried to integrate LLMs into various workflows.

Your sentiment is that this is stack overflow c/p style business development. I understand this as: You receive instructions from a third party entity and carry them out verbatim. An because that to use a LLM that is anti-curiosity. Let's delve into that, shall we? 1. Following instructions verbatim is as old as instructions. You could apply the same sentiment to mentorship, books, and well, Q/A systems. Just to inspire some reflection: Do you think good chefs ever use recipes or is that only bad chefs? It is quite well established that following instructions is key to learning. 2. You say that it is equivalent to follow instructions from an LLM to following instructions from SO - I think this misses a key feature of LLMs: The ability to index them. You can tell them they are care about business development in a narrow sense, to what it is index all future responses. This is realtime interactive and does probe behavior like changing what you index your instructions for, which indeed is the core of curiosity. Based on this I hold on to my previous statement as a response yo your comment: > Curiosity is about not being categorical - \"It's Stack Overflow copy-pasting MkII.\" is extremely categorical and thus, anti-curiosity.

Since this is HackerNews, let's follow through the logic -- if the AI you're running is the CEO, who are you? You're the owner / shareholder / (board if you want to be). This wave of AI is like giving a superpower to people who can direct/imagine/realize what they want, describe it, and (for now) glue together the output of the AI. A lot of the work is ongoing this year in the glue phase, thought of as 'actions' or 'copilot'ing. We'll have a core directable glued-together stack that can take instruction like \"make me a shopify site to sell cute mini traffic cones that are oscar-the-grouch themed, but make sure they don't violate any copyright themes, make me 100 ads to sell them\" by the end of 2024. Who is the CEO of the shopify site? Well, if it could be AI, that would be great by me -- who wants to read ad effectiveness reports? Not me. Who wants to tell the CEO if their recommendation to scale up sounds good? I don't mind. Additionally, I think it's good to remember that among the people most threatened by this future, it's those who write for a living. Journalists, script writers and lawyers, essentially. The visual arts community is a close second. Programmers have nearly infinite demand for their software skills; I'm someone who believes software demand will continue to go up for a loonnng time as costs decline. So, journalists are likely to have a sort of internal dis-ease that is really high about where we are in the tech cycle. Nothing wrong with that, but it's sensible to moderate/think \"is their dis-ease reasonable for me to have also?\" Hackers have got like a super-powered computing tool FROM THE FUTURE in the last year.

You need relationships with manufacturers to do that 2. You need to validate the physical results prior to a full run 3.

They’ll eventually do images, with text, hopefully both actually relate and make sense. I’d give that 2 years really to refine. They’re really good predictors, but when you start mixing things and gluing 4-5 things together, the error rate grows exponentially and the understanding equally had a massive drop. reply vessenes 5 hours agorootparentI think you're very wrong about this timeline. 1. I've never sourced hardware, so I can't comment directly on manufacturers. I have done plenty of business in Asia, and, I have purchased from alibaba. One side of those alibaba transactions is definitely using AI translation already. I don't think manufacturers in Asia will care at all \"who\" is sourcing product from them. For speccing a car - sure, you're right that a relationship is needed (and probably will involve doing some drinking near the factory). For speccing injection mold / printable goods? I'm skeptical that this is cut and dried in favor of humans with IRL relationships. 2. Trivially done by an AI; \"Mr. Bossman do you want to validate this sample, or have me hire someone to do it?\" 3. This is demonstrably untrue; OpenAI disagrees with you about this, for instance. ChatGPT pre-instructions include multiple paragraphs about this topic already. (here's a link to info about it if you're curious: https://x.com/krishnanrohit/status/1755122786014724125/photo...) Generative AI that can spell correctly is here now, although not widely commercially deployed, but is in no way needed to AI CEO things. My experience as the 'gluer' is that the most recent visual/multimodel models are good enough to, say, fix a CSS bug in HTML they wrote by looking at a screenshot of the output. So, I'd say the opposite is true in my experience -- with multimodal feedback, they are able to self correct. Anyway, to me this doesn't add up to 2030. Maybe for the snazzy mac app version.

Lt CEO: reply TheNewsIsHere 3 hours agoprevThere is an element of longevity and forethought to being a good CEO, that I don’t see AI being focused on. Beyond the lack of actual human cognition, no accountability, and prospect for compromise/poisoning, an AI that emulates a good CEO would need to make judgement calls that generative AI and LLMs just aren’t designed for. Businesses that endure are comfortable saying no to deals/business/revenue sometimes, or making decisions that result in short term losses for long term gains. Choices that may contradict what the data right now would tell you to do. The prototypical ideal of an entrepreneur often includes some amount of “taking it on faith” — being comfortable taking a leap when you need to. That is not something an AI can do. Many people seem to want AI to replace executives but every time I hear reasons why, those reasons are all centered on executives doing their job either poorly or for making unpopular decisions, often both. Of course this is common; it’s effectively a trope at this point. I am not sure we should sacrifice human leadership of business because some leaders are bad. We should instead focus on variously being, fostering, or advocating for better leaders. reply dasil003 3 hours agoprevWow, this is some ultimate clickbait, combining peak AI hype with timely economic concerns as well as the evergreen hatred of bad bosses. The fact that articles like this get traction is ironically exactly why an AI can’t be a good CEO—picking a popular next token is worthless if not backed by some reasoning and organizational structure to benefit the business. It’s a trope that CEOs are out of touch with the ground reality faced by the rank and file, but what’s less obvious is that the majority is also pretty ignorant about the inner workings of executive leadership. There’s just not enough data there to train an AI as everything written down is very carefully wordsmithed, and depends on context from thousands of private conversations, many of them full of controversial and contradictory points. The things an AI would emit based on this input would cause open rebellion and shareholder lawsuits in a heart beat. reply djohnston 2 hours agoparent> but what’s less obvious is that the majority is also pretty ignorant about the inner workings of executive leadership. Idk, I tend to think that people in positions of leadership overestimate their competence and ability to actually effect positive change in an organisation. They're kind of a monkey in the cockpit that we get to point at and say \"Because of the monkey we are now doing x, y, z\", but whether that monkey is a primate or a probability distribution seems irrelevant. We just watched the entire tech industry trend-follow and overhire, then layoff the overhires without any accountability as to how it happened, and you're positing there's some intangible skill here that a probability distribution can't replicate? Doubt. Tl;dr - I think executive leadership is careening towards a reckoning that even its entrenched cronyism will be unable to avert. It will take one automated COO or CEO and the whole MBA house of cards will come tumbling down. Real domain expert CEOs will always be around, but the MBA plant will go the way of the support agent. reply ein0p 4 hours agoprevIn my experience, LLMs are mostly useful if you already have expertise either directly in the field you’re asking about or in adjacent fileds. They’re also useful in fields which you are exploring so as long as your exploration does not need 100% reliability of information, which most domains do not. As far as business is concerned, however, there’s so much obscure regulation and (in VC) so many opportunities for others to take advantage of your ignorance, that you do really benefit a lot from having people who have been there and done that, and got screwed in the pooper a few times. LLMs aren’t that, at least not yet.

Do CEOs matter? Startup CEOs certainly do, they're actually doing something that involves work. But do CEOs of more mature companies matter? Arguably not, since they commonly do more harm than good.

Although we variously like to beat up on shitty CEOs around here (rightfully so), a corporate officer of any title requires an ability for cognition, reflection, and abstraction that an AI does not possess. That might be a bit of a technical argument in a way, but at the end of the day AI doesn’t change the fact that you can’t hold a computer responsible. It’s a machine. reply datavirtue 3 hours agoparentprevYou can have an AI make a decision alongside the CEOs and see which one is right. It's science. reply imgabe 5 hours agoprevThen do it.

Actually, the primary job of a CEO is to take decisions with whatever information they have at their disposal. The decision may not always be right, but s/he should be able to make it within a certain timeframe.

A CEO is the head of sales for the company’s stock if it’s that kind of company. He or she also tends to do a lot of recruiting or at least oversee that process a lot. AI could replace some of the decision making and optimization for revenue, etc. but I’d see CEOs using it rather than being replaced. Of course that will be the case for most jobs. AI will only replace jobs that are nothing but generating low to mid level content and/or making very uncreative decisions whose answers can be found latent in existing training data. reply datavirtue 3 hours agoparentprevIt's the \"information\" part I'm worried about.

All you need is algorithmic financial engineering to ensure cashflow, unless I am out of touch and don’t understand what a CFO doe, which is possible. reply TheNewsIsHere 4 hours agoparentThe role of CFO isn’t about just the spreadsheets. In large organizations most of that analysis and reporting flows across or up to the CFO, which is in large part a fiducial and leadership function. Of course a CFO does analyze and sign off on statements and reports. They know the numbers of a business even if they can’t tell you off the top of their heads how much R&D is paying for Buildkite. They’re also usually a human-in-the-loop to authorize transactions large enough to be C-level and require two signatures. A good CFO is very concerned and experienced in the nuance of business that isn’t captured in algorithms or databases. They are able to run a team that can integrate products and services into a business model, and help differentiate a business model from a competitor. They can advise other executives on why “that idea sounds great but done this way it would be money laundering,” to cite a seemingly bombastic example that I’ve encountered in real life.

If I don't have confidence in their ability to negotiate the problems we are facing I just move on. So far, most of the ramblings I have heard from CEOs sound like they have been reading too many articles. In other words, clueless. I wish to fuck they would start chatting with AI more. So many complaints about Gen Z, it is ridiculous. Gen X taught them not to invest themselves in the company too much.

Building a big functional company like Zuckerberg did isn't something just anyone can do, Tim Cook just took over a big functional company and made it continue do what it did before. I think it will be a while until AI can build companies from scratch, but I think just running a company and keeping it do what it currently does wont take nearly as much. reply gcanyon 6 hours agorootparentThe common narrative is that Tim Cook was the organizer and glue behind Steve Jobs's vision for years, and \"just took over a big functional company and made it continue do what it did before\" is a funny way to describe the tear Apple has been on for the last ~15 years. reply TheNewsIsHere 4 hours agorootparentThat is a narrative that is borne out by the record but it is a vast oversimplification. If we’re talking about Tim Cook specifically, he was a wonderful choice because of his SCM acumen. He was one of the original architects of the supply chain system Apple uses to this day. Product OEMs that follow a philosophy like Apple’s are in a sense logistics and SCM firms as much as they are software firms. Particularly in that regard (speaking to SCM) Apple is a place of constant change and that it all works as well as it does is a bit of a miracle brought forth by a bunch of talented people. That applies equally to other massive, heavily integrated manufacturers, like Toyota for example. reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparentprev> \"just took over a big functional company and made it continue do what it did before\" is a funny way to describe the tear Apple has been on for the last ~15 years. Compared to Facebook, yes Apple just continued doing what they did under Steve while Facebook went from being a small private site for Harvard students to being a global tech giant. I don't see why you would equate those two. reply hackernewds 6 hours agorootparentprev [–] Facepalming at the assumption that Tim Cook doesn't do much and it's something anyone can do reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparent [–] Why did you write that response to me and not to the person above me? I didn't say Tim Cook didn't do anything, keeping the company on course isn't doing nothing. The person above me said he did nothing of value, not me. But note that keeping the company on course isn't the same thing as building the company and setting the course. Edit: Also there are a lot of people who can keep a company on course, there are much much fewer who can build a company. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "gcss: Simplify CSS Management with Pure Go, No JavaScript Needed",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/AccentDesign/gcss",
    "originBody": "gcss CSS written in Pure Go. No JS builders, no preprocessors, no linters, no frameworks, no classes, no variables, no overrides, no plugins, no dependencies, no javascript, no templates, no bs, no nothing. Just Go. Motivation This is really just a bit of fun and a way to write CSS in Go. I wanted to see if it was possible and it is with ease. I wanted to find a way to easily control the CSS from the server side and not have to worry about pre-building the css to take variables and stuff. I didnt want to use UI libraries that are written for JS frameworks and I didn't want to use preprocessors or linters that add more steps to the build process. Could I just use CSS? Yes of course and I will, but I wanted to see if I could write CSS in Go as this is what is compiling the rest of the project. Gopher No it looks nothing like the Go gopher, but it's a gopher and I like it. It's the best I could get from the LM without giving up, ideogram.ai (1400097641). Next steps The next steps for this project are to add more features to the CSS package. This includes adding support for more CSS properties and maybe mixins. What I don't want to do is to add support for all CSS functionality as some things are better in CSS, but I do want to be able to create a few UI components that are configurable using Go. What I don't need I don't need UI libs that are written for the purpose of JS frameworks. I don't need linters when I have Go's static typing. I don't need javascript to generate CSS. I don't need templates with 400 css classes in them. I don't need css with more variables in them than actual css properties. What I do need Go's static typing. Installation go get github.com/AccentDesign/gcss Usage There are multiple ways you can use gcss in your project. For examples of property values, see the style_test.go file. Writing css to a file: package main import (\"github.com/AccentDesign/gcss\"\"github.com/AccentDesign/gcss/props\"\"github.com/AccentDesign/gcss/variables\"\"os\" ) type Stylesheet []gcss.Style var styles = Stylesheet{{ Selector: \"html\", Props: gcss.Props{FontFamily: props.FontFamilySans, },},{ Selector: \".button\", Props: gcss.Props{BackgroundColor: variables.Zinc800,Border: props.Border{ Width: props.UnitPx(1), Style: props.BorderStyleSolid, Color: variables.Zinc900.Alpha(128),},BorderRadius: variables.Size1H,Color: variables.White,FontSize: variables.Size4,PaddingBottom: variables.Size3,PaddingLeft: variables.Size5,PaddingRight: variables.Size5,PaddingTop: variables.Size3, },},{ Selector: \".button:hover\", Props: gcss.Props{BackgroundColor: variables.Zinc900, },}, } func main() {file, err := os.Create(\"stylesheet.css\")if err != nil { panic(err)}defer file.Close()for _, style := range styles { if err := style.CSS(file); err != nil {panic(err) }} } The benefit of all this are Keeps the css free of variables. Keeps html free of classes like bg-gray-50 text-black dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-white and eliminates the need to remember to add the dark variant. I recently saw a button component on an html page 10 times with over 1800 characters in the class attribute of each. This is not maintainable nor debuggable. Keeps the css clean and easy to debug with no overrides like the above. Allows for easy theming based on server side logic. Examples For example usage see the examples directory that include: CSS resets - A simple example collection of css resets. Templ integration - An example of how to load styles from gcss with the templ package. Themed CSS using multiple HTTP handlers - An example of how to use multiple http handlers to serve different themes. Themed CSS using a single HTTP handler - An example of how to use a single http handler to serve different themes using media queries. Write to a file - An example of how to write to a file. Write to an HTTP handler - An example of how to write to an http handler. Write to stdout - An example of how to write to stdout. Contributing If you would like to contribute to this project, please open an issue or a pull request. We welcome all contributions and ideas. Mix it up with other CSS frameworks You can mix gcss with other CSS frameworks like tailwindcss for example: separate the css files into base and utils: /* base.css */ @tailwind base; /* utils.css */ @tailwind utilities; Then add the gcss styles in between in your html:Try to keep the specificity of the gcss styles to 1 by using single classes this will ensure any tailwindcss utilities will be able to overwrite your styles where required.",

Classes can't compose or inherit (or, if they can, I don't know about it and would welcome a correction). For example, let's say I use a third-party css library (materializecss, or similar) that provides a class `btn-warning` and `warning-text`, which sets say 10 fields (colors, elevation, etc) on the former and `text-transform` on the latter. I just want to write one new class that inherits fields from both the existing classes. I can't specify a new class `my-btn-warning` that inherits all the fields from `btn-warning` and `warning-text`. I can't create a new class `my-btn-warning` that is composed of `btn-warning` and `warning-text`. My only option (open to correction) is to copy-and-paste the existing `btn-warning` and `warning-text` fields into my new `my-btn-warning` class. There's simply no reusability here. If I want reusability, I need to go outside the spec i.e. have a build step. Not just any build step, but one that exactly matches the upstream library. Which is impossible if there are two upstream libraries, or if my existing build step is different. This project looks nice but it combines all the disadvantages of writing CSS with all the disadvantages of a build step and adds the extra downside of not being compatible with anyone else's (including mine) build step. To me, this is the worst of all worlds, with no redeeming advantage at all. reply petepete 10 hours agoparentIt sounds like you're blaming CSS for the shortcomings of the library you're using.

Maybe I was unclear: my gripe is that this functionality is such a necessary thing to have, that external non-spec third-party tools have to be used to get this functionality. It is a shortcoming of CSS, because CSS is not providing this functionality that users want. The fact that everyone is using a third party tool to get this functionality only reinforces my point: if everyone is doing it, then it's a shortcoming. > Have a .btn rule that styles all your buttons.

It seems like the point of this is to run during a compilation step with the added capability of rebuilding a CSS response on the fly, if you wanted. Building a CSS during compile is no different than using something like Tailwind and is essentially free. reply akdor1154 15 hours agoparentprevUnsure if you're trolling: your attitude is basically big cashed up corporates squatting on their users' devices, because their devs are too lazy, unempathetic, incompetent, or all three, to pick a better solution. This shit is why basic webpages drain my battery and burn my lap. reply dzink 15 hours agorootparentNo, the attitude is that CSS is for decoration to meet the User’s needs (colors, dark or light mode, font sizes and adjustments for accessibility, etc). So moving it to backend is a bad idea because you remove the users ability to customize or at worst make your entire service delayed both for all users and for the user who needs the customization by doing it on the server. (now I understand the tool featured here is for precompile, but this is the argument i was making before I knew that). The whole industry of React and similar giant frameworks is to offload functionality to the browser and make the server only a data source - you reduce the amount of data that has to go through tight pipes and speed up the responsiveness of the site for your users. Basic pages drain your battery for sure. There is a gradient of that and putting CSS in the front end is the wise minimal end of that gradient, while React is the opposite side of it, then add SQLite and you go even more client heavy. It depends on the tool you are building - some justify it, but many don’t. reply codedokode 6 hours agoprev [–] Please note that using slash at the end of the tag is not supported in HTML:I often see such code and it seems that people simply don't know HTML and copy random garbage they found on the Internet.

Quoting the spec [1]: > Then, if the element is one of the void elements, or if the element is a foreign element, then there may be a single U+002F SOLIDUS character (/), which on foreign elements marks the start tag as self-closing. On void elements, it does not mark the start tag as self-closing but instead is unnecessary and has no effect of any kind. For such void elements, it should be used only with caution — especially since, if directly preceded by an unquoted attribute value, it becomes part of the attribute value rather than being discarded by the parser.

    "originBody": "SPI flash SPI Flash reader Like ho.ax, I had been using a Dangerous Prototypes buspirate to read SPI flash boot ROMs, but it was too slow. So I built a dedicated one with a Teensy 2 or 3 and a 8-SOIC chip-clip. It can read/write the entire multi-megabit ROM in a minute. Sources are available from bitbucket.org/hudson/spiflash. Spotting boot ROMs Many SPI flash chips are 8-SOIC, like this 8 megabyte 25L6406E. On x86 sytems they are also typically memory mapped at 0xFF800000, but it is also easy to read them with an external reader. Pinout These pins are large enough that it is easy to attach with a buspirate/logic-probe clips or using a dedicated chip clip that connects to all eight pins at once. On the bottom of the Teensy 2 there is a pad footprint for a 3.3 volt regulator -- I've cut the trace and soldered one in, as described here. For the Teensy 3, which runs at native 3.3V, no hardware modifications are required. Most laptops and some servers use 8-pin chips in either SOIC or DIP packages: +------+ (white) B0 !CE ---| o |---- +V 3v3 (red or brown) (brown) B3 SO ---| |---- !RST !WP ---| |---- SCK B1 (green) (black) GND GND ---| |---- SI B2 (blue) +------+ For the 16-pin chips typically found on server motherboards, the pinout is: NC ---- 1 o 16 --- CLK Vcc (3v)- 2 W 15 --- DI NC ---- 3 I 14 --- NC NC ---- 4 N 13 --- NC NC ---- 5 B 12 --- NC NC ---- 6 O 11 --- NC /CS ---- 7 N 10 --- GND DO ---- 8 D 9 --- NC Sometimes the SPI flash chip doesn't respond to the i command -- the result comes back as all 0xFF. If I cycle power to the chip a few times it starts to respond. I'm not sure what the root cause is of this, but to make it easier I've put a separate jumper on the power pin from the teensy to the SOIC chip. This allows me to cycle the power until I get a good read of the chip ID. Some MacBooks have debug ports on them that connect to the SPI flash ROM (and maybe other interesting debug signals?). I've probed the MacBookPro 10,1 and mapped the pinout for almost all of the SPI signals, with the exception of Power and !WP. Usage The reader should show up as a serial device on your computer. It has a the following simple commands: i: Read chip ID; if all 0xFF or 0x00, then something is wrong. The format of the ID result is described in the data sheet and JEDEC standard: r7f0000↵: read 16 bytes from 0x7f0000 and hex dump them. e7f0000↵: erase a sector at address 7f0000. You shouldn't need to do this since the upload command will erase sectors as it crosses them. u190000 1a0000↵: Upload (and erase) 0x1a0000 bytes to 0x190000. Typically I will then shell out from minicom and run pv; you could also use cat although it wouldn't give you any feedback on the transfer: pv new-rom.section.rom > /dev/ttyACM0 The entire ROM can be read using xmodem. Shell out from minicom and run: rx/dev/ttyACM0 rom.bin Reverse Engineering More details on reverse engineering a ROM are described in my Thunderstrike talk at 31c3.

While doing in-circuit SPI flashing of several laptops for Coreboot, getting a good read or write was difficult. One of the many things I'd regularly try was to reseat the clip. Unfortunately, with the Pomona clips, this reseating would tend to catch and push in the pins of the clip, so they started making even poorer contact. This pushing in was possible because there's not a single rigid pin straight through from the component to the test headers. The pin is 2 or 3 (I forget) parts, and a lower part can pop out of the plastic channel/groove it's in. You can disassemble the clip and push things back together, but it wasn't quite the same as before deformed. I ended up having better luck with simpler clips that have a single physical pin straight through, such that the header pitch is the same as the component. Then I bent the pins to the side in an alternating pattern, to give enough room to attach my individual wires. reply baby_souffle 1 hour agoparent> I ended up having better luck with simpler clips that have a single physical pin straight through, such that the header pitch is the same as the component. Then I bent the pins to the side in an alternating pattern, to give enough room to attach my individual wires. I have had 100% the opposite experience :D. For whatever reason, the cheap clips quickly develop intermittent faults on some number of wires or the pin deforms hopelessly. You can tell the problem is getting worse when you have to maintain more pressure to hold the clip in place or do multiple reads and confirm that the sha1 hash of the dump file matches for the majority of reads! reply neilv 1 hour agorootparentMaybe I just had clumsy technique. I was usually attaching the clip with not much room to open it beyond the component, which I guess might've contributed to pushing in the component-side pins. reply lemonlime0x3C33 48 minutes agoparentprevI love Pomona SOIC test clips, the other cheaper ones off of amazon are garbage though. :) I find when flashing hardware you might have to try a few times and if you get a good read/write going don't move, don't breathe, don't do anything until it is done. reply schmidtleonard 37 minutes agoparentprevWas it Pomona or Pomona knockoff?

They seem ambiguous about which side of the board you can plug them into, but they are actually (barely) polarized. The main disadvantage is the expense of the connector and expense of castellated holes on the edge of your board. If you can afford the BOM cost use a surface mount 10-pin 50-mil header, or if you can afford the footprint space and some holes, use the SKEDD connector.

We present copy-and-patch, an extremely fast compilation technique that also produces good quality code. It is capable of lowering both high-level languages and low-level bytecode programs to binary code, by stitching together code from a large library of binary implementation variants. We call these binary implementations stencils because they have holes where missing values must be inserted during code generation. We show how to construct a stencil library and describe the copy-and-patch algorithm that generates optimized binary code. We demonstrate two use cases of copy-and-patch: a compiler for a high-level C-like language intended for metaprogramming and a compiler for WebAssembly. Our high-level language compiler has negligible compilation cost: it produces code from an AST in less time than it takes to construct the AST. We have implemented an SQL database query compiler on top of this metaprogramming system and show that on TPC-H database benchmarks, copy-and-patch generates code two orders of magnitude faster than LLVM -O0 and three orders of magnitude faster than higher optimization levels. The generated code runs an order of magnitude faster than interpretation and 14% faster than LLVM -O0. Our WebAssembly compiler generates code 4.9X-6.5X faster than Liftoff, the WebAssembly baseline compiler in Google Chrome. The generated code also outperforms Liftoff's by 39%-63% on the Coremark and PolyBenchC WebAssembly benchmarks.

The only caveats I can think of (`pledge`d not to use `mprotect`, marked most of the address space with `mimmutable`) apply to all other JITs too.
