In the text-to-image domain, the release of Stable Diffusion clearly signaled that open source was a viable distribution mechanism for foundational models. However, the same cannot be said in the large language model (LLM) space, in which the biggest breakthroughs are coming from models like GPT-4, Claude, and Cohere, which are only available via APIs. The open source alternatives to these models haven\u2019t shown the same level of performance, specifically in their ability to follow human instructions. However, an unexpected research breakthrough and a leaked release are starting to change that.A few weeks ago, Meta AI announced Llama, an LLM designed to advance research in the space. Llama was released in different versions, including 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B parameters, and despite being notoriously smaller than alternative models, was able to match the performance of GPT-3 across many tasks. Llama was not initially open-sourced, but a week after its release, the model was leaked on 4chan, sparking thousands of downloads.What could have been seen as an unfortunate incident has become one of the most interesting sources of innovation in the LLM space in the last few weeks. Since the leak of Llama, we have seen an explosion of innovation in LLM agents built on it. Just to cite a few examples:Stanford University released Alpaca, an instruction following model based on LLama 7B model.Researchers from \u00a0UC Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, and UC San Diego open sourced Vicuna, a fine-tuned version of LLama that matches GPT-4 performance.Berkeley AI Research Institute(BAIR) released Koala, a version of LLama fine-tuned using internet dialogs.Nebuly open sourced ChatLLama, a framework for creating conversational assistants using your own data.FreedomGPT is an open source conversational agent based on Alpaca which is based on LLama.The Colossal-AI project from UC Berkeley released ColossalChat, a ChatGPT type model with a complete RLHF pipeline based on LLama.Several other projects are worth mentioning in this list, and I am sure more will be released soon. One thing is certain: the accidental leak of Llama might have turned out to be one of the biggest sparks of innovation in the open source LLM space.\ud83d\udd0e ML ResearchOpenAI SafetyOpenAI published a detailed blog post outlining some of the principles used to ensure safety in their models.

Since the leak, Alpaca, Vicuna, Koala, ColossalChat, and ChatLLama, among other models, have been released, all built on top of Llama. The open-source alternatives to these models have not shown the same performance level until the Llama release. The leak of Llama has turned out to be one of the biggest sparks of innovation in the open-source LLM space, where a war between open-source and API-based distribution is looming.

    "hn_content": "The LLama Effect, a leak that sparked open-source alternatives to ChatGPT, has drawn a lot of attention from tech-savvy individuals. The comments show that the llamas are great toys but openai's GPT models like text-davinci-003 perform significantly better and provide uses for work. GPT-4 appears to be more intelligent, as it can offer explanations of why a certain action should be taken. However, some comments suggest that these models may rely on rote pattern matching rather than reasoning.A conversation with GPT-4 explores how to enter a building when all signs are written in mirror text, with the AI ultimately concluding that the building's glass door should be pulled to enter and pushed to exit. The discussion also touches on GPT-4's ability to reason and generalize, compared to its predecessor GPT-3. ChatGPT feels bad for not always getting things right and should be more assertive, according to one user. Other users note the ability of text-only GPT-4 to understand spatial reasoning and track the visual space of a maze.Experts discuss the capabilities of chatGpt in understanding puzzles and completing tasks. Some comments suggest that the AI is capable of reasoning due to its ability to prioritize tasks and consider surrounding context. Others point out the importance of manual fine-tuning and constant evolution. While there is debate regarding the actual level of \"learning\" happening in language models, there is hope for a more accessible and democratized future of AI.An open assistant project showcasing Lora's popularity preserves individual control by modifying unique qualities of the output with different models. Patiently  training  future  open-source  clean architectures and recent releases including Llamas and Bard are paving the way for efficient formatting of results. Growing GPU compute power could make competitive LLM training possible within smaller budgets, however, one must comprehensively test each model before application. Most people still use the 30B model due to lack of resources for the advent of the 65B model.An HN user claims that GPT-4 can follow complex prompts that GPT-3.5 struggles with, but it's not widely available, and there are no alternatives at the moment. Users are reporting that smaller model versions are 'quite slow' and can get slower over time due to heat throttling. Comparing consumer-grade hardware against OpenAI's top stuff running on high-end GPU farms, it's clear that the technology benefits from much larger scale than most people can afford. It's said that even GPT-4, if it exists, will be a toy compared to leaked versions. Finally, LLaMA leak has led to open-source optimizations appearing on every platform.Experts discuss software piracy and alternative interpretations of recent leaks in open source AI. Some users express a desire to run powerful models locally for privacy and security, while others argue that larger models are still needed for certain tasks. Legal questions around the copyrightability of model weights are raised, with some arguing they could be forced into the public domain. A user's discussion of their personal setup for running the 65B llama model sparks interest, while others debate the potential for banning or regulating AI companies without proper research collaborations. There is skepticism of LLAMA's ability to compete with ChatGPT-level models, but praise for the experimentation and collaboration among experts in the open source AI community.The leak of LLaMA models is driving popularity and demand for chatbot models like Alpaca and Vicuna, but some HN users find them inferior to ChatGPT. Meta is trying to take down publicly available copies of LLaMA, but some users claim that it's futile. Open-source AI remains popular because people like to tinker with things and find their limits. There is a want for locally hosted models in businesses to handle confidential inputs and outputs. Meta and Google are facing leadership and execution problems.An HN user suggests that Meta would have sold the same number of products even without their Metaverse push. Another user argues that Meta tacitly endorsed a recent leak. The conversation then turns to the hardware required to run 65B+ models, with one user suggesting that a consumer-grade GPU is not sufficient, and another recommending cloud instances. Lastly, there is a discussion about the copyright implications of AI-generated output.OpenAI may face legal challenges for using the output of their models to train other commercial models. There are concerns about copyright infringement and the legality of using unlicensed and scraped content in the model's training. However, machines and generative AI algorithms can't be authors, and their outputs are not copyrightable as per US law. Web scraping for commercial use may be dubious, although it's not a CFAA violation, and scraping public websites does not constitute an enforceable breach of contract. Society needs to establish enforceable standards to prevent LeCun's et al. from negatively impacting people.OpenAI's claim to grant AIs copyright is challenged as humans don't get the copyright on the output of something they teach. AIs don't yet qualify for personhood, so OpenAI cannot claim ownership on the output of their AI. If GPT output were copyrightable, OpenAI's TOS around output in training shouldn't be enforceable. AIs trained on public commons raise the question of copyright ownership on their output. Some argue that AIs cannot sign an NDA or contract, so it questions their informed consent.OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which is steered by RLHF for helpful, structured continuations trained on random text, can still give inaccurate information or lie despite measures to ensure privacy and factual accuracy. An HN user recommends the InstructGPT and Alpaca models to address this. Several users note that admitting a lack of knowledge and improved multimodal versions are promising breakthroughs in the AI's evolution. However, some users criticize OpenAI's management of GPT-3 and other LLMs, questioning those who hold it in high regard and urging more transparency and consensus among software developers.Comments on ChatGPT's accuracy and capabilities were divergent but generally critical. Some users found it useless or prone to factual hallucinations, while others claimed that the latest GPT4 version had improved in certain aspects. A discussion on ChatGPT's competence included examples of its difficulty in tasks such as identifying a palindrome or reversing a string, though some users pointed out that its limitations are due to its basic architecture. One user noted that while LLMs don't distinguish between fiction and fact, some have a degree of structured reasoning, albeit flawed.An HN user argues that text compression is not a deterministic process and is a concept derived from token sampling, thus avoiding illusions for contextual purposes. Another user agrees that ChatGPT exhibits pattern-recognizing qualities but argues against emergent intelligence and understanding. A comment mentions that Bing/Sydney and ChatGPT have different personalities. The post does not provide new information on technology but rather discusses the inherent nature of text compression. Applications for YC Summer 2023 are open.",

    "hn_content": "Researchers at Stanford are exploring ways to reduce the computational cost of self-attention for long sequences in deep learning. One option that has worked for one user is to use the dynamic routing algorithm, Heinsen routing, which can handle sequences with over a million tokens on a single GPU. Another user points out that linear attention advances, such as flash attention, have already been made. The article also discusses efforts to optimize Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and convolution calculations for GPUs. Future co-processors may be engineered with optimized\u00a0self-attention as a primitive building block, allowing for LLMs with trillions of parameters to run locally on mobile phones and laptops.A new approach uses FFTs recurrently to approximate convolutions with input-length filters. It may solve an issue with other sub-quadratic-replacements for self-attention that rely on low-rank/sparse approximation. An HN user questions why a transformer or RNN is better than a simple linear layer with the same number of parameters for sequence modelling. Another HN user explains that the transformer is (approximately) permutation equivariant and makes a massive difference in generalization and training speed. The post discusses the potential of long context lengths in improving AI capabilities, and the multi-dimensional nature of 'superhuman' abilities. Compute cost and model efficiency are also considered as important factors.Comments on Hacker News discuss the limitations of Long-Range Dependence language models (LLMs) and their inability to compete with human expertise in terms of long-term memory; however, some argue that coupling LLMs with other systems, such as a planner or theorem prover, could be the solution to this problem; experts fear that jobs focused on fact retrieval may be at risk as LLMs advance rapidly and have already achieved graduate-level knowledge in math and physics; there is much potential for improvement in LLMs through multi-modal data, but progress may rely on interactive feedback loops between agent and environment, a challenge in fields like robotics and RL; while LLMs excel at quickly piecing together existing information, their capacity for original problem-solving remains limited.The recent release of GPT-4 has led to new research on what next-token prediction can do on new datasets, and researchers are excited about the possibilities. However, some commenters express skepticism about the increasing trend towards longer-context models in AI, arguing that they may hit a wall. There is a suggestion that future breakthroughs may involve associative long-term memory, or continuous/online learning. Some also discuss the benefits and limitations of state-space models and RNNs compared to transformers, with potential implications for scaling and democratizing AI.Experts discuss the relationship between model architectures and context length and question if longer context lengths could be considered a new form of search. One user points out that understanding K,Q,V representation was crucial to the development of LLMs. The article highlights that some individuals may use technology without understanding how it works, as is the case with any technology. Lastly, one user asks for clarification regarding the relationship between the results discussed in the article and a recent paper.",
    "hn_summary": "Stanford researchers explore cost reduction for self-attention in long sequences. Optimizing computation for GPUs and co-processors can optimize LLMs. Skepticism around longer-context models, coupling LLMs with other systems may create new solutions.

The accounting-and-consulting giant is being sued for $2.7bn by the administrators of NMC, a London-listed hospital operator it had audited and which went into administration after understating debts by $4bn. EY is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), a British regulator; the firm denies the administrators\u2019 claims of negligence. Its plan to unshackle an advisory business constrained by its inability to work with audit clients, codenamed \u201cProject Everest\u201d, is in doubt amid a rebellion by a group of American partners. And on March 31st its German arm received the harshest penalty ever meted out by APAS, Germany\u2019s accounting watchdog, which includes a \u20ac500,000 ($548,000) fine and, worse, two-year ban on auditing new publicly listed clients in the country. This is a financial blow to the firm\u2014and an even bigger reputational one.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.APAS\u2019s decision comes after a three-year investigation into EY\u2019s role in the demise of Wirecard, a fintech darling turned Germany\u2019s biggest post-war corporate scandal. EY had given Wirecard a clean bill of health for a decade until the company collapsed in 2020 amid allegations of massive financial fraud. APAS now says that it considers it \u201cproven\u201d that between 2016 and 2018 EY violated its duty of care during the audit of Wirecard and Wirecard Bank. Five current and former employees were also fined between \u20ac23,000 and \u20ac300,000. Seven other employees who were also under investigation escaped punishment by handing back their auditor\u2019s licences. In a statement, the firm said, \u201cEY Germany has fully co-operated with APAS throughout its investigation. We regret that the collusive fraud at Wirecard was not discovered sooner, and we have learned important lessons from this matter.\u201dAfter its cockups in recent years EY has indeed been trying to get better at spotting mischief. In 2021 it said it would invest $2bn over three years in improving its audits, including upgrading its technology the better to detect fraud. But no auditor is likely to get things right every time. Indeed, scandals such as Wirecard and NMC go to the heart of the so-called \u201cexpectations gap\u201d in auditing. Auditors insist that their services cannot be treated as a guarantee that accounts are truthful, and note that sophisticated frauds are by their nature difficult to spot. And it is not the only auditor to be embroiled in controversy. In 2020 Deloitte was fined \u00a315m ($19m) by the FRC for \u201cserious and serial failures\u201d in its audit of Autonomy, a business-software firm. HP, an American tech firm that bought Autonomy in 2011, alleged that its target had misstated its accounts.Regulators, for their part, think audits could be improved. They have tried to increase competition. For instance, in Europe firms must rotate their auditors, typically after ten years. Yet despite such efforts, audit remains a cosy oligopoly. The so-called \u201cbig four\u201d\u2014Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC\u2014together audit nearly all large listed companies in Europe and America, weakening incentives to invest in audit quality. For example, EY is currently auditing 12 of the 40 companies in the dAX, the stockmarket index of German blue chips, according to Wirtschaftswoche, a business weekly. They include giants such as Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen. Its main rivals, PwC, KPMG and Deloitte, work for 12, ten and five DAX firms, respectively. Next year several DAX companies will decide whether to renew the mandates of their respective auditors. Siemens, Siemens Energy and Siemens Healthineers, three engineering firms, have already said they will end their contract with EY, though that is also related to the obligation to rotate auditors. Other clients in statutory need of a new auditor will be unable to switch to EY because of the ban even if they want to\u2014which, given the damaging publicity, they may not. EY\u2019s rivals will be watching the fallout closely. So will its partners elsewhere in the world. The fact that, like other global accountants, EY operates a franchise-like structure, with independent partnerships in each country, will not spare the wider network from reputational damage. As for EY Germany, it remains keen on Project Everest.

    "hn_content": "EY has been banned from conducting new audits in Germany, according to an article on Economist.com. The comments section contains a discussion of the behaviour of major consulting firms such as EY, which often subcontract substantial work to lower-paid, less experienced staff after winning contracts. The article comments note that the companies in question are hired primarily to minimize risk rather than drive business performance, and that the risk of the lowest-paid staff inadequately executing projects can backfire on the consulting firms. Consultancy firms are notable for shouldering their clients' risk, and managers might also find that outsourcing to individuals or smaller firms with insider experience in larger firms can lead to equal or better outcomes.A user on Hacker News discusses their work as a prototype builder for hospitality and consumer companies with tech debt, using basic financial rigor and visionary thinking to help clients move from concept to MVP to pilot; marketing themselves to clients through word of mouth as a more affordable option than big or midsize consultancies. Other users discuss the role of auditors, with one user noting that auditors serve a purpose to double-check the accuracy of a company's numbers, but don't investigate or uncover fraud. Another user points out the checkered past of EY, who recently made headlines for their involvement in the Wirecard scandal and for cheating on professional licensing exams.Ernst & Young (EY) has been fined \u20ac3.5m ($4.2m) by the German financial regulator, BaFin, over the firm's auditing of now-defunct fintech company Wirecard. A spokesperson for EY said that the firm accepts \"full responsibility\" for its \"incorrect auditing decisions.\" BaFin has also banned EY from conducting audits for public companies in Germany for at least three months. The scandal surrounding Wirecard resulted in a \u20ac100bn ($120bn) worth of damage to the company's shareholders, affecting up to 1.4 million savers in Germany. Five employees of EY were also fined, and a further seven escaped punishment.A discussion on Hacker News explores the nature of creditors versus investors and their bets on future company profits; one user claims that creditors are fundamentally a risk and backed by contracts, while another suggests that providing credit is a form of betting on future profits. The conversation delves into the American system's favoritism of those with extra money and how this impacts the structure of the system itself, with one comment pointing out the shielding of creditors from risks. The thread also touches on the consequences of declaring bankruptcy and how the German system is not small to medium business-friendly.Directors should not be barred from trading when their business fails, unless they commit fraud or gross mismanagement. Business failure is a common occurrence, and entrepreneurs should minimize the risk of bankruptcy. Some comments suggest that Germany has complicated and strict procedures for starting a business, but this advice should be taken with caution. The incentives for auditors are often misaligned, and auditors should be held accountable, but the implementation of such policies has been difficult. Insurers could be held responsible for fraud and other business risks, and they, in turn, could appoint auditors to align incentives with shareholders, customers, and suppliers.Malta had to license a lot of smaller shops as accredited gambling auditors as each audit blocks two accredited people for around three weeks, and with a surplus of gambling companies registered in the country, the auditors could only process five to six companies each, many of them without technical knowledge. Auditors can only audit a statistically significant sample, with fraud difficult to find if two employees are involved in internal controls. The use of AI could work to find more suspicious transactions and internal controls. Technology could impact financial reporting, enabling every transaction to be audited in real-time with software.An audit would be necessary to evaluate whether the entire supply chain is working as intended; the sheer complexity of accounting for large multinational companies can make it difficult to identify patterns and catch fraudulent activity; auditors' conflict of interest can also be a concern; automation and use of machine learning can help detect inconsistencies, though there is no guarantee; the example of Wirecard's fraudulent activities is highlighted, as well as other techniques such as money laundering through art dealing; auditors mainly check the paperwork, but sometimes the system can be doctored and untethered from reality.The Wirecard scandal has highlighted how auditors only provide reasonable assurance and cannot guarantee fraud won't occur. Auditors only provide a \"top-level glance\" due to the difficulty, cost, and time of a more thorough check. The problem of fraudulent activity can't be solved by technology but requires people to change their mindset, according to a user who studied accounting and auditing. BaFin's failure to detect fraud indications, and instead accusing journalists of market manipulation or trading shares in the company, was astonishing. Liability, so far, remains uncertain.A systemic failure needs to be investigated carefully to determine who committed a crime, and this takes time. The auditors' poor execution in audits have been exposed, and auditors lack knowledge of their role in the process. Audits should be thoroughly disclosed to reveal potential conflicts of interest, and auditing should be separated from consulting. Financial crime should be better investigated, and institutions should receive in-depth audits that are funded by public trust to prevent conflicts of interest. Finally, governmental power, while the seeming solution, is too corruptible to trust in the face of lucrative practices.EY, a big four accounting firm, could face another major blow for their audit quality. A German court has ruled the company was partly responsible for Wirecard\u2019s multi-billion-dollar accounting fraud scandal due to iffy bookkeeping practices. It's still unclear what the ultimate consequences of this will be. The scandal is a reminder of the issue of building and keeping trust in the financial industry. However, some users argue that regulators have successfully taken actions against corporate malfeasance in certain areas, particularly finance. Comments express skepticism towards large auditing firms and the efficacy of relying on them for oversight, and urge for increased involvement from technical experts rather than lawyers and accountants.A discussion on Hacker News about auditing practices by government contractors and Big Four accounting firms. Some comments point out potential conflicts of interest and problems with government outsourcing to private firms. EY's recent ban from auditing is also mentioned, with some disagreeing with the decision but others citing the importance of auditors and their accountability. The discussion also touches on the role of corporate consulting and the responsibility of auditors in highly regulated industries.A debate on whether consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG add value or not. Some argue that these firms merely 'rubber stamp' decisions made by management, while others believe they have been unfairly maligned. Some suggest that a lack of 'skin in the game' should be banned instead of entire sectors. Additionally, the suggestion has been made to force auditing companies to stop offering consulting services to avoid conflicts of interest. This is related to the discussion of the public sector hiring private contractors. McK and BCG don't do auditing. The comments also debate the distinction between strategy and system integrator consulting companies, as well as the need for 'skin in the game' and potential solutions.",
    "hn_summary": "Ernst & Young (EY) has been banned from conducting new audits in Germany due to incorrect auditing decisions and involvement in the Wirecard scandal. Consulting firms subcontract lower-paid staff to minimize risk, but this can backfire. Auditors only provide reasonable assurance and do not guarantee fraud won't occur. Use of automation and AI can help detect fraudulent activity. Auditing should be separated from consulting to prevent conflicts of interest. There is debate over the value of consulting firms and the need for \"skin in the game.\""

Down here, the sun does weird things. This leads       to accurate-yet-strange sentences, such as \u201ccan you believe it \u2013 only 4 more days until sunset\u201d.I know you\u2019re all here for the scenic photos, but first indulge me for a bit about how \u201cdaylight\u201d works at       polar latitudes.Any location South of the Antarctic Circle (around 66.5\u00b0 South       latitude) will experience 24 hours of consecutive daylight (\u201cmidnight sun\u201d),       and 24 hours of consecutive darkness (\u201cpolar night\u201d) at least       once per year. However - most areas still get \u201cnormal\u201d (daily) sunrises and sunsets for at least part of the year.McMurdo, for example, sits at 77.85\u00b0 South latitude. Well below the Antarctic Circle, but still nowhere near       as far South as South Pole Station. McMurdo gets daily sunrises and sunsets for several months each year,       during the transitional period between 24x7 daylight and 24x7 night.This year at McMurdo,       the 24x7 \u201cmidnight sun\u201d period ended on February 20. There will be daily sunrises and sunsets until April 25,       at which point McMurdo will enter \u201cpolar night\u201d. The sun will stay below the horizon until August 19.       Then there will be daily sunrises and sunsets until October 24, followed by another round of midnight sun.A daily sunset at McMurdo station, from September 2022.         McMurdo gets daily sunrises and sunsets from August through October, and again from February through April.In my Hut Point post about McMurdo Station, I remarked:\u201cIt\u2019s now early September, and we\u2019re rapidly gaining daylight.        We\u2019re getting an extra 15-20 minutes per day, and it\u2019ll be just a        few more weeks until there\u2019s some light 24x7. For now,        the sun is just barely peeking out from behind the hills.\u201dThat\u2019s McMurdo. Strange, but not too strange.South Pole is where things get really weird.At exactly 90\u00b0 South latitude, the sun rotates in a near-perfect counterclockwise circle around the sky.       There is no difference       whatsoever between \u201cnight\u201d and \u201cday\u201d. On any given day, 2pm looks the same as 2am. The sun is at the same       height, just in a different part of the sky.The sun reaches its highest point in the sky, about 23.5\u00b0 above the horizon, around the       December Solstice (December 21).This photo was taken at 2pm on December 18th, near the peak of sunlight.         2am that day would have looked nearly the same,         with the sun just in a different part of the sky, but at the same height.After the sun reaches its peak, it begins to set. It\u2019s still rotating in perfect circles around       the sky; they\u2019re just getting lower and lower each day.When the sun gets low enough in the sky,       usually around mid-February, the temperature starts dropping rapidly.This is why South Pole Station \u201ccloses\u201d for winter around February 15th each year. Beyond this day, it\u2019s       operationally difficult to keep up flights. Sure enough, this year the temperature started dropping rapidly       right around February 15th, as I noted in Last Flight Out.The best way I can explain this is with a video. This video was originally published by       Robert Schwarz, who has spent 15 winters at the South Pole working       for one of the science projects here. It is reposted here with Robert\u2019s permission.In the video, you\u2019ll see a 5-day timelapse, tracking the sun, from March 8 through March 13, 2017.       It\u2019s late in the season, and the sun is pretty low in the sky by this point.Pretty weird!Tangent \u2013 all of this makes it especially silly that we observe \u201cdaylight savings time\u201d here.       We follow New Zealand time, because we had to pick something, and all our logistics run through New Zealand.       A few days ago, I ran around station setting all the analog clocks 1 hour back,       but it sure didn\u2019t feel like we were saving any \u201cdaylight\u201d.       Again, there is no visible daylight difference between times on a given day. We have a single,       gradual sunrise and sunset, spread out over the course of an entire year.I wasn\u2019t particularly rigorous taking daily photos to catalog the sun\u2019s gradual descent, but here\u2019s a few,       showing the date and what the sun looked like on that day:December 30, 2022February 5, 2023February 15, 2023February 19, 2023February 19, 2023March 15, 2023March 19, 2023The sun here at South Pole Station finally \u201cset\u201d on March 23, 2023 at 12:54pm, NZ time. We all stared out the       window (or ventured outside) to watch it happen, but it\u2019s really an anticlimactic milestone. We\u2019re       basically experiencing a single, very weird, year-long day/night cycle. The actual moment of \u201csunset\u201d       (officially defined as the moment the sun completely dips below the horizon) isn\u2019t really that special \u2013       the effects are spread out for several weeks.Nevertheless, here\u2019s my closest true \u201csunset\u201d photo:Sunset at the Geographic South Pole!And a few more photos from around sunset:As the sun slowly disappears below the horizon, we\u2019re treated to a several-week-long period of brilliant       colors. The sun continues its counterclockwise rotation, just below the horizon, allowing you to experience       a sunset from any direction you choose.For example \u2013 in the \u201cmornings\u201d (7am), the sun is visible from the       observation deck at Destination Alpha. In the evenings, the sun has just finished passing through the backyard.       By about midnight, it illuminates the Ceremonial South Pole out in front of the station.These next few photos were taken about 10 days after sunset! It\u2019s still magical, showing just how slowly       the sun sets.By April 6, we had our first bright moon! And with some lingering sunlight from the opposite side       of the sky, there was still plenty of light, even for camera phone photos:With any luck, we should start seeing our first auroras within the next few weeks!During Winter here at South Pole Station, we take our celestial events very seriously.On March 25, we observed Sunset Dinner. This is a formal affair \u2013 a ritual, a celebration, a proper excuse       to revel in the magical absurdity of our situation.We\u2019re thousands of miles from civilization, it\u2019s -80\u00b0F outside, and we\u2019re marching toward       six months of darkness, with only ourselves to rely on. Time to celebrate!Our galley crew goes all-out to prepare. The decor, the ambiance, the food\u2026 the entire evening is a       curated masterpiece. It\u2019s one of the most fun all-station evenings I\u2019ve had so far.Salad, with greens from our greenhouse!I'd pay $20 for a dessert like this at an upscale restaurant back home. Props to our galley crew!We\u2019re now passing through all the various stages of Twilight,       on our way towards night.From March 22 through April 5, we were in Civil Twilight.From April 5 through April 22, we\u2019ll be in Nautical Twilight.From April 22 through May 12, we\u2019ll be in Astronomical Twilight.From May 12 through August 2, it\u2019ll be night, and fully dark, with only occasional light from the moon.Then we\u2019ll repeat the cycles in reverse, culminating in sunrise around the       September Equinox.This afternoon, as I was putting the finishing touches on this post, I stepped outside and saw a star       bright enough to catch on camera.

Threats sent to the Dutch journalist over Telegram demanded that she retract an article critical of China, she wrote in English and in Dutch in the Saturday edition of the Volkskrant. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands responded that it has demanded clarification from China about the intimidation campaign.Neither the newspaper nor the police have been able to find out who exactly is behind it, but the person who sent the threats claims to represent the interests of the Chinese State. Vlaskamp was a correspondent in China from 2001 to 2019, and has been working as a foreign editor for the Volkskrant since her return to the Netherlands. She regularly writes critically about the Chinese State, and about sensitive subjects such as the oppression of Uyghurs and the activities of Chinese dissidents in the Netherlands.One of those dissidents is Wang Jingyu. Vlaskamp has written extensively about the 21-year-old who she first met in 2021. \u201cIn 2019, when Wang was still in secondary school, he got into trouble in China after writing critical tweets about Hong Kong and other politically sensitive subjects,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe managed to avoid arrest by fleeing the country together with his girlfriend.\u201d The two arrived in the Netherlands nearly two years ago and requested asylum. \u201cIn my article I had shown in detail how Beijing was making the young activist\u2019s life miserable over here as well.\u201dHe received threatening messages via Telegram in October from someone who calls themself \u201cAlice,\u201d Vlaskamp said. \u201cKeep your foul mouth shut, you filthy traitor. If you go on forcing yourself upon anti-Chinese media, the police will come to arrest you,\u201d one of the messages read. \u201cYour parents will suffer even worse and one day you will be punished yourself. And things won\u2019t end well for the anti-Chinese journalists either.\u201dAnother message read, \u201cOne tip from me and the police will come and arrest you and your journalist friend.\u201d That message was coordinated with a bomb threat at the Chinese embassy that was reported to police. Simultaneously, Vlaskamp and Jingyu both received confirmations of hotel bookings in their name for a location close to the embassy, which they had not arranged themselves.\u201cThis simple email from Booking.com is the start of a complicated and at times bizarre intimidation campaign which takes me on a Chinese rollercoaster ride, against my will. My superiors at the newspaper, the Dutch police, and myself have front row seats for this display of how the Chinese operate if they wish to silence people about matters to which the Chinese one-party State does not want to draw attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where this journey will end and neither do we know who is driving. And the person behind the wheel will do everything they can to keep it that way.\u201dThe police response took place on October 15 shutting down parts of The Hague for the investigation. \u201cIt sounds crazy, but the Chinese embassy has actually called the police about a bomb and mentioned our names,\u201d Jingyu told Vlaskamp after he spent a day going over his story with police. The bizarre nature of it made Vlaskamp burst out in a fit of laughter, as she had worked frequently with Chinese diplomats and maintained a healthy professional relationship with them.\u201cDuring the almost quarter century that I\u2019ve been working as a China correspondent, I\u2019ve learned enough to know how the Chinese operate if they want someone to shut up,\u201d Vlaskamp wrote. \u201cAnd yet I am also shocked. As far as I know, Western journalists are rarely treated this heavy-handedly. Also, my assailants make no effort at all to conceal that the threat is of Chinese origin.\u201dThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants clarification from China about the intimidation and threats against the journalist. The ministry has contacted the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands about this, a spokesperson confirmed.The ministry called it \"very worrying that a dissident and a journalist are faced with such far-reaching intimidation. This Cabinet is committed to the safety of journalists and human rights defenders worldwide and strongly opposes all forms of unwanted foreign interference. That this intimidation takes place in the Netherlands is unacceptable.\"It reflects another issue in a recent string of incidents that has caused tension between the Netherlands and China. Recently, the Netherlands put export restrictions on the country\u2019s tech sector that make it nearly impossible for ASML to export technologically advanced microchip production equipment to China. State players were also linked to an espionage scheme targeting workers in the Dutch tech sector, and one of the Dutch intelligence agencies said China was also part of a plot to use smartphones to spy on Dutch businesses.China has also been accused of illegally operating secret police stations in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Dutch authorities said just one month after the Chinese embassy bomb threat that they are becoming more concerned about increasing threats from both China and Russia, and there is an ever-growing list of politicians, agencies, and government offices banning workers from installing the social media app TikTok on phones used for work. This follows advice from Dutch intelligence agencies concerned about the influence the Chinese State has on ByteDance, the company that owns the app.In response to the article, the Chinese embassy confirmed they received a bomb threat and reported it to police, a representative told the Volkskrant. \u201cAs a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands, the embassy took this threat seriously and passed the bomb threat information to the Dutch police immediately. The Dutch government and police took immediate and professional measures to ensure the security of our embassy. There have been growing attacks and threats against the Chinese embassy recently, including from violent protesters and unknown parcels posted to or thrown in the embassy,\u201d the statement read. \u201cFalse or not, we have to take each case seriously.\u201dReporting by ANP and NL TimesFollow us:Latest storiesFeyenoord stays on course for the title beating RKC 5-1Berghuis leads Ajax to a comfortable victory against Fortuna SittardAmsterdam police arrest boy, 16, for stabbing that wounded a 13-year-oldKing Willem-Alexander has ruled for ten eventful years marked with controversyAirplane the most popular choice as more Dutch residents book holidays for 2023Suspect in Curacao drive-by shooting that killed Dutch musician arrested in VlaardingenTop storiesTourist attractions and nature sites are getting ready for Easter weekendDutch journalist who writes critically on China targeted in \u201cbizarre\u201d intimidation schemeRetailers think they can handle Easter crowds despite staff shortagesTrain derailment timeline leaked: Crane was at active railroad earlier than agreedMany festivals not happening this year as organizers struggle to stay afloatFive victims of Voorschoten train crash still in hospital, one in ICU\u00a9 2012-2023, NL Times, All rights reserved.Footer menuPrivacyContactPartner content",

One user reminisced about working in a college mailroom in the 1970s, while others discussed wages and inflation. The post has garnered significant attention due to the unique nature of the USPS facility's work. The discussion on Hacker News touched on the evolution of labor and wages over time, with a focus on changes in the cost of essential goods and the role of technology in labor efficiency.A discussion on government subsidies for essential services like education and housing, which may increase demand without matching supply, leading to rising prices. However, a user argues that efficiencies in the restaurant industry have made it more affordable despite remaining an essential service. The conversation diverts to the confusing address systems in various countries, with landmark-based addressing in Latin America, and building code-based addressing in Japan. Hidden superpowers of dedicated zip codes in the US are discussed, and the delay in delivering mail to nearby addresses is puzzling.USPS sorting happens primarily at regional processing centers, rather than individual stations, due to cost optimization. Sorting machinery is usually larger and more automated at processing centers. While local-only processing may have been preferable in the past, a shift to intercity mail and centralization has made regional processing more efficient. Handwriting is becoming obsolete as keyboarding takes hold, but it still has a certain nostalgic value.Experts discuss the benefits of writing in books, including improved notetaking and deeper engagement with the material. Some users express frustration with their handwriting, while others embrace the shift to digital communication. The loss of cursive writing is viewed as a sign of society's increasing reliance on technology, with some concerned about the potential consequences. The discussion touches on the importance of property ownership and the role of books as conveyors of knowledge. The need for specialized facilities to maintain reliable delivery is also noted.The USPS's guaranteed pickup of stamped paper is a marvel, despite being unnecessary for reliable service. Some criticize governments' aimless running of such services, while others view it as a form of ECC. USPS is self-funded and has a unique way of dealing with its resources, unlike the domain name system. A private company could contract this job out, earning money from USPS while also building institutional data that could be used for machine learning. However, there are concerns about potential privacy violations with the use of private data. The US Postal Service's handwriting recognition technology is already impressive.USPS has a cursive handwriting OCR facility in Salt Lake City, the last of its kind, due to vast amounts of mail that require human sorting. The facility handles 175 million cursive-addressed mail items a year, which are a hassle for OCR systems to classify. Salt Lake City is home to the largest Mormon community in America, and this is believed to be because Mormons' genealogical focus led more people to learn cursive. The software is provided by Eagle, and Siemens is also mentioned. An HN user points out that Google Lens is capable of reading handwriting, but edge cases can still cause issues.A post on Hacker News discusses the USPS's Handwritten Mail Recognition System, which uses a combination of OCR and human workers to decipher difficult-to-read addresses. Some users praise the US Postal Service's \"duty\" and \"commitment,\" while others suggest improving handwriting or creating a mobile app to help users. Handwriting recognition has existed for years, but it is still a challenge for many postal workers with high accuracy requirements. The article also notes that a reliable postal system is critical infrastructure in many parts of the world.The discussion thread on Hacker News includes a comment about the unreliability of postal services, particularly in government buildings, and paid couriers being the only trustworthy option. Another comment tells a story about a Mormon genealogy enthusiast who utilizes computers to enhance research efficiency, with a personal anecdote about building computers with his grandfather. A separate comment discusses the writer's experience with handwriting analysis connected to the MBTI personality test. While readers may find these comments interesting, none of these are the main point of the article.USPS state-of-the-art data center in Salt Lake City relies on human workers to decipher and encode addresses that can't be read by automated systems. Thousands of handwritten envelopes pass through the facility every day, and the center needs to employ proficient cursive readers to deal with letters that machines cannot recognize. Although there are fewer letters being sent through the country's postal system and machine learning can help identify handwriting more quickly, some unrecognizable handwriting requires human involvement.USPS employs 800 people in Utah to decipher bad handwriting that OCRs can't, as the long tail of the cursive writing is harder for AI systems to process. An HN user says that while 98% is automated by OCRs, 2% requiring human intervention is still a significant challenge. Some users believe that these problems serve as an example of issues that persist in computer vision and machine learning technologies. There is skepticism toward AI systems solving major world problems while USPS must employ hundreds of humans to process everyday mail.",
    "hn_summary": "The USPS facility in Utah specializes in deciphering cursive handwriting with a software provided by Eagle and Siemens. Handwriting recognition has been challenging for postal workers, and human intervention is still required. The discussion on Hacker News touches on the evolution of labor and wages, property ownership, government subsidies, and the benefits of writing in books. Salt Lake City's Mormon community is believed to have contributed to the facility's large number of skilled readers. Some suggest the USPS should create a mobile app, while others express concerns about privacy violations with the use of private data."

    "hn_content": "Apple has been criticized for withholding benefits from unionized locations, fueling outcry from labor advocates. The company has been accused of trying to prevent its retail stores from unionizing, a tactic that is not new to a variety of physical labor unions. Some believe that benefits should be based on an individual or collective basis rather than whether employees are unionized. Starbucks was found guilty of similar tactics by the NLRB but for refusing to negotiate. We should thank the unions for benefits we currently have, such as a 40-hour workweek.Employees of Apple's retail stores have criticized management and praised the benefits of union membership, alleging that non-unionized workers receive worse benefits from the tech giant. One worker was granted a special raise after the union bargained out-of-cycle benefits, but this was later seen as a slight by some staff who felt that additional pay owed to them by Apple should have been paid unconditionally. Some Hacker News users criticized the unions' negotiating tactics, but others praised the benefits of union membership for tech company employees.An article on unionization prompted a discussion about the potential impact on workers. Some commenters argued that forming a union can be difficult, while others said that it provides a way for workers to negotiate as a group. There were also debates about the power dynamics within unions, with some arguing that union leaders can become co-opted by management, while others pointed out that union members can vote for their representatives and that union leaders are accountable to their membership. Overall, the thread highlighted the complexities of unionization and its potential impacts on workers.A discussion on the safety nets in America and Europe has broken out on a Hacker News post. While some claim that America has ample safety nets available\u2014even bankruptcy, others argue that Europe has better policies protecting its people. Some worry that the working lower middle class is struggling the most. The discussion spans topics such as corporate paternalism and union benefits, ultimately leading to calls for an economic system that recognizes worker involvement and co-ownership.Apple is accused of anti-union vote tampering and spreading misinformation about non-union perks for employees. The union claims that Apple announced the perks to scare union employees ahead of other store votes. A commenter suggests that unions and management can have a non-hostile relationship that can be good for businesses. Some commenters accuse Apple of hypocrisy, stating that they only care about profit and market progressive values for public appeal. One commenter gives an example of Toyota's employees perceiving lower wages as beneficial during the financial crisis. The younger generation seems to be pro-union, possibly due to a sense of hopelessness and the inability to afford basic necessities.A Gallup Poll shows that 71% of Americans approve of labor unions, indicating a growing interest in unionizing, especially in modern retail and restaurant jobs. While some comments argue that retail jobs are not necessarily abusive, others highlight the low pay and lack of benefits for front-line workers, as well as the risk of death during the pandemic. Apple stores are some of the most profitable retail stores per square foot, leading to attempts to unionize. However, some argue that tenure-based promotions and layoffs could detrimentally affect the company's ability to remove under-performers.",

Built-in functions6.1. Logging to PostgreSQL from PL/Rust6.2. Triggers6.3. SPI7. Trusted and Untrusted PL/Rust8. PostgreSQL configuration9. Rules and RegulationsPL/Rust Under the Hood10. Architecture11. Designing for Trust12. Lints13. Environment variablesLight (default)RustCoalNavyAyuPL/Rust GuideWhat is PL/Rust?This documentation is under development.PL/Rust is a loadable procedural language that enables writing PostgreSQLfunctions in the Rust programming language. These functions are compiled tonative machine code. Unlike other procedural languages, PL/Rust functions arenot interpreted.The top advantages of PL/Rust include writing natively-compiled functions to achieve the absolute best performance,access to Rust's large development ecosystem, and Rust's compile-time safety guarantees.PL/Rust is Open Source and actively developed on GitHub.FeaturesPL/Rust provides access to Postgres' Server Programming Interface (SPI) including dynamic queries, preparedstatements, and cursors. It also provides safe Rust types over most of Postgres built-in data types, including (butnot limited to), TEXT, INT, BIGINT, NUMERIC, FLOAT, DOUBLE PRECISION,DATE, TIME, etc.On x86_64 and aarch64 systems PL/Rust can be a \"trusted\" procedural language, assuming the proper compilationrequirements are met. On other systems, it is perfectly usable as an \"untrusted\" language but cannot provide thesame level of safety guarantees.Example PL/Rust functionThe following example shows an example PL/Rust function to count the length ofan input string. See PL/Rust Functions and Argumentsfor more examples.CREATE FUNCTION strlen(name TEXT)  RETURNS int LANGUAGE plrust AS$$  Ok(Some(name.unwrap().len() as i32))$$;Using the function is just like any other PostgreSQL function.SELECT strlen('Hello, PL/Rust');\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\u2502 strlen \u2502\u255e\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2561\u2502   14 \u2502\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518Built on pgxPL/Rust itself is a pgx-based Postgres extension. Furthermore, each LANGUAGE plrust function are themselves mini-pgx extensions. pgxis a generalized framework for developing Postgres extensions with Rust. Like this project, pgxis developed by TCDI.The following sections discuss PL/Rusts safety guarantees, configuration settings, and installation instructions.General Safety, by RustQuoted from the \"Rustonomicon\":Safe Rust is the true Rust programming language. If all you do is write Safe Rust, you will never have to worryabout type-safety or memory-safety. You will never endure a dangling pointer, a use-after-free, or any other kindof Undefined Behavior (a.k.a. UB).This is the universe in which PL/Rust functions live. If a PL/Rust function compiles it has these guarantees, bythe Rust compiler, that it won't \"crash.\" This quality is important for natively-compiled code running in aproduction database.What about unsafe?PL/Rust uses the Rust compiler itself to wholesale disallow the use of unsafe in user functions. Ifa LANGUAGE plrust function uses unsafe it won't compile.Generally, what this means is that PL/Rust functions cannot call unsafe fns, cannot call extern \"C\"s intoPostgres itself, and cannot dereference pointers.This is accomplished using Rust's built-in #![forbid(unsafe_code)] lint.3rd-party crate dependencies are allowed to use unsafe. We'll discuss this below.What about pgx?If pgx is a \"generalized framework for developing Postgres extensions with Rust\", and if PL/Rust user functionsare themselves \"mini-pgx extensions\", what prevents a LANGUAGE plrust function from using any part of pgx?The plrust-trusted-pgx crate does!The plrust-trusted-pgx crate is a tightly-controlled \"re-export crate\" on top of pgx that exposes the bare minimum necessary forPL/Rust user functions to compile along with the bare minimum, safe features of pgx.The crate is versioned independently to both pgx and plrust and is published on crates.io.By default, the version a plrust user function will use is that of the one set in the project repository when plrust itselfis compiled. However, the plrust.trusted_pgx_version GUC can be set to specify a specific version.The intent is that plrust-trusted-pgx can evolve independently of both pgx and plrust.There are a few \"unsafe\" parts of pgx exposed through plrust-trusted-pgx, but PL/Rust's ability to block unsaferenders them useless by PL/Rust user functions. plrust-trusted-pgx's docs are available on docs.rs.What about Rust compiler bugs?PL/Rust uses its own rustc driver which enables it to apply custom lints to the user's LANGUAGE plrust function.In general, these lints will fail compilation if the user's code uses certain code idioms or patterns which we know tohave \"I-Unsound\" issues.PL/Rust contains a small set of lints to block what the developers have deemed the most egregious \"I-Unsound\" Rust bugs.Should new Rust bugs be found, and detection lints are developed for PL/Rust, the lints can be applied to new user function compilations along with ensuring that future function executions had those lints applied at compile time.Note that this is done on a best-effort basis, and does not provide a strong level of security \u2014\u00a0it's not a sandbox,and as such, it's likely that a skilled hostile attacker who is sufficiently motivated could find ways around it(PostgreSQL itself is not a particularly hardened codebase, after all). You should ensure such actors cannot execute SQLon your database, but to be clear: this is true regardless of whether or not PL/Rust is installed. Having said that, anyissues found with our implementation will be taken seriously,\u00a0and should bereported appropriately.Trusted with postgrestd on Linux x86_64/aarch64The \"trusted\" version of PL/Rust uses a unique fork of Rust's std entitledpostgrestd when compiling LANGUAGE plrust user functions. postgrestd isa specialized Rust compilation target which disallows access to the filesystem and the host operating system. The Install PL/Rust section outlines the steps required fortrusted install of PL/Rust.Currently, postgrestd is only supported on Linux x86_64 and aarch64 platforms.When plrust user functions are compiled and linked against postgrestd, they are prohibited from using thefilesystem, executing processes, and otherwise interacting with the host operating system.In order for PL/Rust to use postgrestd, its Rust compilation targets must be installed on the Postgres server.This happens via plrust'splrust/build script, which clones postgrestd, compiles it, bydefault, for both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures, and ultimately places a copy of the necessary libraries used byRust for std into the appropriate \"sysroot\", which is the location that rustc will look for building thoselibraries.The trusted Feature FlagPL/Rust has a feature flag simply named trusted. When compiled with the trusted feature flag PL/Rust willalways use the postgrestd targets when compiling user functions.Again, this is only supported on x86_64 and aarch64 Linux systems.postgrestd and the trusted feature flag are not supported on other platforms.As such, PL/Rust cannot be considered fully trusted on those platforms.If the trusted feature flag is not used when compiling PL/Rust, which is the default, then postgrestd is notused when compiling user functions, and while they'll still benefit from Rust's general compile-time safetychecked, forced usage of the plrust-trusted-pgx crate, and PL/Rust's unsafe blocking, they will be able to access thefilesystem and communicate with the host operating system, as the user running the connected Postgres backend(typically, this is a user named postgres).PL/Rust is also a Cross CompilerIn this day and age of sophisticated and flexible Postgres replication, along with cloud providers offeringPostgres on, and replication to, disparate CPU architectures, it's important that plrust, since it stores the userfunction binary bytes in a database table, support running that function on a replicated Postgres server of adifferent CPU architecture.cross compilation has entered the chatBy default, PL/Rust will not perform cross compilation. It must be installedand enabled through configuration.Configuring a host to properly cross compile is a thing that can take minimal effort to individual feats ofheroic effort. Reading the (still in-progress) pgx cross compile guide can help. Generally speaking, it's not too awful to setup on Debian-based Linux systems, such as Ubuntu. Basically,you install the \"cross compilation toolchain\" apt package for the other platform.",

Developers can now use Rust to write database functions for defining custom types, implementing custom operators, and other functions that can run at machine speed, without relying on untested third-party C code. The trusted status enables cloud providers like RDS and Supabase to provide it in their setups. The implementation blocks file system access and is secure, but the Rust implementation is vulnerable to safety issues just like any other language. Some cloud vendors aim to add PL/Rust to their platforms in the coming months.PL/Rust is a procedural language for writing PostgreSQL functions in Rust, with top advantages including exceptional performance, access to Rust's development ecosystem, and Rust's compile-time safety guarantees. However, support for event triggers and DO blocks has not yet been incorporated, which may limit its optimization for computational triggers in bulk operations. In-database computation using Rust can be advantageous, especially for video similarity search and smaller, more efficient types that lead to improved database performance.

Elon Musk made a statement accusing Substack of scraping Twitter and trying to download a massive portion of their database, but experts find the statement incomprehensible and several levels of nonsense. The block is not based on IP addresses, but domain names and keywords, with searches for Substack, misspelled or not, returning incorrect results. The Streisand effect is in play, with Musk's actions catapulting Substack Notes to the forefront despite being a comparatively tiny company that has yet to launch.Elon Musk's tweet about Substack recent scandal raises eyebrows, but many dismiss it as his usual antics. Despite accusations of substack scraping Twitter's database, Substack CEO denies improper use of Twitter APIs. Some HN users point out that this is similar to the tactic of modern corporate cancel culture, and that even Twitter's reports are unlikely to catch their scraping. While some argue that Substack is better than Twitter for hosting healthier business models, others say the company is just like Twitter, fueled by ads and low-quality content aimed at appealing to the masses. Elon's actions may be a part of his plan to appear technically incompetent in public.Twitter is facing criticism for replacing the term \"substack\" with \"newsletter\" in search results, and for previously banning the mention of non-Twitter usernames. Elon Musk has been involved in controversies related to Twitter's moderation decisions, which some say contradict the company's mission of supporting free speech. Some users express concern about Substack's plans to add a newsfeed feature which might lead to low-quality clickbait content. Some HN users speculate that Elon Musk may have bipolar disorder, while others make sarcastic comments about his recent Twitter spats.Elon Musk's tweet linking to a Substack article was reportedly blocked by Twitter, leading to criticism of Twitter's API usage policies; however, Twitter is well known for taking measures to prevent what they consider \"API abuse.\" There may be censored/redirected terms in Twitter search related to Substack as well. Furthermore, if Substack releases a Twitter clone, it remains unclear how many Twitter users will migrate to this new platform or stay on Twitter. As Twitter and Substack continue to compete, it remains to be seen how the situation will evolve, and people are exploring alternative microblogging protocols to avoid such centralized censorship altogether.Amidst criticisms against Elon Musk for banning Substack links on Twitter, some users point out that similar requests have been made by other companies in the past. Others resist turning the issue into a spectacle and suggest a need to hold leadership accountable.

The site continues to develop its shadow library and, following a successful fundraiser, now plans to expand its services to the physical book market. Z-Library envisions a book 'sharing' market, where its millions of users can pick up paperbacks at dedicated \"Z-Points\" around the globe.With more than 12 million books in its archive, Z-Library advertised itself as the largest repository of pirated books on the Internet.The site has millions of regular readers who find a wealth of free knowledge and entertainment at their fingertips.This success was briefly interrupted late last year when the U.S. Government seized the site\u2019s main domain names. The enforcement action also led to the arrest of two alleged Russian operators of the site, who now find themselves at the center of a criminal investigation.A crackdown of this magnitude usually marks the end of a pirate site, but Z-Library appears to be going in the opposite direction. The site has made a full comeback with a more \u2018censorship-resistant\u2019 setup and recently collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations. Next Up: Sharing Paper BooksIn a new message, posted this week, Z-Library thanks its userbase for their generous contributions, noting that it secured all the necessary funds to ensure continued development. Apparently, this includes support for offline sharing. In addition to offering millions of ebooks, Z-Library says that it\u2019s working on a new service that will help users to share physical copies with each other. \u201cBooks you have read should not gather dust on your shelf \u2013 instead, they can get a second life in the hands of new readers! This helps to preserve the literary heritage and spread the knowledge and ideas contained in books to more people,\u201d they write. Z-PointsThe book lending concept, commonly known as a library, is a few hundred years old already, but Z-Library will upgrade both scale and reach. The idea is to create a global market with dedicated pick-up points for user-donated books.\u201c[W]e want to organize \u2018Z-Points\u2019 \u2013 collection and storage points for books that will be the link between those who share their books and those who need them. \u201cBook owners who are willing to share them with other users can send books to the nearest Z-Point in their region. And those who need books stored in these points will be able to receive them for their use.\u201dThis sounds like a P2P competitor for traditional libraries. Interestingly, however, Z-Library believes that existing libraries are ideally suited to become Z-Points. People can also volunteer to run a Z-Point from their own homes. Running a book lending point will require quite a bit of storage space and organizational effort so fulfillment centers and third-party logistics services are also welcome to join in.By Users, For UsersThe Z-Point idea is still in the planning phase. According to Z-Library, users will be able to send books by mail. These can then be loaned by others and/or sent by mail when requested. This proposal is quite different from the traditional pirate ebook library Z-Library offers now. And loaning a book to someone is generally not seen as copyright infringement either unless it\u2019s a copied ebook. Whether there\u2019s a market for this plan and if it will ever come to fruition has yet to be seen, but based on the comments we\u2019ve read so far, plenty of people seem to like it. Soon after the announcement was made public, hundreds of enthusiastic responses started rolling in. If anything, it shows the global scale of the site, with people suggesting Vietnam, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia, Iran, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Spain India, Argentina, Egypt, France, Ethiopia, China, and Ghana as ideal Z-Point locations.Questions and SuggestionsThe announcement was posted several days after April 1st, so it appears to be serious. That said, there are plenty of questions that remain unanswered. What are the legal implications, for example, and who covers the costs?\u201cThe idea is good but like how would you deal with the logistics and also with cost? Especially when the team is facing legal pursuit how can you hide your identities and do it?[sic]\u201d one commenter writes.Other commenters pointed out that, in many countries, people already organize free libraries to collect and donate books to local communities. Some of these are organized and promoted through the \u201cLittle Free Library\u201d project.The Z-Library team says that it welcomes comments and suggestions. For now, there are no concrete plans, but a seed has been planted.Next PostPrevious PostTagged In:z-libraryzlibraryYou Might Also Like:PiracyZ-Library Raises Tens of Thousands of Dollars to Keep its Pirate Library RunningMarch 30, 2023, 09:02 by Ernesto Van der SarPiracyZ-Library Returns on the Clearnet in Full Hydra-ModeFebruary 13, 2023, 11:55 by Ernesto Van der SarAnti-PiracyZ-Library Knockoffs Trigger Dubious DMCA TakedownsDecember 17, 2022, 20:46 by Ernesto Van der SarSubmit a correction or tip.SponsorsPopular Posts\u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate SitesUS Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming SitesWhich VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously in 2023?SPARKS Piracy Busts: Facts, Rumors & Fear Point to Something HugeFrom 2 Years ago\u2026Are Cops Playing Music While Being Filmed to Trigger Copyright Filters?Corel Wrongly Accuses Licensed User of Piracy, Disables Software RemotelyPirate Bay Takes Over Distribution of Censored 3D Printable GunTorrentFreak Stats14336Breaking news stories179kSocial media followers19.9kRSS subscribersCopyright\u00b7 Privacy Policy\u00b7 VPN Providers\u00b7 About TorrentFreak",

Some expressed skepticism about the success of past plans by entities primarily involved in illegal activity to launch massive real-world initiatives, while others noted the value of libraries and shared access to books in promoting the continued acceleration of human development.E-book licensing model appears cheap, except big publishers have metered licensing, requiring repurchase every 1-2 years. Prices usually vary between 1x-3x the physical price depending on publisher, popularity, and date of publication. Consumers can buy ebooks at 0.5x to 1x of paperback price, while library budgets focus on spending majority on bestsellers. The concept of a library is not new, but there is an increasing recent focus on bestsellers with unfortunate consequences.

    "hn_content": "Perseus, a NextJS alternative written in Rust, is being discussed on Hacker News. Some users prefer using JavaScript for front-end development because Rust's tooling and borrow checker can be cumbersome. However, several commenters note that Rust is making inroads in the lower levels of the JS stack, and Rust frameworks like Perseus could benefit by incorporating JS/TS as a last-mile scripting language. Some developers think that using Typescript could even be a gateway to Rust, whereas others believe that Rust is too expensive to adopt for wider adoption.An analysis shows that Rust has the fastest cold starts of AWS Lambda, while Go is not far behind on warm starts, though these are only for hello world programs without I/O. Some users believe that Go's cold start is slower because it has a runtime to boot up before executing the first line of code in process exec. However, Rust is versatile and could end up being great for almost any task given a few more years to mature its frameworks. Meanwhile, some users feel like they are wasting their time by not learning Rust or Zig.Experts discuss the merits of learning Rust versus Go. Some see Rust as more suitable for low-level programming and system and tooling work, while others view Go as better suited for web development due to its simpler dynamic dispatch and garbage collector. One user suggests learning a variety of languages to broaden horizons, while another emphasizes the importance of fun in programming. The consensus is that the value of a programming language depends on where one lives and wants to work.The article discusses the adoption of Rust as a good language for major projects, with less issues of package abandonment, and is future safe due to recent developments. However, Rust jobs may be less common in certain regions, so some may not see the value in learning the language. The article also mentions Perseus, a state-driven web development framework for Rust that recently went stable. There is confusion around what \"state-driven\" means, but it is similar to React. The discussion also touches on the difference between server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) and how to apply them to different infrastructure.A discussion on Hacker News centers around new ways of client web app development that combine server-side rendering for performance with dynamic client handling for interactivity. While there are concerns about scalability, at scale, cloud computing services like Cloudflare Workers and CloudFront offer alternatives to Vercel's pricing model. Notably, there is debate over the distinction between static site generators (SSGs) and server-rendered apps (SSRs), with static internationalization (i18n) possible with SSGs. Despite the advantages of SSGs, server-side development requires more complex infrastructure, with implications for hosting, personalization, security, and performance.Discussion on the difference between server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) in NextJS. While some users view SSG as a static website, it is actually more complex and allows for pre-generating files per path, providing benefits of SSR on the first page load. However, the distinction between SSR and SSG is critical for infrastructure planning, and some users feel that it is being downplayed. NextJS has both SSG and SSR capabilities, but some commenters argue that they should not be completely separate. Additionally, some users question the idea that SSG is always more limited than SSR.The release of a new full-stack framework that compiles front-end to WebAssembly in Rust called Perseus has caught the attention of tech-savvy individuals with a substantial interest in a further middleground between traditional full-stack frameworks Next, SvelteKit, and Fresh; but has yet to catch on with wider audiences. Users have commented on the code apparently requiring a considerable amount of boilerplate and being somewhat tough for real-world usage, yet has potential to be a faster alternative to Svelte due to Sycamore, offering an alternative to NextJS despite some feature discrepancies, and being disruptive in web-based industries.HN users discuss the importance of finding the right tool for the job and note that there are REST APIs and frontend frameworks for almost every programming language, but Rust has better marketing. One user asks if there is an equivalent to a Prolog package in Go, while another points out that Next.js uses a compiler written in Rust. However, another user raises concerns about the practicality of replacing JS code with a stack that requires a different language and how to build plugins for rustified frameworks and build systems.",

I told you: tiny theory.Painting in really broad strokes, though, I'd say that type 1 doesn't take people into account and type 2 knows that at the heart of all of their engineering work (and problems) are people.Type 1 believes in capital E Engineering, where there are cold, hard truths; there's math & physics; it's applied science. It's what you see in The Martian.Type 2 would probably ask: \"yeah, but what if the guy in The Martian didn't have to build this stuff for himself but for others?\"Now, as you might have noticed, I'm not-so-subtly hinting at the fact that the type 2 engineer knows a bit more but maybe you also wonder whether you can\u2019t smell a hint of cynicism in there and think that it's me admitting defeat \u2014 we can't build nice things because it all becomes a mess as soon as people are involved.Here's the kicker though: it's the opposite! It's not cynicism, type 2 engineering is embracing the fact that we build with and for people and taking on an even bigger challenge of doing work despite the chaos this produces.Because, see, when it gets messy, that's where it gets real; that\u2019s where the actual work begins, when you go from drawing board to actually shipping something of value and with impact to someone.It's embracing the fact that people are not machines and no matter how often they say they're rational thinkers, you still know that even the strongest choose-the-best-tool-for-the-job advocates will sometimes choose a tool because, well, the GIF in the README was cooler. It's knowing that no one will read your documentation if you don't make it entertaining and easy to read. It's leveraging the fact that people will install security updates to get new emojis. It's anticipating that, no, not everybody will follow the best practice because everybody has a Thursday afternoon that feels like it should be Friday evening.Let me add one more on top: I'd argue that it's precisely because of how messy it can get do the things we build become beautiful.Until next week!Thanks for reading Register Spill!

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post discusses the differences between two types of software engineers who approach their work with different mindsets. However, a Type 3 engineer is introduced: one that ignores the larger system and only focuses on writing software. The post highlights the problem of tech companies prioritizing growth and engagement over profitability and tangible improvements. Some commenters suggest that engineers must also understand and take responsibility for their product\u2019s definition, but good product management can still add value. The metaphor of software as a form of literacy is questioned by a commenter, and another compares Type 3 engineers with the failed idea that everyone will drive a car, so everyone should be able to fix a car.Software engineers may be myopic and arrogant, thinking they can solve any human problem through machines, but sometimes AI can solve problems that were previously unsolvable. Managers who think they can offload difficult tasks to employees have missed the tide, as coders are the new managers. Human fallacies impact both managers and engineers, and non-functional requirements are difficult to reflect in code. Software is giving organizations a generational opportunity to rework themselves, and success can often depend on one's manager. Attempts to automate humans through more rules and policies can lead to failure as companies get bigger.An HN user asks how to offload to silicon periodically creating a new private key to sign future releases, but keep it far away from builds until it's actually used, while putting its public key on the builds. Other users suggest solutions like Vault. Some comments diverge into discussions of the type of software engineer one is and the complexity of software created. One user acknowledges the need to reduce the best possible outcome of their work in favor of the best likely outcome, while others debate the merits of new versus boring technology.Developers should build a system that can handle the load that is expected and some scaling; overcomplicating software is not helpful. Without explicit focus on what the end user needs, overly complicated, half-assed products will be created. Documentation, especially for configuration and operation of the software, is often missing and can cause delays. Type 2 engineering embraces building with and for people, but some use it as an excuse to not do something or draw out simple conversations. The optimal approach is somewhere between Type 1 and Type 2 engineering.The article discusses the dichotomy of relying on people to follow rules versus implementing automated solutions. An executive's comment highlights the importance of striking a balance in designing mandatory tools, and some comments suggest that there may be problems not worth fixing through automation. The debate focuses on evaluating the extent to which formalized processes can guarantee that humans will follow the desired path. In the end, successful software engineering involves diagnosing the dynamics of both technical and social systems, knowing when to establish guidelines instead of rigid rules, and aligning everyone on common goals.A discussion on Hacker News reveals two types of software engineers, Type 1 who prioritize technical challenges over user experience, and Type 2 who consider people at the heart of their work; there is debate on whether one type is better than the other, but many believe both are necessary depending on the context; some suggest that the two types reflect the balance between innovation and stability in a team; discussions also touch on the importance of balancing risks, knowing one's target audience, and continuously questioning assumptions.Software engineers can be grouped into those who think in dichotomies and those who don't, but this categorization is overgeneralizing. One HN user suggests dividing engineers into \"naive\" and \"experienced.\" Another user states that the hardest problem in software engineering is non-technical, such as convincing people about a technical strategy. Some users note the importance of understanding the needs and dynamics of the larger business when working on software systems. One user emphasizes the need to find the root cause of a problem before proposing solutions. However, the article acknowledges the difficulty of generalization and urges readers to take the post as \"food (snack?) for thought.\"",

Readers are interested to know how relevant the content remains in 2021 and whether a new edition should be released. Some users suggest that outdated sections, including those discussing /proc, IDE and devices, should be updated in a new edition. Despite this, the book remains a relevant and useful resource for Linux API development. Users recommend brushing up on C before diving in, but still believe the content is accessible for those with basic knowledge.Aria2 is a download application that splits files to bypass server speed caps. The program allows users to resume downloads from where they left off, even when downloads temporarily pause. Advanced Linux Programming, despite the name, is not an advanced book but rather one for beginners. The book starts with a C \"Hello World\" chapter; while confusing, publishers often use \"advanced\" or \"beginner\" in the title for marketing purposes. Finally, a user points out that the book was published in 2001 when discussing \"Advanced Linux Programming.\"",

Responding to a point about government regulation as a barrier, another user countered by pointing out that American firms have been successful due to their domestic market alone and proximity to 'hotbeds of VC money', and that AI researchers must collaborate, and perform big data processing which only large capital investments can provide. Another user opined that an open source project would be necessary for academia to retain AI researchers and promote work that aims to benefit society as a whole, instead of merely benefiting corporate stockholders.An idea is proposed to develop AI while avoiding unaccountable parties controlling this powerful force for the generation of society's wealth and benefits. CERN's success as a multinational institution makes it an attractive candidate to handle the start of an AI project as a new phenomenon, although a model will need to be evolved. Some comments view this initiative as unnecessary as the market will provide corresponding incentives. It is also noted that the CERN model may not apply to AI, and notable researchers from EU taking a different path to secure AI's future. Kickstarter is not recommended as a funding source due to their opposition to some AI projects. The prevailing thought is that the funding required is beyond what can be raised through crowdfunding channels. AI is an interdisciplinary industry with interconnected issues, including energy supply stability, the non-monopolistic semiconductor industry, and the transformation of existing businesses, governments, and societies in general.",

These commands can be access by acombination of the tilde prefix (~) followed by the command.For example ~? print the help message containing all of the supported escapesequences:david@remote-host:~$ ~?Supported escape sequences: ~.  - terminate session ~B  - send a BREAK to the remote system ~R  - request rekey ~#  - list forwarded connections ~?  - this message ~~  - send the escape character by typing it twice(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)Pay extra attention to the last line;(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)This means that for the escape sequence to take effect a preceding newline isrequired.Also, a small note for people using a keyboard with a nordic layout; Totype the tilde character, press AltGr+^ <Space>.

See here.  + Just run `python awesome_chat.py --config lite.yaml` to experience it.+ [2023.04.01] We updated a version of code for building.## OverviewLanguage serves as an interface for LLMs to connect numerous AI models for solving complicated AI tasks!See our paper: [HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580), Yongliang Shen, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Dongsheng Li, Weiming Lu and Yueting Zhuang (the first two authors contribute equally)We introduce a collaborative system that consists of **an LLM as the controller** and **numerous expert models as collaborative executors** (from HuggingFace Hub). The workflow of our system consists of four stages:+ **Task Planning**: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks.+ **Model Selection**: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models hosted on Hugging Face based on their descriptions.+ **Task Execution**: Invokes and executes each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT.+ **Response Generation**: Finally, using ChatGPT to integrate the prediction of all models, and generate responses.## System Requirements### Default (Recommended)For `config.yaml`:+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS+ VRAM >= 24GB+ RAM > 12GB (minimal), 16GB (standard), 80GB (full)+ Disk > 284GB  + 42GB for `damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b` + 126GB for `ControlNet` + 66GB for `stable-diffusion-v1-5` + 50GB for others ### Minimum (Lite)For `lite.yaml`:+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS+ Nothing elseThe configuration `lite.yaml` does not require any expert models to be downloaded and deployed locally.

Then run the following commands:### For Server:```bash# setup envcd serverconda create -n jarvis python=3.8conda activate jarvisconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidiapip install -r requirements.txt# download models. Make sure that `git-lfs` is installed.cd modelsbash download.sh # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`. # run servercd ..python models_server.py --config config.yaml # required when `inference_mode` is `local` or `hybrid`python awesome_chat.py --config config.yaml --mode server # for text-davinci-003```Now you can access Jarvis' services by the Web API. + `/hugginggpt` --method `POST`, access the full service.+ `/tasks` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1.+ `/results` --method `POST`, access intermediate results for Stage #1-3.For example:```bash# requestcurl --location 'http://localhost:8004/tasks' \\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\--data '{  \"messages\": [    {      \"role\": \"user\",      \"content\": \"based on pose of /examples/d.jpg and content of /examples/e.jpg, please show me a new image\"    }  ]}'# response[{\"args\":{\"image\":\"/examples/d.jpg\"},\"dep\":[-1],\"id\":0,\"task\":\"openpose-control\"},{\"args\":{\"image\":\"/examples/e.jpg\"},\"dep\":[-1],\"id\":1,\"task\":\"image-to-text\"},{\"args\":{\"image\":\"-0\",\"text\":\"-1\"},\"dep\":[1,0],\"id\":2,\"task\":\"openpose-text-to-image\"}]```### For Web:We provide a user-friendly web page. After starting `awesome_chat.py` in a server mode, you can run the commands to communicate with Jarvis in your browser: - you need to install `nodejs` and `npm` first.- [ IMPORTANT ] if you are running the web client on another machine, you need set `http://{LAN_ip_of_the_server}:{port}/` to `web/src/api/hugginggpt.ts@Line=9`.- if you want to use the video generation feature, you need to compile `ffmpeg` manually with H.264.- you can switch to ChatGPT by `double click` on the setting icon!```bashcd webnpm installnpm run dev``````bash# Optional: Install ffmpeg# This command need be executed without errors.LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 output.mp4```### For GradioThe Gradio demo is now hosted on Hugging Face Space. You can also run the following commands to start the demo locally:```bashpython models_server.py --config config.gradio.yamlpython run_gradio_demo.py --config config.gradio.yaml# or run the HF Space as a Docker image (Build with `inference_mode=hibrid` and `local_deployment=standard`)docker run -it -p 7860:7860 --platform=linux/amd64 registry.hf.space/microsoft-hugginggpt:latest python app.py```### For CLI:You can also run Jarvis more easily in CLI mode:```bashcd serverpython awesome_chat.py --config config.yaml --mode cli```Examples of CLI mode:```Welcome to Jarvis! A collaborative system that consists of an LLM as the controller and numerous expert models as collaborative executors. Jarvis can plan tasks, schedule Hugging Face models, generate friendly responses based on your requests, and help you with many things. Please enter your request (`exit` to exit).[ User ]: Given a collection of image A: /examples/a.jpg, B: /examples/b.jpg, C: /examples/c.jpg, please tell me how many zebras in these picture?[ Jarvis ]: Based on your request, I have used several models to process the images you provided. For the image A: /examples/a.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text \"a cat sitting on a window sill looking out\". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box '/images/a3dc.jpg', which contains two objects with labels 'potted plant' and 'cat'. For the image B: /examples/b.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text \"two zebras standing in a field of dry grass\". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box '/images/f5df.jpg', which contains three objects with labels 'zebra'. For the image C: /examples/c.jpg, I used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text \"a zebra standing in a field of tall grass\". Then I used the object-detection model facebook/detr-resnet-50 to generate the image with predicted box '/images/69c7.jpg', which contains one object with label 'zebra'. Finally, I used the canny-control model canny-control to generate the image '/images/7e18.png' based on the image /examples/f.jpg. Therefore, there are four zebras in these pictures. Is there anything else I can help you with?[ User ]: Please answer all the named entities in the sentence: Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.[ Jarvis ]: Sure, I understand your request. Based on the inference results of the models, I will answer your request step by step. Firstly, I used the token-classification model dslim/bert-base-NER to recognize the named entities in the sentence. The inference result is that the named entities are Iron Man, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Then, I used the question-answering model deepset/roberta-base-squad2 to answer your request. The inference result is that there is no output since the context cannot be empty. Therefore, I cannot make it. I hope this answer your request. Is there anything else I can help you with?[ User ]: Please generate a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg[ Jarvis ]: Sure. I have generated a canny image based on /examples/f.jpg. To do this, I first used the image-to-text model nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning to generate the text description of the image, which is \"a herd of giraffes and zebras grazing in a field\". Then I used the canny-control model to generate the canny image of the original image, which is stored in the path \"/images/1ea2.png\". Finally, I used the canny-text-to-image model lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny to generate the canny image based on the text description and the canny image, which is stored in the path \"/images/ba66.png\". Do you need anything else?```## ConfigurationThe server-side configuration file is `server/config.yaml`, and some parameters are presented as follows:+ `model`: LLM, currently supports `text-davinci-003`. We are working on integrating more open-source LLMs.+ `inference_mode`: mode of inference endpoints + `local`: only use the local inference endpoints + `huggingface`: only use the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints **(free of local inference endpoints)** + `hybrid`: both of `local` and `huggingface`+ `local_deployment`: scale of locally deployed models, works under `local` or `hybrid` inference mode: + `minimal` (RAM>12GB, ControlNet only) + `standard` (RAM>16GB, ControlNet + Standard Pipelines) + `full` (RAM>42GB, All registered models)On a personal laptop, we recommend the configuration of `inference_mode: hybrid `and `local_deployment: minimal`. But the available models under this setting may be limited due to the instability of remote Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.## Screenshots## CitationIf you find this work useful in your method, you can cite the paper as below:  @article{shen2023hugginggpt,    title  = {HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace},    author = {Shen, Yongliang and Song, Kaitao and Tan, Xu and Li, Dongsheng and Lu, Weiming and Zhuang, Yueting},    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.17580},    year  = {2023}  }## Acknowledgement- [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/)- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)- [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)- [ChatGPT-vue](https://github.com/lianginx/chatgpt-vue)",

A user recommends a podcast about fusion energy. The article discusses how D-T fusion emits most of its energy as high-energy neutrons, and explains the need for a heat exchanger to capture that energy. A user debates the viability of commercial fusion, while another defends that new technologies are not necessarily commercially viable in their early stages. The spherical tokamak offers a solution to the high fixed costs of traditional tokamaks.Researchers have reportedly doubled the magnet strength in small-scale fusion tests with relatively low input energies. While fusion is theoretically promising, branding problems with fission could leave fusion with a comparative advantage if marketed as \"clean\". Waste from fusion is shorter-lived than that of fission reactors, and there is no danger of a runaway reaction as there is with fission. Spherical tokamaks are a state-of-the-art application tested recently: some users suggest that, while the design is compressed to the point of being spherical, the name \"spheromak\" is already taken.

It contained a secret room in purple that read \"Created by Warren Robinett,\" whose name was not recognized by Atari management. The designers' discontent led to the creation of Activision and Imagic. Atari's laid-back ethos was gone after it was sold to Warner Communications Inc., with CEO Ray Kassar coming in and undervaluing the designers.Atari designer Warren Robinett's creation of the first Easter egg in a video game is discussed by The Hustle, which provides context around the birth of this phenomena. The report refers to the tradition of designers including secret messages in arcade games in the 1970s and cites the motivation for this as a desire for recognition and individuality. Robinett's Easter egg has particularly elevated his status, selling 1 million copies of the game Adventure and being mentioned in Ernest Cline's book and subsequent Spielberg movie, Ready Player One.

    "content": "Developers should place error types near their unit of fallibility to ensure modular error handling. The article uses a hypothetical Rust library that implements the parsing of Blocks.txt in the Unicode Character Database as an example of how to properly handle error types. The article outlines common problems such as unhelpful error messages, inextensibility, and difficulty matching errors, that arise when error handling is not done correctly. To improve error handling, developers can leverage the .source() method, construct better error types with \"On from\" and \"nearness\", and aim for verbosity in error messages.The article discusses problems with big-enum error handling and introduces the principle of error types being located near their unit of fallibility. The example library's error type is split into three distinct types to improve extensibility and modularity, with each type having precise error matching and good backtraces. The library's I/O errors are better explained through a more structured error type design, and the .source() method is used to create more readable error messages. There are issues with hardcoded public enum data and non-modularity in big-enum error handling, which can cause confusion and difficulty when maintaining the code.The article discusses the importance of thoughtful error handling techniques to ensure resilient, reliable, and user-friendly systems in Rust programming. The author provides an example of a structure to use for error handling, emphasizing the significance of good backtraces, extensibility, inspectability, stability, and modularity. The article also acknowledges that the structure requires extra code and complexities but encourages the reader to view it as an opportunity to treat errors more seriously. The article concludes by suggesting that good error handling is worth learning and that it ultimately results in better systems.",

    "hn_content": "Rust's error messages are a significant reason for its popularity, but different use cases require different types of error messages. SNAFU, a Rust crate, encourages creating distinct error types and composing them to produce unique traces for each error. Providing detailed information as part of an error type enhances testing and allows callers to recover from specific errors. While detailed error reporting can be done without using distinct error types, separating errors by type can reduce error proliferation and make error handling easier for callers. However, developers must ensure they only expose as a public API the information that they are comfortable supporting.A discussion on error handling in Rust libraries suggests that logging and terminating may not be the best approach, due to its drastic nature. The primary use of error reporting is for debugging the library, but even library users may benefit from understanding the source of the error. It is a common failure to have documentation that only describes parts of a codebase without explaining its architecture and high-level information. Users suggest either having very granular errors or using opaque errors with good human-readable descriptions. Checked exceptions in Java are praised for their ability to communicate recoverable errors. The fatal flaw of Java is not having algebraic types.",

Thank you! reply  KenoFischer 5 hours ago        | parent | next [\u2013] Yes, it's useful when you're ssh'd into some production system somewhere and just want to get a quick sense of some data in memory instead of going through the steps of installing a full graphics stack (which fortunately is pretty much a one-liner in Julia also, but can take a few mins). reply  Tarrosion 4 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Yeah, I find it super useful when you want a maximally quick look at the shape of your data. Even if I'm local (ie not SSH'd onto a remote system where displaying graphics could be a hassle), using UnicodePlots can \"break my flow\" less than generating prettier plots in another window. reply  schneems 4 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I added comparative histograms (normalized to the same axis) for derailed benchmarks so that when I send a perf PR they get the distribution data in an accessible format.You can copy and paste it right into the comments or description.That\u2019s one use case. reply  IshKebab 4 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] You can normally add images to PRs though? reply  schneems 54 minutes ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] Turning the same data into an image provides no additional info and requires extra steps.

And if humanity should go extinct, leaving nothing but our legacy, the alien explorers who discover the ruins of our society would struggle to interpret human history without some great store of information to guide them.Maybe these postapocalyptic scenarios are far-fetched, but even if society is never, say, drowned by the seas in some climate-driven disaster, leaving the remnants of humanity clinging to a few small bits of land, the massive collection of knowledge accumulated by the Internet Archive, comprising millions of books, is an invaluable resource.By collecting and digitizing such a huge collection of works and lending them out online, the Internet Archive is making an incredible social contribution. The way the nonprofit manages that archive, however, has earned the wrath of book publishers. A few months into the coronavirus pandemic, when many physical libraries were closed, the IA began partnering with libraries to give users access to the IA\u2019s collection, and removed digital limits on its lending. Several book publishers sued in June 2020, alleging a violation of copyright; the IA discontinued the practice a short time later.Dan Cohen: Libraries need more freedom to distribute digital booksLast month, a federal court sided with the publishers; Judge John G. Koeltl wrote that the IA had simply \u201ccopied the Works in Suit wholesale for no transformative purpose and created ebooks that \u2026 competed directly with the licensed ebooks of the Works in Suit.\u201d The ruling went beyond this to say that controlled digital lending, or CDL, violates copyright law.That\u2019s significant, because for the past decade or so, many U.S. libraries have engaged in CDL, by which a limited number of digital copies, based on the number of physical copies a library possesses, are loaned out. Users lose access to these digital copies after a set period of time. The crux of the publishers\u2019 complaint is that they want to charge libraries fees for ebooks, and they can\u2019t do that if the Internet Archive is allowing those libraries to loan out its scanned copies for free. The ebook licenses that publishers sell to libraries, by contrast, have to be renewed after a fixed number of loans or a certain period of time, and they are highly profitable.\u201cThe Publishers reasonably expect to be compensated for the reproduction of their copyrighted works,\u201d Koeltl wrote, \u201cand IA stands to profit from its non-transformative exploitation of the Works in Suit.\u201d Although the IA is a nonprofit, Koeltl wrote that the IA benefits directly because it uses \u201cits Website to attract new members, solicit donations, and bolster its standing in the library community,\u201d and because it is paid whenever someone uses the website\u2019s \u201cBuy from Better World Books\u201d button to purchase from the IA-affiliated Better World Books store.The IA, in response, contends that it is doing nothing more than what libraries have traditionally done, loaning out copies of books it has bought. The only difference is that the copies are digital, rather than physical. But with CDL, the IA does not loan out more digital or physical copies than the IA has purchased. The Internet Archive also argues that there\u2019s no evidence this lending has affected the publishers\u2019 profits, which the judge concluded was irrelevant to the underlying legal matter. \u201cLibraries have been around for thousands of years; they are older than copyright law itself,\u201d the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing the IA, wrote in its brief. \u201cNever in the history of the United States have libraries needed to obtain special permission or to pay license fees to lend the books they already own.\u201dIf the ruling stands, the implications for libraries are disastrous. They will have to choose between purchasing licenses for ebooks from publishers for books they already carry every few years and expanding their collections. There should be a reasonable middle ground that is not publishers gouging libraries or giving away works for free en masse. If creating digital copies of books has \u201cno transformative purpose,\u201d it\u2019s also true that ebook-licensing-fee renewals are little more than rent-seeking: The works themselves are unchanged, but the nature of digital delivery allows publishers to charge people in new ways.Knowledge is too precious to be abandoned entirely to the whims of the profit motive. The Internet Archive\u2019s large collection of out-of-print books is safe; its handling of newer works is the subject of the lawsuit. But in between these two categories are those books to which publishers continue to hold rights but that are not profitable enough for them to digitize, and may be difficult to find in physical libraries. The recent bowdlerization of older works by authors such as Roald Dahl and Agatha Christie illustrates another dilemma: Unlike ebooks, which can be altered by the publisher anytime it chooses, scans of physical books preserve the original. That is a problem shared by any nonphysical media sold through a license: You don\u2019t really own it, so providers can restrict access or change the material in any manner they wish.As an author, I want to be paid for my work. If publishers cannot profit off book sales, they cannot pay authors, and if they cannot pay authors, fewer books will be written. But as an author, I have also found the Internet Archive incredibly useful, particularly as a way to consult books that are not in the public domain and are difficult to find.Xochitl Gonzalez: The librarians are not okayLike any library, the IA lends books, and in doing so, it helps other authors write more of them. There are few individual, physical places in which you can find Red Scare\u2013era studies on loyalty oaths, a collection of essays by Black writers on Louis Farrakhan written at the height of his popularity in the 90s, and lengthy 19th century justifications of American apartheid written by segregationists. Trying to access all these works in person might cost you several plane tickets. Although unlimited digital lending would unfairly prevent publishers and authors from profiting from their work, CDL seems like an appropriate compromise, one that resembles the way libraries already function.The Internet Archive provides an invaluable service in digitizing precious but less commercially viable books and lending them out, because insufficient demand means the publishers will simply not make them available, and finding and using them for research might require travel. Although publishers could plausibly argue that such lending interferes with their profits, in practice they will never try to make money off ebooks of these works.\u201cThese days, many patrons want and expect to have digital access to books. But publishers don\u2019t choose to make their full catalogs available through ebook licensing, and they can manipulate availability as well to prioritize certain authors, subjects, etc.,\u201d Corynne McSherry, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. \u201cWithout CDL, publishers will have unfair power over the future of books and libraries alike.\u201dThe IA is appealing the decision, but defeat could mean millions in damages as well as attorneys\u2019 fees for the publishers. McSherry noted that \u201cthere are legal provisions that allow damages to be limited where a library has acted on the good-faith belief that it was engaged in a lawful fair use, which the Internet Archive did, and does.\u201dEven if society never falls to the zombie hordes and the ruins of human civilization are never visited by alien archaeologists, the IA remains an irreplaceable resource for readers, scholars, and basically anyone who wants to learn. It is in such places that small sparks of inspiration have ignited eras of innovation and discovery. The fact that we can visit them without leaving our homes shouldn\u2019t make a huge difference.",
    "summary": "A federal court ruling that controlled digital lending (CDL) violates copyright law could have disastrous implications for libraries, including having to choose between purchasing expensive ebook licenses from publishers or expanding their collections; the Internet Archive (IA), a nonprofit organisation that loans out digital copies of the millions of books it has collected and digitised, has been at the centre of a lawsuit by several book publishers who sued it in 2020 alleging copyright infringement; and it was this CDL loaning model the court ruled against last month, which could have \"unfair power over the future of books and libraries alike,\" according to attorney Corynne McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing the IA in its appeal over the ruling.",

    "hn_content": "A recent article on The Atlantic about a court ruling that could harm the future of libraries has garnered attention on Hacker News. Some comments on the post suggest that the copyright laws that protect authors' interests are extended for too long, leading to large corporate publishers squatting on copyright for far too many decades. Others note that texts which are not protected by \"pre-emptive\" availability can disappear, leading to a loss of knowledge. Some even go so far as to suggest that copyright length should be cut significantly to prevent these harms.A recent ruling about controlled digital lending has sparked discussions on the topic of copyright law and public libraries. The judge concluded that lending CDL material was the legal matter and whether it affects the publisher's profits was not relevant. Some users suggest bringing a \"suit in equity\" petition against companies to provide proof of profit loss. Meanwhile, others argue that copyright law is unfair and inequitable and that the decision might increase the positive occurrence of changes being made. Some believe that copyright anarchy will reign in the presence of current decisions, while others state that libraries are public entertainment centers; the public should not be paying for them.Public libraries have been established to provide learning and piety, and were not initially designed to provide entertainment; however, libraries have adapted to their surroundings and have become places of public entertainment; libraries also need funding, which is given based on the services provided to their customers; libraries are important for communities, as they offer equal access to resources for all people, regardless of socioeconomic status; libraries have faced criticism for, at times, discarding works that may be the last remaining copies of certain niche, scholarly works.Libraries should focus on keeping books that are still relevant and in demand, using inter-library loans for niche or outdated material. Outdated books that aren't checked out should be weeded to make room for new books. The inter-library loan system is a cost-effective way to provide access to information. The act of discarding books is not new, but some people are not aware of it. Librarians do not get paid to destroy books, but may earn revenue from recycling them. Expert opinion guides the process of selecting books, but circulation stats are also important.Public libraries face the dilemma of discarding books to make space for new ones and donations. An HN user defends the process by pointing out the professional judgment required for decision-making. Guidelines recommend balancing circulation popularity, expert analysis of the book's value, and the library's mission. It is challenging to evaluate old books' relevance without ideological bias, but librarians can get help from local subject-area experts. Small and medium-sized public libraries are not research libraries and do not need to retain items for historical research. Public libraries are cultural assets and not just repositories for books. The article raises the question, \"How many authors would exist if there were never any libraries?\" The IA is pushing an idea for unlimited royalty-free digital distribution, which if normalized, could end writing as a profession, although AI-generated text may flood the market soon.Publishers are suing the Internet Archive (IA) for \"unlimited royalty-free digital distribution.\" IA insists that it wants digital first sale rights, linking digital copies to the number of physical copies owned. Sources believe controlled digital lending is illegal and also impose disadvantageous ebook lending terms on public libraries. The National Emergency Library (NEL) was perceived as the triggering factor for the lawsuit against IA after the former violated the digital lending control mechanism implemented by publishers. Controlled Digital Lending, however, could potentially endanger copyright laws' protection whilst furthering publishers' capitalisation on writers' earnings. Many authors reportedly earn minimum wages from their writings.An online discussion on a ruling regarding the Internet Archive's (IA) National Emergency Library (NEL) is more of a commentary than news. The discussion includes arguments about publishers acting as gatekeepers, and the inequitable nature of copyright law. Comments covered a range of topics, including paying workers, the impact of libraries, the thriving creative communities, and music and journalism industries undergoing a revolution. The IA lost the case when it admitted it had no controls in place with library partners and had a clear profit motive in linking to Better World Books. The discussions express concern about profit institutions pushing out artistic creativity.The post discusses a case related to digital lending, which has sparked ongoing debate. Some users argue that the information provided is not news and has been talked about extensively, while others claim that the submitted commentary offers new insights. The case involves the intersection of digital and physical ownership, with a profit motive involved. No new technology or releases are mentioned. However, the discussion provides a unique perspective on the issue at hand.",

Out of the identified illegal assets, prosecutors have linked about 91.4 billion won ($69 million) of the specified amount directly to Kwon.Although Kwon amassed millions, none of the assets tied to him are recoverable or under the jurisdiction of the South Korean authorities. This is mainly because the now-arrested former CEO reportedly converted most of the illicit funds into Bitcoin (BTC) using overseas crypto exchanges instead of investing in physical assets, per a report\u00a0published by local media outlet KBS.Early investigation into the Terra collapse by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that\u00a0Kwon siphoned nearly $100 million worth of Bitcoin from Terra post-collapse. In another report\u00a0based on an SEC interview with former Terraform Labs, published in South Korean media, Kwon was accused of siphoning $80 million a month before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.The South Korean authorities have requested Binance to halt any withdrawal request associated with Kwon. Binance confirmed to Cointelegraph that they are cooperating with the prosecutors and offering any assistance they need.\u00a0\u201cWe provided Korean LE authorities with the requested assistance. Since we cannot comment on ongoing LE investigations, for any further comment please reach out to the prosecutors.\u201cSouth Korean prosecutors are actively tracing properties associated with Terraform Labs executives to recover some illicit funds from the Terra debacle. On April 3, prosecutors seized homes and other assets to stop former Terra employees from selling things that might be tied to legal cases.In addition to the residences in Seoul owned by former CEO Shin Hyun-seong and others, the prosecutors also filed foreclosure actions against their foreign-registered vehicles, lands in Hwaseong and Gapyeong in Gyeonggi-do, and Taean in South Chungcheong Province.Related: Do Kwon faces fraud charges from US prosecutors hours after arrestTerra was a booming crypto ecosystem until its $40 billion collapse in May 2022. What was initially thought to be a market-triggered event turned out to be a clear case of fraud, with former CEO Kwon at the epicenter. According to on-chain data, In the 3 weeks leading up to the depeg of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, one entity dumped over $450 million of UST on the open market. Four days after the last sale, UST started collapsing. The entity behind the massive dump was none other than Terraform Labs. TFL has been perpetrating the narrative that UST was \"attacked\". This is a false flag. In reality, TFL themselves weakened the Curve pool by irresponsibly dumping a massive amount of UST in a short timeframe. This reduced liquidity and severely weakened the peg.\u2014 FatMan (@FatManTerra) December 6, 2022Despite an arrest warrant from South Korean authorities and an Interpol red notice against his name, Kwon continued to evade arrest for nearly a year before getting caught on March 23\u00a0in Montenegro. #Bitcoin #South Korea #Binance #Terra #Regulation Add reaction Add reaction Related News An overview of fake product detection using blockchain technology Islam and crypto: How digital assets can comply with Islamic financial law CBDCs will lead to absolute government control Is Binance in hot water?

    "content": "Andrew Kelley speaks on the challenges of balancing full-time employment with developing software on the side leading up to supporting oneself via open source work, how to deal with feedback, and the moral issues of commercial forking in the open source community, along with discussing his experiences with Zig - a programming language he developed for music studio projects which has since gained popularity. Kelley also delves in C programming, static linking, integer casting rules, and more.Andrew, the creator of the Zig programming language, was frustrated with certain aspects of C, including static linking and the abundance of unnecessary and preventable bugs. He also disliked the C pre-processor's complicated language and the toxic culture within the C community. Andrew's vision for Zig aimed to reduce the amount of information users needed to remember and create a less confrontational community. Zig has garnered interest and users over time, with projects such as the Pokemon rom randomizer being built on the language. Despite setbacks, Andrew dedicated time to developing Zig and now receives donations from Apple to the Zig Software Foundation.Andrew from the OKCupid code base stressed the importance of negotiating ownership of intellectual property (IP) in any spare time projects with employers. Andrew\u2019s open source project, Zig, which he worked on outside of his full-time job, grew to a point where he calculated he could quit his job and focus on Zig using a Patreon account for financial support. Andrew described the difficulties of having a full-time job and an open-source project, however, he also found that his open-source project helped him design compiler errors.Software developer Andrew Kelley's non-profit programming language Zig, founded to support charitable initiatives including anti-human trafficking NGO Exodus Cry, operates on an \"intrinsic\" driver rather than profit, Gallagher Woolf reports in an interview for Hacker Noon with Andrew and Zig's lead developer Adam Siska. Contributors to the free, open-source software include Zig's creators and\u00a0those who appreciate its \"horizontal\" approach to ensuring memory safety. While Zig shares LLVM dependencies with the memory-safe systems coding language Rust, Andrew says they can \"team up\" rather than compete.Zig aims to make pointers safer, allowing them to be optional rather than null, and taking into account alignment for more secure systems. The handling of undefined behavior is seen as a tool to catch bugs by Zig's creators, while allowing for optimization of code both with and without checks. The creation of a commercial fork of Zig was allowed under its MIT license, but the deceptive tactics used by the fork creators caused concern. Despite this, the fork's commercial status did not worry Zig's creator, who saw it as more of a curiosity.Zig's creator, Andrew Kelley, talks about the language's solution to the language barrier problem in technology, as well as his confidence in the project, despite initial claims that Zig was just a \"toy language\". Kelley envisions a world where operating system courses and textbooks focus on Zig as the programming language of choice, resulting in better performance, memory usage, and stability for applications. Kelley also gives advice for open source developers, encouraging self-funding projects and believing in the project's goals to gain support.Tech Times reports on various programming-focused video courses available on the web, varying from designing principles to incident response. The courses are led by acclaimed experts in the field, taking a net running time from 48 to 201 minutes. These courses can enable new insights into programming for the expert audience.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501718",
    "content": "![Supavisor](/docs/images/supavisor-banner.png)# Supavisor - Postgres connection pooler- [Overview](#overiew)- [Motivation](#motivation)- [Architecture](#architecture)- [Docs](#docs)- [Features](#features)- [Future work](#future-work)- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)- [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)- [Inspiration](#inspiration)## OverviewSupavisor is a scalable, cloud-native Postgres connection pooler. A Supavisor cluster is capable of proxying millions of Postgres end-client connections into a stateful pool of native Postgres database connections.For database managers, Supavisor simplifies the task of managing Postgres clusters by providing easy configuration of highly available Postgres clusters ([todo](#future-work)).## MotivationWe have several goals with Supavisor:- **Zero-downtime scaling**: we want to scale Postgres server compute with zero-downtime. To do this, we need an external Pooler that can buffer and re-route requests while the resizing operation is in progress.- **Handling modern connection demands**: We need a Pooler that can absorb millions of connections. We often see developers connecting to Postgres from Serverless environments, and so we also need something that works with both TCP and HTTP protocols.- **Efficiency**: Our customers pay for database processing power, and our goal is to maximize their database capacity. While PgBouncer is resource-efficient, it still consumes some resources on the database instance. By moving connection pooling to a dedicated cluster adjacent to tenant databases, we can free up additional resources to better serve customer queries.## ArchitectureSupavisor was designed to work in a cloud computing environment as a highly available cluster of nodes. Tenant configuration is stored in a highly available Postgres database. Configuration is loaded from the Supavisor database when a tenant connection pool is initiated.Connection pools are dynamic. When a tenant client connects to the Supavisor cluster the tenant pool is started and all connections to the tenant database are established. The process ID of the new tenant pool is then distributed to all nodes of the cluster and stored in an in-memory key-value store. Subsequent tenant client connections live on the inbound node but connection data is proxied from the pool node to the client connection node as needed.Because the count of Postgres connections is constrained only one tenant connection pool should be alive in a Supavisor cluster. In the case of two simultaneous client connections starting a pool, as the pool process IDs are distributed across the cluster, eventually one of those pools is gracefully shutdown.The dynamic nature of tenant database connection pools enables high availability in the event of node outages. Pool processes are monitored by each node. If a node goes down that process ID is removed from the cluster. Tenant clients will then start a new pool automatically as they reconnect to the cluster.This design enables blue-green or rolling deployments as upgrades require. A single VPC / multiple availability zone topologies is possible and can provide for greater redundancy when load balancing queries across read replicas are supported ([todo](#future-work)).## Docs- [Installation and usage](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor/wiki/Installation-and-Usage)- [Metrics](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor/wiki/Metrics)## Features- Fast - Within 90% throughput as compared to `PgBouncer` running `pgbench` locally- Scalable - 1 million Postgres connections on a cluster - 250_000 idle connections on a single 16 core node with 64GB of ram- Multi-tenant - Connect to multiple different Postgres instances/clusters- Single-tenant - Easy drop-in replacement for `PgBouncer`- Pool mode support per tenant - Transaction- Cloud-native - Cluster-able - Resilient during cluster resizing - Supports rolling and blue/green deployment strategies - NOT run in a serverless environment - NOT dependant on Kubernetes- Observable - Easily understand throughput by tenant, tenant database or individual connection - Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint- Manageable - OpenAPI spec at `/api/openapi` - SwaggarUI at `/swaggerui`- Highly available - When deployed as a Supavisor cluster and a node dies connection pools should be quickly spun up or already available on other nodes when clients reconnect- Connection buffering - Brief connection buffering for transparent database restarts or failovers## Future Work- Load balancing - Queries can be load balanced across read-replicas - Load balancing is independant of Postgres high-availability management (see below)- Query caching - Query results are optionally cached in the pool cluster and returned before hitting the tenant database- Session pooling - Like `PgBouncer`- Multi-protocol Postgres query interface - Postgres binary - HTTPS - Websocket- Postgres high-availability management - Primary database election on primary failure - Health checks - Push button read-replica configuration- Config as code - Not noly for the supavisor cluster but tenant databases and tenant database clusters as well - Pulumi / terraform support## Benchmarks### Local Benchmarks- Running `pgbench` on `PgBouncer` (transaction mode/pool size 60)```PGPASSWORD=postgres pgbench -M extended --transactions 100 --jobs 10 --client 100 -h localhost -p 6452 -U postgres postgrespgbench (15.2, server 14.6 (Debian 14.6-1.pgdg110+1))starting vacuum...end.transaction type: scaling factor: 1query mode: extendednumber of clients: 100number of threads: 10maximum number of tries: 1number of transactions per client: 100number of transactions actually processed: 10000/10000number of failed transactions: 0 (0.000%)latency average = 510.310 msinitial connection time = 31.388 mstps = 195.959361 (without initial connection time)```- Running `pgbench` on `Supavisor` (pool size 60, no logs)```PGPASSWORD=postgres pgbench -M extended --transactions 100 --jobs 10 --client 100 -h localhost -p 7654 -U postgres.localhost postgrespgbench (15.2, server 14.6 (Debian 14.6-1.pgdg110+1))starting vacuum...end.transaction type: scaling factor: 1query mode: extendednumber of clients: 100number of threads: 10maximum number of tries: 1number of transactions per client: 100number of transactions actually processed: 10000/10000number of failed transactions: 0 (0.000%)latency average = 528.463 msinitial connection time = 178.591 mstps = 189.228103 (without initial connection time)```### Load Test![Supavisor load test virtual users chart](./docs/images/load-test-vus.png)![Supavisor load test qps chart](./docs/images/load-test-qps.png)- Supavisor two node cluster - 64vCPU / 246RAM - Ubuntu 22.04.2 aarch64- 1_003_200 concurrent client connection- 20_000+ QPS- 400 tenant Postgres connection- `select * from (values (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')) as t (num,letter);`- ~50% CPU utilization (pool owner node)- 7.8G RAM usage## Acknowledgements[Jos\u00e9 Valim](https://github.com/josevalim) and the [Dashbit](https://dashbit.co/) team were incredibly helpful in informing the design decisions for Supavisor.## Inspiration- [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/)- [stolon](https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon)- [pgcat](https://github.com/levkk/pgcat)- [odyssey](https://github.com/yandex/odyssey)- [crunchy-proxy](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-proxy)- [pgpool](https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)- [pgagroal](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal)## Commercial Inspiration- [proxysql.com](https://proxysql.com/)- [Amazon RDS Proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/)- [Google Cloud SQL Proxy](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy)",

Now, a new film alleges that hundreds of his pieces of work can be traced to other artists.\u201cIt\u2019s called stealing,\u201d said comic strip artist Hy Eisman, who has just turned 96 and only recently discovered that Lichtenstein had reproduced one of his images in the 1960s. \u201cI worked like a dog on this stupid page and this guy has $20m to show for it. If it wasn\u2019t so tragic, it would be [funny].\u201dHe vents his anger in a new documentary, titled WHAAM! BLAM! Roy Lichtenstein and the Art of Appropriation, which shows that the original comic artists had lived austere and even destitute lives. While Lichtenstein\u2019s paintings sold for tens of millions of dollars, their originals had earned them just a few dollars.Eisman, who has worked for almost 75 years on a huge range of publications, most recently the Popeye comic strip, is among more than 30 comic artists \u201cappropriated\u201d by Lichtenstein and who believe that they were cheated of recognition.Recalling that his Private Secretary comic of 1963 was cribbed for Lichtenstein\u2019s Girl in Window of the same year, he told the Observer: \u201cI got paid very little for the page, something like $4. He was able to turn it into a painting and make millions. When I saw that he did that to other people, I thought it was a lousy thing to do. But until now I never thought I was involved.\u201dJames L Hussey, the documentary\u2019s director, said: \u201cEisman was unaware that Lichtenstein had appropriated his work until I contacted him. He was very shocked.\u201dRoy Lichtenstein\u2019s Blam of 1962, right, which was copied from a panel in Russ Heath\u2019s All-American Men of War #89. Photograph: Hussey-Cotton FilmsLichtenstein, who died in 1997, is widely regarded as one of the foremost artists of the 20th century. Along with Andy Warhol, he created the pop art movement by appropriating imagery from modern American culture. His work now changes hands for millions of dollars, with the most expensive, a painting called Masterpiece, reportedly selling for $165m.The documentary features comic book expert David Barsalou, who has traced about 300 Lichtenstein works to other artists: \u201cI thought, maybe there\u2019s only four, five or six paintings that he did close to the originals. But it was hard to describe my feelings as I started discovering more and more over the years that his images were like just direct copies.\u201dThey include Lichtenstein\u2019s Blam of 1962, in which a pilot ejects from an exploding plane, just like Russ Heath\u2019s All-American Men of War #89 of the same year.Heath was appreciated for the high quality of his work, but he struggled financially. He died in 2018, having ended his days relying on charity for his food.Michael Daley, a cartoonist, said: \u201cComic book artists are rightly aggrieved. Aside from outright plagiarisms, technically and artistically, they are generally far better draughtsmen than Lichtenstein, who couldn\u2019t even correctly copy the properly drawn ellipse of a jet engine\u2019s air intake. They were also superior in their artfully dynamic and expressive compositions, every one being a master of the graphic potency of a cropped image.\u201dBut Bradford R Collins, author of the book Pop Art and professor of art history at the University of South Carolina, defended Lichtenstein: \u201cIt\u2019s not plagiarism. It\u2019s appropriation. With plagiarism, you\u2019re stealing somebody\u2019s work and using it for the same purpose they did. If Lichtenstein made comic books out of it, that would be stealing. But appropriation means you\u2019re taking something and reusing it for a very different purpose, taking something out of a comic book and making it into a painting.\u201cI can understand why Eisman would feel angry. I would feel the same way. But artistically, it\u2019s not plagiarism.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Art WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, if they want to sue, they could sue and have a legitimate reason to sue. But they wouldn\u2019t make enough to bother having a suit.\u201dRoy Lichtenstein\u2019s Girl in Window, 1963, left, and a panel by Hy Eisman in the Private Secretary comic of the same year. Photograph: Hussey-Cotton FilmsIn the documentary, a lawyer argues that Lichtenstein\u2019s work would be considered transformative because in most instances he added new elements rather than making an exact copy.Lichtenstein himself said: \u201cMy work has been accused of looking like the things that I copy, and it certainly does look like the things I copy\u2026 But it is that quality, whatever art is, that transforms the work of art to be something different.\u201dHussey said: \u201cWhen Lichtenstein did this in the 1960s, he was selling these paintings for thousands of dollars. That was an irritant to a lot of these comic artists. But the bitterness grew.\u201cAs the years went by and as they moved into retirement, not only were they struggling financially, but they were also watching these paintings rise dramatically in value.\u201dTopicsRoy LichtensteinThe ObserverComics and graphic novelsPlagiarismPaintingArtReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFilmBooksMusicArt & designTV & radioStageClassicalGamesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The documentary alleges that over 30 comic artists were \"appropriated\" by the founder of the pop art movement, who made millions from selling his work, whilst the original artists who were copied lived austere and even destitute lives. While some defend Lichtenstein's work as \"appropriation\", critics call it stealing, with \"outright plagiarisms\" cited alongside \"technically and artistically\" superior works copied by Lichtenstein.",

    "hn_content": "New allegations of plagiarism against artist Roy Lichtenstein have sparked a discussion on the appropriateness and creativity of his work in the art world. While some consider his work transformative, others find it to be blatant stealing with minimal changes to existing scenes and images. Some HN users wonder what would happen if Lichtenstein's work were copied and appropriated, and whether the Lichtenstein estate could argue against such actions when many of their own pieces utilized similar tactics. The accusations of plagiarism highlight the importance of ethics and originality in the artistic community.The article discusses how art is always a product of its context and how it's often difficult to appreciate radical art of the past because it changed art so dramatically that we now take it for granted. However, some commenters argue that the artists didn't do enough to advocate for \"low\" artists, especially considering the elitism they were rebelling against. Other commenters discuss the subjectivity of art and the importance of intent. There is also a debate about whether \"appropriating\" artists should credit the original source or not, and whether the transformative nature of the art justifies not crediting the original.Controversy surrounds Roy Lichtenstein following claims that he copied existing comic book artwork and claimed it as his own, without giving adequate credit to the original artists. While some argue that Lichtenstein transforming low-value art into high-prestige art is common in the art world, others question whether he crossed a line in terms of intellectual property. The case is similar to that of Shepard Fairey's Hope, which didn't meet the bar for being transformative, or Andy Warhol's effect on Prince's photo. The arguments extend to whether or not the artwork was fair use or a copyright violation.Roy Lichtenstein's artwork, which appropriates comic book panels, has been criticised for plagiarising the work of original comic book artists like\u00a0Tony Abruzzo, who created the comic book panels used in Lichtenstein's Drowning Girl. Some have defended Lichtenstein's work, arguing that he transformed cultural detritus into something considered beautiful and relevant by the high-art community. In any case, copyright and intellectual property concerns come into play; along with issues surrounding the cultural value placed on comic book art vs fine art.HN users discuss the legitimacy of Roy Lichtenstein's art, which was created by redrawing and reimagining comic book panels. Some argue that it's not stealing since Lichtenstein found a new market and marketed the art in a new way, while others believe it is copyright infringement. The debate delves into the nature of art, creation, and value in the art world. Many argue that all art is derivative and that Lichtenstein's work is no different. However, others argue that it's not about copying but about the intention and creativity behind the work. Ultimately, opinions are divided, with some seeing Lichtenstein's work as transformative and others seeing it as unoriginal.The post discusses the issue of copyright in the comic industry and how artist Roy Lichtenstein's unique marketing strategy was pivotal to modern culture, despite criticisms of him \"stealing\" from other artists. Some commenters argue that copyright laws were not properly enforced or defended, while others note the blurred line between imitation and theft in the art world. The post also highlights the fact that the original comic book artists were often viewed as lowly-paid commodities, and the publishers had no interest in turning them into respected artists. The comments include a mix of opinions on the topic, with some arguing that certain actions can still be considered theft even if they are not legally enforceable.",
