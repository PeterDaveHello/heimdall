    "originBody": "November 11, 2023 3 Comments In the summer of 2022, KrebsOnSecurity documented the plight of several readers who had their accounts at big-three consumer credit reporting bureau Experian hijacked after identity thieves simply re-registered the accounts using a different email address. Sixteen months later, Experian clearly has not addressed this gaping lack of security. I know that because my account at Experian was recently hacked, and the only way I could recover access was by recreating the account. Entering my SSN and birthday at Experian showed my identity was tied to an email address I did not authorize. I recently ordered a copy of my credit file from Experian via annualcreditreport.com, but as usual Experian declined to provide it, saying they couldn’t verify my identity. Attempts to log in to my account directly at Experian.com also failed; the site said it didn’t recognize my username and/or password. A request for my Experian account username required my full Social Security number and date of birth, after which the website displayed portions of an email address I never authorized and did not recognize (the full address was redacted by Experian). I immediately suspected that Experian was still allowing anyone to recreate their credit file account using the same personal information but a different email address, a major authentication failure that was explored in last year’s story, Experian, You Have Some Explaining to Do. So once again I sought to re-register as myself at Experian. The homepage said I needed to provide a Social Security number and mobile phone number, and that I’d soon receive a link that I should click to verify myself. The site claims that the phone number you provide will be used to help validate your identity. But it appears you could supply any phone number in the United States at this stage in the process, and Experian’s website would not balk. Regardless, users can simply skip this step by selecting the option to “Continue another way.” Experian then asks for your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, email address and chosen password. After that, they require you to successfully answer between three to five multiple-choice security questions whose answers are very often based on public records. When I recreated my account this week, only two of the five questions pertained to my real information, and both of those questions concerned street addresses we’ve previously lived at — information that is just a Google search away. Assuming you sail through the multiple-choice questions, you’re prompted to create a 4-digit PIN and provide an answer to one of several pre-selected challenge questions. After that, your new account is created and you’re directed to the Experian dashboard, which allows you to view your full credit file, and freeze or unfreeze it. At this point, Experian will send a message to the old email address tied to the account, saying certain aspects of the user profile have changed. But this message isn’t a request seeking verification: It’s just a notification from Experian that the account’s user data has changed, and the original user is offered zero recourse here other than to a click a link to log in at Experian.com. If you don’t have an Experian account, it’s a good idea to create one. Because at least then you will receive one of these emails when someone hijacks your credit file at Experian. And of course, a user who receives one of these notices will find that the credentials to their Experian account no longer work. Nor do their PIN or account recovery question, because those have been changed also. Your only option at this point is recreate your account at Experian and steal it back from the ID thieves! In contrast, if you try to modify an existing account at either of the other two major consumer credit reporting bureaus — Equifax or TransUnion — they will ask you to enter a code sent to the email address or phone number on file before any changes can be made. Reached for comment, Experian declined to share the full email address that was added without authorization to my credit file. “To ensure the protection of consumers’ identities and information, we have implemented a multi-layered security approach, which includes passive and active measures, and are constantly evolving,” Experian spokesperson Scott Anderson said in an emailed statement. “This includes knowledge-based questions and answers, and device possession and ownership verification processes.” Anderson said all consumers have the option to activate a multi-factor authentication method that’s requested each time they log in to their account. But what good is multi-factor authentication if someone can simply recreate your account with a new phone number and email address? Several readers who spotted my rant about Experian on Mastodon earlier this week responded to a request to validate my findings. The Mastodon user @Jackerbee is a reader from Michican who works in the biotechnology industry. @Jackerbee said when prompted by Experian to provide his phone number and the last four digits of his SSN, he chose the option to “manually enter my information.” “I put my second phone number and the new email address,” he explained. “I received a single email in my original account inbox that said they’ve updated my information after I ‘signed up.’ No verification required from the original email address at any point. I also did not receive any text alerts at the original phone number. The especially interesting and egregious part is that when I sign in, it does 2FA with the new phone number.” The Mastodon user PeteMayo said they recreated their Experian account twice this week, the second time by supplying a random landline number. “The only difference: it asked me FIVE questions about my personal history (last time it only asked three) before proclaiming, ‘Welcome back, Pete!,’ and granting full access,” @PeteMayo wrote. “I feel silly saving my password for Experian; may as well just make a new account every time.” I was fortunate in that whoever hijacked my account did not also thaw my credit freeze. Or if they did, they politely froze it again when they were done. But I fully expect my Experian account will be hijacked yet again unless Experian makes some important changes to its authentication process. It boggles the mind that these fundamental authentication weaknesses have been allowed to persist for so long at Experian, which already has a horrible track record in this regard. In December 2022, KrebsOnSecurity alerted Experian that identity thieves had worked out a remarkably simple way to bypass its security and access any consumer’s full credit report — armed with nothing more than a person’s name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number. Experian fixed the glitch, and acknowledged that it persisted for nearly seven weeks, between Nov. 9, 2022 and Dec. 26, 2022. In April 2021, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how identity thieves were exploiting lax authentication on Experian’s PIN retrieval page to unfreeze consumer credit files. In those cases, Experian failed to send any notice via email when a freeze PIN was retrieved, nor did it require the PIN to be sent to an email address already associated with the consumer’s account. A few days after that April 2021 story, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that an Experian API was exposing the credit scores of most Americans.

Banks, businesses and employers should be prohibited from sharing your personal information with third parties.I live in Switzerland, where this is the case. Even the government doesn&#x27;t get this information. If the government thinks you&#x27;re cheating on your taxes, they have to use warrants and follow the same procedures as for any other crime.The only financial records accessible are records of legal debt collection actions (\"Betreibungen\"). Before offering someone credit, you can find out if other people had to sue them to collect.Yet, even with so little information - without credit reporting agencies - everything works just fine.FWIW, due to international pressure (things like FATCA), Swiss law was changed so that banks do report on international customers. reply namdnay 3 hours agoparent“Everything works just fine”It definitely worked great for a lot of dictators, tax cheats and the sort… I think Switzerland is a great example of why complete privacy isn’t fair on ordinary taxpayers - it allows the ultra-rich to hide what they owe reply cmutel 40 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m an American living in Switzerland for over 10 years, and this was definitely my impression as well. But that isn&#x27;t really the case anymore here - you can no longer have anonymous (i.e. only numbered) accounts, and Switzerland is no longer a preferred locations for dirty money.The ironic thing is that one of those new hot spots, in addition to the usual suspects like Cyprus, the Caribbean, etc., is the USA. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2021&#x2F;wyo... for some juicy details. reply stavros 15 minutes agorootparentAs far as I know, Cyprus complies with FATCA&#x2F;CRS as much as anyone else (unless the \"anyone else\" is, as you say, the US). reply emodendroket 2 hours agorootparentprevAdditionally the “international pressure” the OP alludes to is since Swiss banks were the banks of choice international crime, including whichever activity you think might be most heinous. reply mise_en_place 2 hours agorootparentprevPrior to 1913 the IRS didn&#x27;t exist. The US seemed to do just fine before then. Tarrifs are the best way for the government to raise revenues. Especially when you are doing business with hostile countries like China. Please do educate yourself on US history before making such comments about privacy. reply emodendroket 2 hours agoparentprevI would say this problem would also be solved if we stopped pretending that a Social Security number was a serious substitute for secure national ID. reply crotchfire 2 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s an easy way to do that: pass a law exempting Social Security Numbers from all identity theft and fraud laws.Make it completely legal and tort-free to lie about social security numbers anytime, anywhere, except when dealing directly with the government (i.e. filing your taxes).That&#x27;ll stop them being used, and right quick. reply fkarg 1 hour agorootparentproblem is: what to use instead?

But it is surprising that the total lack of security isn’t a deal-breaker for their actual customers. I mean if you can basically impersonate anybody using this service, what is the point of using it? reply cortesoft 13 hours agoparentThese accounts aren’t for the people who pay Experian money. Companies pay Experian money to access information about individuals; the only reason Experian even allows accounts for individuals is because they are mandated by law to allow things like credit freezes and the annual credit report. If they weren’t required, they wouldn’t do it at all. They have zero incentive to improve the experience or the security of it. reply caminante 10 hours agorootparent> Companies pay Experian money to access information about individualsAnd your firm pays Experian&#x2F;Equifax&#x2F;etc. to GIVE information about you, e.g., automated employment verification. reply drewmol 10 hours agorootparentAnd Experian pays your company for the data through programs like The Work Number reply heavyset_go 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd your employer feeds their payroll into Experian and its partners so it can then resell that information. reply moneywoes 9 hours agorootparentprevsomeone shoudl be able to freeze their work number to preven this correct? or am I thinking of something else reply nyokodo 15 hours agoparentprev> what is the point of using it?Plausible deniability allowing them to push as much significant risk of identity theft onto consumers instead of themselves where it should be. reply ajmurmann 12 hours agorootparentEven the term \"identity theft\" needs to go. My identity wasn&#x27;t stolen! I&#x27;m still the same person. The bank got tricked by a scammers and somehow the bank tries to make that my fault.Edit: Imagine this the other way around! Grandma gets scammed by someone pretending to be her bank. So the bank&#x27;s identity got stolen. So now the real bank needs to fix it, provide more proof of identity to all customers and jump through all kinds of hoops to not owe grandma crazy amounts of money. reply DoctorOW 12 hours agorootparentIt always reminds me of this classic Mitchell and Webb sketch about the subject.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CS9ptA3Ya9E reply earthboundkid 12 hours agorootparentprevYes! I’ve been saying this for years. The whole framing is a victim blaming dodge, when the two bad actors are the crooks and whoever made the loan with insufficient ID. reply civilized 15 hours agoparentprevIf identity theft were to get so common that the data became statistically unreliable, we would be long past the point that even Congress would feel compelled to do something about it. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentThere’s no such thing as identity theft, it is impossible to steal an identity, the person still has their identity. It is impersonation. The victim is the entity that has fallen for the impersonation (likely a bank, etc), the perpetrator is the one who did the impersonation, and the impersonated person is just some uninvolved third party.I know it is pedantic but it is important to keep in mind because dumping the need to seek redress on the uninvolved third party is ridiculous, so we shouldn’t use language that plays into that point of view. reply toomuchtodo 15 hours agorootparentIt’s identity fraud frankly. Hold consumers harmless and put the burden on the industry (if you did not have an high identity assurance you’re on the hook for costs and losses) and this problem evaporates. Also outlaw credit monitoring and identity theft insurance. reply rzzzt 14 hours agorootparentprevA classic Mitchell & Webb sketch: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-c57WKxeELY reply ClimaxGravely 3 hours agorootparentThank you for that, I&#x27;m actively looking to see how I can watch this show now. reply robin_reala 42 minutes agorootparentThis is from That Mitchell and Webb Sound, a radio show they did.

So, in that regard, they are also a victim. reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentAlthough I think it is more accurate to call them a victim of something like slander by the credit agency, in that case. I mean, I’m not sure exactly what the laws are around slander, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some cutout for cases in which the person actually believed the lies they were repeating, but if an organization represents itself as an expert in people’s trustworthiness it obviously has a heightened responsibility to verify what it is repeating. reply jdsully 14 hours agorootparentCredit reporting agencies have immunity from slander claims unless you can prove malice. reply marcosdumay 14 hours agorootparentSo you&#x27;ve found the problem. If they are immune from the crime, they won&#x27;t stop practicing it. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 9 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that in most cases, slander&#x2F;libel is never a crime anyway.It&#x27;s merely a tort (wrong). It never rises to the level of a crime. The few instances&#x2F;places where slander is a crime in the US (historically or otherwise) are very problematic and subject to abuse.Perhaps this specific kind of slander should be criminal, but it might be the only kind that should be. Not only would you need to justify that philosophically, but somehow convince legislators to make it that way (at the federal level, I should think).It&#x27;d be a tough journey. reply nick222226 14 hours agorootparentprevWould them ignoring a few certified letters asking them to contact you to correct slanderous significant errors in your information be enough to show malice? reply colejohnson66 13 hours agorootparentThat’s what a dispute is. It’s required by the FCRA. reply usea 12 hours agorootparentprevThe impersonated person is impacted because the credit agency is lying about them to other people. reply civilized 14 hours agorootparentprevI completely agree. But if I recall correctly, they&#x27;ve set up the law so that if they get duped, you&#x27;re on the hook for whatever they got duped into giving the impersonator. That&#x27;s the biggest problem. reply Buttons840 14 hours agorootparentTell me you&#x27;re Bank of America and I&#x27;ll give you a thousand dollars. You disappear into the night and I&#x27;ll go get my thousand dollars back from the real Bank of America. Is that how the law is setup? (Honestly, making a website that looks like a legit Bank of America website is about as difficult as getting someone&#x27;s SSN.) reply kagakuninja 14 hours agorootparentprevThe banks aren&#x27;t the only victims. The person has had their credit rating damaged, and may even be on the hook for fraudulent charges made in their name. reply 9991 9 hours agorootparent> The person has had their credit rating damagedThis is called libel.

It’ll be the same result, but you’ll have more things. reply andrewaylett 11 hours agorootparentprevThe actual customers can, consumers can&#x27;t though.I&#x27;m pretty sure the OP was meaning that there&#x27;s little point for the businesses that make use of the credit bureaus, if they can&#x27;t be sure the bureau is accurate, rather than that consumers might be better off opting out (even if they could). reply plagiarist 6 hours agoparentprevWe need a HIPAA for personal data. reply munk-a 2 hours agoparentprevThe fact that we haven&#x27;t nationalized credit reporting absolutely baffles me. These companies have so much power over our lives, are completely unaccountable, and are so incredibly incompetent. reply Aaargh20318 57 minutes agoparentThe whole credit rating system as it is in the US seems complete ass-backwards to me. It basically encourages people to go into debt to build a history of paying it back in time.Here in the Netherlands it works exactly the opposite: the best &#x27;rating&#x27; is to not be in the system at all. When you get a loan, the amount and monthly payments are registered. This registration is removed once you have paid back the loan.When you ask your bank for a loan, they basically look at two things: how much is your income and how much are your current financial obligations (i.e. existing loans). Cost of living is subtracted from your monthly income, as well as the monthly payments of your existing loans (from the national debt registry). What&#x27;s left is how much (additional) monthly payment you can afford. If the monthly payment for your newly requested loan is above this number it will be refused.As such there is no such thing as a good or bad rating, only what you can and cannot afford. reply jasonwatkinspdx 1 hour agoparentprevYears ago I worked in the industry and I totally agree. Fair Isaac in particular has enormous power as basically the only source of models people use, and they are very opaque. reply silveraxe93 1 hour agoparentprevRight, so as a solution to them having: too much power over our lives, being unaccountable and incompetent. Is:Giving the backing of the state over their actions. Move from being accountable to government to _being_ the government. And the competency of giant public bureaucracies! reply dools 1 hour agoparentprevYes and then people claim the social credit scoring system in china is a dystopian hellscape. I happen to think it’s far less dystopian that privately run financial credit reporting agencies. reply lwhi 1 hour agorootparentI think social credit scoring is another level closer to hell. reply gchamonlive 13 hours agoparentprevMaybe this is why for the past few weeks I am receiving countless emails from major retailers like Casas Bahia or Americanas and even Magazine Luiza with purchase confirmation listing several smartphones and notebooks whose invoice bare my name and cpf.I tried contacting every retailer. Only Magazine Luiza seem to have acknowledged the fraud and issued a warning but to no avail, as I am still receiving invoices from them.I contacted the local police and issued a boletim de ocorrência (which I am not quite sure how to translate) that describes the problem and how I was unable to apply countermeasures.I am expecting fallout from this. I am really anxious about this whole situation and how I am utterly powerless in protecting my identity. reply tmcz26 13 hours agoparentI’m in the fraud prevention space in Brazil and know the heads of fraud for all these retailers. If you like you can FWD the purchase receipts to zyzzyx26 at gmail dot com and I’ll notify them.You personally won’t have issues, financially or otherwise. Your email might get blocklisted for some time, and if you make new purchases you might want to use a new&#x2F;secondary email, but otherwise no issues.A while ago someone used my CPF and Phone on Magalu and I’m still able to purchase there. I did report it to the head of fraud though :) reply saagarjha 10 hours agorootparentWell I am from the fraud remuneration department of Brazil and know the person who pays out compensation for these crimes.

Try to reach out to the ombudsman (ouvidoria) and explain your case. Even if they don&#x27;t actually solve the problem, you documented that you tried to friendly resolve the issue.> I am expecting fallout from this.Very worst case scenario, the retailers will send the fraudulent invoices to collection agencies and might report you to the credit bureaus. Don&#x27;t ever pay any cent toward this fraudulent debt. Don&#x27;t negotiate. The only option is the debt going away as it is fraudulent. It&#x27;s their money that&#x27;s on the hook and paying it shifts the responsibilities to you.Once it hits the credit bureaus, as you already have a Boletim de Ocorrência, and proof of contacting the companies (protocol numbers + dates), i.e. documentation, sue them and ask for damages. It&#x27;s a simple and common suit that both the credit bureaus and the retailers will want to settle. Make them pay for your time. They don&#x27;t have any proof that it was your person that made those transactions.> I am utterly powerless in protecting my identity.Yeah, but the thing is, if the retailers, banks, credit cards, etc. really wanted to avoid fraud, every purchase&#x2F;subscription would require the same level of protection as a real estate transaction. Everything signed, in-person meetings, upfront payments, banks, lawyers, notaries, cryptographic signatures (hey, we have e-CPF and nobody uses it!). But as you see, 100% fraud avoidance means friction, and no sane retail business likes friction. It&#x27;s a business decision on their end. They accept risk so they can take your money easier. reply tmcz26 11 hours agorootparentIf it’s a purchase using Credit Card, absolutely zero chance of going to collections. That’s not how it works. There’s no legal footing for collections and they are not in the habit of creating legal headaches for themselves.If however it’s a credit purchase (personal loan, crediário, etc) then it might go to collections, then this advice works.Online purchases though are 80% credit card and 15% Pix&#x2F;Boleto so it’s unlikely they got a loan just to buy stuff. If they can get a loan, they’ll get the cash itself and run.Edit: on a Credit Card transaction the burden of evidence is on the merchant. THEY have to prove it was you. reply rescbr 10 hours agorootparentTell this to MercadoPago. Once I did a chargeback on a fraudulent gift card purchase and months later they sent this debt to collections - they didn&#x27;t report it to the credit agencies, though. It resolved pretty fast once I escalated the issue to the ombudsman.There&#x27;s no legal footing, but they will try. reply wildrhythms 13 hours agoparentprevHow does this fraud work? They buy the goods, and provide the seller some random individual&#x27;s (your) identity? reply tmcz26 12 hours agorootparentStolen ID from one person (ID, name, sometimes using the real person’s email and phone, sometimes creating fake yet similar emails like wildrhythms2@yahoo.com), someone else’s stole credit card number, and a drop address to receive and reship (sometimes deliver direct to the purchaser of the fraud item).Typically the item is resold for half the price and it’s spoken for. It’s not like they buy to resell later. If they make the fraud they already have a buyer reply gchamonlive 13 hours agorootparentprevI have no idea. There are, however, many official invoices (notas fiscais) being issue in my name. I believe there might also be fraudulent credit cards issued in my name that ate being used, or something like that, which would explain the physical retailers not questioning the purchase. That is why I am expecting fallout from this. reply tmcz26 12 hours agorootparentYou can check any credit card issued on your name in Banco Central’s Registrato page[0]. Credit card, loans, etc.However, HIGHLY unlikely they issue a card in your name and purchase stuff in your name online. If they have a card with them, they’ll go to physical stores and leave with the product with them immediately.Typically (as I said above) they have purchased a stolen CC number online and are using it until it gets blocked or run out of balance&#x2F;limit.In any case, there’s zero fallout for you, the victim. These retailers are used to this (0,5% of transactions turn into fraud), so they’ll eventually figure out it’s fraud and they know it wasn’t you. They know you’re a victim too.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registrato.bcb.gov.br&#x2F;registrato&#x2F;Edit with the link reply rescbr 11 hours agorootparentprev> I believe there might also be fraudulent credit cards issued in my name that ate being usedAs tmcz26 said, it&#x27;s very unlikely they issued a card on your name, but if that happened, contact the bank&#x27;s ombudsman AND report it to the Central Bank, as they failed the KYC process. reply ciropantera 12 hours agorootparentprevSomething similar happened to me once.

They don&#x27;t do their own taxes, they don&#x27;t open their own credit cards, they don&#x27;t negotiate their own mortgages or car loans, nothing. They just tell their butler or financier or real estate agent or whatever \"Go get me an X\" and that other person deals with all the shit. Being the target of identity fraud just means they hire another gofer to deal with it full time for six months which costs them so little money, relative to their wealth, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not even worth thinking about. And they&#x27;re not even using their own credit, most of the time, they&#x27;re using the \"credit\" of some shell corporation or limited liability corporation or trust or whatever other financial bullshit they hired a dozen lawyers to set up to commit tax fraud.

Lenders report the information to the credit bureaus, typically all three of the big ones, so if you want no information reported, simply close all your credit cards and loans, etc. and place credit freezes on your credit reports.I don&#x27;t think that \"increased competition\" will work here. We are not customers of the credit bureaus. We are the product. The customers are lenders and other people who need your information. From the lenders&#x27; perspective, this is all working out fine, largely because the onus for \"identity theft\" is placed on members of the public as individuals rather than on lenders to accurately verify applicants&#x27; identities before extending credit. As many people have pointed out before, \"identity theft\" is a misnomer designed to pass the buck onto individuals. Ideally, it should be the lenders&#x27; responsibility to prevent criminals from misusing your information and to make things right whenever a criminal tries to use your information fraudulently, but right now the onus is placed on individuals.A better solution would be to have higher standards for identity verification by lenders. That would shift the burden onto lenders to actually verify people&#x27;s identity before extending credit. Some lenders actually do a pretty good job of verifying people&#x27;s identities before extending credit in my experience, while others just seem to accept the information given uncritically (as far as I can tell!).

It is $1.50-$2.00 per proofing attempt with the government credential using ID.me or stripe identity. The problem is that no one is incentivized to slightly increases costs to reduce fraud because the burden falls on consumers instead, and credit reporting agencies don’t want to see their moat and revenue stream cannabalized.

If someone can easily recreate your account, they can unfreeze it which makes it pretty useless. reply xienze 3 hours agorootparentYes, but if you have an account you’ll at least get an email notifying you that your account’s email address has changed (as a result of someone recreating your account). That’s how I was tipped off to someone trying to buy a car in my name (by pulling on the thread of calling customer support asking wtf I got that email). So it’s very useful to at least have an Experian account so you can know when someone is trying to go after you this way.Now granted, it’s possible that the attacker won’t change your email address first, in which case I’m not sure if you get an email stating that your credit was unfrozen.

You needed to be a known and upstanding member of the community to get a loan for anything substantial.And technically, you can get many loans today without a credit score. For example, there are bank statement mortgage loans, but they have caveats like:- you will go through manual underwriting and will likely need to show records of payment history on any existing debts, including utilities, insurance, rent, etc- They will likely need the contact information for each one of your previous debts to verify it manually- When they run a quote, you will typically be considered at the lowest credit score possible for that program - typically 620 for a conventional loan or 500 for FHA. This means you&#x27;ll be getting the worst rate possible- You&#x27;ll likely need a 20% down payment, depending on if any of the PMI automated underwriting systems even give you a quote with such a low \"fake\" credit score. The lender might ask for more of a down payment depending on their own risk assessment.- The lender (or whoever buys your loan) will report your new account to the bureaus, giving you a score. reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentAdditionally, while it may suck, and maybe there is some other emergent reality that sucks less, we practically live in this one.

(August 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Water channel of Qanats of Ghasabeh, Iran A qanat or kārīz is a system for transporting water from an aquifer or water well to the surface, through an underground aqueduct; the system originated approximately 3,000 years ago in what is now Iran.[1] The function is essentially the same across North Africa and the Middle East but the system operates under a variety of regional names: qanat or kārīz in Iran, foggara in Algeria, khettara in Morocco, falaj in Oman and the United Arab Emirates, karez in Afghanistan, 'uyūn in Saudi Arabia, etc.[1] The largest extant and functional qanat systems are located in Iran, Afghanistan, Oman, the oases of Turfan region of China, Algeria, and Pakistan.[1] This is a system of water supply that allows water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without losing much of the water to evaporation. The system has the advantage of being resistant to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. Karez are constructed as a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by a gently sloping tunnel. This taps into underground water and delivers it to the surface by gravity, without need for pumping. The vertical shafts along the underground channel are purely for maintenance purposes, and water is typically used only once it emerges from the daylight point. The qanats still create a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid climates, but the value of this system is directly related to the quality, volume and regularity of the groundwater. Much of the population of Iran and other arid countries in Asia and North Africa historically depended upon the water from qanats; many populated areas are close to the areas where qanats are possible.[2] Qanat in Kashan surfacing within the Fin Garden; it is thought to have served Iran's Sialk area for thousands of years. A kariz surfacing in Niavaran, Tehran, currently used for watering the grounds of The National Library of Iran Names[edit] Common variants of qanat in English include kanat, khanat, kunut, kona, konait, ghanat, ghundat.[3] Qanāh (قناة) is an Arabic word that means \"channel\".[4] In Persian, the words for \"qanat\" are kārīz (or kārēz; كاريز) and is derived from earlier word kāhrēz (كاهریز). The word qanāt (قنات) is also used in Persian. Other names for qanat include kahan (Persian: کهن), Kahn (Balochi), kahriz/kəhriz (Azerbaijan); khettara (Morocco); Galerías, minas or viajes de agua (Spain); falaj (Arabic: فلج) (United Arab Emirates and Oman), foggara/fughara (North Africa).[5] Alternative terms for qanats in Asia and North Africa are kakuriz, chin-avulz and mayun. Origins[edit] Possible diffusion of qanat technology According to most sources, qanat technology was developed in ancient Iran by the Persian people sometime in the early 1st millennium BCE and slowly spread westward and eastward from there.[6][7][8][9][10][11] However, some other sources suggest a Southeast Arabian origin.[12][13] In addition, analogous systems appear to have been developed independently in China and in South America (specifically, Southern Peru).[14] A cotton species, Gossypium arboreum, is indigenous to South Asia and has been cultivated on the Indian subcontinent for a long time. Cotton appears in the Inquiry into Plants by Theophrastus and is mentioned in the Laws of Manu.[15] As transregional trade networks expanded and intensified, cotton spread from its homeland to India and into the Middle East. One theory is that the qanat was developed to irrigate cotton fields,[16] first in what is now Iran, where it doubled the amount of available water for irrigation and urban use.[17] Because of this, Persia enjoyed larger surpluses of agricultural products, thus increasing urbanization and social stratification.[18] The qanat technology subsequently spread from Persia westward and eastward.[6] In the extremely arid coastal desert of Peru, a technology of water supply similar to that of the qanats, called puquios, was developed. Most archaeologists believe that the puquios are indigenous and date to about 500 CE, but a few believe they are of Spanish origin, brought to the Americas in the 16th century. Puquios were still in use in the Nazca region in the 21st century.[19] Technical features[edit] Cross-section of a qanat In arid and semi-arid regions, owing to high evaporation, transportation routes were in the form of qanats, which led groundwater to consumption areas along the tunnels. In the long run, the qanat system is not only economical but also sustainable for irrigation and agricultural purposes.… The ground water flow was known to depend on grain size of sediments, and, therefore, the tunnels in qanats are filled in with coarser material than the surrounding hose geological formations. The qanats are constructed mainly along the valleys where Quaternary sediments are deposited. — Underground Aqueducts Handbook (2016) Qanats are constructed as a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by a gently sloping tunnel which carries a water channel. Qanats efficiently deliver large amounts of subterranean water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains by gravity, typically from an upland aquifer, with the destination lower than the source. Qanats allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without much water loss to evaporation.[20] It is very common for a qanat to start below the foothills of mountains, where the water table is closest to the surface. From this source, the qanat tunnel slopes gently downward, slowly converging with the steeper slope of the land surface above, and the water finally flows out above ground where the two levels meet. To connect a populated or agricultural area with an aquifer, qanats must often extend for long distances.[2] Qanats are sometimes split into an underground distribution network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller canals are below ground to avoid contamination and evaporation. In some cases water from a qanat is stored in a reservoir, typically with night flow stored for daytime use. An ab anbar is an example of a traditional Persian qanat-fed reservoir for drinking water. The qanat system has the advantage of being resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. From a sustainability perspective, qanats are powered only by gravity, and thus have low operation & maintenance costs once built. Qanats transfer freshwater from the mountain plateau to the lower-lying plains with saltier soil. This helps to control soil salinity and prevent desertification.[21] Qanat vs. spring-flow tunnel[edit] The qanat should not be confused with the spring-flow tunnel typical to the mountainous area around Jerusalem. Although both are excavated tunnels designed to extract water by gravity flow, there are crucial differences. Firstly, the origin of the qanat was a well that was turned into an artificial spring. In contrast, the origin of the spring-flow tunnel was the development of a natural spring to renew or increase flow following a recession of the water table. Secondly, the shafts essential for the construction of qanats are not essential to spring-flow tunnels. Impact of qanats on settlement patterns[edit] A typical town or city in Iran, and elsewhere where the qanat is used, has more than one qanat. Fields and gardens are located both over the qanats a short distance before they emerge from the ground and below the surface outlet. Water from the qanats defines both the social regions in the city and the layout of the city.[2] The water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest in the upper reaches and more prosperous people live at the outlet or immediately upstream of the outlet. When the qanat is still below ground, the water is drawn to the surface via water wells or animal driven Persian wells. Private subterranean reservoirs could supply houses and buildings for domestic use and garden irrigation as well. Further, air flow from the qanat is used to cool an underground summer room (shabestan) found in many older houses and buildings.[2] Downstream of the outlet, the water runs through surface canals called jubs (jūbs) which run downhill, with lateral branches to carry water to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The streets normally parallel the jubs and their lateral branches. As a result, the cities and towns are oriented consistent with the gradient of the land; this is a practical response to efficient water distribution over varying terrain.[2] The lower reaches of the canals are less desirable for both residences and agriculture. The water grows progressively more polluted as it passes downstream. In dry years the lower reaches are the most likely to see substantial reductions in flow.[2] Construction[edit] Traditionally qanats are built by a group of skilled laborers, muqannīs, with hand labor. The profession historically paid well and was typically handed down from father to son.[2] Preparations[edit] Alluvial fan in southern Iran. Image from NASA's Terra satellite. The critical, initial step in qanat construction is identification of an appropriate water source. The search begins at the point where the alluvial fan meets the mountains or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains because of orographic lifting and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively easy. The muqannīs follow the track of the main water courses coming from the mountains or foothills to identify evidence of subsurface water such as deep-rooted vegetation or seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine the location of the water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is available to justify construction. If these prerequisites are met, the route is laid out aboveground. Equipment must be assembled. The equipment is straightforward: containers (usually leather bags), ropes, reels to raise the container to the surface at the shaft head, hatchets and shovels for excavation, lights, spirit levels or plumb bobs and string. Depending upon the soil type, qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops) may also be required.[2][22] Although the construction methods are simple, the construction of a qanat requires a detailed understanding of subterranean geology and a degree of engineering sophistication. The gradient of the qanat must be carefully controlled: too shallow a gradient yields no flow and too steep a gradient will result in excessive erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading the soil conditions leads to collapses, which at best require extensive rework and at worst are fatal for the crew.[22] Excavation[edit] Construction of a qanat is usually performed by a crew of 3–4 muqannīs. For a shallow qanat, one worker typically digs the horizontal shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the shaft and one distributes the excavated earth at the top.[22] The crew typically begins from the destination to which the water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated at a distance of 20–35 m (66–115 ft). The separation of the shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate maintenance effort. In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.[2][22] Most qanats in Iran run less than 5 km (3.1 mi), while some have been measured at ≈70 km (43 mi) in length near Kerman. The vertical shafts usually range from 20 to 200 m (66 to 656 ft) in depth, although qanats in the province of Khorasan have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to 275 m (902 ft). The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to facilitate the process of removing soil.[2][22] The construction speed depends on the depth and nature of the ground. If the earth is soft and easy to work, at 20 m (66 ft) depth a crew of four workers can excavate a horizontal length of 40 m (130 ft) per day. When the vertical shaft reaches 40 m (130 ft), they can excavate only 20 meters horizontally per day and at 60 m (200 ft) in depth this drops below 5 horizontal meters per day. In Algeria, a common speed is just 2 m (6.6 ft) per day at a depth of 15 m (49 ft). Deep, long qanats (which many are) require years and even decades to construct.[2][22] The excavated material is usually transported by means of leather bags up the vertical shafts. It is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts. These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From the air, these shafts look like a string of bomb craters.[22] The qanat's water-carrying channel must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows easily. However the downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions under which the water transitions between supercritical and subcritical flow; if this occurs, the waves that result can result in severe erosion that can damage or destroy the qanat. The choice of the slope is a trade off between erosion and sedimentation. Highly sloped tunnels are subject to more erosion as water flows at a higher speed. On the other hand, less sloped tunnels need frequent maintenance due to the problem of sedimentation.[21] A lower downward gradient also contributes to reducing the solid contents and contamination in water.[21] In shorter qanats the downward gradient varies between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost horizontal. Such precision is routinely obtained with a spirit level and string.[2][22] In cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive underground mills. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a jub or canal overground. This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due to evaporation.[2][22] Maintenance[edit] The vertical shafts may be covered to minimize blown-in sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. For safety, air flow must be assured before entry. Restoration[edit] Some damaged qanats have been restored. To be sustainable, restoration needs to take into account many nontechnical factors beginning with the process of selecting the qanat to be restored. In Syria, three sites were chosen based on a national inventory conducted in 2001. One of them, the Drasiah qanat of Dmeir, was completed in 2002. Selection criteria included the availability of a steady groundwater flow, social cohesion and willingness to contribute of the community using the qanat, and the existence of a functioning water-rights system.[23] Applications of qanats[edit] Irrigation and drinking water supply[edit] The primary applications of qanats are for irrigation, providing cattle with water, and drinking water supply. Other applications include cooling and ice storage. Cooling[edit] Further information: Evaporative cooler Wind tower and qanat used for cooling Qanats used in conjunction with a wind tower can provide cooling as well as a water supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see Bernoulli effect) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it. The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the transfer of latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.[24] A Persian Ab anbar with wind towers connected to a qanat Ice storage[edit] Further information: Yakhchāl Yakhchāl of Kheshti in Yazd Province By 400 BCE, Persian engineers had mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert.[25] The ice could be brought in during the winters from nearby mountains, but in a more usual and sophisticated method they built a wall in the east–west direction near the yakhchal (ice pit). In winter, the qanat water would be channeled to the north side of the wall, whose shade made the water freeze more quickly, increasing the ice formed per winter day. Then the ice was stored in yakhchals—specially designed, naturally cooled refrigerators. A large underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and a system of windcatchers or wind towers was used to draw cool subterranean air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels, even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and was available year-round.[25] Qanats by country[edit] Africa[edit] Algeria[edit] Water \"metering\" through a distribution weir on a foggara in Algeria Qanats (designated foggaras in Algeria) are the source of water for irrigation in large oases like that at Gourara. The foggaras are also found at Touat (an area of Adrar 200 km from Gourara). The length of the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers. Although sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200 CE, they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam. The water is metered to the various users through the use of distribution weirs that meter flow to the various canals, each for a separate user. The humidity of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off. In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passes out of the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.[26] Egypt[edit] According to Herodotus, qanat irrigation technology was introduced to Egypt by the Achaemenid king Darius I during his reign of 522 BCE-486 BCE, which is supported by the historian Albert T. Olmstead.[27] There are four main oases in the Egyptian desert. The Kharga Oasis is one that has been extensively studied. There is evidence that as early as the second half of the 5th century BCE water brought in qanats was being used. The qanats were excavated through water-bearing sandstone rock, which seeps into the channel, with water collected in a basin behind a small dam at the end. The width is approximately 60 cm (24 in), but the height ranges from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water was used to irrigate fields.[22][28] There is another instructive structure located at the Kharga oasis. A well that apparently dried up was improved by driving a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr to allow collection of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built, and holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the rocks—are evident.[28] Libya[edit] Exit of a foggara in Libya David Mattingly reports foggara extending for hundreds of miles in the Garamantes area near Germa in Libya: \"The channels were generally very narrow – less than 2 feet wide and 5 high – but some were several miles long, and in total some 600 foggara extended for hundreds of miles underground. The channels were dug out and maintained using a series of regularly spaced vertical shafts, one every 30 feet or so, 100,000 in total, averaging 30 feet in depth, but sometimes reaching 130.\"[29] Morocco[edit] Irrigation cisterns (sharij) at Figuig date palm oasis in Morocco (1913) In southern Morocco, the qanat (locally khettara) is also used. On the margins of the Sahara Desert, the isolated oases of the Draa River valley and Tafilalt have relied on qanat water for irrigation since the late 14th century. In Marrakech and the Haouz plain, the qanats have been abandoned since the early 1970s, having dried up. In the Tafilaft area, half of the 400 khettaras are still in use. The Hassan Adahkil Dam's impact on local water tables is said to be one of the many reasons for the loss of half of the khettara.[30] The black berbers (haratin) of the south were the hereditary class of qanat diggers in Morocco who build and repair these systems. Their work was hazardous.[5] Tunisia[edit] At Sfax, showing how the rainwater was gathered (1918) The foggara water management system in Tunisia, used to create oases, is similar to that of the Iranian qanat. The foggara is dug into the foothills of a fairly steep mountain range such as the eastern ranges of the Atlas mountains. Rainfall in the mountains enters the aquifer and moves toward the Saharan region to the south. The foggara, 1 to 3 km (0.62 to 1.9 mi) in length, penetrates the aquifer and collects water. Families maintain the foggara and own the land it irrigates over a ten-meter width, with length reckoned by the size of plot that the available water will irrigate.[31] Asia[edit] Afghanistan[edit] The Qanats are called Kariz in Dari (Persian) and Pashto and have been in use since the pre-Islamic period. It is estimated that more than 9,370 Karizes were in use in the 20th century. The oldest functional Kariz which is more than 300 years old and 8 kilometers long is located in Wardak province and is still providing water to nearly 3000 people.[32] 40 years of war destroyed a number of these ancient structures.[33] In these troubled times maintenance has not always been possible. To add to the troubles, as of 2008 the cost of labour has become very high and maintaining the Kariz structures is no longer possible.[dubious – discuss] Lack of skilled artisans who have the traditional knowledge also poses difficulties. A number of the large farmers are abandoning their Kariz which has been in their families sometimes for centuries, and moving to tube and dug wells backed by diesel pumps.[citation needed] However, the government of Afghanistan was aware of the importance of these structures and all efforts were made to repair, reconstruct and maintain (through the community) the kariz.[citation needed] The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development along with National and International NGOs made the effort. There were still functional qanat systems in 2009. American forces were reported to have unintentionally destroyed some of the channels during expansion of a military base, creating tensions between them and the local community.[34] Some of these tunnels were used to store supplies, and to move men and equipment underground.[35] Armenia[edit] Qanats have been preserved in Armenia in the community of Shvanidzor, in the southern province of Syunik, bordering with Iran. Qanats are named kahrezes in Armenian. There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed in XII-XIVc, even before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005. Potable water runs through I, II and V kahrezs. Kahrez III and IV are in quite poor condition. In the summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water reaches its minimum, creating a critical situation in the water supply system. Still, kahrezes are the main source of potable and irrigation water for the community. Azerbaijan[edit] The territory of Azerbaijan was home to numerous kahrizes many centuries ago. Archaeological findings suggest that long before the ninth century CE, kahrizes by which the inhabitants brought potable and irrigation water to their settlements were in use in Azerbaijan. Traditionally, kahrizes were built and maintained by a group of masons called 'Kankans' with manual labour. The profession was handed down from father to son. It is estimated that until the 20th century, nearly 1500 kahrizes, of which as many as 400 were in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, existed in Azerbaijan. However, following the introduction of electric and fuel-pumped wells during Soviet times, kahrizes were neglected. Today, it is estimated that 800 are still functioning in Azerbaijan. These operational kahrizes are key to the life of many communities. In 1999, upon the request of the communities in Nakhichevan, the International Organization for Migration began implementing a pilot programme to rehabilitate the kahrizes. By 2018 IOM rehabilitated more than 163 kahrizes with funds from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), European Commission (EC), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, US State Department (BPRM) and the self-contribution of the local communities. In 2010, IOM began a kahriz rehabilitation project with funds from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). During the First Phase of the action which lasted until January 2013, a total of 20 kahrizes in the mainland of Azerbaijan have been renovated. In June 2018, the Second Phase has been launched and by 2022, IOM and KOICA aim to renovate fully a total of 40 kahrizes. China[edit] Karez gallery near Turpan, Xinjiang, China Main article: Turpan water system The oasis of Turpan, in the deserts of Xinjiang in northwestern China, uses water provided by qanat (locally called karez). The number of karez systems in the area is slightly below 1,000, and the total length of the canals is about 5,000 kilometers.[36] Turpan has long been the center of a fertile oasis and an important trade center along the Northern Silk Road, at which time it was adjacent to the kingdoms of Korla and Karashahr to the southwest. The historical record of the karez extends back to the Han dynasty. The Turfan Water Museum is a Protected Area of the People's Republic of China because of the importance of the Turpan karez water system to the history of the area. Iran[edit] See also: Traditional water sources of Persian antiquity In the middle of the twentieth century, an estimated 50,000 qanats were in use in Iran,[2] each commissioned and maintained by local users. Of these, only 37,000 remain in use as of 2015. One of the oldest and largest known qanats is in the Iranian city of Gonabad, and after 2,700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers. Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman are zones known for their dependence on an extensive system of qanats. In 2016, UNESCO inscribed the Persian Qanat as a World Heritage Site, listing the following eleven qanats: Qasebeh Qanat, Qanat of Baladeh, Qanat of Zarch, Hasan Abad-e Moshir Qanat, Ebrāhim Ābād Qanat in Markazi Province, Qanat of Vazvān in Esfahan Province, Mozd Ābād Qanat in Esfahan Province, Qanat of the Moon in Esfahan Province, Qanat of Gowhar-riz in Kerman Province, Jupār – Ghāsem Ābād Qanat in Kerman Province, and Akbar Ābād Qanat in Kerman Province.[37][38] Since 2002, UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme (IHP) Intergovernmental Council began investigating the possibility of an international qanat research center to be located in Yazd, Iran.[39] The Qanats of Gonabad, also called kariz Kai Khosrow, is one of the oldest and largest qanats in the world built between 700 BCE to 500 BCE. It is located at Gonabad, Razavi Khorasan Province. This property contains 427 water wells with total length of 33,113 m (20.575 mi).[40][41] Ancient Persian water clock Ancient Persian clock in Qanats of Gonabad Zibad According to Callisthenes, the Persians were using water clocks in 328 BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Qanats of Gonabad and kariz Zibad, dates back to 500 BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years.[42] The Water clock, or Fenjaan, was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from the Qanats of Gonabad until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks.[43] Many of the Iranian qanats bear some characteristics which allow us to call them feat of engineering, considering the intricate techniques used in their construction. The eastern and central regions of Iran hold the most qanats due to low precipitation and lack of permanent surface streams, whereas a small number of qanats can be found in the northern and western parts which receive more rainfall and enjoy some permanent rivers. Respectively the provinces Khorasan Razavi, Southern Khorasan, Isfahan and Yazd accommodate the most qanats, but from the viewpoint of water discharge the provinces Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi, Fars and Kerman are ranked first to fourth. Henri Golbot explored the genesis of the qanat in his 1979 publication, Les Qanats. Une technique d'acquisition de l'eau (The Qanats. a Technique for Obtaining Water),[44] He argues that the ancient Iranians made use of the water that the miners wished to get rid of it, and founded a basic system named qanat or Kariz to supply the required water to their farm lands. According to Goblot, this innovation took place in the northwest of the present Iran somewhere bordering Turkey and later was introduced to the neighboring Zagros Mountains. According to an inscription left by Sargon II, the king of Assyria, In 714 BCE he invaded the city of Uhlu lying in the northwest of Uroomiye lake that lay in the territory of Urartu empire, and then he noticed that the occupied area enjoyed a very rich vegetation even though there was no river running across it. So he managed to discover the reason why the area could stay green, and realized that there were some qanats behind the matter. In fact it was Ursa, the king of the region, who had rescued the people from thirst and turned Uhlu into a prosperous and green land. Goblot believes that the influence of the Medeans and Achaemenids made the technology of qanat spread from Urartu (in the western north of Iran and near the present border between Iran and Turkey) to all over the Iranian plateau. It was an Achaemenid ruling that in case someone succeeded in constructing a qanat and bringing groundwater to the surface in order to cultivate land, or in renovating an abandoned qanat, the tax he was supposed to pay the government would be waived not only for him but also for his successors for up to 5 generations. During this period, the technology of qanat was in its heyday and it even spread to other countries. For example, following Darius's order, Silaks the naval commander of the Persian army and Khenombiz the royal architect managed to construct a qanat in the oasis of Kharagha in Egypt. Beadnell believes that qanat construction dates back to two distinct periods: they were first constructed by the Persianse, and later the Romans dug some other qanats during their reign in Egypt from 30 BCE to 395 CE. The magnificent temple built in this area during Darius's reign shows that there was a considerable population depending on the water of qanats. Ragerz has estimated this population to be 10,000 people. The most reliable document confirming the existence of qanats at this time was written by Polybius who states that: \"the streams are running down from everywhere at the base of Alborz mountain, and people have transferred too much water from a long distance through some subterranean canals by spending much cost and labor.\" During the Seleucid Era, which began after the occupation of Iran by Alexander, it seems that the qanats were abandoned. In terms of the situation of qanats during this era, some historical records have been found. In a study by Russian orientalist scholars it has been mentioned that: the Persians used the side branches of rivers, mountain springs, wells and qanats to supply water. The subterranean galleries excavated to obtain groundwater were named as qanat. These galleries were linked to the surface through some vertical shafts which were sunk in order to get access to the gallery to repair it if necessary. According to the historical records, the Parthian kings did not care about the qanats the way the Achaemenid kings and even Sassanid kings did. As an instance, Arsac III, one of the Parthian kings, destroyed some qanats in order to make it difficult for Seleucid Antiochus to advance further while fighting him. The historical records from this time indicate a perfect regulation on both water distribution and farmlands. All the water rights were recorded in a special document which was referred to in case of any transaction. The lists of farmlands – whether private or governmental – were kept at the tax department. During this period there were some official rulings on qanats, streams, construction of dam, operation and maintenance of qanats, etc. The government proceeded to repair or dredge the qanats that were abandoned or destroyed for any reason, and construct the new qanats if necessary. A document written in the Pahlavi language pointed out the important role of qanats in developing the cities at that time. In Iran, the advent of Islam, which coincided with the overthrow of the Sassanid dynasty, brought about a profound change in religious, political, social and cultural structures. But the qanats stayed intact, because the economic infrastructure, including qanats was of great importance to the Arabs. As an instance, M. Lombard reports that the Moslem clerics who lived during Abbasid period, such as Abooyoosef Ya’qoob (died 798 CE) stipulated that whoever can bring water to the idle lands in order to cultivate, his tax would be waived and he would be entitled to the lands cultivated. Therefore, this policy did not differ from that of the Achaemenids in not getting any tax from the people who revived abandoned lands. The Arabs' supportive policy on qanats was so successful that even the holy city of Mecca gained a qanat too. The Persian historian Hamdollah Mostowfi writes: \"Zobeyde Khatoon (Haroon al-Rashid's wife) constructed a qanat in Mecca. After the time of Haroon al-Rashid, during the caliph Moghtader's reign this qanat fell into decay, but he rehabilitated it, and the qanat was rehabilitated again after it collapsed during the reign of two other caliphs named Ghaem and Naser. After the era of the caliphs this qanat completely fell into ruin because the desert sand filled it up, but later Amir Choopan repaired the qanat and made it flow again in Mecca.\"[citation needed] There are also other historical texts proving that the Abbasids were concerned about qanats. For example, according to the \"Incidents of Abdollah bin Tahir's Time\" written by Gardizi, in 830 CE a terrible earthquake struck the town of Forghaneh and reduced many homes to rubble. The inhabitants of Neyshaboor used to come to Abdollah bin Tahir in order to request him to intervene, for they fought over their qanats and found the relevant instruction or law on qanat as a solution neither in the prophet's quotations nor in the clerics' writings. So Abdollah bin Tahir managed to bring together all the clergymen from throughout Khorasan and Iraq to compile a book entitled Alghani (The Book of Qanat). This book collected all the rulings on qanats which could be of use to whoever wanted to judge a dispute over this issue. Gardizi added that this book was still applicable to his time, and everyone made references to this book. One can deduce from these facts that during the above-mentioned period the number of qanats was so considerable that the authorities were prompted to put together some legal instructions concerning them. Also it shows that from the ninth to eleventh centuries the qanats that were the hub of the agricultural systems were also of interest to the government. Apart from The Book of Alghani, which is considered as a law booklet focusing on qanat-related rulings based on Islamic principles, there is another book about groundwater written by Karaji in 1010. This book, entitled Extraction of Hidden Waters, examines just the technical issues associated with the qanat and tries to answer the common questions such as how to construct and repair a qanat, how to find a groundwater supply, how to do leveling, etc.. Some of the innovations described in this book were introduced for the first time in the history of hydrogeology, and some of its technical methods are still valid and can be applied in qanat construction. The content of this book implies that its writer (Karaji) did not have any idea that there was another book on qanats compiled by the clergymen. There are some records dating back to that time, signifying their concern about the legal vicinity of qanats. For example, Mohammad bin Hasan quotes Aboo-Hanifeh that in case someone constructs a qanat in abandoned land, someone else can dig another qanat in the same land on the condition that the second qanat is 500 zera’ (375 meters) away from the first one. Ms. Lambton quotes Moeen al-din Esfarzi who wrote the book Rowzat al-Jannat (the garden of paradise) that Abdollah bin Tahir (from the Taherian dynasty) and Ismaeel Ahmed Samani (from the Samani dynasty) had several qanats constructed in Neyshaboor. Later, in the 11th century, a writer named Nasir Khosrow acknowledged all those qanats with the following words: \"Neyshaboor is located in a vast plain at a distance of 40 Farsang (≈240 km) from Serakhs and 70 Farsang (≈420 km) from Mary (Marv) ... all the qanats of this city run underground, and it is said that an Arab who was offended by the people of Neyshaboor has complained that; what a beautiful city Neyshaboor could have become if its qanats would have flowed on the ground surface and instead its people would have been underground.\" These documents all certify the importance of qanats during the Islamic history within the cultural territories of Iran. Kariz Gonabad Iran In the 13th century, the invasion of Iran by Mongolian tribes reduced many qanats and irrigation systems to ruin, and many qanats were deserted and dried up. Later, in the era of the Ilkhanid dynasty especially at the time of Ghazan Khan and his Persian minister Rashid al-Din Fazl-Allah, some measures were taken to revive the qanats and irrigation systems. There is a 14th-century book entitled Al-Vaghfiya Al-Rashidiya (Rashid's Deeds of Endowment) that names all the properties located in Yazd, Shiraz, Maraghe, Tabriz, Isfahan and Mowsel that Rashid Fazl-Allah donated to the public or religious places. This book mentions many qanats running at that time and irrigating a considerable area of farmland. At the same time, another book, entitled Jame’ al-Kheyrat, was written by Seyyed Rokn al-Din on the same subject as Rashid's book. In this book, Seyyed Rokn al-Din names the properties he donated in the region of Yazd. These deeds of endowment indicate that much attention was given to the qanats during the reign of Ilkhanids, but it is attributable to their Persian ministers, who influenced them.[42] In the years 1984–1985 the ministry of energy took a census of 28,038 qanats whose total discharge was 9 billion cubic meters. In the years 1992–1993 the census of 28,054 qanats showed a total discharge of 10 billion cubic meters. 10 years later in 2002–2003 the number of the qanats was reported as 33,691 with a total discharge of 8 billion cubic meters. In the restricted regions there are 317,225 wells, qanats and springs that discharge 36,719 million cubic meters water a year, out of which 3,409 million cubic meters is surplus to the aquifer capacity. in 2005, in the country as a whole, there were 130,008 deep wells with a discharge of 31,403 million cubic meter, 33,8041 semi deep wells with a discharge of 13,491 million cubic meters, 34,355 qanats with a discharge of 8,212 million cubic meters, and 55,912 natural springs with a discharge of 21,240 million cubic meters.[45] In 2021, a British trained architect Margot Krasojević designed a luxury eco hotel based on principles of qanat and windcatchers in a desert in Iran, called Qanat. The project has not yet been built but offers ideas for applying ancient technology to modern-day cooling problems in the desert. Iraq[edit] A survey of qanat systems in the Kurdistan region of Iraq conducted by the Department of Geography at Oklahoma State University (US) on behalf of UNESCO in 2009 found that out of 683 karez systems, some 380 were still active in 2004, but only 116 in 2009. Reasons for the decline of qanats include \"abandonment and neglect\" prior to 2004, \"excessive pumping from wells\" and, since 2005, drought. Water shortages are said to have forced, since 2005, over 100,000 people who depended for their livelihoods on karez systems to leave their homes.[46] The study says that a single karez has the potential to provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over 200 hectares of farmland. UNESCO and the government of Iraq plan to rehabilitate the karez through a Karez Initiative for Community Revitalization to be launched in 2010. Most of the karez are in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (84%). A large number are also found in Erbil Governorate (13%), especially on the broad plain around and in Erbil city.[47] India[edit] In India, there are karez (qanat) systems are located at Bidar, Bijapur, Burhanpur \"(Kundi Bhandara)\" and Aurgangabad. The Bidar karez systems were probably the first one to have ever been dug in India. It dates to the Bahmani period. Bidar has three karez systems as per Gulam Yazdani's documentation.[48] Other than Naubad there are two more karez systems in Bidar, \"Shukla Theerth\" and \"Jamna Mori\". The Shukla theerth is the longest karez system in Bidar. The mother well of this karez has been discovered by near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. The third system called Jamna mori is more of a distribution system within the old city area with many channels crisscrossing the city lanes.[49] Restoration efforts commenced in 2014, with the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez in 2015, uncovering 27 vertical shafts linked to the Karez. The rejuvenation of the system has had a significant impact on the water-deficit city of Bidar. A seventh line of the system was discovered in 2016 during a sewage line excavation.[46] Valliyil Govindankutty, Assistant Professor in Geography at Government College Chittur, was responsible for rediscovery and mapping of the Naubad Karez System in 2012-2013. Later in 2014-2016 team YUVAA joined Govindankutty to help uncover Other two Karez Systems in Bidar.[50][51] Detailed documentation of the Naubad karez system was done in August 2013 and a report was submitted to District Administration of Bidar that found several new facts. The research has led to the initiation of cleaning the debris and collapsed sections paving the way to its rejuvenation. The cleaning of karez has led to bringing water to higher areas of the plateau, and it has in turn recharged the wells in the vicinity. The Bijapur karez system is much more complicated. A reveals that it has surface water and groundwater connections. The Bijapur karez is a network of shallow masonry aqueducts, terracotta/ceramic pipes, embankments and reservoirs, tanks etc. All weave together a network to ensure water reaches the old city. The system starts at Torwi and extends as shallow aqueducts and further as pipes; further it becomes deeper from the Sainik school area onward which exists as a tunnel dug through the geology. The system can be clearly traced up to Ibrahim Roja. In Aurangabad the karez systems are called nahars. These are shallow aqueducts running through the city. There are 14 aqueducts in Aurangabad. The Nahar-i-Ambari is the oldest and longest. Its again a combination of shallow aqueducts, open channels, pipes, cisterns, etc. The source of water is a surface water body. The karez has been constructed right below the bed of lake. The lake water seeps through the soil into the Karez Gallery. In Burhanpur the karez is called \"Kundi-Bhandara\", sometimes wrongly referred to as\"Khuni Bhandara\". The system is approx 6 km long starts from the alluvial fans of Satpura hills in the north of the town. Unlike Bidar, Bijapur and Aurgangabad the System airvents are round in shape. Inside the Karez one could see lime depositions on the walls. The Systems ends to carry water further to palaces and public fountains through pipe line. Indonesia[edit] It has been suggested that underground temples at Gua Made in Java reached by shafts, in which masks of a green metal were found, originated as a qanat.[52] Japan[edit] In Japan there are several dozen qanat-like structures, locally known as 'mambo' or 'manbo', most notably in the Mie and Gifu Prefectures. Whereas some link their origin clearly to the Chinese karez, and therefore to the Iranian source,[53] a Japanese conference in 2008 found insufficient scientific studies to evaluate the origins of the mambo.[54] Jordan[edit] Among the qanats built in the Roman Empire, the 94 km (58 mi) long Gadara Aqueduct in northern Jordan was possibly the longest continuous qanat ever built.[55] Partly following the course of an older Hellenistic aqueduct, excavation work arguably started after a visit by emperor Hadrian in 129–130 CE. The Gadara Aqueduct was never quite finished and was put in service only in sections. Pakistan[edit] In Pakistan qanat irrigation system is endemic only in Balochistan. The major concentration is in the north and northwest along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and oasis of Makoran division. The Karez system of the Balochistan desert is on the Tentative List for future World Heritage Sites in Pakistan.[56] The acute shortage of water resources give water a decisive role in the regional conflicts arose in the course of history of Balochistan. Therefore, in Balochistan, the possession of water resources is more important than ownership of land itself. Hence afterward a complex system for the collection, channeling and distribution of water was developed in Balochistan. Similarly, the distribution and unbiased flow of water to different stockholders also necessitate the importance of different societal classes in Balochistan in general and particularly in Makoran. For instance, sarrishta (literally, head of the chain) is responsible for administration of channel. He normally owns the largest water quota. Under sarrishta, there are several heads of owners issadar who also possessed larger water quotas. The social hierarchy within Baloch society of Makoran depends upon the possession of largest quotas of water. The role of sarrishta in some cases hierarchical and passing from generations within the family and he must have the knowledge of the criteria of unbiased distribution of water among different issadar. The sharing of water is based on a complex indigenous system of measurement depends upon time and space particularly to the phases of moon; the hangams. Based on seasonal variations and share of water the hangams are apportioned among various owners over period of seven or fourteen days. However, in some places, instead of hangam, anna used which is based on twelve-hour period for each quota. Therefore, if a person own 16 quotas it means that he is entitled for water for eight days in high seasons and 16 days in winter when water level went down as well as expectation of winter rain (Baharga) in Makran region. The twelve-hour water quota again subdivided into several sub-fractions of local measuring scales such as tas or pad (Dr Gul Hasan Pro VC LUAWMS, 2 day National conference on Kech). The Chagai district is in the north west corner of Balochistan, Pakistan, bordering with Afghanistan and Iran. Qanats, locally known as Kahn, are found more broadly in this region. They are spread from Chaghai district all the way up to Zhob district. Syria[edit] Qanats were found over much of Syria. The widespread installation of groundwater pumps has lowered the water table and qanat system. Qanats have gone dry and been abandoned across the country.[30] Oman[edit] In Oman from the Iron Age period (found in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called 'Falaj' were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of Falaj: Daudi (Arabic: داوودية) with underground aqueducts, Ghaili (Arabic: الغيلية) requiring a dam to collect the water, and Aini (Arabic: العينية) whose source is a water spring. These enabled large scale agriculture to flourish in a dryland environment. According to UNESCO, some 3,000 aflaj (plural) or falaj (singular), are still in use in Oman today. Nizwa, the former capital city of Oman, was built around a falaj which is in use to this day. These systems date to before the Iron Age in Oman. In July 2006, five representative examples of this irrigation system were inscribed as a World Heritage Site.[57] United Arab Emirates[edit] The falaj irrigation system at Al Ain Oasis The oases of the city of Al Ain (particularly Al-Ain, Al-Qattarah, Al-Mu'taredh, Al-Jimi, Al-Muwaiji, and Hili), adjacent to Al-Buraimi in Oman, continue traditional falaj (qanat) irrigations for the palm groves and gardens, and form part of the city's ancient heritage.[12][58] Multiple Aflaj have been found from the early Iron Age, as early as 1100 BC, and some sources claim these to be the earliest examples of the Qanat irrigation system.[59] The Falaj system continued to be in use into the Early Pre Islamic (300 BC - 300 AD), and were reintroduced after the Early Islamic conquests in the souqs of Julfar, Dibba, and Tawwam.[60] Islamic geographer Al Muqqadasi stated: “Hafit {Tuwwam} abounds in palm trees” in the 10th century, indicating extensive use of the Falaj system. The Falaj system is still operating in the city of Al Ain, as well as in multiple mountainous settlements, including the villages of Wadi Shees and Masafi. Europe[edit] Greece[edit] The Tunnel of Eupalinos on Samos runs for 1 kilometre through a hill to supply water to the town of Pythagorion.[61] It was built on the order of the Tyrant Polycrates around 550 BCE. At either end of the tunnel proper, shallow qanat-like tunnels carried the water from the spring and to the town. A preserved viaje de agua in Madrid Italy[edit] The 5,653 m (3.513 mi) long Tunnels of Claudius, intended to partially drain the largest Italian inland water, Fucine Lake, was constructed using the qanat technique. It featured shafts up to 122 m deep.[62] The entire ancient town of Palermo in Sicily was equipped with a huge qanat system built during the Arab period (827–1072).[63] Many of the qanats are now mapped and some can be visited. The famous Scirocco room has an air-conditioning system cooled by the flow of water in a qanat and a \"wind tower\", a structure able to catch the wind and use it to draw the cooled air up into the room. Luxembourg[edit] The Raschpëtzer near Helmsange in southern Luxembourg is a particularly well preserved example of a Roman qanat. It is probably the most extensive system of its kind north of the Alps. To date, some 330 m of the total tunnel length of 600 m have been explored. Thirteen of the 20 to 25 shafts have been investigated.[64] The qanat appears to have provided water for a large Roman villa on the slopes of the Alzette valley. It was built during the Gallo-Roman period, probably around the year 150 and functioned for about 120 years thereafter. Spain[edit] There are still many examples of galería or qanat systems in Spain, most likely brought to the area by the Moors during their rule of the Iberian peninsula. Turrillas in Andalusia on the north facing slopes of the Sierra de Alhamilla has evidence of a qanat system. Granada is another site with an extensive qanat system.[65] In Madrid they were called viajes de agua and were used until the construction of the Canal de Isabel II. See Viaje de agua [es] and Viajes de agua en el Madrid histórico [es] in Spanish. The Americas[edit] Qanats in the Americas, usually referred to as puquios or filtration galleries, can be found in the Nazca Province of Peru and in northern Chile.[30] The origin and dating of the Nazca puquios is disputed, although some archaeologists have asserted that they were constructed by the indigenous people of the Nazca culture beginning about 500 CE.[66] The Spanish introduced qanats into Mexico in 1520 CE.[67] In the Atacama Desert of northern Chile the shafts of puquios are known as socavones.[68] Socavones are known to exist in Azapa Valley and the oasis of Sibaya, Pica-Matilla and Puqui Nuñez.[68] In 1918 geologist Juan Brüggen mentioned the existence of 23 socavones in the Pica oasis, yet these have since then been abandoned due to economic and social changes.[68] Cultural references[edit] In an August 21, 1906, letter written from Tehran, Florence Khanum, the American wife of Persian diplomat Ali Kuli Khan, described the use of qanats for the garden at the home of her brother-in-law, General Husayn Kalantar,[69] January 1, 1913[70] \"The air is the most marvellous I ever was in, in any city. Mountain air, so sweet, dry and \"preserving\", delicious and life-giving.' She told of running streams, and fresh water bubbling up in the gardens. (This omnipresence of water, which doubtless spread from Persia to Baghdad and from there to Spain during its Muslim days, has given Spanish many a water-word: aljibe, for example, is Persian jub, brook; cano or pipe, is Arabic qanat—reed, canal. Thus J. T. Shipley, Dictionary of Word Origins).\" — Florence Khanum (1906) cited in Arches of the Years (1999) An old tradition in Iran was to hold symbolic wedding ceremonies between widows and qanats in which the widow became the \"wife\" of the qanat. This was believed to help ensure the continued flow of water.[71][72] See also[edit] Suranga – Traditional water management system in Kerala and Karnataka, south India Water clock – Time piece in which time is measured by the flow of liquid into or out of a vessel Ab Anbar – Traditional Iranian water reservoir Acequia – Community-operated watercourse Roman aqueducts – Type of aqueduct built in ancient Rome Aflaj – Ancient water channels in Oman History of water supply and sanitation Menara gardens – Public garden in Marrakech, Morocco Oasis – Fertile area in a desert environment Traditional water sources of Persian antiquity Yakhchāl – Ancient Persian ice-house Mamanteo – Seasonal water retention system using permeable ground cover for storage Tank cascade system – Ancient irrigation system in Sri Lanka Notes[edit] ^ a b c Remini, B.; Kechard, R.; Achour, B.

In the long run, the ganat system is not only economical but also sustainable for irrigation and agricultural purposes... The ground water flow was known to depend on grain size of sediments, and, therefore, the tunnels in qanats are filled in with coarser material than the surrounding hose geological formations. The qanats are constructed mainly along the valleys where Quartenary sediments are deposited. ^ a b c Nasiri, F. & Mafakheri, M. S.

Just how it doesn&#x27;t feel entirely right to suddenly start calling Spanish \"Español\" instead in English, or Swedish as \"Svenska\" and so on. I&#x27;ve met so many people not realizing the endonym \"farsi\" is just a (for some reason) new word in English used for the already well established name for the Persian language reply crazygringo 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a very interesting question. I&#x27;ve only ever heard it referred to as Farsi, so I didn&#x27;t even know there was another option. Intriguingly, Wikipedia provides plenty of information, which seems to support your position (italics mine):\"Farsi, which is the Persian word for the Persian language, has also been used widely in English in recent decades, more often to refer to Iran&#x27;s standard Persian. However, the name Persian is still more widely used. The Academy of Persian Language and Literature has maintained that the endonym Farsi is to be avoided in foreign languages, and that Persian is the appropriate designation of the language in English, as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity. Iranian historian and linguist Ehsan Yarshater, founder of the Encyclopædia Iranica and Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Iranian Studies, mentions the same concern in an academic journal on Iranology, rejecting the use of Farsi in foreign languages.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Persian_language#Name reply peyton 1 hour agorootparentIt’s part of our overseas propaganda efforts to use American linguistic hegemony to void cultural and historical ties with countries we aren’t friends with. The language is Persian, not Farsi. reply eganist 10 hours agorootparentprevFarsi is solely the name of the language. Persian could describe the language or a number of other things, such as the culture, the people, etc.Farsi and Persian are interchangable in the context of the language, and plenty of Persian Americans prefer using \"Persian\" to name the language rather than Farsi (this is especially common among persians who refer to themselves as \"Persian,\" and I think a lot of it is because \"Farsi\" is associated with \"Iranian\" which has a less ideal connotation associated with it in the West today). But it&#x27;s not universal, and both are pretty widely accepted.That&#x27;s my understanding. I&#x27;m not versed in the historical details though. There&#x27;s probably a Persian culture professor lurking who can offer a more informed answer. reply Penyngton 1 hour agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s a link you can use to explain the topic to people who make this mistake: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cais-soas.com&#x2F;CAIS&#x2F;Languages&#x2F;persian_not_farsi.h... reply animal_spirits 10 hours agorootparentprevI have only ever heard of the language referred to as Farsi in English.

It&#x27;s not uncommon that I need to pause and clarify (typically \"French people\", that is, native francophones vs. residents of France). Not sure why more ambiguity is to be sought after. reply Liquid_Fire 5 minutes agorootparentMaybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, but I would never interpret \"French people\" to mean anything other than people from France (not necessarily resident in France though).

They used to throw straws in qanats&#x27; wells to see how rapid the movement of water is for repair purposes.\"Vs Latin \"canal\":\"For cannālis, from canna (“reed, cane”), from Ancient Greek κάννα (kánna, “reed”).*And the Greek in turn comes, apparently, from Akkadian (Semitic) \"qanûm\" \"reed\".And so I&#x27;d guess the Arabic &#x27;qanat&#x27; either from either Akkadian or from its own Semitic vocabulary or was borrowed back in from Greek.Nifty. reply zabzonk 14 hours agoparentprevalso mentioned in \"Dune\", the novel, along with other arabic&#x2F;persian words. reply globular-toast 1 hour agoparentI somehow managed to read most of Children of Dune without looking up what a qanat is.

Recall that there&#x27;s a lot of innovation in the \"little things\"; note that a parallel post is talking about different shapes of spearheads, and each of those variations would definitely correspond to a new patent in the modern patent system. At the same time, most written sources throughout history are from elites, who give very little thought to what the working classes are doing, and thus tend to ignore innovation that does exist.My gut instinct is that innovation rate throughout history is largely constant on a per-capita basis, although I would admit that probably some industries are more or less innovative at various stages or in history. Through that lens, the fact that you&#x27;re looking at >10× total person-years pre-1800 compared to post-2000 means that I&#x27;d feel rather comfortable opining that there were more total innovations before 1800 than after 2000. reply KineticLensman 11 hours agorootparentprev> Now I&#x27;m wondering if the sum total of all inventions prior to 1800 is more or less than the total since 2000Not sure why you have the gap between 1800 and 2000. But the number of things &#x27;invented&#x27; before 1800 is massive in terms of the broad categories of things we consider essential to life e.g. (in no particular order) fire, transport, cooking, metal working, agriculture, animal husbandry, buildings, weapons, health care, books, paintings, music, optics, etc. There are very few things after 2000 of such importance.I suspect that if you had a single cut-off at 1800, &#x27;before&#x27; might still win, if we stick to these high-level categories, rather than, say, patent applications. reply geraneum 9 hours agorootparentprev“autoclaves, antibiotics, and anesthesia during surgery are nice but the super intelligent AI that found the cure for all illnesses and the ability to go back in time and etc. are more important.”Someone in x thousand years from now. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparentOr even a hundred.

Find Names yo be real Why I made this site @bemmu When our Japanese-Finnish son was born, we wanted to find a name that would work in both languages. To help with the search I wrote a simple tool for personal use to look through all the names in both Japanese and Finnish, finding ones which appear in both. Thinking others might find it useful as well, years later I went back and improved it to the point that I could release it online, which is the page you are now on. This tool currently supports 58 different languages or cultures. For example if you are German and your wife is Klingon, it can tell you that the only name option is \"Arne\". In other words, it finds the intersection of two name lists. Some languages don't have many options, so it also tries a fuzzy search and some other strategies as well. Since all of these are found by software, there are no guarantees that the names are any good (for instance it sometimes suggests \"Timo\" for an Italian name, which wouldn't be great), so it is intended to only give you ideas to consider. Hope you like it. Oh, and here are the Japanese-Finnish names it found for us. We ended up going with a completely unique one that wasn't in the list, but just having a list to work with was a nice start for our name brainstorming session! Suggestions or just want to say hi?

That&#x27;s easy, but the pronunciation is quite often completely different. A good example is Jules in French vs English. In this scenario, you&#x27;re effectively going by two differently-pronounced names in all face-to-face interactions, not that different from the folks from China or India who are adopting \"Westernized\" names abroad. The only perk is that you might not have to spell it out over the phone.Do you want the same pronunciation? This is also fairly easy in many languages, but the spelling is likely to differ. An example of this might be Hannah versus Hana (English &#x2F; Czech). This option makes verbal communications easy, but may confuse people who are trying to read your name out loud or to write it down - so any interactions with customer service are going to be mildly annoying.Do you want both? For most languages, the list will be extremely short, perhaps half a dozen names such as \"Anna\". If you don&#x27;t fall in love in one of these options, tough luck.There is also a softer version of this goal: have a name that isn&#x27;t native in the second language, but that is easy to spell and pronounce. For most people, this is probably the best compromise. It lets you keep your national identity, doesn&#x27;t limit your choices too much, and minimizes friction. reply schrijver 14 hours agoparentDon’t see the problem with different pronunciations… I have a first name like Jules, I like it… indeed depending on whether people are French or English speaking they pronounce it differently—but that doesn’t bother me at all! It still feels very much like they are referring to me, and it feels like two versions of the same name, not two names. reply PumpkinSpice 14 hours agorootparentNone of this is a problem in any objective sense. It&#x27;s just that if your goal is to use one name across two languages, it&#x27;s not exactly what you get in this scenario.Stuff like that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but I bumped into quite a few immigrants who had strong preferences one way or the other. reply lucb1e 13 hours agorootparentI perceive my name to be how it is pronounced, with writing being secondary. Interesting that others see it the opposite way. Maybe related: I remember stuff best when it&#x27;s spoken, whereas apparently most people learn best when they read it or hear+write_along. I&#x27;m not dyslexic so it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t read well or anything, but still, audio seems to be my brain-compatible format.When someone says luke, yeah I&#x27;ll get it and I definitely don&#x27;t mind, but IPA &#x2F;lyk&#x2F; or French Luc is what my name is. Apparently the &#x2F;y&#x2F; sound just doesn&#x27;t exist in most languages I interact with and that makes it impossible for virtually any non-French&#x2F;Dutch person to pronounce it properly. I don&#x27;t fault them, I don&#x27;t mind, but I appreciate if someone makes an effort (even if it&#x27;s wrong, it&#x27;s only about trying) to call me by my name rather than by a translation thereof.(Edit: wtf, don&#x27;t trust tools like http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipa-reader.xyz that is near the top of search results. The default american voice pronounces &#x2F;y&#x2F; like the \"o\" in \"who\".

Accent is fine but don&#x27;t change the sound to a different IPA character altogether... For the symbols &#x2F;lyk&#x2F;, I&#x27;ve tested all voices: Dutch, French (+Canadian), Icelandic, German, Norwegian, Turkish, and Swedish are correct, whereas English, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese incorrectly read the IPA.

English doesn&#x27;t distinguish between &#x2F;y&#x2F; and &#x2F;u&#x2F;, so a native English speaker being asked to reproduce a &#x2F;y&#x2F; sound (especially in running speech where you&#x27;re not thinking about how to pronounce the sound in particular) is likely to end up with something near &#x2F;u&#x2F; anyways. reply umanwizard 11 hours agorootparentprevI know exactly how Luc is pronounced in French, but I wouldn’t do so (unless we were speaking French) because it sounds weird to use non-English sounds in English.Btw, this sound also exists in German and is spelled “y”. If you meet a German and want them to say your name in your preferred way, tell them to imagine it’s spelled “Lyk”. reply lucb1e 10 hours agorootparentGerman has the sound indeed, it&#x27;s just one swapped symbol (and probably an unusual character combination&#x2F;sequence), that&#x27;s why I feel like they ought to be able to easily. Usually it&#x27;s written ü though (ironically, in IPA &#x2F;ü&#x2F; sounds like the german u without umlaut!), but they tend to forget what the pronunciation was even if we speak somewhat regularly. It&#x27;s just foreign to them, I can understand ^^. Got one south african colleague who does it perfectly every time, native english speaker so it surprised me a lot (they&#x27;re the only one so far) but probably due to afrikaans as second language it just clicks for them.Lyk is an interesting option I should try with germans. It makes the vowel sound a bit too &#x27;short&#x27; but it&#x27;s very close indeed. Let&#x27;s see what results that gets compared to Lüc :) reply keiferski 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree with your take that the spoken version of my name is what I identify with most, not the written one.

Luckily the Hebrew alphabet is different so that wasn&#x27;t a problem in terms of spelling, but we had a lot of discussions around how to spell names that have different spellings in English vs. Spanish.We went with names that are not native-Hebrew, but are easy to pronounce in all three languages. reply riffraff 14 hours agoparentprevyou forgot the most interesting! same spelling and pronounciation, different gender!Gabriele and Andrea come to mind. reply osmsucks 1 hour agorootparentBeats me how \"Andrea\" became a female name.

But this one makes me curious; Hindi is like English in that a written \"a\" is often pronounced reduced. (Compare the traditional spelling suttee to the \"reformed\" spelling sati, which more closely reflects the Devanagari spelling, or the spelling of the English word \"jungle\" to the Hindi word of the same pronunciation, jangal.)So it&#x27;s possible that a highly nativized pronunciation of \"Pavit\", if stressed on the second syllable, might be correct! reply petre 15 hours agoparentprevIt attempts to solve a naming problem using a dataset and algorithms, failing miserably.\"There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.\" reply lucb1e 12 hours agorootparent\"using a dataset and algorithms\" is a lot of fancy words for ctrl+fAt least, I have no indication that it does more than just find which items in list A also occur in list B.

We were after names that could be pronounced in both Danish and Gujarati. After grabbing name lists from various websites, I generated phonetic translations of each name, and then looked at the names that had the shortest edit distances in the phonetic representation between both languages. It was a great exercise in taping bits of software together, and I ended up coming down to a shortlist of 7 names. I very proudly showed this list to my wife, and she showed me her list of names that she had written down.Turns out two of the names were on both the lists, so we went with them. I have a feeling that it wasn’t so important that they were on my lists. reply jkrems 14 hours agoparentprevThe dataset seems pretty unreliable.

German.I wonder what the source for the names is.

When our daughters were born we were a French and German living in an English speaking country so we tried to make sure that the name works in 3 languages. Actually when we finally decided on a name for our first daughter (Tia) we chose a long form of the name (Tiahana) because my mother in law is half Spanish (Tia means Aunty in Spanish).Incidentally most of the names we considered don&#x27;t seem to be on the list returned by this website (and we didn&#x27;t go for very uncommon names).It seems the algorithm selects on names that exist in both languages (judging by the graphic in the results). I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s often not really what you want, as they might sound very different. reply keiferski 12 hours agoparentprevIn practice, what happens in many cases is that you have a separate name for each place. For example, your English passport will say “John” but your Polish one will say “Jan.” The Polish one won’t actually let you have the name “John”, or at least it will be translated by default.So it isn’t always necessary to have a single name that can translate into X languages, but that there is a version of the name in the languages you care about. reply adelie 14 hours agoparentprevthese results are absolutely hilarious for chinese, where names are almost entirely freeform, gender is determined by character choice (not sound), and there&#x27;s only a limited set of suffixes to choose from in the first place.i think these are probably scraped from historical figures, since i see some very recognizable ones (i.e. enlai, zedong, jianguo), but there&#x27;s also a data integrity issue because a lot of the masculine chinese names show up with , or £ in them. reply silvestrov 10 hours agoparentprevData for Danish is absolute garbage.

I can&#x27;t count the number of pronunciations I have heard and I have largely given up except for the most extreme mispronouncations.

    "title": "Go Open Source Release Celebrates 14 Years with Feature-Filled Updates and Future Improvements",
    "originLink": "https://go.dev/blog/14years",
    "originBody": "The Go Blog Fourteen Years of Go Russ Cox, for the Go team 10 November 2023 Today we celebrate the fourteenth birthday of the Go open source release! Go has had a great year, with two feature-filled releases and other important milestones. We released Go 1.20 in February and Go 1.21 in August, focusing more on implementation improvements than new language changes. Profile-guided optimization (PGO), previewed in Go 1.20 and released in Go 1.21, allows the Go compiler to read a profile of your program and then spend more time optimizing the parts of your program that run most often. In Go 1.21, workloads typically get between 2% and 7% CPU usage improvements from enabling PGO. See “Profile-guided optimization in Go 1.21” for an overview and the profile-guided optimization user guide for complete documentation. Go has provided support for gathering coverage profiles during go test since Go 1.2. Go 1.20 added support for gathering coverage profiles in binaries built by go build, allowing you to gather coverage during larger integration tests as well. See “Code coverage for Go integration tests” for details. Compatibility has been an important part of Go since “Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs”. Go 1.21 improved compatibility further by expanding the conventions for use of GODEBUG in situations where we need to make a change, such as an important bug fix, that must be permitted but may still break existing programs. See the blog post “Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and Go 2” for an overview and the documentation “Go, Backwards Compatibility, and GODEBUG” for details. Go 1.21 also shipped support for built-in toolchain management, allowing you to change which version of the Go toolchain you use in a specific module as easily as you change the versions of other dependencies. See the blog post “Forward Compatibility and Toolchain Management in Go 1.21” for an overview and the documentation “Go Toolchains” for details. Another important tooling achievement was the integration of on-disk indexes into gopls, the Go LSP server. This cut gopls’s startup latency and memory usage by 3-5X in typical use cases. “Scaling gopls for the growing Go ecosystem” explains the technical details. You can make sure you’re running the latest gopls by running: go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest Go 1.21 introduced new cmp, maps, and slices packages — Go’s first generic standard libraries — as well as expanding the set of comparable types. For details about that, see the blog post “All your comparable types”. Overall, we continue to refine generics and to write talks and blog posts explaining important details. Two notable posts this year were “Deconstructing Type Parameters”, and “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Type Inference – And a Little Bit More”. Another important new package in Go 1.21 is log/slog, which adds an official API for structured logging to the standard library. See “Structured logging with slog” for an overview. For the WebAssembly (Wasm) port, Go 1.21 shipped support for running on WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) preview 1. WASI preview 1 is a new “operating system” interface for Wasm that is supported by most server-side Wasm environments. See “WASI support in Go” for a walkthrough. On the security side, we are continuing to make sure Go leads the way in helping developers understand their dependencies and vulnerabilities, with Govulncheck 1.0 launching in July. If you use VS Code, you can run govulncheck directly in your editor using the Go extension: see this tutorial to get started. And if you use GitHub, you can run govulncheck as part of your CI/CD, with the GitHub Action for govulncheck. For more about checking your dependencies for vulnerability problems, see this year’s Google I/O talk, “Build more secure apps with Go and Google”.) Another important security milestone was Go 1.21’s highly reproducible toolchain builds. See “Perfectly Reproducible, Verified Go Toolchains” for details, including a demonstration of reproducing an Ubuntu Linux Go toolchain on a Mac without using any Linux tools at all. It has been a busy year! In Go’s 15th year, we’ll keep working to make Go the best environment for software engineering at scale. One change we’re particularly excited about is redefining for loop := semantics to remove the potential for accidental aliasing bugs. See “Fixing For Loops in Go 1.22” for details, including instructions for previewing this change in Go 1.21. Thank You! The Go project has always been far more than just us on the Go team at Google. Thank you to all our contributors and everyone in the Go community for making Go what it is today. We wish you all the best in the year ahead.

You can of course imagine hypotheticals where there was more money behind it, but on the spectrum of PLs it&#x27;s got more support than most. And further, I think the core developers who work on it like rsc and bradfitz are objectively great implementers. Despite that, the majority of complaints about Go are a lack of language features; you even see some in this thread.In other words, a language with an above-average amount of effort and ability and 14 years behind it is still perceived as feature poor. But imagine how much more time it would have taken if they had taken on a larger scope, like if they had gone through all the complex design process for generics up front.For me it is a great lesson on how important reducing scope is for shipping, and also how a reduced scope enables you to more judiciously choose what is important. If they had decided that features X, Y, Z were table stakes for their launch they would never have had the time to do the other things that I think have made Go great. reply VBprogrammer 22 hours agoparentI only have a small amount of Go experience but in my humble opinion I don&#x27;t think the lack of features is due to lack of time or funding. In fact it would have probably been much easier to say yes to a bunch of features than to continually deflect and reject the demand for those. I&#x27;m sure anyone working with different stakeholders recognises this effect.They have very deliberately tried to minimise the feature set in order to keep the language easy to learn. C++ is probably the canonical example of a language which hasn&#x27;t kept the feature set tractable but I&#x27;d even argue that Python may have fallen into this trap in recent history. reply mseepgood 21 hours agorootparent> They have very deliberately tried to minimise the feature setI thought this was common knowledge. They made whole conference talks about it. reply vram22 18 hours agorootparentYes, and Rob Pike has a post about it on his blog, command-central.com, IIRC. reply asah 21 hours agorootparentprevGiven AI assisted programming, I&#x27;m not sure how much any of this matters... reply sakjur 20 hours agorootparentComplex language features have much more of a toll on reading code than they have on writing code. One example that I like to use is that while Go&#x27;s lack of operator overloading is occasionally a nuisance, it means that you&#x27;ll never have to dig deep to understand what \"+\" is doing on this particular line, since it&#x27;ll always behave according to the core language rules.I think the total cost of debugging hours often ends up being several magnitudes higher than the cost of development hours. At least for me, the process of debugging is something that involves scanning the code to load up my brain with as much possibly relevant context as I can and then try to analyze what parts of that might explain the seen behavior. A carefully designed language should help to both minimize the size of that context and the amount of linguistical gotchas that are part of it.If I&#x27;d use an AI assistant, that lets me ask more pointed questions. Wouldn&#x27;t that improve the assistance the AI can provide? reply merb 19 hours agorootparentThat is not necessarily true. Especially the error handling makes it really awkward to read go code. A lot of languages with an expressive type system do look aweful when looking at methods. But the same thing can be done with go methods. Writing hard to understand go code is just as easy as say with scala or rust reply sakjur 19 hours agorootparentOh, absolutely. I don&#x27;t mean to claim Go as an outstanding example of a well-designed programming language. I appreciate Go&#x27;s language design, but I also similarly appreciate Scala, Rust, Java, Erlang and various other programming languages I&#x27;ve interacted with.My point is more against the notion that AI assistants would make careful language design any less important than in favor of any particular language. The popular programming languages all have their own virtues and drawbacks (and the unpopular ones almost certainly have at least their own drawbacks). reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentprev> Especially the error handling makes it really awkward to read go code.Go does not have error handling at all, just general value handing. What do you find awkward about its value handlers? They are essentially the same as every other C-style language out there. reply VBprogrammer 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s certainly not difficult to understand Go error handling. But it does take up quite a bit of real-estate. I think more importantly for me, it&#x27;s too easy to forget an error check. Having primitives which make error checking painless and validated by the compiler would be nice. reply randomdata 14 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s too easy to forget an error check.I never understood this. I do understand it is easy to forget to handle an error like it is easy to forget to handle a distance or temperature. Humans will make mistakes.But nobody laments about how they forget to handle distances or temperatures, or cry for special constructs to ensure that they don&#x27;t screw up their distance and temperature handling. What is it about the word error that sends developers into a tizzy?Why would we want a solution that only works for errors and not for values of all kinds? reply vacuity 13 hours agorootparentBecause handling errors is important for complex programs. Whether errors-as-values or exceptions or aborts are the best option, being able to write a program that handles errors well makes it that much more robust. Don&#x27;t want some weird behavior happening when the program should&#x27;ve noticed an error and dealt with it somehow. reply randomdata 11 hours agorootparentHanding values is important for all programs. You don&#x27;t want some weird behaviour happening in any case. If you are writing a system that turns on a heater when the temperature falls below freezing, you&#x27;re going to have a really bad time if you forget to handle the temperature.So, yes, it makes sense to have constructs that can help with that problem, but it would be weird to have such constructs only for what a human considers an error condition. You would want that for every case that needs to be handled.Otherwise you have to resort to testing, and if you accept that testing is good enough to ensure that you don&#x27;t forget to check the temperature, then it also good enough to ensure that you have checked an error. There is nothing special about the error case. It&#x27;s just another state like any other. reply erik_seaberg 5 hours agorootparentAn error signals that a non-error value you were relying on will not be available. Control flow should nearly always change in response to that, often drastically. That’s why a language should provide a caller-controlled non-local exit from a futile chain of calls. Many languages only do that for errors, which is not a major limitation when users can define errors. reply vacuity 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, I think that&#x27;s why a lot of people are disappointed that Go doesn&#x27;t quite have sum types, because sum types do increase expressivity around values in general. That they improve error handling is just one application. reply randomdata 11 hours agorootparentThere seems to be no consensus as to what sum types actually means, but the most popular definition I find in my travels is: Tagged unions. Which is funny as a sum is not a union, but anyway...Assuming you share in that definition, while Go might benefit from tagged unions in general, I&#x27;m not sure they actually help in any way with remember to handle errors. A union is just as easy to forget to handle as a single discriminate type.But perhaps you are of another sum type school? Perhaps one of the other sum type definitions are useful here? reply vacuity 11 hours agorootparentTagged union is a good definition. I was thinking of Rust&#x27;s Result type, which has Ok(some value) and Err(some value) variants. reply randomdata 11 hours agorootparentRight. See that doesn&#x27;t help, at least not in the context of Go without any other modifications. Logically, you can reduce that Result state to a simple boolean (Ok = true, Err = false). But the bool type in Go is prone to the very same problem.It doesn&#x27;t matter how many type layers you add. The problem is that there is nothing in the language that enforces handling of values, no matter what type that value might be. reply vacuity 10 hours agorootparentYes, manual tagging doesn&#x27;t provide type safety. That&#x27;s why I said some people are disappointed that Go doesn&#x27;t have sum types. There isn&#x27;t even a convoluted workaround either, at least not a full one. reply randomdata 9 hours agorootparentIt is not so much a matter of lack of type safety, it is forgetting to implement an application requirement.Even an advanced type system capable of formal proofs isn&#x27;t going to help you if you&#x27;ve forgotten the requirement when defining the types. And if you are using a language with a lesser type system (Go, Rust, any language you are likely to use in the real word), and haven&#x27;t forgotten the requirement, then you would have encoded that knowledge in tests instead, making the forgetfulness in implementation ultimately immaterial. After all, there is no practical difference between learning that you forgot to implement logic by the compiler telling you or the test suite telling you.So, we can infer that the OP is talking about where one straight up forgot about the requirement from start to finish. I&#x27;m skeptical that there is any technical solution to that problem, but sum types most certainly isn&#x27;t it. reply vacuity 9 hours agorootparentThere is a point at which even dependent typing won&#x27;t save you, but sum types are a useful tool to reduce negligence. Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good. reply randomdata 9 hours agorootparentSum types are useful tool, but they are not helpful in this particular case. There is nothing about sum types that would help avoid this problem in the slightest. Perfect need not be the enemy of good, but good is not equivalent to not even trying.This is not a general \"wouldn&#x27;t it be nice of Go had...\" thread. We are talking about a specific problem. reply vacuity 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not really sure what your point is then. We should have comprehensive tests and therefore error checking isn&#x27;t special compared to other programming mistakes? I think we should both have tests (don&#x27;t skimp on them if given time, of course) and use tools like sum types to write more robust programs from the get-go. Errors can even be treated like other values using sum types; that raises the bar universally instead of just improving error checking. replymejutoco 17 hours agorootparentprevI think you will like this quote :)\"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.\" - Brian W. KernighanI dont know if it applies to language features, though. reply xigoi 16 hours agorootparentprev> it means that you&#x27;ll never have to dig deep to understand what \"+\" is doing on this particular line,Instead you&#x27;ll have to dig deep to undershnnd what \"Add()\" is doing on this particular line. How is that any different? reply thunky 15 hours agorootparentBecause parent is taking about operators like \"+\" and how it can be confusing not knowing if a function call is behind it. This is different from obvious functions like \"Add()\". reply xigoi 15 hours agorootparentHow is “Add()” any different from “+”? They&#x27;re just two different names for the same thing – a function that adds two numbers or other objects. reply thunky 15 hours agorootparentBecause if the language doesn&#x27;t allow overloading (which is the context of this thread) then \"+\" will always be implemented by the language. That&#x27;s a big difference. replybayindirh 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you can’t design your program in your head, and can’t trace the code by reading it, neither the compiler nor AI (i.e.: code derived from other people’s code) won’t help you.I like Go in that regard. You can keep the whole feature set in your head, and read&#x2F;simulate the code without getting confused, and I’m telling this as a C++ fan. reply speed_spread 20 hours agorootparentprevA line of code is written once but read ten times. AI making it cheap to write will only increase the maintenance burden. And if you need AI to maintain AI written code, you&#x27;ll have gained nothing but a new dependency in your toolbox. reply bananapub 19 hours agorootparent> A line of code is written once but read ten timesreally? source? My counter-assertion is that I&#x27;d guess most code is basically never read - most of it is in ad-hoc PHP CMSes or VBA scripts. reply speed_spread 18 hours agorootparentMy assumption about something coded in Go is that it was expected to be persistent and actively maintained. I agree that AI is good for one-off scripting purposes. reply asah 14 hours agorootparentprevThe downvoting is so cute. Given the pace of AI development, y&#x27;all really think we&#x27;re going to be typing individual lines of code in languages like golang? Seriously?Come on HN, you&#x27;re better than this. reply lolinder 19 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think the lack of features is due to time or funding constraints: all the large languages that originated after Go have more elaborate features, and many of them have less funding than I assume Google puts towards Go.Rust, Kotlin, Swift, and Dart are the main ones I&#x27;m looking at. Rust and Dart had an official package manager long before Go did. All four have had some form of generics, at least the first three have sum types, null safety, and many other features that are missing in Go. These languages might have as much funding as Go (I don&#x27;t know), but they&#x27;ve had less time to implement these things.Rather than funding constraints, it seems to me that Go has avoided adding features because that&#x27;s not the kind of language they want to design. It may have led to more polish than some of the languages listed above (I personally prefer programming in any of the first three to programming in Go), but it&#x27;s not a given that Go would have taken longer to build if they&#x27;d made the scope bigger. reply pansa2 21 hours agoparentprev> on the spectrum of PLs it&#x27;s got more support than mostGo definitely has much more funding and developer hours put into it than open-development languages like Python - that’s got to be a good thing for the language.On the other hand, would you choose to build a long-term business on top of Go, given that all that support comes from one company? What if Google decide that maintaining Go is no longer in their best interest? reply usrbinbash 21 hours agorootparent> On the other hand, would you choose to build a long-term business on top of Goa) Absolutely and b) already done.Go is stable. The language is battle tested. It works as advertised. It is open source. Even if google pulled all funding (unlikely, since alot of their architecture seems to use it), the language is maintainable.And btw. Languages don&#x27;t have to continuously evolve to remain viable. Modern languages seem to indicate otherwise, but that behavior is what Go actively avoids; adding everything and the kitchen sink into the language as soon as some other language has it. If Go showed one thing, it is that PLs don&#x27;t need to add as many features as possible.And just to prove that point: C is still a top rated language in terms of usage. When was it last updated? C17 came out in 2017, and did not add new features. It superseded C11, which came out 6 years before that, also mainly standardising things that were already de-factos in most compilers. Before that was C99 in 1999, and before that is only ANSI-C and K&R. reply pjmlp 13 hours agorootparentThis year, C23 will be ratified in January 2024, and there are enough features on the pipeline for C to be \"C++ without classes\". reply crabbone 19 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of misinformation, bad arguments and bad conclusions in this post. Let&#x27;s pick it apart.> Go is stable.But, past isn&#x27;t a guarantee of the future. It was stable before, but who&#x27;s to say it will be in the future? The fact that it&#x27;s \"owned\" by a single entity should make you scared that it wont, because the whim of that entity is what can change any property of the language.Additionally, Go has no standard, no alternative implementations to speak of. All of this should have you concerned for the future (but you seem to ignore the obvious dangers).> It works as advertised.It&#x27;s the opposite. Languages with single (or one primary) implementation advertise how they work. Go is implement first document later language. The public discussion is for show because public doesn&#x27;t control how things are being implemented. The Go dev. team may listen to everyone&#x27;s opinion, nod in agreement, and do something else entirely, and nobody will hold them responsible for the discrepancy.> the language is maintainable.By who? How did you come to this conclusion? There&#x27;s only evidence to the contrary of your argument. There isn&#x27;t any other organization that&#x27;s interested in maintaining Go if Google were to go away. At least nobody expressed such an intention publicly.> Languages don&#x27;t have to continuously evolve to remain viable.This is demonstrably false. Hardware changes, operating system interfaces change. If you don&#x27;t keep up with these changes, eventually your language becomes irrelevant. To further illustrate this point: today, versions of Python 3.7 and older cannot be built from source on modern Linux with current GCC. Python&#x27;s dependencies on libffi and libssl are incompatible with their current interfaces, and so the language can only be built with older libraries (but then the operating system needs to use the older ones too) or statically linked with those libraries, but in case of libffi that doesn&#x27;t help because it will not work for its intended goal. And the further back you go, the less likely it is that you will be able to build and use any version of Python. Bet, the same is true for Go.> When was it last updated? C17 came out in 2017C standards don&#x27;t get implemented on the year they are released. Bet you Microsoft probably doesn&#x27;t fully implement this standard. (I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a guess based on past experience using their tools).In more broader terms, I have no idea why did you bring C into this argument. C is an entirely different language in terms of governance, support, standardization... It&#x27;s basically all things that Go isn&#x27;t. Standards and multiple interested vendors ensure the survival of the language. The whole argument against using Go for long-term projects is that it&#x27;s not like C. You trying to point out that C is used successfully for long-term projects doesn&#x27;t help to show that Go would too. If anything, you should suspect that it won&#x27;t, because Go is the opposite of C. reply Wowfunhappy 19 hours agorootparent> This is demonstrably false.

Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but my sense is this would be a relatively minor maintenance task.I suspect no one has updated Python 3.7 because there is no need (and because the Python foundation would prefer to nudge everyone to update anyway). reply saturn_vk 17 hours agorootparentprevI can think of at least 2 more implementations besides the official one. So I&#x27;d have to assume that the misinformation you speak of us coming from you reply usrbinbash 18 hours agorootparentprev>There&#x27;s a lot of misinformation, bad arguments and bad conclusions in this post.

It was stable before, but who&#x27;s to say it will be in the future?Whos to say C will be stable tomorrow? Well, the fact that things like GCC are standards unto themself, even without any official governance (Which C has in addition). Its the same for Go.If anyone was to change that, all I have to do is check out an earlier version of this open source language, and use that. And since tons of code rely on this, that is what would happen.Languages don&#x27;t become unstable because they suddenly change trajectory. This rarely ever happens. Language instability requiring constant evolvement and developer effort (both from the languages devs, as well as the languages users) is the result of feature upon feature getting heaved upon a language, along with codebases relying on these features, necessitating constant maintenance effort to keep up to date.Go, explicitly, has a completely different design trajectory.

The language didn&#x27;t change much from C99, which itself wasn&#x27;t that big a step away from ANSI-C. C99 was a quarter century ago, and C remains one of the most used languages in existence.> To further illustrate this point: today, versions of PythonI am pretty sure I never used Python as an example for this. If you disagree, quote where I did.> In more broader terms, I have no idea why did you bring C into this argument.For a very simple reason: To show that a language that is mostly feature-freezed, and so stable that I can run a modern compiler on decades-old unchanged code, and still get a runnable executable, can be, and are, incredibly successful. Go has been called \"C for the 21st century\", and for everything other than System-Programming, that statement holds true. reply pjmlp 13 hours agorootparent> The language didn&#x27;t change much from C99, which itself wasn&#x27;t that big a step away from ANSI-C.

What a terrible comment.But:archive&#x2F;tar breaks so often we&#x27;ve had to have a fork of it on and off for the last 10 years.

Well, what kind of real world code would rely on the fact that closures over an iteration target examine a value that depends on runtime behavior instead of the actual value that, semantically, seems to have been closed over?I have stumbled upon this issue myself when I first learned Go. I have used Go professionally and in private projects and since long before modfiles became a thing. I have NEVER seen code that relies on this completely unintuitive behavior. This is not a change that breaks something good, this is a fix that removes a footgun from the language.Further down, rsc writes this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;60078#issuecomment-15424...) That&#x27;s some of the real-world evidence in favor of changing 3-clause loops. I have looked, and I found no evidence in favor of not changing them. If you want to make the case for not changing them, the way to do that would be to provide real-world examples of code that breaks with the new semantics.So, semantics aside, no, I do not consider this a breaking change, because while it is, technically, not backward compatible, it doesn&#x27;t break existing code.> I gave multiple examples already.What exactly breaks in the archive&#x2F;tar package? I looked it up, only found some bugs and issues, but nothing I would consider a change that breaks existing code.What exactly did modfiles break? I can still compile code without modules. Yes, modern versions of the go-tool require a flag via envvars, but they are still compatible with old projects. And libraries changing is not the same as the language changing. If a build relies on a certain commit on the library, I can always check out that commit. reply saturn_vk 15 hours agorootparentprev> Demanding 10 examples is a terrible comment.

Some of the most critical systems are built with it.If it’s good enough for Kubernetes then it’s good enough for any business. reply crabbone 19 hours agorootparentI believe, Kubernetes was initially built in Java.

Then reaching a very stable 1.0 in 2012 is also fast.That&#x27;s only possibly by reducing scope. I don&#x27;t think more people help, because you can&#x27;t really divide and conquer language design.(As far as I understand, the early project was something like \"take Ken Thompson&#x27;s C compilers and add goroutines, garbage collection, slices, and interfaces\")I don&#x27;t use Go regularly, but I&#x27;ve also had some very good experiences with it lately.They have kept the tools simple and predictable. Getting started is a breeze.The MIPS support worked surprisingly well, e.g. on a machine with 64 MB of RAM.I&#x27;ve had and still have a lot of gripes about (mainly being a sort of closed ecosystem), but you can&#x27;t deny that it works well, and is a big achievement. reply HumblyTossed 21 hours agoparentprevI like Go because it does have so few features.

Your old Go 1.15 programs will continue to compile and work for the foreseeable future. reply davewritescode 17 hours agorootparentThis isn’t true at all and I’ve complained about it before but the go maintainers introduced a big breaking change in the x.509 standard library that caused a lot of scrambling.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;39568As far as I know every other language standard library still allows CN to be used to validate the hostname when the SAN field doesn’t exist. reply ericbarrett 14 hours agorootparentI disagree that TLS is a good example of a breaking change, since this is a specific library dealing with a developing and dynamic area of security. If this weren’t changed, it would compromise PKI cert integrity by allowing obsolete fields. Also you can get the old behavior back with a flag. The fact that other languages are lagging here reflects badly on them.As discussed in the link, CommonName has been deprecated in x.509 serverAuth certificates for decades, and all major browsers dropped support for the field (even as a fallback) years ago. reply davewritescode 7 hours agorootparentYou can’t get the old behavior back with a flag as of 1.17 and if you could I wouldn’t be complaining.Also, the reason CN is deprecated has nothing to do with security but the maximum length of the field in the spec.

They specifically mentioned forward compatibility. Something that requires continued maintenance effort, and the more versions you roll out, the bigger the effort.I seriously doubt Go is advertised as forward compatible or that it is such in practice. Just like any similar programming language, they depend on system interfaces, and those change, albeit at a slow rate. If all older versions of Go aren&#x27;t on life support, then some will become obsolete over time. reply kunley 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s very far from true for many of languages.Tried to gradually upgrade projects written Ruby and Python, that were not touched in 10 years. The dependencies were based on C extensions that depended on libs not existing anymore. It was even impossible to get the original version compiled, because in was dependent on a Linux distro version that doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, even as docker images.That was the hard lesson: depending on dynamically loaded libs means you need to constantly maintain the project and even if it has no visible bugs, or doesn&#x27;t depend on the code having security vulnerabilities, you need to adapt it to evolve together with the libs, and that is needed even if you actually use only what&#x27;s \"old\" in the libs. But we&#x27;re not saving every megabyte of a disk space anymore like in 90s. Switching to static compilation does wonders for maintainability. reply dragonwriter 17 hours agorootparentYou can vendor compiled dynamically loaded libraries, too, installing them with your program if not available.If you actually need them to be the same version used by something else on the system, that&#x27;s still a peoblem, but static compilation doesn&#x27;t solve that, anyway. reply kunley 10 hours agorootparentIt is not about vendoring. Vendored dynamic libs would be depending or other libs or even on glibc that does not exist anymore. You can&#x27;t recreate the dynamic libs environment.With static you don&#x27;t need that environment, only the kernel, so yes, static compilation solves the problem. reply Yoric 22 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely not with Python. I&#x27;m currently maintaining a Python application and every minor version update for the language or even some of the frameworks involved comes as a high-stress process with numerous potential breakages. reply criddell 21 hours agorootparentSure, but if you don’t keep moving to the new version, your application will continue to work for the foreseeable future, no?

At the expense of not being able to update too much the OS running the thing within Docker, which by itself comes with a security risk. reply crabbone 18 hours agorootparentprevNot at all. Python 3.7 and older cannot be even built on current Linux + GCC. Python has few important system dependencies s.a. libffi and libssl that since changed major versions and aren&#x27;t compatible with the interfaces used by Python 3.7 (what happens in Python 2.7 world -- heaven only knows).Python has no standard. There&#x27;s no implementation of Python that say \"we support versions X, Y and Z\" of Python. It just keeps going and as the platform changes, it changes too. Old versions lose support relatively quickly. Three or four years if memory serves. If you go beyond that horizon, things start to fall apart, the further you go, the more likely it just be too hard to fix.Compare this to C, where compilers typically support all C standards up to something moderately recent. Your C89 code would compile and work today to the extent guaranteed by the standard. Actual programs will have experienced bitrot of course.

To make things worse, you can only recover a panic in a goroutine that you spawn. So, you can&#x27;t do anything to prevent a panic in a goroutine spawned by a third-party library crashing your whole program. The best you can do is to set up a supervisor to restart your program after crash. reply galangalalgol 22 hours agoparentRust made the same call. Panic isn&#x27;t supposed to be \"I&#x27;m not sure what to do now, maybe my caller will know?\". That is an error not a panic amd you return it. A panic is for \"I just realized I or someone else did something really bad and the invariants of everything are now in question, hit the breakers, lets try this again\". If your dependency library, like so many, panicked rather than take the time and effort to check the conditions that would cause an out of bounds access, then they are bad and they should feel bad, fork and merge the fix and don&#x27;t say anything, they will feel the shame. reply beltsazar 21 hours agorootparent> Rust made the same call.Completely different. In Rust when you spawn a thread [1] or an async task [2], you&#x27;ll get a handle from which you can check if a panic happens inside the thread&#x2F;task.

One of the valid reasons for a panic is that you&#x27;ve encountered something that makes you think your adress space is in a bad state. Threads share an address space, so the reasoning was that if they panic, so should the process, but that isn&#x27;t what happened. reply DangitBobby 18 hours agorootparentprevThen why does recover() even exist? Programs seem to continue just fine after a recover. reply quickthrower2 22 hours agorootparentprevRunning off forks is no fun though. reply hackerbrother 21 hours agorootparentSo the question is: should there exist a method that means “bring down the whole ship”. (Or, should that method be something more severe than “panic”, and panic should be redefined with a more limited scope.) reply quickthrower2 10 hours agorootparentI agree. I like C# where you can expect libraries to play nice. In theory it is possible for C# library to crash your app but it is definitely not on the trodden path.But I do prefer return values over exceptions! I have not used Go and I think the err != nil boilerplate might drive me a little insane, but Haskells option types seem a nice fit. reply zoky 21 hours agorootparentprev> Panic isn&#x27;t supposed to be \"I&#x27;m not sure what to do now, maybe my caller will know?\".So panic is supposed to be “I’m not sure what to do now, I don’t care if my caller knows”?No process running outside of kernel space ever has any business panicking. Throw an error and move on with your life (or don’t, that’s fine too) but don’t punish your caller by forcing it to crash because you failed to foresee X, Y, or Z circumstances. reply usrbinbash 20 hours agorootparent> Throw an error and move on with your lifeNo, absolutely not!Panics are the result of conditions that absolutely should crash the program! They are not errors, they are not similar to exceptions, they are conditions that should not occur, and thus if they do occur, either the program itself, or the platform it is running on, has a problem that needs to be solved before the program runs again.If a cars fuel is running low, it should turn on a warning light and inform the driver that he should find a gas station. If a piece of the road is suddenly missing, the car needs to stop.If a panic occurs, I don&#x27;t WANT the program to continue executing! That would lead me right back into C land, where an out-of-bounds memory access would silently start to poison my program and crash it days after the actual error ocurred, if i&#x27;m lucky! If I&#x27;m unlucky, and the process needs to be sufficiently privileged, it would kill the server, again several days (or weeks) later, with slim-to-no chance for me to figure out what even went wrong. reply iainmerrick 20 hours agorootparentWhy would there be a \"recover\" function, then?A quick google turns up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;defer-panic-and-recover, which says:For a real-world example of panic and recover, see the json package from the Go standard library. It encodes an interface with a set of recursive functions. If an error occurs when traversing the value, panic is called to unwind the stack to the top-level function call, which recovers from the panic and returns an appropriate error valueThat&#x27;s panic and recover used for control flow, just like might use exceptions in other languages.Looks like panic has at least two purposes, depending on whether you recover or not? reply usrbinbash 20 hours agorootparent> A quick google turns up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;defer-panic-and-recover, which says:And another quick googling turns up this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26799which says: However, this is a poor example and a misuse of panic and recover as exceptions. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;effective_go.html#panic The example will be invalid soon with the release of go 1.11 as well. The panic&#x2F;recover was removed from the unmarshal code. See master&#x27;sSo no, panic and recover are not meant to be used as control flow. Yes, they CAN be used that way. I also CAN use pythons `eval` a lot, use a scripting language as my command line interpreter, or make an apple-pie with onions and garlic.As for why `recover` exists in the first place: Packages should have the ability to stop internal panics. There are various reasons for that, some worse than other. For example it is probably okay if a package doing sensor readouts recovers from a division by zero and replaces it with an error saying that the sensor value makes no sense. reply iainmerrick 18 hours agorootparentAha, good find, thanks! Maybe they need to work on their SEO. :) reply zoky 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd why exactly do you trust a called method to determine whether or not you should be able to keep running? Like… do your job, you object. I didn’t load your library and call a method on you to tell me what the state of my system is, I just want you to either do what I asked you to do or fail gracefully, and then I can decide whether we crash or not.> If a piece of the road is suddenly missing, the car needs to stop.Uh, no. If a piece of the road is missing, it’s up to the driver to stop, not the car. The car has no business whatsoever determining whether the road exists or not, except inasmuch as it communicates to the driver “hey, whatever the heck this is is difficult or impossible to drive on, your call what we do though.” reply usrbinbash 19 hours agorootparent> just want you to either do what I asked you to do or fail gracefullyAnd most of the time, this is EXACTLY what happens. In fact most libraries that do use panics, recover them internally and return errors to the callers.Again: panics are not errors, panics are not exceptions. A library should never panic in a way that it&#x27;s caller notices, UNLESS it met a condition that simply is not recoverable, not by the library itself, and not by it&#x27;s caller.Yes, this requires care by the libraries authors not to overuse panics. Yes, there are libraries that do overuse them. No, this doesn&#x27;t change anything about what I wrote. If a library I use would do that, I would either fix the library, or find a better one.> Uh, no. If a piece of the road is missingOkay, let me try again with a better analogy:If a cars engine breaks down, the car will stop. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the driver wants the car to go for another 100 kilometers. It stops. Period. Not because anyone or anything \"wants\" the car to stop, but because its engine \"package\" met a condition, under which the further running of whatever context it is used in (in this case, the car), is no longer feasible and&#x2F;or possible.That is exactly what panicking in a way that hits the runtime communicates: Oh noes, the engine just broke down, and now the machine can no longer run. reply zoky 9 hours agorootparentI’m not sure how valuable these analogies actually are, but your example of the broken engine really seems to go towards my point. If the car breaks down, the driver still has several options: coast downhill, switch to a different car, pull a bicycle out of the trunk, or just get out and continue on foot. But the car enforcing the end of the trip by simply exploding and killing the driver isn’t really an acceptable response to engine failure.A library that unrecoverably crashes your program for any reason is defective by design, and a programming language that purposely allows a library to do so as a design choice is also defective by design in my opinion. reply zozbot234 20 hours agorootparentprev> I just want you to either do what I asked you to do or fail gracefully, and then I can decide whether we crash or not.Then you&#x27;re looking for resumable conditions, which just so happen to be effectively isomorphic to async-await. (The called function is effectively a piece of async code which &#x27;awaits&#x27; upon a failure condition, after which it can either be resumed or canceled as with an ordinary panic.) reply xyzzy_plugh 20 hours agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s reasonable for the caller to continue then return an error.

And why on Earth would we trust it to do so? Is encapsulation not even a thing anymore? I really just don’t understand. reply bogeholm 20 hours agorootparentA classic example is:- Accessing array out of bounds: panic- File not found: error reply nishs 19 hours agorootparentThere are two \"kinds\" of panics: those initiated by the Go runtime, and those initiated by the program author, though technically there isn&#x27;t a distinction. When you access an array out of bounds, the Go runtime initiates the panic. On the other hand, for a condition that the program should hold but doesn&#x27;t, the program author should initiate the panic. For example, in the exhaustive switch below, reaching the default case means that either you have somehow incorrectly allowed the construction of an invalid token value earlier in your program, or you have missed to account for a valid token value in this function. func (t token) symbol() byte { switch t { case add: return &#x27;+&#x27; case sub: return &#x27;-&#x27; case mul: return &#x27;*&#x27; case quo: return &#x27;&#x2F;&#x27; default: panic(\"unknown token\") } }Errors are different. For example, url.Parse returns an error if its input string is an invalidly formatted URL. package url func Parse(rawURL string) (*URL, error) reply galangalalgol 19 hours agorootparentThat is a great example of a reason to panic. There is nothing you can do at that point but return an error or panic, and something has really gone wrong if you are pulling bad tokens out of a hashmap you made yourself, tonthe point I think you should panic. Sadly, almost all the panics I see coming out of rust crates are because someone called unwrap instead of handling the error case. replygoldinfra 20 hours agoparentprevSounds like you may be confused thinking that a panic in Go is like throw in other languages? Third-party libraries should virtually never panic. Go has panic, and it&#x27;s useful for a few things, but does not use them as exceptions are used in other languages.This is a bit like worrying that your programming language won&#x27;t prevent a third-party library from sending a SIGKILL to your program or that it doesn&#x27;t prevent third-party libraries from delete your entire file system.No general purpose language protects against malicious or stupid code. reply jamescostian 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen apps break in prod where third party libraries had array accesses on indices that didn&#x27;t exist, or dereferenced nil pointers, in goroutines they spawned. And those aren&#x27;t the only ways to cause a panic without ever calling the panic function.Third party libraries have bugs sometimes, and other times our usage of them can create bugs. Nothing like a SIGKILL or anything malicious. That&#x27;s just the way things are and will be. And breaking down like this in dev can be fantastic!But when a once in a blue moon issue crops up in prod and all other connections are dropped, the fact that a simple defer+recover couldn&#x27;t have been preemptively placed on all goroutines is a huge nightmare.

That&#x27;s why Go has a mechanism to handle a panic with the `recover` function.

They should have either removed panics entirely and made error as return values the only way to do signal errors or they should have made defer+recover more mainstream like exceptions.Current state of affairs is that third party libraries panic where they shouldn’t, programs don’t defer where they should, recovers cause deadlock due to non deferred mutex releases, that assumed panics are panics and not exceptions. On top of that we have to live with the verbose error handling that still isn’t water tight. reply Mawr 17 hours agoparentprevA panic means your program has entered an invalid state. Continuing to run an arbitrarily broken program would be reckless, so crashing is the only option.Even if you could somehow prevent your program from crashing internally, it could be killed at any time by the environment it&#x27;s running in, up to the cleaning lady tripping on the power cable.That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t make sense to try to prevent crashes. Instead, programs should be capable of resumption irrespective of when they were killed.

The language design is really good that way, and the compiler helps a lot. What&#x27;s tricky is to understand the underlying concepts like it&#x27;s module structure, ownership, etc.Writing practical code is harder if you&#x27;re not used to it because it enforces discipline that a lot of coders in other languages don&#x27;t care about like the mutability of a variable. For me it just clicked because that&#x27;s something I always struggled with in other languages and it frustrated me that I wouldn&#x27;t know how a variable was supposed to be used. The fact that in rust that concept is built into the language makes me excited. If someone doesn&#x27;t care about that kind of thing then I can see it being very frustrating.With Golang, I would strongly recommend ignoring all advice. People kept saying it&#x27;s easy to understand, that it&#x27;s like python, or that it&#x27;s like a better C. Forget all that, try to approach it from the ground up as it&#x27;s own separate thing, dive into what interfaces, slices, etc. actually are. Then write a bunch of practical go code like a webserver, then a lot of go idioms become a lot more obvious. I really feel like there were some lanuage design decisions made where one thing exists because of another feature, so writing some code makes those links obvious as opposed to learning each feature independently. reply dewey 22 hours agoparentprevFor me Go is one of the easiest languages to learn (even if there are some low level bits like closing bodies etc.) just because you always know what goes in and comes out of a function.When doing Ruby after only using Go for years it was (and still is) very tricky for me to deal with error handling and figuring out what kind of object I&#x27;m dealing with. reply SkiFire13 22 hours agoparentprev> when it comes to syntax for meIf your issue is that the syntax is too complex then you&#x27;ve got a problem since semantics are usually way more complex to grasp than syntax. reply Yoric 22 hours agorootparentMy assumption is that the parent poster uses the word \"syntax\" for \"syntax and semantics\".

They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.\" – Rob Pike 1The problem Go solves is that google has a bunch of people who can hack out code, but don&#x27;t really know the theory of computer science, can&#x27;t understand high level abstractions and complex type systems... So they need a language for \"the average programmer\", or as pg would say, \"the blub programmer\".",

    "originBody": "Horrible edge cases to consider when dealing with music Sat 02 April 2022 — download I'm a huge fan of navidrome, and thus spent some time reading its source code, and discussing with Deluan about its data model, making this list of weird edge-cases as we went. Weird album names: † from Justice ★ from David Bowie ' from Frank Zappa () from Sigur Rós Love Symbol from Prince, of course.from Caravan Palace Both Microsoft's Windows and Linux might dislike the naming scheme of MASTER BOOT RECORD's albums. If you're on Linux, you might appreciate ///////-//-///// from The You Suck Flying Circus. Apparently, the vaporwave movement genre artists like to put spaces between each letter, like on Hallmark '87 A T R I U M. Laughing Mantis released a song called X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*, also known as the EICAR test file Albums without a title, like Rammstein's latest album, Led Zeppelin's fourth album, KoЯn's eighth album, … Some albums have multiple covers: The Police's Synchronicity has 36 cover variations. Art Garfunkel' Fate for breakfast had 6 covers, but since it made a flop in the USA, most people only have seen one. Ian Dury & The BLockheads' Do it yourself had at least 34 sleeves Some albums have confusing or problematic covers: Scorpion's Virgin Killer GGGOLDDD's No Image Amanda Palmer's There Will Be No Intermission features a picture of her fully naked, leading to censored versions. John Lennon & Yoko Ono's Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins Confusing album names: (untitled) from The Byrds untitled from R Kelly untilted from Autechre Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album from +/-. Tintern Abbey's 7\" Vinyl single A-side is named Beeside. Weezer released a couple of albums titled Weezer, sometimes twice a year. Underoath released an album called Ø (Disambiguation), making the wikipedia page for Ø (disambiguation) confusing. Meghan Trainor's Title Some tracks don't have a title or have a confusing name: Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II. Mezbrow's Yantra Material Action Autechre's EP7 has an untitled track in the pregap, and another regular one called \"Left Blank\". Some tracks are long: \"Doom Apocalypse X, The Ultimate Fate Of The Universe (Part IX: The Photon Era)\" from NǽnøĉÿbbŒrğ VbëřřĦōlökäävsŦ, lasting almost 7h, with the full album, \"The Ultimate Fate Of The Universe\" a bit under 23h. The Rise and Fall of Bossanova from Pipe Choir Three, a 13 hours long song split in 5 parts. Some tracks are short: Nine in Nails's Broken has 99 tracks, with tracks 7 to 97 consist of 4 seconds of silence each. Speaking of size, some albums' name are long as well: Prajecyrujučy Sinhuliarnaje Wypramieńwańnie Daktryny Absaliutnaha J Usiopahłynaĺnaha Zła Skroź Šaścihrannuju Pryzmu Sîn-Ahhī-Erība Na Hipierpawierchniu Zadyjakaĺnaha Kaŭčęha Zasnawaĺnikaŭ Kosmatęchničnaha Ordęna Palieakantakta, Najstaražytnyja Ipastasi Dawosiewych Cywilizacyj Prywodziać U Ruch Ręzanansny Transfarmatar Časowapadobnaj Biaskoncaści Budučyni U Ćwiardyniach Absierwatoryi Nwn-Hu-Kek-Amon, Uwasabliajučy Ŭ Ęfirnuju Matęryju Prach Ałulima Na Zachad Ad Ękzapłaniety from Eximperituserqethhzebibšiptugakkathšulweliarzaxułum When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right, from Fiona Apple. Tracks can have multiple artists, like GRAY (그레이) (Feat. Various Artists) - 119 REMIX which has, of course, 119 different ones. Some bands are kinda changing their name: GZR, also known as g//z/r on their first album, geezer on their second, and GZR on their third. Ghost was known as Ghost B.C. for some times, but only in the USA. Suede, known as \"The London Suede\" in the USA. Zoviet France, also known as \":$OVIET:FRANCE:\", \"Soviet France\", \":Zoviet-France:\" and latterly usually written as \":zoviet*france:\". Invent, Animate changed their name to \"Invent, Animate\" to avoid being confused for 2 distinct artists. Their latest EP, The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was, consists of 3 tracks: \"The Sun Sleeps, \",\" and \"As If It Never Was\". Some artists have several names: Aphex Twin, also known as Blue Calx (not to be confused with the other Blue Calx), Caustic Window, Brian Tregaskin, The Dice Man, Soit - P.P, Smojphace, Rutchkfard Games, Phonic Boy On Dope, Polygon Window, Power-Pill, Q-Chastic, Ricardo Jamiro, Richard D. James, Karen Tregaskin, GAK, The Tuss, user48736353001, and Bradley Strider. Filipe Santos Some bands have confusing names: The The, so much for skipping articles like \"A\" or \"The\" I guess. It's not the same The as in Jad and The The Band Artist Unknown Unknown Artist !!! The 8 different bands called Live The dozen bands called LP Some tracks have confusing names, on purpose, like every single one on Drumkoon's They Tried To Ban This album. Some albums are known under several names: Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs from Ministry, whose real name is ΚΕΦΑΛΗΞΘ The Beatles, known as \"The White Album\". Ozzy Osbourne's Speak of the Devil was released as \"Talk of the Devil\" in the UK. Songs Of Inaudible Trucks And Cars from Ozma was released as Songs Of Audible Trucks & Cars, when it was put up for distribution on MP3.com, because the character restriction kept them from having the whole original title. Most albums have several versions/releases: The Eminem Show with its 15 versions All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling by Efrim Menuck, under the name God Speed You Black Emperor! released on cassette in 1994 on cassette with 27 tracks, re-released in 2022 with 4 tracks, and the bootleg version with 31 tracks. Oh, and also the band changed their name from \"Godspeed You Black Emperor!\" to \"Godspeed You! Black Emperor\" in 2002. Sybreed's Japanese edition of Antares has 12 tracks, with the 11th being \"Technocracy\", while the USA version also has 12 tracks, but the 11th is \"Plasmaterial\". The Russian edition only has 11 tracks like the Swiss promo one, but the European promo version only has 8. The Art of Noise released 4 UK versions of their Close-Up single with the same catalogue number and the same sleeve, but with different tracks, including a version that didn't even contain the track \"Close-Up\". Licensing issues are annoying: MF DOOM released MM..FOOD in 2004, and a re-recorded version in 2007 due to an uncleared Sesame Street Sample. Different bands may have the same name. Take \"Emperor\" for example. It could be: The Norwegian black metal band Emperor, The Drum'n'bass producer Emperor, The Trance artist Emperor, The Japanese Metal band Emperor, originally named Rommel, not to be confused with Rommel from Japan. The virtual penguin hip-hop artist in the world of Arknights Emperor, The Emperor, an hip-hop artist, The Emperors, but the 60s rock band, The Emperors, but the 60s blues band, The Emperors, but the 90s rock band, Havamal could refer to the Viking metal band or to, well, the other Viking metal band. Or Bulldog Breed. It could be the one from the UK who released an album called Made in England, or the one from the UK who released an album called Made in England. Avishai Cohen, the Jazz musician from Israel, and Avishai Cohen, the Jazz musician from Israel. Common \"cool\" names like Revolver, Peace, Hybrid, End, … Internationalisation is hard, like for Пётр Ильич Чайковский (Tchaikovsky) and his 31 different names on MusicBrainz.

KEYGEN CHURCH's made two eloquently named albums: \"░█░█░░█░█░█░\" and \"░ ▒ ▓ █\". Magma and their Kobaïan made-up language featuring some custom diacritics that don't exist in utf8. Aphex Twin has a track named ∆Mᵢ⁻¹=−α ∑ Dᵢ[η][ ∑ Fjᵢ[η−1]+Fextᵢ [η⁻¹]]. Qebrus' ᐔ ᐌ ᐂ ᐍ ᐚ and its horrible track list. Heck, his whole discography is horrible in this regard. Mister Softy, better known as ░▒▓, and his █ ▄ █ █ ▄ ██ ▄ ██ ▄█ album. Coldplay' Music of the Spheres album uses emoji as titles for most of its tracks. Flume's Hi This is Flume's fifth track. My favourite: a band named brouillard, with a single member called brouillard, whose every single album is named brouillard, and of course, so is every single track. Take a look at MusicBrainz' database schema to have a glimpse on how to tame this madness.",

This kind of makes sense as when we use that we do so to actually keep the supposedly-deleted word for subtext effects brought up by making explicit we redacted one word for another, but it feels like a category error to me, as if it did the right thing but at the wrong level (even the one with \"scratch that\", although it gets closer)The last one is (one of a few, elided for terseness) prompts that I tried to cross check whether it was a coincidence: doesn&#x27;t seem so as they all produced non-transitional results.Can&#x27;t test 4.0, wondering how it tackles that. reply jjulius 8 hours agoparentprevHonorable mention goes to Marco V&#x27;s \"C:\\del*.mp3\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discogs.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;133498-MarcoV-Cdelmp3-Solari... reply bitwize 7 hours agoparentAlmost the Bobby Tables of music. reply timrobinson333 1 hour agorootparentYes I&#x27;m surprised the author didn&#x27;t manage to find an artist or track with an SQL injection - surely someone must have tried reply jezzamon 1 hour agoparentprevAnother fairly high profile one is Taylor Swift re-recording all her old songs and re-releasing them.

I am surprised there are no songs that use characters only available in two different character sets, or are the same Chinese character repeated with multiple different writings (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Japanese).I suppose that some people are running into trouble by using CHARACTER VARYING(n) instead of TEXT in their database, but if you pick the most likely database for your local music player, then it doesn&#x27;t matter. (sqlite doesn&#x27;t care, basically.)The song that&#x27;s named after a virus test signature is amusing. I guess encrypt your filenames and database so that the OS can&#x27;t pry into the details. Since you hopefully didn&#x27;t write your music player in C, there should be no way that a virus can affect your music player.(While I was researching this post, I found an interesting Defcon talk about what happens when you turn the EICAR virus signature into a QR code and scan it. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cIcbAMO6sxo A lot of stuff breaks!

One of the \"security vulnerabilities\" in our product was that we don&#x27;t scan the data in the database for viruses. We pushed back to not do this, because one of our customers literally uses our system to store viruses they analyze.

Wed Nov 8, 2023 by Alexandre Prokoudine Glimpse NX didn't have a great solution for missing menu, but this new 3D CAD application has On This Page GIMP’s complexity Enter Dune 3D Interaction hints Thoughts? Disclaimer: this post is an extended transcript of the video below. If you’ve been around long enough, you probably remember a project called Glimpse. Originally it was an attempt to create a fork of GIMP for the name change. Then that project got an offspring, Glimpse NX, where a new image editor with a cleaner, more approachable user interface was supposed to be developed. Neither project was successful, but this is one of the mockups they came up with: I vividly remember that when I first saw this, I thought: “Looks interesting, but there is just no way this is going to work!”. And the main reason for that is… GIMP’s complexity There is a huge amount of commands and options built into GIMP’s menus and nested menus. The program amassed all that over the years, and then the team tried to solve that with a search dialog: Which kinda works when you generally know what you need or how a feature you want could be called. But really not when this is your first rodeo. Anyway, it is very difficult to represent all this complexity in an application that looks like the thing on the mockup above. With GTK3 tech, one possible solution to do that is a dropdown menu in the headerbar, like in Siril: But this is not very convenient because when you go to a nested menu in one part of the screen, it opens in an entirely different part of the screen, and it’s very annoying. And then again, how many menus like that can you fit into one headerbar before users run for pitchforks with a determined look on their faces? So it’s not really great, I think we could do better. Enter Dune 3D One possible solution is coming from a new application called Dune 3D. It’s a 3D CAD program built on top of Open CASCADE kernel and SolveSpace constraint solver — all the usual suspects. The developer is the same guy who came up with Horizon EDA, a GTK3-based electronic design automation package. Dune 3D is very, very new. The initial code import to GitHub was made just two weeks ago, so not a lot of people even know about this project yet, but that is beside the point. The interesting part here is when you first look at this, you can’t help yourself wondering: “Okay, I get it, he barely started coding. Still, where is all the functionality?”. Well, since the status bar says “Press Space”, let’s do just that: And that gets me really excited. Because you get the search bar for when you know what you’re looking for, when you know the terminology, when you understand what you need. And you also get a kind of menu that is helpful for when you need to navigate into the unknown and see all your options. So this is a very interesting solution that, while not perfect for a lot of complexity, could still be iterated upon, in my opinion. Update: as the developer pointed out, this search/menu dialog has been available in Horizon EDA for the past 7 years, he simply reused his own code in the new program. Interaction hints Another interesting thing here is that when you do something like drawing a line, for example, you get these nice visual hints here, just above the status bar: The idea is coming from Blender obviously, and it would make a lot of sense to use this in applications like GIMP and Inkscape. Here is a good reason why. When you are coming from an application like Photoshop, you are used to do set of modifiers for working with selections. So when you create the selection and you need to add to it, what you do is press Shift in GIMP. But it’s Ctrl in Photoshop. A lot of people that I’ve met who come from Photoshop don’t really know that. And the only way they can find that out is by reading a tutorial or a user manual or maybe watching a YouTube video — the status bar hint isn’t specific enough, and not everyone finds the toggles in tool settings. And the same applies, for example, to moving selections, because in GIMP, you need to press Ctrl+Alt and then drag to move the contents of the selection, which is not how people expect this to work coming from many other applications. Again, the only way they can find this out is by watching a tutorial or reading the user manual. So that’s another thing that I think would make sense to sort of backport from Dune 3D to GIMP in the GTK3-based based version (or GTK4, since Dune 3D is GTK4-based). So I’m really hoping that at least this will be considered by the developers. Thoughts? I don’t think that the redesign that the Glimpse NX team came up with should be implemented as is. There are so many more aspects to discuss apart from access to functionality in menus, and the team explored some of those aspects too: how the headerbar should work, how exporting would be implemented, what tool settings would look like etc. (they removed the git repository with mockups and studies, but I have a local copy). Their redesign definitely makes the program more approachable. And now this solution in Dune 3D probably makes a major deficiency of that design go away. Even more, the interaction hints seem like a great if overlooked idea that could also be a relatively low-effort job. Trying to revamp GIMP’s UX/UI at any level, especially this much, is obviously a huge effort — or would be a huge effort if the developers would ever decide to do that. But I’m really interested in your opinion. Do you think this old redesign of the program could be revived thanks to Dune 3D? Libre Arts is a reader-supported publication.

The author tries to deal with this by putting the a menu next to a search bar and putting hints in the bottom menu (which I don’t think would really work here, as raster tools are less selection-specific than 3D tools). Search fixes the speed-of-access issue, but doesn’t help discoverability very much, as users still have to hunt through highly nested menus.Looking at the screenshots here, I don’t think you actually need search to make those menus more manageable. One screenshot of current GIMP shows a menu tree that looks like “filter->render->noise->solid noise…”. I think you could probably combine the entire noise submenu from that tree, and make it instead a segmented control on the actual “noise” dialog that chooses your type of noise. I suspect dropping the “render” level as well would also be good. “Render” is a bit of a jargon-y term in the context of graphics editing, and I don’t think it means much to most people using it. Furthermore, the top “filter” menu isn’t actually all that long, and people generally prefer wide flatter trees to narrower deeper trees. So, I’d pitch for a simpler menu that would just be “filter->noise…”. By flattening and combining, I think that menu could be made much more usable and discoverable. reply crazygringo 15 hours agoparentUniversal UI search is great, and at this point it should be present in all but the simplest applications. I first saw it introduced in Google Docs, and it&#x27;s precisely for things you suspect exist, but it&#x27;s not even remotely clear which menu, submenu, or dialog it&#x27;s in. (Apple OS Settings is another great example of it.)E.g., you want to apply a hanging indent in Docs? Just type \"hanging\" into the menu search, and it shows \"Indentation options\". It&#x27;s smart enough to know that hanging indentation is an option within the dialog that shows up there. And the menu search seems to have a large range of synonyms, so typing \"picture\" brings up lots of \"insert image\" choices.But it bothers me that even in Docs, almost nobody knows about menu search because it&#x27;s hidden under the \"Help\" menu, rather than being a nice prominent rounded search box in the upper-right corner like you&#x27;d expect.Menus are great for discoverability (so do not get rid of them), but frequently you know what an application can or cannot do (e.g. you assume a word processor can do hanging indents or watermarks), but you don&#x27;t know where exactly it lurks in the menus or which tab of the settings dialog, and don&#x27;t want to waste two minutes hunting for it.It&#x27;s time for a universal search box to exist in every major desktop application. Apple and Microsoft really need to take the lead here to provide standard API&#x27;s and UX components for this, and it saddens me that they haven&#x27;t, and continue to show no signs of interest. reply jonhohle 14 hours agorootparentmacOS has had the ability to search menus for what seems like a decade.

Talk about a hidden feature.So it turns out it&#x27;s under the \"Help\" menu, and it just says \"Search\". I had always assumed that this searched help topics, not menus.But it&#x27;s also pretty miminal, seemingly without support for synonyms or features inside of dialog boxes -- e.g. if you type \"pref\" it won&#x27;t find \"Settings\". It also doesn&#x27;t have a keyboard shortcut to trigger it (like Docs).So I think there&#x27;s still a long way to go to make it a central UX feature. reply jrumbut 12 hours agorootparent> e.g. if you type \"pref\" it won&#x27;t find \"Settings\".I find the OSX search feature close to useless as a \"help\" feature because of this.I came to the realization that it&#x27;s more like a power user shortcut tool than something to help new users. If you know exactly what you&#x27;re looking for and exactly what the application calls it then you can skip navigating through nested menus. reply spookthesunset 9 hours agorootparentExactly.

What the hell, Apple.First Apple hides the feature behind a search box that you don&#x27;t usually ever see and then wouldn&#x27;t ever guess that it searches the menus, then it goes even further to suggest there&#x27;s no keyboard shortcut for it, when there is one. What a complete and utter UX fail. reply chipotle_coyote 10 hours agorootparentIn their partial defense, I don&#x27;t think putting the search bar in the Help menu is either particularly crazy or particularly hidden. Putting it in some dropdown menu is probably the correct UI option, and out of the menus that (nearly) all applications have, \"Help\" is a pretty reasonable choice. Is it super obvious? No, but I mean, \"File\", \"Edit,\" and \"View\" are objectively worse, so that only really leaves the \"[Name of Application]\" as a possibility. Which would also be defensible, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be better.(Now, the complaint that I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere -- that using that same search field to search actual documentation is basically useless -- is an entirely different kettle of fish...) reply Hammershaft 10 hours agorootparentprevMac OS is chock full of undiscoverable keybinds that perform functionality that would be useful for people of all skill levels.

You&#x27;ve got the iconographic tool picker which has submenus on right-click for some tools. Then there&#x27;s the classic menu ribbon at the top which has most things you expect. Then there&#x27;s the right-click context menu inside the canvas that has a subset of all other menu items. And then you have inscrutable hotkeys. Some actions are reasonable, others are not.

They make things more difficult for power users by hiding useful options in some tab in a modal settings dialog, which is a PITA to find and click if you need to change it often. Often they remove something completely from the UI and you need to go find the config file and manually edit some text and restart the program to get functionality back.They&#x27;re trying to cater for novices - they think too many controls on display is going to confuse or overwhelm them.

For each of the items we can add all sorts of synonyms and descriptions so that users at any level can find the tool they’re looking for.And we can even add crude customization to the search.

It won by having an interface that&#x27;s analogous to physical photo editing and by having a bunch of the weird&#x2F;fiddly things that professional need.The best from-the-ground-up interface for a graphics program imo is that of CorelDraw, which survives as the interface to Inkscape. Rather than a craptasm of random, physical-analogue tools, you have a small number of highly functional tools giving you a wide range of options at any one point.And yes, I&#x27;m \"confusing\" vector-graphics editors and bit-map editors.

I can verbosely explain what I am trying to accomplish, and it tells me \"that is called X in GIMP, and here is how to use it: ...\".A recent example is that the Bucket Fill tool was filling in adjacent pixels that were a slightly different color than the one I clicked on. ChatGPT told me this is called the \"threshold\" and how to change it to 0 so it only filled exact matches.

I used to be convinced that the reason people think it&#x27;s reasonable is Stockholm Syndrome. Now I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because most Photoshop users only ever use Photoshop&#x2F;Illustrator&#x2F;InDesign, and simply aren&#x27;t familiar with other software.It&#x27;s bizarre that a search bar that unfolds a vertical menubar when highlighted but unfilled is supposed to be a great advance. It&#x27;s so unimpressive that I 1) don&#x27;t mind it at all, and 2) think the menu aspect is useless. It&#x27;s just a menu command search bar; a good UI library could construct one automatically. Stick it in a corner, or automatically open it when people start typing with no obvious object. It&#x27;s a triviality.What bugs people about the GIMP is that it&#x27;s not Photoshop. All of the GIMPs menu options are placed in eminently logical places. although it&#x27;s a grammar that probably makes sense over time. Photoshop options are mostly placed randomly, and some of them turn out to be ads. That&#x27;s not a huge dig at Photoshop, because it&#x27;s pretty amazing that they ever fix or move anything with so much industry adoption, and adding things has to be a nightmare.But the GIMP puts things in places because they make sense there. They don&#x27;t have the base that would get enraged if they moved things. It&#x27;s extremely telling that when put to specify improvements that could be made, the suggestions are either trivial, like1) a search bar, or2) an extra statusbar above the statusbar (in case they want instructions over their instructions), or3) to make it single-window (because just not moving things is not enough, they have to be prevented from moving things),or they&#x27;re just:4) \"Make it more like Photoshop!

His reaction was to jump up and down, point at the screen, and yell “That sucks! That sucks! Wow, that’s neat! That sucks!”>I tried explaining how we’d performed an experiment proving pie menus were faster than linear menus, but he insisted the liner menus in NeXT Step were the best possible menus ever.>But who was I to rain on his parade, two weeks after the first release of NeXT Step 0.8?

(could be useful for setting the volume&#x2F;brightness, for example) reply DonHopkins 8 hours agorootparentAwesome! I&#x27;m really looking forward to Simon implementing all the features of Fly-Pie across different platforms including Window, Linux and Mac desktops. Please support his great work on Ko-Fi if you can!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko-fi.com&#x2F;schneegansBut until such a day as Fly-Pie-like features and editors are built into every desktop and application and browser user interface toolkit, I do think Blender also requires its own specialized WYSIWYG pie menu editor that knows about Blender&#x27;s command and input systems and user interface capabilities. But it should be inspired by Simon&#x27;s work on Gnome-Pie, Fly-Pie, and Kando. Also drawing 3D pie menu items and animated feedback would be really cool and useful, so you can easily make pie menus of 3D Blender content, like a tree-structured clipboards or asset libraries, or live iconic previews of the effects of editing commands!All of these ideas could be applied to Gimp too, of course, but I&#x27;ve found the Blender developers to be much more open to entertaining other people&#x27;s ideas and contributions about user interface design than the Gimp developers, who have been historically NIH-limited and stubborn (especially about changing the name to something less offensive to the general public). At least Blender already supports pie menus well, and changed the default mouse bindings in response to user demand, and has made huge strides in usability lately. At this point I think it would be much easier to just add a great image editor to Blender, integrated with its video editor, than try to change the minds of the Gimp developers.I love the capabilities of the current Blender pie menu editor add-on, since it supports linear menus and user interface dialogs as well (even embedding them in pie menus, to make hybrid layouts). But it doesn&#x27;t support WYSIWYG editing, or on-the-fly editing of menus in place (like HyperCard) without using a dialog in another window and using a linear list or outline to represent radial layout, which is very confusing and hard to use.The first approach I took to pie menus was to represent pie menus as containing items, and then lay the items out in a circle, starting at an initial angle (typically up), and in a particular direction (either clockwise or counter clockwise). But that has its problems, when it comes to editing, and supporting other than one item per direction.So I&#x27;ve taken a different approach of pie menus containing slices, and slices containing items. So to create a pie menu, first you define how many slices you want, then you add zero or more items to each slice, by dragging and dropping them in. So the directions do not all change around when you add or remove an item, and you can leave empty slices, and you can also put multiple items in any slice.Each slice can be configured with various layout and tracking and drawing policies.One useful policy is a \"pull-out\" slice that dislays one item at once (like a font size), which changes as you pull out, switching between items by the distance. And the items can be discrete (like a linear menu of font faces) or continuous (like an exact floating point font size).Another policy is show all the items in the slice layed out in the slice direction, like a linear menu. That lets you make a linear menu by simply using one slice that points down, and putting multiple items in it. Of course long text labels only work well in the up and down directions, but icons work nicely along the horizontal and diagonal directions, and you can display the selected text label in the menu center when its icon is selected, as feedback.This shows several kinds of pull out pie menus, for selecting fonts and colors:Just the Pie Menus from All the Widgets:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mOLS9I_tdKEThis shows an experiment in exaggerating the increased precision of direction that you get by moving the cursor away from the menu center:Precision Pie Demo:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c0scs59va4c>This is a demonstration of the precision pie menu under the NeWS window system. It&#x27;s an experiment in exaggerating the extra precision that you get with distance as you move out further from the menu center of a pie menu. Normally the further you go from the center the more control you have over the angle, but if you want to input an exact number like an angle you might want to get it down to the a certain number. But you run out of screen space before you get enough leverage to change the number to what you want. Now what happens here is that when you poke out, it makes a flexible lever that the further out you go the more flexible it becomes, and you have much finer control over the number. So as I move around back in and out I&#x27;ll poke it into a different place and just come out further to get a lot of leverage and dial exactly the number I want. So here&#x27;s what happens when you go around to the other side. *POP* And as you get nearer it gets less and less flexible. Generally you kind of eyeball it and then get it exact like 93: well there&#x27;s 93, or 273: there&#x27;s 273. reply luqtas 7 hours agorootparent> Gimp developers, who have been historically NIH-limited and stubborn (especially about changing the name to something less offensive to the general public)first thing that pops is a phrase of some biologist regards why evolution made plants green and not blue (physically, blue can absorb way more energy from the sun)...

Also the loud shouting around blenders UI have died down a lot in recent years, which I attribute to 2 things:1. the great work done to make the UI more discoverable. 2.

It sets expectations, and when they are not met, frustration ensues. But the photoshop UI is not the most intuitive one, just most familiar to this kind of person. Those are two very different things.I understand the frustration, for the same reason I cannot work with Darktable. In some aspects and basic organization it is similar to Lightroom, and when I start using it as Lightroom, it leads to the same frustration. But that&#x27;s not because the Darktable folks did something wrong, but because I cannot act on my habits from different software package and my expectations are not met. Someone, who doesn&#x27;t have the same habits and doesn&#x27;t have to unlearn won&#x27;t have the same issues. reply zelphirkalt 14 hours agorootparentprevNot saying you are necessarily wrong about Gimp possibly being able to copy some of the good ideas from Photoshop. However, you basically confirmed what the GP said.

Just like a Gimp user would, trying to find things in Photoshop. reply epcoa 14 hours agorootparentConfirming what the GP said? This is all misdirection. Bottom line the GIMP UI&#x2F;UX is garbage. There are extremely few people that have used a variety of image editing tools and claim GIMP is actually better. That’s all that matters really. This isn’t some rhetorical exercise. reply pbhjpbhj 56 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t do graphic design any more, but I started with GIMP - when I was first able to try Photoshop (pre GIMP redesign) it was awful, nothing made sense, nothing was where it should be. In contrast, when I first used Corel Draw it seemed intuitive.Just like using a Mac after having been a PC user; or being forced back to MS Windows after using Linux&#x2F;KDE for a couple of decades.I used to use Inkscape heavily, but having not used it for a few years, I go back and the UI has changed, similar experience; I feel lost when I should feel capable.Photoshop was one of the first applications that I noticed using the &#x27;give it free to college students to capture the market&#x27; technique. That works so well because it takes a couple of years for for you to adopt the software as an extension of your way of thinking - changing application means a productivity loss, and a feeling of incompetence, and no professional wants that unless they can clearly see an ultimate gain. reply cycomanic 14 hours agorootparentprevThe previous poster was talking about Krita (and the one before that Krita and Gimp) and while I agree with some of the criticism of gimps UI, I stand by my comment a lot of that criticism is based around \"it is not like program X, that I&#x27;m used to\".I mentioned it in a different post, blender is the prime exhibit for this, its UI received even more criticism than gimps. Now that it has become the (or one of the) most popular 3d modelling tool, most of these voices disappeared, because it has become the first entry point and people are not used to some other way of working anymore. reply Miraste 13 hours agorootparentBlender and Krita fit the different-but-not-bad workflow defense, but GIMP&#x27;s is outright terrible.

Even so, prior to the rewrite it wasn’t such a sorry mess as Gimp, it already had some professional adoption.And my point is, regardless of those claiming gimp sucks because it’s not what they’re used to: it absolutely does not matter an iota because there is near universal acceptance that it’s terrible for anything but toy work.

It does have this feature! I made a crop rectangle, then right-clicked on it. A little menu popped up, titled \"Crop Tool Actions\". One of the things in the menu is a checkbox labeled \"Lock Ratio\", which was unchecked by default. I clicked the checkbox, and then I could resize the crop rectangle with the mouse without changing its aspect ratio.Took me under a minute to figure out, having never used the software before or read any documentation. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s one sign of a decent UI. reply lofaszvanitt 15 hours agorootparentNO RIGHT CLICKING! Nobody does a right click on a crop rectangle. Modifier key.

If you have to edit 100s of images these extra you go the menu, then the submenu, then click, then blablabla, then powpowpow, takes a lot of time. Streamline the user experience. You can only make it better if you use it daily and change the things that frustrate you.

It&#x27;s a total of 2 clicks: right click to open the menu, then move the mouse down 6 entries, then left-click on the checkbox.But also, it&#x27;s my understanding that Krita is not a photo editor, but rather a digital painting program; that any ability it has to edit photos is just because digital paintings are stored in the same file formats as digital photographs.

Oz actions called SgCmds, but never saw or touched the Sg layer.In theory, Oz was UI toolkit agnostic but, as anyone who&#x27;s ever done UI work will understand, it rapidly became wedded to the toolkit we used (a heavily customized version of Tk). This made the eventual switching to Qt very, very difficult. So difficult it nearly destroyed the artists&#x27; faith in the R&D group.

Here is a good reason why.The first place I ever saw this feature was on the Lisp Machine. It was called the \"mouse-documentation\" line.Operating the Lisp Machine:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;symbolics&#x2F;L...>1.3 The Mouse (pp. 3)>The mouse is a pointing device that can be moved around on a flat surface. These motions are sensed by the Lisp Machine, which usually responds by moving the cursor around on the screen in a corresponding manner. The shape of the cursor varies, depending on context. See chapter 10, page 40.>There are three buttons on the mouse, called Left, Middle and Right. They are used to specify operations to be performed. Typically the user points at something with the mouse and specifies an operatin by clicking the mouse buttons. Rapid double clicks are conventionally distinguished from single clicks. Thus, in any specific context, there are up to sex operations that can be performed with the mouse, invoked by Left, Left Double, Middle, Middle Double, Right, and Right Double. Some of these operations are local to particular programs such as the editor, and some are defined more widely across the system.>Typically operations available by clicking the mouse button are listed at the bottom of the screen. This display changes as you move the mouse around or run different programs.>Sometimes holding a mouse button down continuously for a period of time may also be defined to perform some operation, for example drawing a curve on the screen. This will be indicated by the word \"Hold\". For example, \"Middle Hold\" means to click the middle mouse button down and hold it down, releasing it only when the operation is complete. \"Left Double Hold\"means to click the left mouse button twice, holding it down the second time until the operation is complete.>Occasionally a long click is distinguished from a short one, as a Morse Code dash is distinguished from a dot. In cases it doesn&#x27;t matter exactly how long the button is held down, as long as it is perceptibly longer than the usual rapid sgtrike. Such a click will be described by the word \"Long\" as in \"Right Long\".>The mouse is completely \"soft\", like the keyboard: The Lisp Machine can be programmed to interpret the mouse in any desired fashion. The protocol that has been chosen, however, is extremely general and should suffice for almost all needs.[...]>2.1 The Geography of the Display [...]>2.1.2 The Who-Line and Run-Lights (pp. 5) [...]>Above the who-line there is a line of mouse-documentation, which is displayed in inverse video to make it easy to move your eyes to it from someplace else on the screen. This line tells you what the buttons on the mouse would do if you clicked them with the mouse where it currently is. If the line is blank, it means the default mouse buttons are in effect; clicking Left will select the window pointed-to, and clicking Right will get you the system menu (these are explained later). reply IshKebab 15 hours agoparentprevHorizon EDA is really fantastic and the first usable open source EDA tool I&#x27;ve used.

Now that they know it&#x27;s in Gtk4 too they might do something.To understand how it&#x27;s keyboard specific you have to know about what features were removed. In the past you could set the file chooser dialog to have either a text entry field or the path-bar mouse buttons as the default. This was through org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser location-mode. While this gsetting still remains gtkfilechooserwidget.c was changed so it no longer respects those settings and always forces only the mouse based path-bar input mode. This means now when a file path is pasted with ctrl-v (or middle mouse click paste?) the entirely wrong function tries to handle it and this function errors out because it&#x27;s not expecting file path input. replybitwize 15 hours agorootparentprevWhile GTK started off as the GIMP Toolkit, it has since become the GNOME Toolkit, so it doesn&#x27;t really track GIMP&#x27;s needs anymore. reply formerly_proven 10 hours agorootparentprevThey can port GIMP to the QML-based UI framework used by Muse 4. reply PaulDavisThe1st 9 hours agorootparentI would estimate that would be a 3 person-year project, and the result will contain precisely zero improvements for any user (even if theoretically it might be easier to bring various improvements after that is done).That is a hell of an ask. reply radium3d 16 hours agoparentprevBut, haven&#x27;t the gimp team been working on refactoring&#x2F;modularization of all of the tools?

It’s just using the builtin HTTP client to fire off requests, with an identifying user agent. Which means it’s useless for scraping most real world sites you may want to scrape, unfortunately. You’ll get served a JavaScrpt challenge, or not even that (many sites will refuse to serve anything if they see a random user agent like flyscrape&#x2F;1.0). reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 5 hours agoparentWhat are some examples of \"most real world sites\".What are some examples of sites that are not \"most real world sites\".Is HN a \"real world site\".What percentage of sites submitted to HN are \"most real world sites\". (IME, it&#x27;s a minority fraction.)Why not just delete or change the user-agent line in scrape.go before compiling.(Personal experience: I have been successfully retrieving information from the www for decades without including a user-agent header. The number of sites I have found that require this header is relatively small. It does not rise to the level of \"most\".)HN replies usually fail to include even a single example.Similarly, do examples provided for scraper programs and libraries ever include \"most real world sites\". reply oefrha 4 hours agorootparent“Most real world sites” and “most real world sites you may want to scrape” are different, especially when weighted by information volume, so your selective quoting doesn’t help. Alexa top 100 probably contain more information, especially new information, than the rest of Alexa top 10000 combined (random guess I pulled out of my ass, don’t quote me on that), so the overwhelmingly scraping-resistant Alexa top 100 is what most scraping effort is directed against.Anyway, I’m not interested in a pedantic debate. Most (but not all) people who have attempted to scrape any popular site, or unpopular site behind Cloudflare at above-minimum protection level, in recent years should know exactly what I’m taking about.Edit: In case you’re not aware, many of the sites I have in mind are&#x2F;were capable of defeating puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth. User agent is only the most basic thing, like level 1 in a hundred-level dungeon. reply Klonoar 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, nobody cares that most sites will work with it. The number of sites that require it might be small, but that number tends to include significant and notable ones - the ones that most people actually wind up wanting to crawl. Cloudflare & co make this more difficult with each passing year.OP is making a very well known day-one point about this topic. It is somewhat surprising that the library doesn&#x27;t offer a way to dynamically set it.Edit: and this isn&#x27;t even getting into stuff like Tls fingerprinting, header order, etc reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 6 hours agoparentprev\"default = 100 [requests per second]\"How many new TCP connections per second.Is this a \"scraper\" or a \"crawler\".It appears to accept a \"starting URL\" and to follow links.Opening many TCP connections is arguably still a reason why website operators try to prevent crawling (except from Googlebot IPs). As for scraping, it can be done with a single TCP connection. Perhaps \"developers\" instead opt to use many TCP connections and then complain when they get blocked. reply moehm 8 hours agoparentprevInteresting. Can you compare it to colly?

As of right now there is no built-in support for running as a browser.What is possible though, is to use a service like ScrapingBee (not affiliated) and set it as the proxy. This would render the page on their end, in a browser. reply acheong08 14 hours agorootparentTry tls-client. It gets around TLS fingerprinting by Cloudflare reply krick 5 hours agoparentprevThis looks like something I could use. Maybe not revolutional, but I do that from time to time, and even if only for organizational purposes it seems to make sense to store that stuff as a bucnh of configuration files for some external tool, rather than a bunch of python-scripts that I implement somewhat differently every time.Right now I&#x27;m just wrapping my head around how this works, and didn&#x27;t try it hands-on yet, but I struggle to evaluate from the existing documentation, how useful this actually is. All examples in the repository right now are ultimately one-page scrappers, which, honestly, would be quite useless to me. Pretty much every scraper I write has at least 2-3 logical layers. Like, consider your HN-example, but you want to include top-10 comments for each post. Is it even possible? Well, I guess for HN you could just get by using allowedURLs and treating default function as a parser for the comment-page, but this isn&#x27;t generic enough. Consider some internet shop. That would be (1) product category tree, sometimes much easier to hard-code, rather than scrape it every time; hard-coding often is generative (e.g. example.com&#x2F;X&#x2F;A-B-C, where X is a string from the list, A, B and C are padded numbers, each with a different range) (2) you go into each category, retrieve either a sub-category list (possibly, js-rendered, multiple pages) or product list (same applies) (3) open each product url, do the actual parsing (name, price, specification, etc). Each of json-object from (3) often has to include some minimal parsed data from level (2) (like category name)More advanced, but also way to popular to imagine a generic web-scraper without it: in addition to some json-metadata you download pictures, or pdf-files, etc. (Sometimes you don&#x27;t even need metadata.) Maybe just text files, but the result is several GBs, and isn&#x27;t suitable to be handled as a single json-object, but rather a file&#x2F;directory tree.Is any of this possible with this tool?Also, regardless of being it useful for my cases, some minor comments:1. Links in docs&#x2F;readme.md#configuration don&#x27;t work (but the .md files for them actually exist).2. I would suggest making \"url\" in the configuration either a list, or string|list. I suppose, that pretty much doesn&#x27;t change the logic, but would make a lot of basic use-cases much easier to implement. reply fyzix 12 hours agoparentprevWhat happens if &#x27;find()&#x27; returns a list and you call &#x27;.text()&#x27;. Intuition tells me it should fail but maybe it implicitly gets the text from the first item if it exists.Either way, I think you create a separate method &#x27;find_all()&#x27; that returns a list to make the API easier to reason about. reply slig 12 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing!

(Crawlee framework is cool, while not strictly necessary).Its been 8+ years since i started scraping. I even wrote a popular Go web scraping framework previously: (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geziyor&#x2F;geziyor).My favorite stack as of 2023: TypeScript+Playwright+Crawlee(Optional) If you&#x27;re serious in scraping, you should learn javascript, thus, playwright should be good.Note: There are niche cases where lower-level language would be required (C++, Go etc), but probably onlyunder a long XPATH and they decide to change that path? reply sunshadow 16 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t use XPath&CSS selectors at all (Except if you dont have choice). You rely on more generic stuff, e.g, \"the button that has &#x27;Sign in&#x27; on it\": await page.getByRole(&#x27;button&#x27;, { name: &#x27;Sign in&#x27; }).click();See playwright locators: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playwright.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;locators reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 16 hours agorootparentI started putting data-testid attributes in my web app for automated testing using playwright. Prevents me from breaking my own script but it sure would make me more scrapable if anyone cared. Well..

If I&#x27;m looking for something specific like a price or dimensions, I can sometimes get away with it by collecting dollar amounts or X x Y x Z from the raw text. reply aynyc 9 hours agorootparentiframes have been a pain the butt to scrape against.

The support for parsing HTML in x&#x2F;text&#x2F;html is pretty good, and libraries like github.com&#x2F;PuerkitoBio&#x2F;goquery go a long way to matching ergonomics in other tools. This project uses both, but then also goes on to use github.com&#x2F;dop251&#x2F;goja, which is a JavaScript VM and it&#x27;s accompanying nodejs compatability layer and even esbuild, in order to interpret scraping instruction scripts.I mean, at this point I am not sure Go is the right tool for the job (I am actually pretty confident that it is not).A pretty neat stack of engineering, sure!

One common issue with scraping web pages is dealing with data that is dynamically loaded. Is there a solution for this? For example, when using Scrapy, you can have Splash running in Docker via scrapy-splash (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scrapy-plugins&#x2F;scrapy-splash). reply philippta 17 hours agoparentThanks! As mentioned in another comment, currently there is no build in support for this yet.As a workaround one could use a service like ScrapingBee (not affiliated) as a proxy, that renders the page in a browser for you.Surely, relying on a service for this is not always ideal. I am also working on a small wrapper that turns Chrome into an HTTPS proxy, which you could plug right into flyscrape. Unfortunately it is very experimental still and not public yet. I have not yet decided if I release it as part of flyscrape or as a separate project. reply figmert 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Can&#x27;t you load the URL that is being dynamically loaded directly within your scraper? reply mdaniel 17 hours agorootparent [–] Not only can you, in my experience it is substantially less drama and arguably less load on the target system since the full page may make many many other requests that a presentation layer would care about that I don&#x27;tThe trade-offs usually fall into:- authing to the endpoint can sometimes be weird- it for sure makes the traffic stand out since it isn&#x27;t otherwise surrounded by those extraneous requests- it, as with all good things scraping, carries its own maintenance and monitoring burdenHowever, similar to those tradeoffs, it&#x27;s also been my experience that a full page load offers a ton more tracking opportunities that are not present in a direct endpoint fetch. I mean, look how many \"stealth\" plugins out there designed to mask the fact that a headless browser is headlessBut, having said all of that: without question the biggest risk to modern day scraping is Cloudflare and Akamai gatekeeping. I do appreciate the arguments of \"but ddos!11\" and yet I would rather only actors that are actually exhibiting bad behavior[1] be blocked instead of everyone trying with a copy of python who have set reasonable rate limits1 = this setting aside that \"bad behavior\" can be defined as \"downloading data that the site makes freely available to Chrome but not freely available to python\" replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Unmasking the Illusion of \"Anonymous\" Data: Why Our Privacy is at Risk",
    "originLink": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/debunking-myth-anonymous-data",
    "originBody": "Today, almost everything about our lives is digitally recorded and stored somewhere. Each credit card purchase, personal medical diagnosis, and preference about music and books is recorded and then used to predict what we like and dislike, and—ultimately—who we are. This often happens without our knowledge or consent. Personal information that corporations collect from our online behaviors sells for astonishing profits and incentivizes online actors to collect as much as possible. Every mouse click and screen swipe can be tracked and then sold to ad-tech companies and the data brokers that service them. In an attempt to justify this pervasive surveillance ecosystem, corporations often claim to de-identify our data. This supposedly removes all personal information (such as a person’s name) from the data point (such as the fact that an unnamed person bought a particular medicine at a particular time and place). Personal data can also be aggregated, whereby data about multiple people is combined with the intention of removing personal identifying information and thereby protecting user privacy. Sometimes companies say our personal data is “anonymized,” implying a one-way ratched where it can never be dis-aggregated and re-identified. But this is not possible—anonymous data rarely stays this way. As Professor Matt Blaze, an expert in the field of cryptography and data privacy, succinctly summarized: “something that seems anonymous, more often than not, is not anonymous, even if it’s designed with the best intentions.” Anonymization…and Re-Identification? Personal data can be considered on a spectrum of identifiability. At the top is data that can directly identify people, such as a name or state identity number, which can be referred to as “direct identifiers.” Next is information indirectly linked to individuals, like personal phone numbers and email addresses, which some call “indirect identifiers.” After this comes data connected to multiple people, such as a favorite restaurant or movie. The other end of this spectrum is information that cannot be linked to any specific person—such as aggregated census data, and data that is not directly related to individuals at all like weather reports. Data anonymization is often undertaken in two ways. First, some personal identifiers like our names and social security numbers might be deleted. Second, other categories of personal information might be modified—such as obscuring our bank account numbers. For example, the Safe Harbor provision contained with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that only the first three digits of a zip code can be reported in scrubbed data. However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification requires removal not only of your identifiable information, but also of information that can identify you when considered in combination with other information known about you. Here's an example: First, think about the number of people that share your specific ZIP or postal code. Next, think about how many of those people also share your birthday. Now, think about how many people share your exact birthday, ZIP code, and gender. According to one landmark study, these three characteristics are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population. A different study showed that 63% of the U.S. population can be uniquely identified from these three facts. We cannot trust corporations to self-regulate. The financial benefit and business usefulness of our personal data often outweighs our privacy and anonymity. In re-obtaining the real identity of the person involved (direct identifier) alongside a person’s preferences (indirect identifier), corporations are able to continue profiting from our most sensitive information. For instance, a website that asks supposedly “anonymous” users for seemingly trivial information about themselves may be able to use that information to make a unique profile for an individual. Location Surveillance To understand this system in practice, we can look at location data. This includes the data collected by apps on your mobile device about your whereabouts: from the weekly trips to your local supermarket to your last appointment at a health center, an immigration clinic, or a protest planning meeting. The collection of this location data on our devices is sufficiently precise for law enforcement to place suspects at the scene of a crime, and for juries to convict people on the basis of that evidence. What’s more, whatever personal data is collected by the government can be misused by its employees, stolen by criminals or foreign governments, and used in unpredictable ways by agency leaders for nefarious new purposes. And all too often, such high tech surveillance disparately burdens people of color. Practically speaking, there is no way to de-identify individual location data since these data points serve as unique personal identifiers of their own. And even when location data is said to have been anonymized, re-identification can be achieved by correlating de-identified data with other publicly available data like voter rolls or information that's sold by data brokers. One study from 2013 found that researchers could uniquely identify 50% of people using only two randomly chosen time and location data points. Done right, aggregating location data can work towards preserving our personal rights to privacy by producing non-individualized counts of behaviors instead of detailed timelines of individual location history. For instance, an aggregation might tell you how many people’s phones reported their location as being in a certain city within the last month, but not the exact phone number and other data points that would connect this directly and personally to you. However, there’s often pressure on the experts doing the aggregation to generate granular aggregate data sets that might be more meaningful to a particular decision-maker but which simultaneously expose individuals to an erosion of their personal privacy. Moreover, most third-party location tracking is designed to build profiles of real people. This means that every time a tracker collects a piece of information, it needs something to tie that information to a particular person. This can happen indirectly by correlating collected data with a particular device or browser, which might later correlate to one person or a group of people, such as a household. Trackers can also use artificial identifiers, like mobile ad IDs and cookies to reach users with targeted messaging. And “anonymous” profiles of personal information can nearly always be linked back to real people—including where they live, what they read, and what they buy. For data brokers dealing in our personal information, our data can either be useful for their profit-making or truly anonymous, but not both. EFF has long opposed location surveillance programs that can turn our lives into open books for scrutiny by police, surveillance-based advertisers, identity thieves, and stalkers. We’ve also long blown the whistle on phony anonymization. As a matter of public policy, it is critical that user privacy is not sacrificed in favor of filling the pockets of corporations. And for any data sharing plan, consent is critical: did each person consent to the method of data collection, and did they consent to the particular use?

It is specifically criticizing forms of anonymization that only treat direct identifiers like names, addresses, and phone numbers. That is usually referred to as \"pseudonymization\", and they are correct to point out that an only moderately sophisticated attacker can still link people in the dataset using combinations of indirect identifiers like age, birthday, and zipcode. Pseudonymization is a weak form of privacy.More sophisticated methods of privacy also anonymize indirect identifiers, and in some cases personal attributes. They do this by adding noise to the data in such a way that the noise has relatively* minimal impact on the results of computations made over the dataset, but a significant impact on the ability to re-identify someone using indirect identifiers or attributes.*There is always a tradeoff between privacy and utility. The only way to achieve 100% private data is 100% noise, but the privacy-utility tradeoff curve isn&#x27;t linear, and you can still achieve very good utility and very good privacy in many cases, especially with the best tools. Methods are also improving over time, reducing the impact of the tradeoff. reply m000 3 hours agoparentSorry to break you the news, but your employer is probably selling snake oil. And this is exactly the point of the TFA:> However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification requires removal not only of your identifiable information, but also of information that can identify you when considered in combination with other information known about you.So, anonymization may be well intended and sophisticated, but is only effective as long as you control and anonymize all the data available to your adversary. Which you obviously cannot. The best you can achieve with anonymized data is to allow non-malicious users to run some analysis on your data in a controlled environment without exposing them to information they should not see. If that&#x27;s your employer&#x27;s business model, well, there may be a market niche for that. reply genewitch 13 hours agoparentprevIn the interest of charitable-ness, can you define \"noise\" and explain how rudimentary denoising algorithms that have existed since the 1960s can&#x27;t penetrate it?Time and time again people think they&#x27;ve anonymized data and they&#x27;re always proven incorrect.Just come to grips with the fact you&#x27;re participating in the sale of my (or whoever&#x27;s) private data. Hope you sleep well! reply willseth 12 hours agorootparent\"Denoising\" algorithms can&#x27;t remove this kind of noise. It doesn&#x27;t work like that. You&#x27;re simply mistaken.Generally the state of the art for adding noise to data is differential privacy or microaggregation. In the case of differential privacy it&#x27;s typically gaussian or laplacian noise, but it is not a trivial application. Noise applied through microaggregation is not a mathematical function because microaggregation targets k in k-anonymity, and the \"noise\" can only be measured after treatment, through various distortion measures.My company doesn&#x27;t sell private data or facilitate the sale of private data.

Very few of those have a business model where the purpose is to profit from the sale of that data. Every one of our customers is treating first party data for first party use cases, which is far more common than buying or selling data. How many companies have prod user data and developers that need an up to date prod-like database? A ton. Many just copy prod and distribute to devs. The good ones try to keep scripts for populating the database with test data up to date, but that’s a nightmare. Anonymization is an elegant solution to this problem. There are countless other use cases where organizations need to use their customer data internally and (should) want to protect identities.Most companies don’t want to sell their user data because they consider it competitive, and most data brokers don’t want to anonymize because why would they if they’re already selling raw data? They aren’t interested in our software because we prevent singling out of identities. reply newaccount74 2 hours agorootparent> collects user data because it’s necessary to run a businessThat&#x27;s a lie we developers like to tell ourselves.

The anonymization script which I wrote for my company just replaces every string in the customer&#x27;s database with a cryptographic hash--except a list of strings like \"failed\" and \"success\".So unless your city is named \"success\", it&#x27;s going to be missing from the dataset.It&#x27;s a bit bewildering to actually run the app in this mode, but here&#x27;s a lot of diagnostically relevant information you can get out of a database like that. You can even confirm bug fixes. Meanwhile, somebody looking to harm the user would need to already know quite a lot about that user before they could make any use out of such a thing.Good faith efforts to protect user privacy exist, is not helpful to lump them in with the rest like this:> Sometimes companies say our personal data is “anonymized,” implying a one-way ratchet where it can never be dis-aggregated and re-identified.

A couple such data points, and you can be almost certain.If you know when you made a couple of transactions that are in the database, and you can find a set of likely options for each time, and then see what fields they have in common. Once you know your data, you can infer a whole load of the reverse mappings for various fields.If those transactions involve another user, you can start to correlate those mappings with data you know about them, and start to build up a web of transactions that person had even if you don&#x27;t necessarily know yet who the other users they interact with yet.All this is possible without the use of rainbow tables, but chances are your hash function is a standard one, so with a single known mapping you can work out which hash function you chose, and look for speculative entries in the data. e.g. let&#x27;s just look for MD5(\"Chicago\"), SHA1(\"Chicago\"), SHA256(\"Chicago\") and see if there are any matches. If there are, we can use that hash function and trivially create a rainbow table for every city in the US, first names, surnames, etc. reply neeleshs 8 hours agorootparentI think of this as a graph of interconnected data and metadata. Unless the entire graph is anonymized, it&#x27;s not really anonymized. Deducing relationships between metadata elements (city field, and purchase store) ends up being the tricky part, and highly domain specific. Hashes with salts make it a bit harder too. reply lukifer 9 hours agorootparentprevLet’s at least grant the benefit of the doubt, that the poster knew to salt the hash. We can take it as given that incompetence makes for poor anonymization.Your example of “transactions in Chicago” is much more salient; there’s clearly a cat-and-mouse dynamic where data can be de-anonymized, especially if the dataset is public. How much that will actually be possible will be specific to the data in question; but the risk is non-zero. There’s certainly a case that no amount of obfuscation is sufficient if a user has not explicitly consented to their data being used this way. reply mindslight 5 hours agorootparent> Let’s at least grant the benefit of the doubt, that the poster knew to salt the hash. We can take it as given that incompetence makes for poor anonymization.Actually let&#x27;s not, because adding salting doesn&#x27;t actually get it right either. Rather it&#x27;s just another easily-broken system that is only good enough to fool its own designer. It&#x27;s still trivial to run through a list of the most common city names, and recover nearly all of the entries. And if there is just a single \"salt\" per DB, which would be necessary for the apparent requirement that matching city names stay matching, even cycling through all combinations of letters is nearly practical. There just isn&#x27;t enough starting entropy to make hashing meaningful. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ve answered your own questions and kind of defeated your own point here:> Meanwhile, somebody looking to harm the user would need to already know quite a lot about that user before they could make any use out of such a thing.The one thing I see EFF did wrong in this article is, they picked a bad quote to start with. That line from Matt Blaze, it&#x27;s almost a pure tautology. There&#x27;s a better line (though I don&#x27;t know who to credit with it - I picked it up on HN some time ago): there is no such thing as \"anonymized data\", there&#x27;s only \"anonymized until correlated with enough other datasets\".You say \"somebody\" would need to already know a lot about the user to make use of your database. But from my perspective - perspective of the user - that \"somebody\" could just as well be your company. Or your customer buying that data from you... and buying similar data from other companies. reply __MatrixMan__ 7 hours agorootparent> You say \"somebody\" would need to already know a lot about the user to make use of your database.

Some degree of analysis must remain possible because otherwise it would be unclear what the user is paying us for.My point is just that different situations call for different privacy postures. \"Anonymization = Untrustworthy\" glosses over this in a way that doesn&#x27;t help us find ways to improve the situation. reply TeMPOraL 2 minutes agorootparentI understand your point and I agree with it within its scope, however I want to reinforce the point often missed by data handlers: you&#x27;re talking about tradeoffs involved in doing the thing, whereas we (the users) are saying, don&#x27;t do the thing. Anonymization may be a spectrum of trade-offs, but for the side EFF represents here, the two issues are: 1) that companies do the thing that makes anonymization a meaningful concept in the first place, and then 2) use one end of the spectrum to sell this to the public, while actually sitting on the opposite end of that spectrum.I&#x27;d call 2) a continuous equivalent of a discrete rhetorical trick called \"equivocation\" - I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a term for it. JohnFen 5 hours agorootparentprev> My point is just that different situations call for different privacy postures.True.

The only way I know of that data can be collected and handled in an anonymous way is to aggregate the collected data immediately and discard all individualized data.Replacing data with something like a hash is useful in many ways, but there are many things it isn&#x27;t that useful with. reply candiddevmike 11 hours agorootparentprevThese scripts always have the best intentions but typically end up neglected and suddenly production data is on a dev laptop (at least, in my experience, both as an employee and a customer).Make mock data inputs or snapshot data based on internal&#x2F;QA usage, please! reply SenAnder 8 hours agorootparentprev> replaces every string in the customer&#x27;s database with a cryptographic hash [..] So unless your city is named \"success\", it&#x27;s going to be missing from the dataset.I&#x27;m not sure I understand.

Realistically the column names are generic, \"output\", \"input\" things like that.

And the way you now describe it, with the entries in every column being hashed, and the column names themselves being meaningless*, I&#x27;m confused what value such a database has for anyone. They&#x27;re just columns of random data, and the analyst doesn&#x27;t even know what the data represents?*And presumably, somehow, there being no way to recover this meaning. E.g. if an attacker is reversing hashes, they could try several sources of guesses - city names, country names, common first and last names in several languages, heights and weights in metric and imperial in the human range, valid phone numbers, IPv4 addresses, dates, blood type, license plate and post numbers or entire addresses, e-mail addresses if the attacker has a list of known-valid emails... all of these, and I&#x27;m sure many others that I forgot, are sufficiently small that they can be brute-force guessed by simply trying all possibilities, so no matter how generic the name of a column is, if it contains any of this data, the hashing can be reversed. reply uoaei 10 hours agorootparentprev> So unless your city is named \"success\", it&#x27;s going to be missing from the dataset.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geotargit.com&#x2F;called.php?qcity=Success> There are 11 places in the world named Success!Negligence of all possible corner cases is common in handcrafted, \"well-intentioned\" approaches such as this.

Everyone wants the bare minimum, which is unfortunate, but understandable for someone trying to run a business. All of our current customers are only using their data internally and anonymizing to protect identities as that data is shared across other internal groups, mostly for testing and analysis. Even protecting only direct identifiers is far more responsible than the vast majority of businesses, though we push for indirect treatment.If you treat indirect identifiers with our system, the minimum level of anonymization would ensure that there are always a minimum of two matching combinations of indirect identifiers, i.e. k=2, for every record in the dataset. This is far from foolproof for preventing data leakage, but it does prevent singling out and provides a lot of protection in the case of breach. reply Dayshine 13 hours agoparentprevPseudonymization is creating a new random identifier and keeping a linking table from those new identifiers to the original identifiers.Pseudonymized data is for all intents and purposes completely anonymous as long as the people you share the data with cannot access the linking table.That constraint can be enforced technically, contractually, or legally, depending on how important the breach would be. reply willseth 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s pseudonymization regardless of the replacement data format. It can be a token, a format-consistent value, e.g. \"john.smith@example.com\", redacted, etc. All of that is considered pseudonymous.Pseudonymized data is not completely anonymous. For example, your name, address, date of birth, and other identifiable information are likely available in public datasets like property tax records or voter registration data.

We use the state of the art to treat indirect identifiers without pseudonymization, but we pseudonymize as needed if that’s overkill. The bar is set very high for our service. Sadly, very few companies are actually interested in treating indirect identifiers or consider anything besides direct identifiers a problem.I’m familiar with GDPR, we work with EU companies, and all the ones we work with use original definition. NIST link aside, these terms are hardly standards anyway. They are nearly colloquial vocabulary, which unfortunately in this space I expect to remain imprecise and vague. This why we generally only use it in marketing and comms, while in the actual product we drill down into specifications for direct and indirect identifiers, distortion, and risk. replyjandrewrogers 12 hours agorootparentprevMany red-teaming attacks don&#x27;t rely on the identifiers at all, they are essentially \"duck typing\" the entities in the data model.

    "originBody": "KDE Plasma 6.0 Is Enabling Wayland By Default, Initial Support For HDR-Capable Games Written by Michael Larabel in KDE on 11 November 2023 at 06:24 AM EST. 33 Comments It's been an exciting week in the KDE space as along with releasing Plasma 6.0 Alpha, they have also committed to shipping Plasma 6.0 with the Wayland session being enabled by default. Plasma 6.0 will still have X11 support but out-of-the-box it will attempt to use the Wayland session. Prominent KDE developer Nate Graham shared this highlight along with other interesting KDE achievements for this past week: - KDE Plasma 6.0 will be Wayland by default. The remaining blocker bugs are being addressed and the developers feel it's good enough to have the Wayland session by default for Plasma 6.0. - An overhaul to the Breeze app style. - Preliminary support for playing HDR-capable games on HDR-capable displays with the Plasma Wayland session. - Better printer integration within the KDE System Settings. - The Plasma panel settings area has been redesigned (again). - Ark is now much faster at compressing files using XZ and Zstd by enabling multi-threading. - Plasma's start time is up to a few seconds faster. - The Meta + Escape shortcut will now launch the KDE System Monitor. - Various KDE multi-screen issues have been fixed. More details on these KDE improvements for the week via Nate's blog. 33 Comments",

For example:* Chrome needs a bunch of extra flags to launch in Wayland mode* Firefox needs extra flags to launch in Wayland mode* Xwayland is just broken on Nvidia with both sides refusing to compromise (implicit vs explicit synchronization - Nvidia refuses to add implicit and Xwayland refuses to take Nvidia’s patch to do explicit). What this means is that you get tearing, flickering and all sorts of terrible graphical artifacts* Chrome only just fixed HW acceleration for Nvidia (latest m120 beta)* enabling vulkan causes Chrome to fail to render (although this may just me needing to try reinstalling Nvidia drivers)* I thought it was an acceleration thing, but even with HW acceleration fixed Chrome has a bug where the mouse pointer leaves behind white speckling when mousing over on a dark background. VSCode doesn’t have this issue.None of these issues appear in X and this is from someone who thought Wayland is the right way to go (eg you didn’t see this kind of story on Mac when they switched to HW accelerated compositing). reply jwells89 16 hours agoparentMaybe Firefox needing flags is a per-distro thing? I’ll have to check and make sure but I think Firefox works with Waylad sessions out of the box on my Fedora laptop. That’s using an Intel iGPU instead of an Nvidia GPU though so maybe that’s also a factor. reply vlovich123 16 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s right. To make it work on Nvidia you need to go through extra hoops in a bunch of ways (turning on config flags, installing alternative HW decoding libraries etc). Part of this story is definitely Nvidia & Wayland teams being at ends with each other for some reason so anyone on Intel & AMD GPUs probably don&#x27;t see a lot of this which is kind of surprising because 10 years ago Nvidia was the only one with well behaving drivers on Linux. reply cycomanic 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m using sway on an Nvidia card and apart from having to use sway-nvidia (which does set some environment variables for wayland with nvidia) I don&#x27;t have to set any flags for Firefox. On my laptop with Intel graphics I didn&#x27;t have to use any special flags for Firefox on wayland for several years.One thing is that the correct environment variables should be set, but all the wayland compositors have been setting these for ages AFAIK reply brnt 14 hours agoparentprevI have three laptops each with Intel graphics, each from a different generation. They all have the same show stopping (as in screen locking gotta reset) bugs after a fresh distro install, no adjustments.But ofcourse, Wayland isn&#x27;t the problem... reply mpol 1 hour agorootparentIf the device locks up, is that really Wayland, not the kernel driver or mesa driver?Here on HN I see a lot of popular opinions on Intel and their drivers. Even today, proposing it as a baseline for Wayland. But could it perhaps be that Intel is just really good at marketing? AMD might be less about marketing and just delivering good drivers. reply vetinari 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe if you told us, how to replicate this show stopping bug so we could it try ourselves, someone could fix it then. Wayland being the problem or not. reply duckmysick 11 hours agorootparentNot the OP, but happens to me too. Steps to replicate: put your laptop to sleep (suspend) and try to wake it up (resume). You end up with a black screen. Often times, you can SSH into your laptop, but the screen remains unresponsive. Only hard reset helps.There are many reports of such bug. It&#x27;s common on Wayland, but happens on X11 to some folks. The only constant is it happens on devices with Nvidia cards.I tried pretty much everything and I gave up on solving it. reply brnt 11 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t even have to do anything. Just boot after a fresh install and wait a minute or two. Three generation of all Intel laptops. I uploaded some logs, but people were utterly uninterested or hostile. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentIt has nothing to do with Wayland though, based on the description. Wayland used the base kernel API to manage the display. That is probably broken on your given device.X11 often gets patched by a proprietary nvidia blob (the nvidia driver), which uses a separate, non-standard, X-specific API. reply brnt 11 hours agorootparentprevI did, there was no interest. reply chlorion 12 hours agorootparentprevWayland has been flawless for me, but for others not so much.Every thread about wayland has people claiming it&#x27;s broken yet they aren&#x27;t reporting bugs or providing useful information at all, just vague complaints.Many people experience no issues with wayland, and some people do experience issues, but without any information nothing can be done to even attempt to fix things. It&#x27;s possible in many cases that something is misconfigured, or a known issue that has been fixed in newer releases of whatever you are using, or a genuine bug that hasn&#x27;t yet been discovered. Nobody will ever know though. reply vlovich123 7 hours agorootparentBasically your complaint is “Linux users aren’t spending hours to reproduce every single issue and keep following up with additional debug info from every developer new to the conversation”. What if instead the model was done survey who has issues and pick 1 random person who’s reporting issues and build up a knowledge base of the ways it’s failing (ie formally “here’s the symptoms, here’s the root cause and here’s the fix” whether that fix is something the user has to do on their end or a new SW version. I think if you did that enough times, you’d be randomly sampling the highest effect bug rates. It’s not the cheapest way to do this but if you’re having so many foundational issues with something as it’s looking like Nvidia is with Wayland (especially given how old Wayland is), that’s what I’d be telling the Linux driver team at Nvidia to own end to end until we believed all the largest Nvidia issues were resolved (whether or not it’s a driver problem) and then go back to normal triage processes. This stuff is normal shit that happens at high performing teams when things are this bad (eg an entire component critical to Wayland working on a Linux desktop isn’t working if you’re an Nvidia customer).Asking users to contribute to fixing their own issues is the quickest way to make sure nothing ever gets done. I’m an extremely technical user but im using Linux for my day to day engineering needs. I have other SW that needs my attention and debugging my personal desktop issues is not what I’d like to be doing. If it gets bad enough I’ll reinstall the OS from scratch or switch back to Mac and figure out how I can make Linux work in a VM so I can test the software I need. But right now the SW I’m working on is Linux-only and if I can solve and figure out a workaround for the problem by myself without having to pause and follow up about some bug is not where I want to spend my energy. I have enough trouble keeping track of conversations on GitHub. I just hope any bugs I can’t figure out myself will eventually get solved without me having to do anything. And I do follow up some times but the value of that has been hit and miss enough that I do it as rarely as possible. reply brnt 11 hours agorootparentprevI did. It was a base distro install just booted up, as I already stated.l, on three different, bog standard machines. They were not interested either.I take my bug reports a bit more seriously, and I don&#x27;t use instances of success to discount instances of failure. A bug&#x27;s a bug, a good proces cares about outliers (and as you say, Wayland erroring does not seem like an outlier) too.I understand not all combinations of hardware can work flawlessly, but Intel machines with Intel hardware seems like a good baseline to ensure always works before you mainline Wayland. reply tormeh 15 hours agoparentprevUsing Wayland on NixOS with AMD GPU.

Give it a couple of years for every combination to get ironed out. X11 is hardly the answer here. If you&#x27;re going to gripe about Wayland, X11 is never the answer. reply flohofwoe 15 hours agorootparent> Vulkan unlike OpenGL is also quite new.Vulkan is 7 years old by now. That&#x27;s the same time span between Direct3D1 (1995) and Direct3D9 (2002).Wayland is 15 years old now btw.7 and 15 years should be more than enough time to create stable and robust software libraries. reply Wowfunhappy 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t wholly disagree with your conclusion, but it&#x27;s worth considering some context.Direct3D versions 1 – 9 were indeed released at a rapid pace, more than one per year on average. However, it took a whole five years before D3D9 was superseded by D3D10, and subsequent releases have also been relatively slow.Direct3D 12 is eight years old, even older than Vulkan. However, it still feels to me like a \"new\" API, I think because even now, many games still use DirectX 11.I&#x27;m not sure why this is. Probably some combination of the flattening of the technology curve (hardware used to change more each year than they do today), and the fact that once a technology is more complex, it takes more time to change it, and to adopt those changes. And also, legacy compatibility becomes a concern: in 1995, we didn&#x27;t have multiple decades of existing code, libraries, tooling, and complete consumer software to migrate and support. reply Dalewyn 15 hours agorootparent>I&#x27;m not sure why this is.It&#x27;s because Windows.DX9 remained on the frontline for as long as it did because Windows XP was supported from 2001 all the way to 2014 due to usage share. Similarly, DX11 remains on the frontline because Windows 7. I guess it&#x27;s more apt to say they are because Windows Vista and Windows 8(.1) failed spectacularly respectively, but my point remains.Since Windows 7 and 8(.1) are both EOL now, more games should start using DX12 Ultimate. reply Wowfunhappy 14 hours agorootparentWasn&#x27;t DX12 backported to Windows 7? reply Dalewyn 6 hours agorootparentOnly a small subset of Direct3D 12 and only if the game dev incorporated it. reply beebeepka 14 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t dx12 a lower level API? Not nearly as accessible as dx&#x2F;opengl. I guess not everyone in the game industry has the ability to just switch because codebases are messy, \"things are already working\", and there not being much to gain but performance.Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, for example, would often crash on me under dx12, until I switched to dx11. Not everyone is id Software or Epic. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentprev> 7 and 15 years should be more than enough time to create stable and robust software librariesYeah, if it were goddamn Apple forcing the ecosystem to make the change. Linux is the bazaar, no one forces anything, but it also comes with disadvantages, like not adapting new tech. reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentprev> Till today I have found X11 configuration one of the toughest things in Linux. I&#x27;d rather google for some wayland specific flags than worry about X11.My experience here is that this used to be true more than ten years ago. At some point in between that though X11 managed to get to 0 config. At least, I installed Arch & didn&#x27;t have to touch the X config at all and things just worked (on NVidia at least).I&#x27;m not trying to say needing flags is something bad. That stuff will get ironed out for sure. But if you want to avoid Xwayland, you need flags (& it&#x27;s not just Chrome & Firefox - Electron needs similar things) AND Xwayland on Nvidia is a mess right now with no end in sight.> Xwayland is a transitional thing anyways too. When X is dead we won&#x27;t need to worry about Xwayland either.Some apps don&#x27;t even support Wayland and likely won&#x27;t for a long time and I think you&#x27;re underestimating how long XWayland will be a thing (e.g. Tcl&#x2F;TK which is powers a surprising number of developer tooling UIs doesn&#x27;t have Wayland & doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough interest to really push this to production though previous ports have been attempted & made progress). FWIW, this argument has been made since Wayland started 15 years ago. I won&#x27;t even have the same machine in 5 years.> X11 is overcomplicated, over-engineered, barely maintained, is apparently broken from a security angle, ancient...It&#x27;s funny the kind of arguments that get made because you think I&#x27;m against your position. I agree with you and think Wayland should replace X11. But there are very real problems with it today & there&#x27;s a reason anyone with an NVidia GPU goes \"uggh. Wayland\". The problem is not just on Nvidia&#x27;s end and I see cultural problems from Wayland&#x27;s side too (likely because they&#x27;ve faced so much drive by attacks). I feel like Nvidia is stepping up on their side though - I don&#x27;t see the same from Wayland&#x2F;XWayland camp. reply sidkshatriya 14 hours agorootparent> Nvidia is stepping up on their side though - I don&#x27;t see the same from Wayland&#x2F;XWayland campGenuinely curious -- what stepping up should happen from Wayland&#x2F;XWayland ? Intel and AMD seem to work well on it so is it because they have some accepted some ugly hacks that Nvidia are not willing to do ? Something else ? reply vlovich123 8 hours agorootparentIn terms of stepping up, they seem to be tackling through Wayland issues. The latest 545 seems to have people on forums saying “this fixed so many Wayland issues for me”. Now either they are paying professional astrosurfers, or they legitimately fixed some classes of bugs (or it’s random). My experience though is that this kind of feedback tends to be genuine. So I’m giving kudos where it’s due and it seems like the Nvidia team is starting to focus on Wayland issues. Similarly, I was observing recent bug tracker activity on Chrome and Nvidia and all that seemed to be tracking bugs on their end (which not surprising - Nvidia and Google have strong relationships between Android, Chrome, and formerly Stadia).I don’t know the details on the Xwayland BS (which is the main visible issue I’m seeing as unhealthy). I have not done the technical research to fully understand whose position is actually justified. Heck it might be that both sides are correct on the facts (it doesn’t make sense to add the support that makes other GPUs work and it doesn’t make sense yet to add the new way for Nvidia) but the net outcome is that Xwayland on Nvidia’s propietary drivers remains broken for the foreseeable future. Both Intel and AMD both support something called implicit synchronization. But apparently explicit synchronization is “the future” because it enables more performance and Nvidia has clearly communicated they’re not going to support implicit. Xwayland only supports implicit synchronization and refuses to add explicit synchronization (I think strong arming their position is that the explicit synchronization protocol is isn’t ready or not popular enough yet in the ecosystem? I’m not sure). Nvidia has contributed some patch to fix Xwayland to use explicit synchronization when running on the propietary driver (or something like that). reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentprevOf course X11 is badly maintained. Because RedHat took over the maintenance and they want to push Wayland. They took it over to kill it.X11 is not ideal but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll really die. The big benefit of UNIX&#x2F;Linux is choice. Including for a graphics stack.I&#x27;d use Wayland if it worked with KDE on FreeBSD but it doesn&#x27;t yet.

Maybe most people are on laptops and their laptop chip got some fix for an issue impacting those users? Not sure but that’s one obvious difference that might separate me. The other is that my CPU is the 13900k without an Intel GPU and I imagine most people opt for iGPU integrated (I didn’t see the point of it when running a desktop and I had enough of bad experience with Intel+Nvidia on the laptop side of things for the past 2 years with that configuration that I decided my sanity was better this way). replysmallerfish 20 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s been kind of buried, but KDE has the first steps of tiling mode built into it now, in addition to the default screen edge tiling (on KDE 5.27.8 on up).

Opinions will differ, of course and I cannot say whether the time required is justified or calls for optimizations, but personally, I view that moving this to the first search query is less elegant than having it happen during the initial start, when users are more accustomed to waiting a bit longer. With the new setup, the initial query will be less seamless than future ones at a time when the user is actually trying to accomplish something, leading to a degraded experience as far as I am concerned.

It&#x27;s difficult to explain. I noticed this starts happening after I start an Xorg session for the first time, which for some reason always switches back to the default after an upgrade.If someone knows what bug this is and how to fix it, I&#x27;d appreciate it.Then there are other minor issues like the cursor being tiny when hovering over a Firefox window, which I guess uses Xwayland(?).The fact each application needs to explicitly support Wayland, and I need to switch to an entirely different app ecosystem, is insane to me. I&#x27;m willing to make the jump if it offered a truly better experience than X, but I&#x27;ve yet to see that. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparent> The fact each application needs to explicitly support WaylandThat’s not really the case, basically every framework supports both X and Wayland, out of the box. It is just sometimes marked as experimental&#x2F;non-default by some software, e.g. firefox (which is not your average GTK&#x2F;Qt app). reply miloignis 17 hours agorootparentprevI recommend swapping your nix package to firefox-wayland -I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while and it&#x27;s been great. For me, it&#x27;s been a huge improvement over X - thr lack of screen tearing when srolling and playing videos is huge.If an app uses one of the normal GUI toolkits, they don&#x27;t normally have to do anything crazy to support wayland, so I&#x27;d be suprised if you need to swap to a whole new ecosystem (and there&#x27;s always XWayland for those that do). reply imiric 13 hours agorootparentThanks, I&#x27;ll try that, but the thing is that I haven&#x27;t experienced screen tearing on X for many years now, on Intel, AMD or Nvidia cards, and even on high refresh rate displays (90&#x2F;120hz). Sometimes when plugging in a second monitor I need to force full-screen composition with Nvidia cards to get rid of tearing, but I can always set this permanently in a config file, I just haven&#x27;t gotten around to it.I really haven&#x27;t had major gripes with X for many years. It mostly just works, and is rock solid. Long gone are the days when you had to manually craft the perfect config file depending on your setup. It also works great with multiple monitors, though I think there are still some color management issues, which don&#x27;t particularly bother me, and lack of HDR, obviously. Plus the client&#x2F;server architecture is super useful, to this day. IME Wayland feels like a usability regression, forcing me to change many of the programs I use, and it has critical issues, which seemingly only affect me... reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentYou don’t notice screen tearing on normal usage with most desktop environments on X due to them using compositors.

Sandboxes can access the wayland socket and run GUI stuff, without the ability to read the entire screen or run commands that effect outside of the sandbox.The wayland socket is a unix socket, exists as a regular file. Gating access to the socket works like any other file.X11 has some interesting issues here. It creates an \"abstract socket\". These exists as files on the file system, but they are not regular files.An interesting exmaple: A sandbox that starts with a fresh root and bind mounts in only what is required. Even when you don&#x27;t bind the socket into the sandbox, the sandbox can still access it!There are ways to prevent sandboxes from accessing the x11 socket, but this is definitely not what I would have expected!With wayland, if the socket is not bind&#x27;ed into the sandbox, it can&#x27;t be accessed, it behaves as expected!This might not seem that important, but these features bring Linux desktop out of the 1900s with regards to security. Software like flatpak would not be able to effectively sandbox GUIs at all without wayland, a feature other platforms have supported for at least a decade or more!The Linux desktop isn&#x27;t making great use of this and related technology yet, on the standard distro, by default, applications can read your GPG keys and other important data, or even delete it.

There are annoying bugs, but they&#x27;re not show stoppers. I&#x27;m not someone who whines about problems like these, especially because I&#x27;m at the forefront of the Linux desktop, on a known-bad combination, so there are bound to be bugs :PFor example, a persistent bug that hasn&#x27;t gone away in all this time is flaky wake from sleep. Sometimes, one of my monitors breaks in such a way that it drops down to 640x480 res and can&#x27;t be changed back unless I do a list of different rituals. Another bug is that KDE&#x27;s \"Night Color\" feature doesn&#x27;t work, and whenever it turns on it completely freezes the display every few minutes (although unfreezing it is just a matter of pressing the Meta key, so it&#x27;s not a big deal). I keep sleep and Night Color on, even though they&#x27;re broken in the hopes that I&#x27;ll one day wake up to an update that fixed them. I&#x27;m 99% sure those are Nvidia driver bugs, and Nvidia has been working to improve their Wayland support recently (for example, there&#x27;s an upcoming Night Light fix that I&#x27;m excited for: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omgubuntu.co.uk&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;gnome-night-light-nvidia...). Being able to follow progress like this is fun for me.I&#x27;m sure there are some other issues that I&#x27;m not remembering, but overall the desktop is completely 100% usable and reliable (for both working and gaming). My only other machine is a laptop, and that too is running KDE+Wayland (though no Nvidia). I have not switched back to X11 once in the months (year?) since I switched to Wayland, and have not missed anything.EDIT: also, I should mention that I&#x27;m on Fedora Kinoite. I feel like a lot of problems people have with KDE&#x2F;Wayland&#x2F;Nvidia comes down to bad configuration somewhere.

It doesn&#x27;t need a lot of padding, just a pixel here and a pixel there - not to make it less dense, but to make it look cleaner and consistent.

Even though I like KDE , I find that compared to MacOS, KDE is the one that comes out a bit amateurish... the attention to detail in the MacOS UI is just amazing. Am I missing something?? How is KDE better (it really feels much more raw to me, but being on Linux I don&#x27;t really expect much more)? reply GuestHNUser 15 hours agorootparentI think it comes down to preference. I definitely don&#x27;t think KDE is amateur, but it certainly lacks the fine polish Apple has the money to pay for.That said, I find MacOS frustrating at times because basic things can feel like a pain. Switching between several windows of the same application isn&#x27;t a simple Alt-Tab; the green button enters full screen mode (KDE&#x2F;Windows F11 Full Screen is equivalent) instead of leaving just the menu bars and application bar on screen; tiling windows isn&#x27;t as simple as ramming the application against the border you want to expand to. These are simple things I do often in other OS&#x27;s that have tedious menu workflows in MacOS. I still like a lot of MacOS though. reply onetom 15 hours agorootparentThe built-in Cmd-` (backtick) cycles through the windows of the currently selected app.I find it better than Context.app, which i did buy and used on a few machines for a few years.it&#x27;s like navigating within a sparse table.columns are the apps, chosen by cmd-tab.rows are the windows of an app, chosen with cmd-` . reply fragmede 15 hours agorootparentprevContexts.app to fix alt-tab reply GuestHNUser 15 hours agorootparentThanks for this!

How do you cut and paste something on a Mac using the keyboard?2. How do you cut a file in one folder and paste it into another in Finder using the keyboard?3. How are you supposed to know the answer to 2. except by learning it by discussing with Mac users?4. I haven&#x27;t tested recently but it used to be that there was no single consistent way to get to the start or end of a line while selecting the text in between. CMD-shift-arrow left&#x2F;right worked most places, but not everywhere. Ctrl + a&#x2F;e always worked but couldn&#x27;t be used to select text, only to move the cursor.PS: I already asked for a Mac as my next machine at work. But as someone who uses and have used almost all major desktops (Gnome 2, KDE 3, 4 and 5, Windows 95 - 10, several iterations of Mac OS X) for significant time, I do feel the \"attention to detail\" argument for Mac is a bit overblown.PPS: I planning to get a Mac because it has good hardware, is silent, fast and because I want to try it again after a few years.

You don&#x27;t.I realize that&#x27;s not a very satisfying answer, but it&#x27;s quite obviously a conscious UX choice, and IMO not a bad one. The problem is, where does the file go in between the time you cut and you paste? If you accidentally copy something else to your clipboard, do you loose the entire file? Does the file appear in the Trash or is it deleted perminently?You can use cmd+c and then cmd+alt+v to copy a file to your clipboard and then move it to a different directory, but moving is distinct from cutting in that it&#x27;s a synchronous operation. There is no in between point where your file is lost in the ether.3. Assuming we&#x27;re referring to \"how do you move a file with the keyboard\", you open the \"edit\" menu in Finder&#x27;s global menu bar, then hold down \"alt\", at which point \"paste\" will change to \"move item here\".I agree \"hold down option\" is not particularly discoverable. However, it&#x27;s a standard across all of macOS for enabling alternative options. For example, holding down alt will also change \"Minimize\" to \"Minimize All\", and \"Quit\" to \"Quit and Keep Windows\" (or \"Quit and don&#x27;t keep Windows\" depending on your default preference). Once you know this basic idea, it&#x27;s consistent.4. To my knowledge this works in all apps that use Carbon&#x2F;Cocoa. If apps reimplement these views and disregard Apple&#x27;s design guidelines, what is Apple supposed to do?P.S. I think modern macOS is a poorly thought out mess but I love how it was a decade ago (up to OS X 10.9). reply sbuk 14 hours agorootparentprevThe cmd+x&#x2F;c&#x2F;v keyboard shortcuts have been around much longer than the ctrl+x&#x2F;c&#x2F;v equivalents - copied by Microsoft in Windows 3.0; it was all CUA previous to that.1. So to cut in applications (or anywhere anything is selectable other than Finder), it&#x27;s cmd+x, as it has been since the early &#x27;80s; likewise, paste is cmd+v2. In Finder, you&#x27;d use cmd+c to copy the file, cmd+v to paste a copy and cmd+opt+v to move the file. This was introduced, I think, in Lion (OS X 10.9).3. Erm, using the menu bar to begin with?

Digging back into the distant past when I first encountered this on Win 95 (I don’t think I knew about it on 3.1?) it was indeed confusing, though of course now it seems OK, because I got used to it.The example of whether to use the same command for ready-a-file-to-perhaps-move-but-leave-it-otherwise as for definitely-remove-this-thing-now-and-maybe-put-it-somewhere-else is more a matter of taste than one or the other representing better attention to detail. reply MarcusE1W 15 hours agorootparentprevI guess MacOS is more polished than KDE.

There is no coherent design here, nothing aligns, there is no visual hierarchy and often it doesn&#x27;t even show more information than GNOME despite looking so much worse. reply smoldesu 17 hours agorootparent> often it doesn&#x27;t even show more information than GNOME despite looking so much worseYeah, even as a GTK developer I&#x27;m gonna throw a yellow flag here. I&#x27;ve got both Qt and GTK apps that I really love and daily-drive, but none of my GTK3, GTK4 or Libadwaita apps even remotely approach the information density of a Qt app. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that; simplicity is nice for a lot of software. But programs like Cutter, Okteta or even music apps like Eliza cannot be built with the GNOME HIG. I&#x27;d even argue that certain GNOME apps like Meld, GIMP and Glade&#x2F;Cambalache suffer from relying on the GNOME HIG too much. reply aquova 20 hours agoparentprevI used to think the same as you, and I would still agree that out of the box, KDE is probably uglier than Gnome is. However, I&#x27;ve grown to be rather impressed with what you can do with KDE, and more importantly that KDE allows you to do it. Using Gnome was a slow descent into watching all the plugins and UI choices I liked be slowly removed or break over time. reply creesch 20 hours agoparentprevI am not really sure how your comment is a reaction to mine? Having said that, opinions are opinions. I much prefer KDEs UI&#x2F;UX choices over those made by Gnome and have no problem with the general look and feel of the interface. reply JohnFen 19 hours agoparentprevBeauty is entirely subjective, though. I don&#x27;t find KDE ugly at all. Nor do I find Gnome ugly. But I find KDE easy to use, and I don&#x27;t find the same about Gnome. Even if KDE was ugly to me, usability is more important. KDE is also very configurable, so I could probably bend it into something more to my taste. reply lnxg33k1 20 hours agoparentprevI don’t care as long as something is capable of solving issues, but for those who have the needs to have pretty DE, kde has a lot of custom themes and customisability, otherwise its just a boring old guy complaining at the sky, the linux world is better off without those kind of people reply schmorptron 20 hours agoparentprevI agree on the spacing part, but it&#x27;s not fair to complain about it and not submit actual solutions to them.Have you tried getting to know their contribution process, looking at their current design guidelines and submitting a new, well-thought-out and complete design guideline proposal to KDE?

I do like it generally, but visually it’s a mess. I use swaywm on my Arch laptop and pure Gnome 45 on a couple of my Fedora 39 PCs (work and home ones).Would appreciate if someone can help me to get quicker at understanding with their system, so I can actually contribute and not just complain about it being inconsistent here and there. Even though I not use KDE myself, I use it from time to time on other’s machines and enjoy playing with it. I would consider a switch only if the DE would highly reconsider itself towards simplifying and making other defaults. At the moment, Gnome looks like it to me. reply schmorptron 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great! (i mean this unironically in case that came off sarcastic)I&#x27;m not a kde contributor myself, but they seem to have a matrix channel for that purpose at [ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webchat.kde.org&#x2F;#&#x2F;room&#x2F;#new-contributors:kde.org ], where the contributors themselves can probably point you to the relevant resources and get started.About your second point: From what I&#x27;ve been reading on their blog, a large focus of Plasma 6 is making the defaults more sane and simplifying them a good bit.It&#x27;s obviously a huge challenge to design systems that are simple and polished to understand and use on the surface, but powerful to customize underneath, and I&#x27;m interested to see how it will be tackled.Edit: Also on this site [ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.kde.org&#x2F;Get_Involved ] they point to resources for the KDE Visual Design group reply walteweiss 17 hours agorootparentThank you! It will take time, but I will come there eventually. reply jwells89 16 hours agoparentprevEven as someone who’s using KDE on one machine I tend to agree. Things can be polished up a bit by changing themes and font settings but that only goes so far — it can’t do anything about widget arrangement and the general flow of UI design in KDE apps which I find somewhat awkward. reply cmplxconjugate 20 hours agoparentprevI absolutely agree.

Every major OS has been a major downgrade since... :`( reply sph 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m gonna be very controversial here, but the problem is that the vast majority of Linux users are blind to aesthetics and design. Perhaps the vast majority of people are. Mind you, being blind to something does not mean it does not exist.Just look at the desktop wallpaper or any font choice of the average person. It&#x27;s no wonder Comic Sans and Papyrus are the most common fonts in the world, even for formal business documents.Which is perfectly fine, and design challenged people would enjoy a well-designed desktop environment as well, the issue is that they are ready to defend bad design choices to the death. So mention KDE having lower design standards than GNOME and you get a ton of people telling you \"it looks fine to me, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re moaning about.\"You&#x27;d get the same answer telling the average person that, no, Comic Sans is not appropriate for an obituary.---That said, KDE is slowly growing on me, but the default GNOME look is much more slick, even though GTK4 does 1&#x2F;20th of what QT does. All modern GTK4&#x2F;Adwaita apps are a flat, slick blob of grey list widgets.Colour theory and the use of accent colours or non-monochrome icons is unknown to the average GTK developer. reply sublinear 19 hours agorootparent> the vast majority of Linux users are blind to aesthetics and designYes, my god is KDE ugly, but just because they don&#x27;t prioritize aesthetics doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t know better.Linux users (and developers) prioritize functionality above all else. Meanwhile the entire discipline of visual design is just not very consistent. There are far too many subjective little rules and exceptions to maintain and they change all the time. Who cares?Deliberate oversimplification of how things are displayed from the perspective of the implementer rather than the designer is its own aesthetic. It&#x27;s the choice of reason and a rejection of the imperfections of human perception. It&#x27;s rebellious and edgy. It&#x27;s not a mere rationalization of laziness or ignorance, but a middle finger to business types and their marketing henchmen with their annoying design guidelines and requirements that just get in the way of the actual product. KDE was not made by people getting paid to smile and nod while staying quiet in their cubicles (at least not during the hours they worked on it). Very rock and roll. I&#x27;m all for it. reply jdiff 18 hours agorootparentThis is exactly the problem. These two things are not at odds. Good design is functional. Good design makes information easy to find and digest. Visual soup is hard to organize and make sense of. Form is a component of function. A knife with another blade instead of a handle can do less cutting, not more. A knife with a contoured handle is easier to wield than one with a flat block handle. These concepts translate well into UI. reply sublinear 14 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re at odds, then you should try your hand at implementing what you think looks good without breaking upstream features. Then try maintaining it indefinitely.> Visual soup is hard to organize and make sense of.Initially yes but once you know where things are, having everything be visually distinct can sidestep a lot of unnecessary GUI features (search boxes, configurable views, toolbars, etc.) to overcome the impenetrable and dishonest sameness that comes with \"good design\". If there&#x27;s a way to avoid writing more code to maintain, they&#x27;re going to find it. Why obscure the reality of the underlying logic and data when it just gets in the way of progress towards more functionality?In a production setting desktop environments are rare anyway and that&#x27;s where applications are at their most complex. That should be proof enough that visual design isn&#x27;t functional. You want functional and accessible? That&#x27;s a simple 1KB config file on a server somewhere that you edit from a terminal instead of an endless sea of GUI menus and a lifetime of wrist and eye issues. The ultimate \"contoured handle\" is a copy of vim! If you don&#x27;t see the equivalence then you don&#x27;t understand how much of an unnecessary and tortured metaphor the desktop really is. It&#x27;s a concession, not a requirement. reply jdiff 11 hours agorootparentInformation can be dense and designed. It&#x27;s actually more important for dense information to be designed well to avoid devolving into soup. KDE and its many design inconsistencies and automatic collapsing of menus into \"... and X more items\" leading to menus nested 5+ deep is not good design.Away from KDE, away from GUIs, a dense text readout of key value pairs with no new lines presents a lot of information, but is functionally useless. A tiny dash of design - pairs on new lines, some boldness for keys, indentation for values that wrap to new lines - drastically increases the readability. No matter how familiar you are with this particular text dump, this remains true. You can&#x27;t escape design by running off into the terminal.In GUIs, having movable, modular panels can be good design. Blender&#x27;s design is quite good, especially among its peers, and everything about it can be shuffled around in ways most apps with modular panels can only dream of.Again, we&#x27;re not talking about a 1 dimensional spectrum between design and density. Design isn&#x27;t just \"add padding\" and \"remove customizability.\" reply Pannoniae 20 hours agorootparentprevYour comment is funny because Comic Sans is actually pretty good from a design and accessibility perspective.The complaints are mostly \"fun fonts are not appropriate for a business\" and everyone jumped on hating it. But those who are not that stuck-up don&#x27;t hate it with a passion... reply addicted 19 hours agorootparentThere you go proving that it’s not just that many Linux users have a bad design sensibility, but worse, they will defend bad design as good design.Not only do you defend it, even your defense proves that Comic Sans is a bad design, because matching the needs of what it’s used for (in this case a business setting, where fun fonts are not allowed) is one of the highest factors in good design.And you display another behavior which is common among Linux users that the parent hasn’t mentioned. Finally resorting to complaining that the Users are wrong.Here’s the usual 3 step that prevents a lot of progress in the Linux world.1. Have bad design ideas. 2. Defend those bad design ideas. 3. Insist users and the people who want better design are wrong. reply Pannoniae 19 hours agorootparentNot all of life is business, and there&#x27;s some business where fun is allowed.Also, Comic Sans is not even something rebellious, it&#x27;s literally a good-looking, quirky font, people just hate it because it looks distinctive and it stands out.This is a bit dystopian to scream \"NO FUN ALLOWED\".... reply walteweiss 12 hours agorootparentOh my, you guys came from ’90s or ’00s with your Comic Sans. I myself forgot this font ever existed, I see it nowhere these days.It’s beyond awful, just get yourself some link to Google Fonts at least, and explore the myriads of much better looking fonts in every possible way. That’s exactly the problem with aesthetics perception of the FOSS community, having this subjective ‘oh but I like it’ stand on absolutely mediocre shit.

I dispute that. Aesthetics are highly subjective, and things that have an aesthetic sense that I dislike are not wrong, and the people who do like it are not ignorant or idiots. reply kuschku 14 hours agorootparentprevI absolutely agree with everything you said.Sadly, that&#x27;s going to fall on deaf ears, as most people still can&#x27;t tell aesthetics and design apart.KDE has all the features and all the buttons. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;d expect a prototype to be like.Gnome simply reaches good design by just omitting everything that&#x27;d be hard to design. One way to do it, but obviously missing a lot of functionality.Truly good design is making all the bells and whistles feel intuitive. Good design isn&#x27;t about looks, it&#x27;s about information hierarchy and structure.Which is why I love the Windows 9x design so much. reply dooglius 19 hours agorootparentprevIf the vast majority of people don&#x27;t perceive it, it isn&#x27;t bad.

Turns out it&#x27;s completely useless because you can barely hear it even if it&#x27;s right in front of you.Sure, if I&#x27;m buying something purely decorative, like a statue a painting, then aesthetics is all I&#x27;m going for. But for things I have to use, the thing has to do its job above anything else.This is something a lot of designers seems to miss.

    "originBody": "Warning: New Outlook sends passwords, mails and other data to Microsoft 2023-11-10 \"Microsoft steals access data\" - When the well-known German IT portal \"Heise Online\" uses such drastic words in its headline, then something is up. If Microsoft has its way, all Windows users will have to switch to the latest version of Microsoft Outlook. But: Not only can the IMAP and SMTP access data of your e-mail account be transferred to Microsoft, but all e-mails in the INBOX can also be copied to the Microsoft servers, even if you have your mailbox with a completely different provider such as mailbox.org. Main risk: Transferring your data to Microsoft \"Synchronisation with the Microsoft server\" - and everything is copied! If you set up a new account in the software, Microsoft offers a supposed security function: It says that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronised with the Microsoft cloud and that copies of \"emails, calendars and contacts are therefore synchronised between your email provider and Microsoft data centres\". Anyone who reads this carefully may be perplexed, no question. But we all know how easy it is to agree to supposed banalities without reading them and to click away notices, especially when setting up software. In view of the drastic consequences of giving consent here, the warnings and explanations from Microsoft are probably too inconspicuous. Only a few users will realise that they are giving Microsoft comprehensive access to passwords, mail and more. Therefore, once again clearly: Microsoft gets full access to mails, calendars and contacts! But not only Windows users are at risk: Outlook versions for iOS, Mac and even Android are also affected, according to Heise. mailbox.org warns against using the new Microsoft Outlook mailbox.org warns its users: there is a high risk that sensitive data may be transmitted to Microsoft when using the new Outlook! And by the way: this compromised data includes not only emails, but also calendar and contact data. For business customers, storing personal data in this way (albeit unintentionally) may constitute a GDPR offence that is subject to fines. After all, storing data in the Microsoft cloud legally constitutes data processing that requires the conclusion of an order data processing agreement (DPA) with Microsoft - and companies may have to identify this as such in their data protection declarations and in the data processing directory. It is irrelevant whether this is done intentionally by the company management or ultimately through the uninformed consent of an individual employee. Our recommendation Whether business or private: We strongly advise all our customers not to use the new Outlook! And we have the following alternatives for you: Another e-mail client: We advise you to switch to the popular e-mail client \"Thunderbird\" on your computer. This is compatible with Windows and easy to set up. On mobile devices, there are a number of different IMAP mail clients, such as FairEmail and K9 Mail (which will also be called Thunderbird in the future). Using the webmailer: As a mailbox.org customer, you can use our secure webmail portal at any time, which offers an excellent alternative to desktop email clients.

    "originBody": "Personal Tech 6 Meta, YouTube face criminal spying complaints in Ireland 6 Tracking code and ad-block blocking breaks Euro computer law, privacy advocate claims Thomas Claburn Sat 11 Nov 2023 // 08:08 UTC Exclusive Facebook-owner Meta and Google's YouTube now face criminal complaints in Ireland for alleged unlawful surveillance of EU citizens via tracking scripts. Privacy consultant Alexander Hanff, who has occasionally contributed to The Register, has challenged Meta's collection of data without explicit consent under Ireland's computer abuse law. He told The Register he's also in the process of filing a similar criminal complaint against YouTube over its use of scripts to detect ad blocking extensions in people's web browsers. \"I have notified Pearse Street Garda that I want to give a statement to them for the purpose of the criminal complaint and will be sending them additional information over the weekend,\" Hanff told us last night. \"They have got back in touch this afternoon acknowledging the complaint and asking for further information.\" I want to give a statement to them for the purpose of the criminal complaint and will be sending them additional information over the weekend Two weeks ago, Hanff filed a civil complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission against YouTube's browser interrogation system, which detects ad blocking software and refuses to play videos unless adverts are allowed or subscription money handed over. The regulators are right now waiting on a reply from Google to provide an update on the status of that claim. Pointing to decisions by courts and data protection authorities in Europe that have disallowed behavioral advertising without explicit consent, Hanff argues that Meta has been processing data for behavioral ad targeting without a legal basis to do so for at least the past five years. And thus it follows, he says, that deploying and executing scripts that monitor behavior and gather data, is also unlawful. \"Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd for a period of not less than five years from May 25, 2018 to present, illegally deployed surveillance technology to my computers for the purpose of monitoring my behavior, as they had no reasonable excuse or lawful authority to do so,\" Hanff alleged to The Register. Meta also during those years \"illegally intercepted transmission of data within an information system (my computing devices) for the purpose of monitoring my behavior,\" he further alleged. The Instagram giant has a variety of advertising, analytics, and tracking scripts and they change periodically, but one example would be the Meta Pixel, which Meta describes as \"a snippet of JavaScript code that allows you to track visitor activity on your website.\" Hanff believes these activities fall under Ireland's computer abuse law, specifically Sections 2 and 5 of the Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017. Section 2 says, \"A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, intentionally accesses an information system by infringing a security measure shall be guilty of an offense.\" And Section 5 says, \"A person who, without lawful authority, intentionally intercepts any transmission (other than a public transmission) of data to, from or within an information system (including any electromagnetic emission from such an information system carrying such data), shall be guilty of an offense.\" Meta deploying scripts for the purpose of surveillance despite my Do Not Track setting and without any consent would constitute a criminal offense Hanff claimed Meta's processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioral advertising has been unlawful since GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018. \"As you know from the letter I received from the European Commission in relation to the detection of ad blockers – Do Not Track (DNT) is regarded as a setting or other application within the web browser to signal denial of consent as per Recital 66 of 2009/136 (Citizens’ Rights Directive) as such given that I have DNT enabled (and always have had) Meta deploying scripts to my terminal equipment for the purpose of surveillance of my activities (behavioral profiling) despite my DNT setting and without any consent would be a breach of Section 2 above and therefore constitute a criminal offense,\" Hanff claimed. \"Meta Platforms Ireland were not authorized to deploy these scripts to my devices and should have known they were not authorized to do so as a result of the Do Not Track signal sent from my browser.\" Pointing to Section 5, Hanff alleged that since the deployment of the scripts was illegal and Meta circumvented the DNT signal when it deployed those scripts, it's clear any interception of behavior within his device (mouse movements, clicks, and so on), would also be illegal. EU lawmakers scolded for concealing identities of privacy-busting content-scanning 'experts' It's perfectly legal for cars to harvest your texts, call logs Google mulled offering paid-for no-logging private Search subscription UK may demand tech world tell it about upcoming security features With regard to YouTube, Hanff said the issue is essentially the same except that it involves YouTube's attempts to detect ad blocking software using scripts. \"I consider YouTube’s script to be spyware – aka surveillance technology, as it is deployed without my knowledge or authorization to my device for the sole purpose of intercepting and monitoring my behavior (whether or not ads load in my browser or are blocked by an ad blocker),\" he explained. \"I chose to go down the criminal complaint route because historically, EU regulators have been absolutely terrible at enforcing the ePrivacy Directive – and I mean really bad, I would argue even negligent; and as someone who has been fighting these issues for 15 years under the ePrivacy Directive, I decided to change tactics and pursue action under criminal law as I am not willing to wait another 15 years for regulators to do their job and enforce the law – neither can I afford the risk of incredibly high costs by pursuing civil litigation which would take years and see Google and Meta drown me with legal fees.\" I am not willing to wait another 15 years for regulators to do their job and enforce the law He expressed skepticism when asked about the adequacy of settable browser flags like Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control to deal with unwelcome data gathering. Consent for any non-necessary code interaction – scripts, analytics, third-party fonts, and so on – should be the norm, as required under EU law, he argued. Hanff said his hope is that filing these complaints will send a clear message to corporations that they need to stop deploying surveillance technologies on people's devices. \"Additionally, the Irish law I am using holds directors, managers or other officers who willfully cause such an offense to be committed (through policy or authorization, for example) liable of the same offense and are not shielded by the legal entity they work for,\" he said. \"It is my hope that such a liability might force corporate officers to reconsider signing off on illegal behavior under a fear of liability as clearly these decisions are being made by someone and they need to know they can and will be held to account.\" Why now As to the timing, Hanff said there's been a shift over the past 24 months in the actions taken to curtail behavioral advertising and online surveillance, pointing to decisions affecting Meta and TikTok. But he suggests more pressure should be applied because the regulatory process moves too slowly and the financial penalties have been to small to change corporate behavior. \"Regulators have let us down and are absolutely (in my opinion) partly responsible for the erosion of our fundamental rights and the expansion of these illegal behaviors, by failing to do their jobs and take strong enforcement action against violators,\" he claimed. \"As a result, it is now considered as the normal way to conduct online business, which is an incredibly bad reflection of the regulators and has significantly eroded trust of the public that their complaints will ever be dealt with at all – let alone in a meaningful way.\" \"This needs to change,\" Hanff continued. \"For example, I have had a complaint with CNIL since 2019 against Withings – an incredibly simple complaint to deal with (the law and case law is incredibly clear on the issue I have complained about) yet still there has not been any result – and I see this with all of the complaints I have lodged with supervisory authorities across the EU since 2018. It is not acceptable and cannot continue.\" Meta and Google both did not wish to comment.

It would normally be confidential, but in this case it was made by a \"privacy activist\" who publicised it himself.The Gardai and the DPP (prosecutor) make the decision to prosecute or not. If (when) they decide to drop the case, the activist can follow up to get a statement in writing about why the DPP determined it wasn&#x27;t worth a criminal prosecution. That&#x27;s all he&#x27;s likely hoping to get out of this.The US, on the other hand, does have private criminal prosecutions in many jurisdictions, but they aren&#x27;t very common or effective. reply badrabbit 16 hours agorootparentThanks for clearing that up. It&#x27;s very unfair when prosecutors refuse to prosecute and you are the victim. The burden of justice is transfered then to the victim to run a campaign against the DA and at best he loses an election, the original wrong is still not righted! It should fall upon a jury or grand jury to reject an indictment.Short of that, the victim must be allowed to present evidence of a crime before a judge, where the prosecutor has refused to prosecure. if there is merit the why shouldn&#x27;t there be a prosecution?

    "title": "The Potential Benefits and Misunderstandings of Nicotine",
    "originLink": "https://gwern.net/nicotine",
    "originBody": "On the benefits and lack of demerits of nicotine (research up to 2015) IQ, nootropic, psychology 2011-05-09–⁠2016-03-06 in progress ⁠certainty: likely ⁠importance: 9 ⁠backlinks ⁠similar ⁠bibliography ⁠Addictiveness ⁠Effects ⁠Benefits ⁠Performance ⁠Habit-Formation ⁠Costs ⁠Price ⁠Health Issues ⁠Dependence ⁠Conclusion ⁠External Links ⁠Appendix: On Proving Too Much Footnotes Further Reading Similar Links Link Bibliography In 2011, I became curious about nicotine gum/patches as a possible alternative stimulant to modafinil⁠: its much shorter half-life makes it more useful for evenings or scenarios like needing a quick alert on a long drive. I looked briefly into the nicotine/tobacco research to see whether there was convincing evidence that nicotine on its own, without any tobacco or smoke-related delivery mechanism, is either more harmful than most stimulants or likely to lead to severe addiction to tobacco as a ‘gateway drug’. The psychological effects of nicotine as a stimulant are long established by a scattershot literature, so there are possible benefits. Cost-wise, much of the nicotine/tobacco literature willfully conflates the two, leading to misleading attribution of the harm of tobacco to nicotine; many associations with harm are confounded by past or present tobacco use (eg. Kenkelet al2020⁠), but when pure nicotine is examined, as in patch/GUM NRT, the harms appeared minimal: like all stimulants, nicotine may raise blood pressure somewhat, and is addictive to some degree, but the risks do not appear much more strikingly harmful than caffeine⁠ or modafinil (and certainly appear less than the many commonly-used amphetamines). Animal experiments are, like usual, highly ambiguous, of low quality, and of doubtful relevance to humans. There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted, and minimal epidemiological evidence of harm from NRT use over the past 3 decades it has been available. ‘Vaping’ is another story: few experiments have been done, and its popularity is recent enough that any harms are poorly understood other than it can’t possibly be remotely as harmful as tobacco smoking, and its delivery mechanism plausibly is much more addictive than gum/patch delivery would be. Overall, I am personally comfortable using nicotine gum (but not vaping) once in a while, and have done so since 2011 without any noticeable problems or escalation in usage frequency. One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea & coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects tons of systems⁠. Less obvious is that nicotine has many beneficial effects⁠ (and these benefits may be related to anomalous⁠ smoking⁠ results⁠⁠⁠1⁠); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine. Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive, and its addictiveness is genetically modulated⁠⁠2⁠. (If nicotine was all that was going on, why do smokers struggle so much with their transition to NRT en route to quitting entirely? And why do so many people use nicotine gum or patches occasionally for long periods without being addicted, or quitting easily?) All of the harm seems to stem from tobacco, and tobacco smoking in particular; this is not necessarily obvious because almost everyone casually conflates tobacco with nicotine (especially public education programs⁠⁠3⁠), treating them as a single synonymous evil I dub “nicbacco”. When someone or something says that “nicotine” is harmful and you drill down to the original references for their claims, the references often turn out to actually be talking about tobacco rather than nicotine gums or patches⁠⁠4⁠⁠⁠5⁠. Other methodological issues include comparing to current smokers rather than former smokers or failing to control for the subjects being the sort of people who would begin such a societally-disapproved activity like smoking; the studies typically aren’t designed properly even for showing an effect: you need a study which finds deficits in smokers but not in non-smokers or former smokers (eg. Heffernanet al2011⁠ or ⁠Sabiaet al2008⁠/⁠Sabiaet al2012⁠ although neither enables nicotine inferences since there was no nicotine-only control group). The 2019 United States outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products⁠ offers a case in point of this prejudice: despite every sign pointing to adulterants added to illegal THC/marijuana vaping fluids by fly-by-night operators rather than nicotine (such as the decades of nicotine vaping by millions of people not causing them to land overnight in hospital ICUs), the outbreak has been used as an excuse to ban legal nicotine vaping fluids instead—which is like banning aspirin as a response to the opiate crisis because they’re both used for pain relief and they both come in pill form, and some OD victims also used aspirin recently, so that makes them pretty much the same thing, right? Addictiveness Since it’s the main concern, we’ll address it up front. Wikipedia summarizes Guillemet al2005⁠ as “Technically, nicotine is not significantly addictive, as nicotine administered alone does not produce significant reinforcing properties” - the addictiveness coming from MAOIs⁠ (eg. ⁠Khalilet al2000⁠, ⁠Khalilet al2006⁠) & possibly other compounds present in tobacco; while there don’t seem to many human studies aside from the ⁠Amsterdamet al2006⁠ review on the observed inhibition in smokers (consistent with the MAOIs playing a role in addiction), there are a number of significant animal studies: Villégieret al2003, ⁠“Transient behavioral sensitization to nicotine becomes long-lasting with monoamine oxidases inhibitors”⁠. Guillemet al2005, “Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Dramatically Increases the Motivation to Self-Administer Nicotine in Rats”⁠ Villégieret al2005, “Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Allow Locomotor and Rewarding Responses to Nicotine”⁠ Agatsumaet al2006, “Monoamine oxidase A knockout mice exhibit impaired nicotine preference but normal responses to novel stimuli”⁠ Guillemet al2006, ⁠“Monoamine oxidase A rather than monoamine oxidase B inhibition increases nicotine reinforcement in rats”⁠ Villégieret al2007, ⁠“Involvement of alpha1-adrenergic receptors in tranylcypromine enhancement of nicotine self-administration in rat”⁠ Guillemet al2008, ⁠“Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Dramatically Prolongs the Duration of Nicotine Withdrawal-Induced Place Aversion”⁠ Lanteriet al2009, “Inhibition of Monoamine Oxidases Desensitizes 5-HT1A Autoreceptors and Allows Nicotine to Induce a Neurochemical and Behavioral Sensitization”⁠ Reviews or discussion of human smoking & MAOIs include ⁠Fowleret al2003⁠ & ⁠Berlin & Anthenelli2001⁠⁠⁠6⁠. Another thorough and contrarian piece is Frenk & Dar’s2002 book, ⁠A Critique of Nicotine Addiction⁠. I don’t entirely agree with their take-no-prisoners arguments, since additional work since 2002 has clearly shown that nicotine alone does have some addictive properties: for example, Le Follet al2007, “High Reinforcing Efficacy of Nicotine in Non-Human Primates”⁠ found that given enough development, squirrel monkeys would push levers up to 600 times for an injection. But on the other hand, as Le Foll et al comment: Surprisingly, reinforcing effects of nicotine alone have often been difficult to demonstrate directly in controlled laboratory studies with both animals and humans as experimental subjects. Consequently, there has been continuing controversy in the literature about the validity of previous findings of reinforcing effects of nicotine in experimental animals and human subjects [3]⁠, [4]⁠, ⁠[5]⁠, ⁠[6]⁠, ⁠[7]⁠, ⁠[8]⁠. Or “Brain science, addiction and drugs” 2008: The results showed that 40% of smokers receiving the [anti-nicotine] vaccine gave up smoking for nearly six months of follow-up; the highest smoking cessation rate (57%) was associated with the highest antibody response. These results are better than those seen in most nicotine replacement trials, but it is interesting that an unusually high proportion (31%) of the smokers receiving placebo also quit smoking for up to six months [Holman J (2005). “Helping patients kick the habit”. American Diabetes Association, DOC News 2, 1-2]. My take away is that there is addiction but it’s drastically overestimated by almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation capability; the latter makes nicotine doubly valuable, but the former means we will want to be more careful with the nicotine than with modafinil or caffeine, where the main consequence of carelessness is tolerance rendering the stimulant useless or messing up our sleep for a few days. For example, snus⁠, a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular and has been credited with large reductions in the smoking rate⁠⁠7⁠, and with little hard evidence of harm from snus use⁠⁠8⁠. Smokeless tobacco in general is hugely more safe than smoking (⁠“Smokeout: Not as easy as ABC”, Washington Times): Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users. Or “The Nicotine Patch Didn’t Work? You May Not Have Used It Enough”⁠, The New York Times: “People are unreasonably afraid of nicotine”, Dr. Shiffman said. “The majority of smokers believe that nicotine causes cancer and is a big player in the harm caused by cigarettes.” In fact, carbon monoxide, tar and the countless toxic particles in cigarette smoke are what promote illness. Although smokers may become dependent on nicotine, it does not appear to raise the risk of cancer, lung disease or heart disease. Early reports that people who smoked cigarettes while wearing a patch stood an increased risk of heart attack proved unfounded years ago. On the e-cigarette regulation controversy⁠: Dr. Siegel, whose graduate school manuscripts Dr. Glantz used to read, says e-cigarette pessimists are stuck on the idea that anything that looks like smoking is bad. “They are so blinded by this ideology that they are not able to see e-cigarettes objectively,” he said. Dr. Glantz disagrees. “E-cigarettes seem like a good idea,” he said, “but they aren’t.”…Public health experts like to say that people smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar. And the reason e-cigarettes have caused such a stir is that they take the deadly tar out of the equation while offering the nicotine fix and the sensation of smoking. For all that is unknown about the new devices - they have been on the American market for only seven years - most researchers agree that puffing on one is far less harmful than smoking a traditional cigarette…E-cigarette skeptics have also raised concerns about nicotine addiction. But many researchers say that the nicotine by itself is not a serious health hazard. Nicotine-replacement therapies like lozenges and patches have been used for years. Some even argue that nicotine is a lot like caffeine: an addictive substance that stimulates the mind. “Nicotine may have some adverse health effects, but they are relatively minor,” said Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent his career studying the pharmacology of nicotine…“Part of the furniture for us is that the tobacco industry is evil and everything they do has to be opposed,” said John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham in England, and the director for the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. “But one doesn’t want that to get in the way of public health.” (Specifically, the main carcinogens in tobacco seem to be the nitrosamines⁠, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons⁠, radium-226⁠, polonium-210⁠, and the nanoparticles like carbon created in combustion; see ⁠Marmorstein1986⁠, Rodu & Jansson2004⁠ & National Cancer Institute. That is, smoking is bad for you for much the same reason that fireplaces kill; see Naeheret al2007⁠.) Which would seem to suggest the following line of thought: if the research on actual smoking is equivocal, and then the demonstrated harm of non-smoking tobacco is so minimal (even if we ignore equivocalness), then how much safer would be just nicotine on its own as a patch/pill? Let’s ignore the general issue of tobacco (about as harmful as TV watching?⁠⁠9⁠⁠⁠10⁠) and focus on just nicotine. Effects Benefits Performance If you’ve read through this page and also read the Wikipedia page on nicotine, your eye was probably caught by the mention that nicotine affects the cholinergic system - the same system piracetam affects. (This might make nicotine redundant with piracetam⁠ or other nootropics⁠ that affect acetylcholine⁠ or acetylcholinesterase⁠, such as huperzine-A⁠, but it’s been argued against.⁠⁠11⁠) Indeed, the research literature is full of results connecting nicotine with improved mental performance: nicotine ⁠boosted IQ scores⁠ in a small sample of smokers, specifically scores on the RAPM⁠⁠⁠12⁠ (possibly related to its ⁠increasing global connectivity⁠ since IQ is being increasingly reified as measuring the global connectivity of multiple brain subsystems), although Schubertet al2018⁠ finds that nicotine merely makes their subjects faster at reaction-time tasks but not IQ tests reaction time⁠ is improved⁠, ⁠as is⁠ inspection time⁠ and visual⁠ ⁠search⁠ (but perhaps due solely⁠ to faster motor reaction?) pilots’ performance enhanced⁠ 4⁄5 as much as donepezil⁠ does; improves late-day piloting⁠ ⁠driving performance enhanced overnight performance⁠ on various memory & attention⁠⁠13⁠ tasks (“These data suggest that when performance is being measured overnight, smokers show little or no impairment, whilst the performance of non-smokers showed performance decrements.”) faster performance⁠ on Stroop and word classification “…acute nicotine administration may exert direct beneficial effects on novelty detection and subsequent memory recognition”⁠ in smokers, improved prospective memory (things one intends to do); Rustedet al2005⁠ can improve handwriting⁠ helps ADHD (⁠Connerset al1996⁠; or ⁠Levinet al1996⁠ - as well as OCD, see previous footnote): “Results indicate significant clinician-rated global improvement, self-rated vigor and concentration, and improved performance on chronometric measures of attention and timing accuracy.” may help depression⁠⁠14⁠⁠⁠15⁠ may help symptoms⁠ of schizophrenia⁠ via increased synthesis⁠ of GABA⁠ & increased effectiveness of ⁠cognitive training⁠ (see Wikipedia⁠), and protect against Parkinson’s & Alzheimers, see Fratiglioni & Wang2000⁠⁠16⁠ but note the difficulties in dealing with mortality bias (or just general ⁠cognitive impairment in the elderly⁠) A meta-analysis⁠ of nicotine studies reports results similar to older literature reviews (eg. ⁠Warburton1992⁠, ⁠Newhouseet al2004⁠): There were sufficient effect size⁠ data to conduct meta-analyses on nine performance domains, including motor abilities, alerting⁠⁠17⁠ and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. We found significant positive effects of nicotine or smoking on six domains: fine motor, alerting attention-accuracy and response time (RT), orienting attention-RT, short-term episodic memory-accuracy, and working memory-RT (effect size range = 0.16 to 0.44). A 2011 ADHD review⁠⁠18⁠ covers nicotine: Dozens of studies have assessed the effects of nicotine on cognition in healthy, nicotine-naïve samples including studies of memory (McClernonet al2003), attention (Froeligeret al2009) and inhibitory control (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). In a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies in which nicotine was administered to non-smokers or only minimally deprived smokers (Heishmanet al2010), nicotine was shown to have positive effects on multiple domains including attention and working memory. Twenty-nine studies specifically assessed non-smokers and among those, positive effects were observed for reaction time on tests of sustained (or alerting) attention and working memory. Studies of the effects of nicotine on inhibitory control were not included in the meta-analysis, but a handful of studies suggest potential positive effects of nicotine on this domain. Two small studies have observed acute (Levinet al1998) and chronic (McClernonet al2006) transdermal nicotine administration to result in trends toward decreases in errors of commission on a CPT task. Moreover, nicotine has been shown to reduce CPT commission errors in nonsmokers with schizophrenia (Barret al2007), non-smokers low in attentiveness (Poltavski and Petros, 2006); and decrease stop signal reaction time in adolescents nonsmokers with ADHD (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). Despite these findings, nicotine was not shown to improve response inhibition in adults with ADHD as measured with a CPT task (Levinet al2001). nicotine ⁠confirmed⁠ to have short-term boosts to “attention and memory”⁠⁠19⁠; similar results (with one negative⁠⁠20⁠): Kumariet al2003, “Cognitive effects of nicotine in humans: an fMRI study”⁠, Fouldset al1996, ⁠“Cognitive performance effects of subcutaneous nicotine in smokers and never-smokers”⁠ Heishmanet al1994. ⁠“Nicotine and smoking: a review of effects of human performance”⁠ Le Houezecet al1994 ⁠“A low dose of subcutaneous nicotine improves information-processing in non-smokers”⁠ and “Effects of cotinine on information processing in nonsmokers”⁠ (cotinine⁠ is a nicotine metabolite with effects of its own) during withdrawal, performance returns to baseline⁠ (but not below; in tension with Ernst2011, and see also a similar possible example with neuroplasticity⁠) In non-humans, mice ⁠learn faster on low doses (see also Levinet al1998, ⁠“Nicotinic acetylcholine involvement in cognitive function in animals”⁠) perhaps unsurprisingly given all this, nicotine has been found helpful in the elderly; see “Nicotine treatment of mild cognitive impairment: A 6-month double-blind pilot clinical trial” (⁠slides⁠; mention no withdrawal symptoms)⁠⁠21⁠ and its citations. (In keeping with our usual nicotine vs smoking dichotomy, note that smoking may be bad for mental functioning in the elderly⁠⁠22⁠.) expectancies ⁠don’t seem to be⁠ a large part of the effect but doses past 14mg seem to harm performance in ⁠Poltavskiet al2012⁠ Notice that many of these results are recent, and postdate the victorious war on tobacco. The question of whether positive results are tainted by tobacco money has ⁠been examined⁠; Anders Sandberg⁠ notes that⁠ there is pretty clear evidence of funding bias - but the independent researchers still turned up their fair share of positive results. Anecdotally, a⁠ great⁠ many⁠ Imminst⁠ posters report a positive experience which is similar to, but better than, the extremely popular amphetamine formulation Adderall⁠; a few also favorably compare it to caffeine⁠. (These anecdotes are supported by a historical survey which reports that the 2 highest rates of hourly consumption were during work hours, and that “Of these three groups [surveyed], 86% of the clinic group, 83% of the students, and 59% of the hospital workers agreed with the statement that ‘smoking helps me think and concentrate’.”) Habit-Formation Besides the nootropic effects, nicotine can be used as an relatively precise self-reward - faster acting than other stimulants like caffeine and modafinil, but with a combination of weak addictiveness and habit formation which is seems to be neural⁠⁠23⁠ and epigenetic⁠⁠⁠24⁠ and affecting sensitivity of the reward system⁠. This use of nicotine to strengthen habits is in accord with at least some research into nicotine; from “Nicotine Creates Stronger Memories, Cues To Drug Use”⁠, Science Daily, describing ⁠“Dopamine enables in vivo synaptic plasticity associated with the addictive drug nicotine”⁠ (Tang & Dani2009; see also Davis & Gould2008⁠, Levineet al2011, Perkinset al2017⁠): “Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being,” said Dr. John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. “However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action.” Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr. Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco. …“The brain activity change was just amazing,” Dani said. “Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections-sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation.”…“We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking.” ⁠Wedrifid⁠ ⁠comments⁠: I have had success working around ‘Ugh’ reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain… And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me)). Again, I don’t swear by it but it works…⁠⁠25⁠ I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the Internet than the substances themselves…. I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn’t particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing Ritalin⁠), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a ‘mere’ stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful.⁠⁠26⁠ (I found 1mg nicotine gum helpful for starting a gym-going habit, but then after it felt strong, I dropped it due to a bit of concern about increasing blood pressure before strenuous workouts.) ⁠Romeo Stevens⁠: E-cigarettes are a really cheap nicotine delivery system. Like pennies per cigarette equivalent cheap if you mix juice yourself. I don’t see how taking advantage of the effects of nicotine is any worse than caffeine. I started vaping while I study and have seen huge productivity improvements from the reduction in ugh fields. Dose-wise: My lozenges (when I had them) were 4mg… which I would consider almost too much. About equivalent to a full double-dose can of energy drink. If I use nicotine as a stimulant now I tend to go with about 4mg of 16 hour patch. (That is, I cut the 24mg 16 hour patches into small pieces). Costs Price The price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices & widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range: for example, one Nicorette gum⁠ product offers 100 4mg gums for $50.13$38.562013, or 39 cents a gum, or if you split one in half to get a 2mg dose, $0.23$0.182013 a dose. a random nicotine lozenge product is 144 4mg lozenges for $55.48$42.682013, $0.39$0.302013 per lozenge, and $0.19$0.152013 per 2mg. 2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard⁠⁠27⁠ for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years’ worth - just like with melatonin⁠). One difficulty with gum, however, is that it’s hard to subdivide: nicotine evaporates from gum and so cutting up a 4mg piece of gum into 4 1mg pieces forces you to either use them all within a few hours, waste some pieces, or store them in some sort of air-tight wrapper for later use. Further, the rise of e-cigarettes⁠ which use nicotine dissolved in water means that if you are willing to have the nicotine absorbed quickly (which would seem to slightly increase addiction risks), the price for a 2mg dose plummets even further; consider one liter of fluid for e-cigarettes ($306$2322012 as of 2012, but down to $208$1602013 as of October 2013). The concentration is 100 mg of nicotine per ml, there are 1000 ml per liter, one wants 2 mg per dose, so (100 × 1000) / 2 = 50,000 doses for $302$2322013, or a (very) small fraction of a cent per dose Health Issues So, what are the gotchas? Tolerance may be a problem. Posters⁠ report⁠ (like with most stimulants, and perhaps ⁠modafinil⁠); their anecdotes are supported by general observations that smokers tend to escalate their smoking habit and by findings that nicotine ⁠down-regulates its receptors⁠ in mice. On the other hand, even if one does develop tolerance to nicotine, that simply suggests spacing it out or rotating with other stimulants. One could imagine a 3-day cycle: nicotine, caffeine, and modafinil. Nicotine is well-known to cause vasoconstriction⁠ (higher blood pressure) which concerns people⁠ But the increase may not be all that large, especially at a low non-smoker dose; and if there is blood pressure increase, it may be perfectly tolerable.⁠⁠28⁠ Though patches are generally found to be safe⁠⁠29⁠ and not abused⁠⁠30⁠, research on nicotine turns up all sorts of possible ways nicotine could be net-unhealthy (perhaps⁠ it metabolizes to a carcinogen among other things or cause mutations⁠⁠31⁠ ) But nicotine has been so intensively studied that we ought to expect a lot of scary looking correlations and possibilities even if nicotine were the bee’s knees, and it can be difficult to interpret the overall mass of studies - what does it actually mean if in mice nicotine increases lung cancer resistance⁠ but in ⁠female rats nicotine plus estrogen⁠ weakens resistance to brain trauma? Does this work in humans? Does it make the cancer more deadly? Is that offset by benefits elsewhere? Is this even a real result given the small sample sizes & ⁠lack of replication⁠? If we read of ⁠massive carcinogenesis in mice⁠ being given LD50⁠-size doses of nicotine for 2 years, is that evidence against nicotine’s safety or for? What does it mean when ⁠one can cause cytotoxicity⁠ in mouse cells in a petri dish using 100% undiluted nicotine (and no more dilute) while 4/5 cigarette smoke extracts caused cytotoxicity? There are a lot of links in this page, but only a fraction of the ones I’ve seen. Cherry-picking and unjustified leaps are a problem in any review; “Cigarette smoking: an underused tool in high-performance endurance training”⁠ makes the point humorously. One Mind & Muscle illustrates the problem: “Consider acne. Nicotine increases keratinocyte differentiation, increases sebum production, etc. It seems like it would induce acne. Yet, overall studies show nicotine use is associated with significantly less acne, purportedly due to other anti-inflammatory mechanisms…nicotine is unfortunately far more complex and difficult to understand.” There are other grab-bags of pros and cons to nicotine⁠⁠32⁠. Nicotine has been shown⁠ to impair neurogenesis⁠ in the hippocampus⁠ in rats at high doses. But the impairment was only shown at the higher doses⁠⁠33⁠, and it’s unclear how it would generalize to humans. (As well, many stimulants impair the hippocampus in mice & rats; ⁠caffeine⁠, for example.) there may be an interaction with diabetes: a small correlational study found a long-term correlation between nicotine gum and hyperinsulinemia & insulin resistance (an experimental rat study ⁠found the opposite⁠); and ⁠Axelssonet al2001⁠ found a short-term effect but only in diabetics, similar to ⁠Morganet al2004’s⁠ no acute effect in its (all-healthy) volunteers. (Unfortunately, most studies published since 1996 citing Eliassonet al1996 in Google Scholar are focused on tobacco products or smoking.) You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills. This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren’t worried at all. Given what I’ve read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown. Dependence Nicotine gum or patch use seems to be extremely rare among people who have not previously smoked (“never smokers”), which makes it hard to judge the risk of developing dependence, or the risk of developing dependence and then moving on to tobacco. An example of the rarity comes from ⁠Gerlachet al2008⁠: the authors examined a survey of n = 28,000; 8 never-smokers claimed use of nicotine-replacement therapy, but 6 self-reported tobacco use or had blood-levels too high or low - leaving just 2 (probably) valid examples. Etter2007⁠ ran an online (self-selected) survey on a smoking cessation website, receiving 848 responses; the 5 never-smokers (1 had smoked cigarettes before), reported dependence and one described it as self-medication for depression (see also ⁠Caldirolaet al2013⁠). Etter2007 described the background information on the rarity of never smokers, apparent absence of nicotine gum abuse, and generally low levels of dependence on former or current smokers: People who were addicted to the nicotine gum could easily find our questionnaire, because it was listed on top of the list in Google. In spite of this effective enrolment strategy, we identified only two never-users of tobacco among daily gum users, which suggests that NRT use in never-users of tobacco is a rare phenomenon. Similarly, a previous survey in people who responded to a newspaper ad that read: “Are you addicted to nicotine gum?” could not enrol any never smoker ⁠[5]⁠. Furthermore, there was no report of subsequent nicotine dependence in never smokers who were treated with nicotine for ulcerative colitis, aphtous ulcers and sleep-disordered breathing [⁠18⁠,⁠19⁠,20⁠,⁠21⁠]. The short-term effect of the nasal spray was also tested in never smokers, with no report of never smokers getting addicted to this fast delivery product [⁠22⁠,23⁠,24]. In a previous survey, 0.3% of adolescent never smokers reported past daily use of NRT, but none was reported as being addicted to NRT [25⁠]. However, some adolescents will endorse using any product when a list is presented to them, eg. 0.4% said they used a fictitious nicotine “Nic-T” product [26⁠]. In two surveys in the USA, 2.7% and 4.6% of school drug counsellors indicated that nicotine patches and gums were abused by adolescents, but these “NRT abusers” were mainly smokers who used NRT while smoking, and only 7% to 16% of these “NRT abusers” were never smokers [27⁠]. The latter study did not report any case of NRT dependence in adolescent never smokers [27]. Similarly, studies in representative samples of the UK and Swedish general populations found no never-user of tobacco among users of NRT [28⁠]. A review of post-marketing surveillance data in the USA found no report of primary dependence to the nicotine gum and patch,[29⁠] and only 39 cases of dependence on the nicotine gum were reported per million prescriptions to smokers, in surveillance data [⁠30⁠]. Therefore, addiction to nicotine gum in never smokers is probably very rare. Furthermore, there may be few adverse consequences of being addicted to the nicotine gum, except for the financial cost and the inconvenience of permanent chewing. In particular, NRT products are safe even in patients with heart disease, [31⁠,⁠32⁠] and there was no untoward effect of 5 years of nicotine gum use in the Lung Health Study [⁠33⁠]. Thus, long-term use of NRT is not known to be harmful. ⁠Etter2009⁠ yielded additional information: For instance, in U.S. national samples, 5 to 6% of nicotine gum users used it for more than the recommended duration of 3 months (Shiffmanet al2000; Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, & Burton, 2003a⁠), and in the UK, 9% of gum users in smoking cessation clinics used the gum for one year or more (⁠Hajek, McRobbie, & Gillison, 2007⁠). In a survey of 805 households that purchased the nicotine gum, 2% purchased it continuously for 6 months or more (Shiffmanet al2000). In clinical trials, up to 30% of patients use NRT products beyond the recommended 3-month period (⁠Hajek, Jackson, & Belcher, 1988⁠; ⁠Shiffman, Hughes, Di Marino, & Sweeney, 2003b⁠; Hugheset al1991a⁠; ⁠Steinberg, Foulds, Richardson, Burke, & Shah, 2006⁠; ⁠Johnson, Hollis, Stevens, & Woodson, 1991⁠; Hatsukami, Huber, Callies, & Skoog, 1993⁠; ⁠Hughes, 1989⁠). However, participants in clinical trials usually receive the gum for free, and having to pay for it decreases utilization (⁠Hughes, Wadland, Fenwick, Lewis, & Bickel, 1991b⁠). …Taking a substance over a longer time than intended is a criterion for drug dependence (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), but long-term use does not necessarily imply dependence, because dependence requires other criteria, in particular unsuccessful attempts to quit and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Post-marketing data from the U.S., reported by the manufacturers, indicated that only 39 cases of dependence on the nicotine gum were reported per million prescriptions (Spykeret al1996). However, the limitations of post-marketing surveillance data are well known (⁠Brewer & Colditz, 1999⁠), and survey data indicate that the prevalence of dependence on the nicotine gum in over-the-counter settings is substantially higher than that, at about 1% of ever users (Hugheset al2004). About one third of smokers report having ever used NRT products (Al-Delaimy, Gilpin, & Pierce, 2005⁠). Thus, even if only 1% of users became dependent on the gum, this would still represent tens of thousands of people…Even though some users may be dependent on the gum, it must be emphasized that there is no known adverse consequence of long-term use of NRT, except for the financial cost, and that the potential benefits (ie. prevent late relapse) far outweigh the drawbacks. This is probably why dependence on the nicotine gum has been generally downplayed in the literature (Westet al2000⁠ [see also Hugheset al2005⁠]). Siegelet al2011 found new e-cigarette users claimed large reductions in smoking due to e-cigarette use. Etter & Bullen2011⁠ found their e-cigarette users likewise used it as a smoking substitute. Dawkinset al2013⁠ ran an online survey of 1347 e-cigarette users; only 2 respondents were never-smokers and were not analyzed further. The current & ex-smoker respondents indicated less cravings & dependence on e-cigarettes than cigarettes, and to use them long-term as a substitute. A ⁠2016 survey by Scott Alexander⁠ of the online nootropics⁠ communities (primarily Reddit’s /r/nootropics⁠) had ~342 respondents on its nicotine-efficacy question and a subset answered questions about nicotine source & whether they considered themselves addicted, but not never-smoker status: About 35% of users reported becoming addicted, but this was heavily dependent upon variety of nicotine. Among users who smoked normal tobacco cigarettes, 65% reported addiction. Among those who smoked e-cigarettes, only 25% reported addiction (and again, since there’s no time data, it’s possible these people switched to e-cigarettes because they were addicted and not vice versa). Among users of nicotine gum and lozenges, only 7% reported addiction, and only 1% reported major addiction. Although cigarettes are a known gigantic health/addiction risk, the nootropic community’s use of isolated nicotine as a stimulant seems from this survey (subject to the above caveat) to be comparatively but not completely safe. One approach to estimating addictiveness of nicotine gum or patches is to borrow a strategy from Fagerstrom & Eissenberg2012⁠ in looking at the success of various studies’ control groups (using nicotine gums or patches) in quitting during those studies: The intention here was not to estimate the effect of the treatment but rather its placebo to determine how difficult it is to stop using a certain form of tobacco/nicotine product. Therefore, the success rate in the placebo group is used as indicators for difficulty abstaining. Table 2 shows that cigarette smokers, independent of treatment, show a success rate of roughly 10% with little variation (range 9.8-11.2). Those seeking to stop ST use have roughly more than double the success rate of cigarette smokers (range 19.1-33.0). In the study (⁠Tønnesen & Mikkelsen, 2012⁠), where 69 long-term users of pure nicotine mostly in the form of gum, in average seven years, a success rate of 36% was observed. Those who become long-term users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are recognized as heavy dependent smokers (⁠Hajek, Jackson, & Belcher, 1988⁠), which also seemed to be true in this study. Their cigarette consumption before quitting was 24.5 per day and their recalled FTCD score from when they were smoking was a high 6.7. It can be hypothesized that this type of smoker would have had no better success rate in stopping than the 10% seen normally but when coming off long-term NRT, it was 36%. The 36% was obtained from a 1-year follow-up. Several of the smokeless studies reported success rates from 6 months. It is of interest to note that the authors excluded long-term patch users since it would have been unlikely to see a difference between active and placebo treatment due to the ease by which they normally can stop. Moreover, it is much more infrequent to observe long-term patch use (Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, & Burton, 2003). It seems as a patch is not very likely to be able to support a compulsive use pattern due to its little behavioral involvement and or pharmacokinetic nicotine uptake pattern. The data in Table 2 lead us to conclude that quitting cigarette smoking is more difficult than quitting ST (Fagerström, Gilljam, Metcalfe, Tonstad, & Messig, 2010⁠) and, although there is only one study from the NR category, that quitting these products may be easiest (Tønnesen & Mikkelsen, 2012). What does this imply for any never-smoker (not predisposed to tobacco use) using nicotine gum/patches judiciously and self-monitoring for signs of dependence, well aware of the dangers of tobacco use? Given the lack of observations despite large datasets, the low rates of dependence in smokers, the ease of quitting nicotine gum, and so on, my personal opinion is that the risk of dependency should be much lower than the smoker risks of 1-20% and then the risk even lower of then progressing to tobacco use. (In considering cost-benefit, it’s worth remembering that tobacco use has been quit successfully by many millions despite the notorious difficulty, and that the health outcomes of quitters gradually heal⁠ to the baseline of non-smokers.) Conclusion So what’s the upshot? My reading has convinced me to at least give it a try and it has been useful (see the nicotine section of ⁠Nootropics⁠). The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it would still have been worth investigating.

Are they right? I don’t know. As deliciously contrarian as it would be to go around shocking people by seriously advocating tobacco use, it’s not a subject I’m interested in tackling. In philosophy, one is taught to not “try to prove too much⁠” (inviting people to modus tollens your modus ponens⁠), to not do more philosophy than one has to; in programming, you learn to not become an “architecture astronaut” solving some hugely abstract version of your actual problem - such overreach invites disaster. It’s much easier for me to defend use of nicotine, so that’s all I try to do: nicotine is pretty much harmless, the studies are clear, the relevant areas & studies comprehensible with not too much work, and I feel I can discuss it with a clean conscience. Really, about the worst you can say about pure nicotine use is that it might be a gateway to tobacco or that one’s blood pressure might increase, which are issues that can be easily addressed empirically via additional studies/surveys or by eg. measuring one’s own blood pressure after taking nicotine, respectively. But if I wanted to defend tobacco itself, I have abruptly expanded my task by orders of magnitude: now I need to deal with all the anti-smoking correlational studies, I need to defend an idiosyncratic interpretation of how the tobacco industry’s products have evolved over the last century, I need to defend not just nicotine but all the other substances in tobacco which might override its benefits, I need to explain why the nigh-universal consensus against tobacco is wrong and to give a historical account of how such an error could come into exist and then expand to be universal. This is an incredible amount of work; any one of these points represents more work than this entire article and plausibly more work than this entire site. One could (and men have) spent entire careers working on small parts of the puzzle just outlined. It’s also bad from the rhetorical point of view: defending tobacco requires me to engage in what looks like ⁠partisan⁠ ⁠politics⁠ & revisionist history. It is challenging beliefs that are, rightly or wrongly, deeply entrenched. Many people have enough flexibility to think, even if a relative died horribly of lung cancer, that nicotine was only the addictive stimulating agent and the real killer was the smoke or the tar or something, and so are willing to consider that nicotine - on its own - might be useful. They are not willing to consider the whole package. You can see the difference in the tasks by comparing this one page to the multiple threads in Imminst alone with scores of pages in each. One is short and clear and easily evaluated on its own terms (I hope), and has met with neutral or positive reactions from everyone I’ve asked to read it; the other comes off as a crank laying out an entire worldview, filled with ad hominems, bad faith, and clearly has not changed anyone’s minds. Remember Pareto’s observation⁠ about where most of the value in a subject comes from, and the value of your time! Without reason to believe tobacco has absolutely massive gains compared to nicotine alone (which there isn’t, even taking pro-tobacco claims at face value), it’s a very ⁠bad use of time⁠ to investigate tobacco. One should let sleeping fags lie. It’s generally assumed that the tobacco industry held off regulation for so many decades simply because it spent so very much on lobbying; but lobbying isn’t omnipotent (look at Prohibition). I think at least part of it is that the evidence is not as strong as one would expect; the main case comes from epidemiology, which has an execrable track record and many problems⁠. The great statistician Ronald Fisher⁠ has often been excoriated for testifying in favor of the tobacco industry and implied to have sold his soul for blood-money, but can we really be that critical when we ⁠read⁠ his arguments (background): There were fewer inhalers among the cancer patients than among the non-cancer patients. That, I think, is an exceedingly important finding. Of course, that could be true and also smoking still harmful. One major attempt to refute Fisher was Cornfield et al’s 1959 paper, “Smoking and lung cancer: recent evidence and a discussion of some questions”⁠. SNPedia⁠ lists ⁠9 studies correlating nicotine use with various genes & SNPs⁠. Nuance is not a goal of anti-smoking campaigns; hence a California Department of Public Health campaign defined its goals⁠ as The program combines an aggressive media campaign with community programs emphasizing three themes: That the tobacco industry lies; That nicotine is addictive; That secondhand smoke kills. and produces advertisements like image of syringe / caption: “Are you a nicotine junkie?” I was reading the Wikipedia nicotine article and thought that the figure cited for estimated American cases of ADHD⁠ caused by nicotine - 500,000 - seemed remarkably high and suspected it and the previous sentence were not about nicotine at all, but tobacco. I was partially right⁠: both were about tobacco, but also lead! Sloppy work even for Wikipedia. I don’t think that any malice was involved, just the general assumption that ‘nicbacco’ is harmful and the distinction between nicotine and tobacco unimportant. Another example is a breathless media article “Children Exposed to Nicotine in Utero Have Lower Reading Scores” on ⁠Choet al2012⁠: here we can’t blame the media or Wikipedia editors because the paper itself (a longitudinal correlational study) has “nicotine” in its title and abstract (a total of 8 times), though the abstract quietly mentions it is actually a study of “maternal smoking”, and so of little interest to anyone interested in nicotine because there are hundreds or thousands of confounding⁠ substances in tobacco smoke (on top of what smoking while pregnant says about the mothers in the first place, something which is only partially controllable for); the authors construct a sort of nicotine exposure index based on daily cigarette consumption & nicotine-content of brands, but as far as I can tell, they never analyze whether the results based on this index are the same as if they had analyzed it the same way for eg. total cigarettes smoked or total tar content. This is not to say that nicotine has no impact on developing brains (many useful drugs or stimulants are contraindicated for non-adults), but their results do not seem to warrant their description. I was amused in 2013 when a Pubmed alert brought me word of a 2013 paper led by Cho titled “Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance”; besides the title, the abstract uses the word “nicotine” 7 times and “maternal smoking” just 1 time - and replicates the above procedure yet again. With research like this, is it any wonder that ‘nicbacco’ is alive and well in phrases like “nicotine-stained”? ⁠“Science’s obsession: The search for a”smart pill”; Science has plenty of theories about how to enhance our brains. Journalist Dan Hurley tested those theories”⁠, Salon: “I understand that smoking is bad”, said Maryka Quik, director of the Neurodegenerative Diseases Program at SRI International, a nonprofit research institute based in California’s Silicon Valley. “My father died of lung cancer. I totally get it.” Yet for years Quik has endured the skepticism and downright hostility of many of her fellow neuroscientists as she has published some three dozen studies revealing the actions of nicotine within the mammalian brain. “The whole problem with nicotine is that it happens to be found in cigarettes”, she told me. “People can’t disassociate the two in their mind, nicotine and smoking. It’s not the general public that annoys me, it’s the scientists. When I tell them about the studies, they should say, ‘Wow.’ But they say, ‘Oh well, that might be true, but I don’t see the point.’ It’s not even ignorance. It’s their preconceived ideas and inflexibility.” A popularization is provided by ⁠Salon⁠: A study involving sixty-seven people with mild cognitive impairment, in which memory is slightly impaired but decision-making and other cognitive abilities remain within normal levels, found “significant nicotine-associated improvements in attention, memory, and psychomotor speed,” with excellent safety and tolerability….”…And we’ve seen absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. There doesn’t seem to be any abuse liability whatsoever in taking nicotine by patch in nonsmokers. That’s reassuring.” That’s not reassuring: it’s totally bizarre. Nicotine has routinely been described in news accounts as among the most addictive sub-stances known. As the New York Times Magazine famously put it in 1987, “nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or amphetamines, and for most people more addictive than alcohol.” But that’s just wrong. Tobacco may well be as addictive as heroin, crack, alcohol, and Cherry Garcia combined into one giant crazy sundae. But as laboratory scientists know, getting mice or other ani-mals hooked on nicotine all by its lonesome is dauntingly difficult. As a 2007 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology put it, “Tobacco use has one of the highest rates of addiction of any abused drug. Paradoxically, in animal models, nicotine appears to be a weak reinforcer.” That same study, like many others, found that other ingredients in tobacco smoke are necessary to amp up nicotine’s addictiveness. Those other chemical ingredients - things like acetaldehyde, anab-asine, nornicotine, anatabine, cotinine, and myosmine - help to keep people hooked on tobacco. On its own, nicotine isn’t enough. “Brain science, addiction and drugs: An Academy of Medical Sciences working group report chaired by Professor Sir Gabriel Horn FRS FRCP” (May 2008): The European Union ban on the sale of “snus” (a moist snuff product) is an example where regulation appears to have prevented access to an effective treatment for cigarette smoking. Snus has become widely used in Sweden, and has been attributed to causing a drop in cigarette smoking: only 17% of Swedish men smoke, whereas 19% of adult men are daily users of snus (Fagerstrom & Schildt, 2003). The use of snus has helped Sweden to become the only European country to reach the WHO goal of less than 20% daily smoking prevalence among adults by 2000. Fagerstrom K & Schildt E (2003). “Should the European union lift the ban on snus? Evidence from the Swedish experience”. Addiction 98, 1191-1195 “Brain science, addiction and drugs” 2008: Concerns about links between snus and increased risk of oral cancer or cardiovascular have not been confirmed by a large-scale epidemiological study (⁠Luoet al2007⁠). However, their data suggested that snus may be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer - with an odds ratio of 2.0, suggesting a lifetime risk increased from 1% to 2% (Luoet al2007). In 2004 the number of new cases of pancreatic cancer in the UK was 7,398 (Cancer Research UK, 2008). This increase is still much lower than the 15-fold increase in the risk of lung cancer attributable to cigarette smoking (38,313 new cases in 2004) (ibid). See also Fouldset al2003⁠, ⁠Rothet al2005⁠, RCTs are shamefully lacking, but offered for your consideration is “Daily TV quota of 6 hours could shorten life expectancy by 5 years”: Watching TV for an average of six hours a day could shorten the viewer’s life expectancy by almost five years, indicates research published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine⁠. The impact rivals that of other well known behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and lack of exercise, the study suggests. Sedentary behaviour - as distinct from too little exercise - is associated with a higher risk of death, particularly from heart attack or stroke. Watching TV accounts for a substantial amount of sedentary activity, but its impact on life expectancy has not been assessed, say the authors. They used previously published data on the relationship between TV viewing time and death from analyses of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), as well as Australian national population and mortality figures for 2008, to construct a lifetime risk framework. …Based on these figures, and expected deaths from all causes, the authors calculated that an individual who spends a lifetime average of six hours a day watching TV can expect to live just under five fewer years than someone who does not watch TV. These figures compare with the impact of other well known lifestyle factors on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease after the age of 50, including physical activity and obesity. For example, other research has shown that lifelong smoking is associated with the shortening of life expectancy by more than 4 years after the age of 50, with the average loss of life from one cigarette calculated to be 11 minutes - equivalent to half an hour of TV watching, according to the authors’ risk framework. The above TV risk may be from sitting; in ⁠another Australian study⁠, 8-11 or 11+ hours of sitting lead to mortality hazard ratios⁠ of 1.15-1.40 compared to the 0-4 hours of sitting group. One Imminst.org poster⁠ argues that “I don’t think that’s all there is to nicotine’s mode of action. Choline⁠ is counter-indicated for OCD and can make it worse, yet there’s many studies showing nicotine’s efficacy in treating even refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.” For the OCD studies, see ⁠Lundberg2004⁠, ⁠Pasquiniet al2005⁠, and ⁠Salín-Pascual & Basañez-Villa2003⁠ among others. I am generally a skeptic of any claims to boost IQ in healthy adults. I am a strong believer that fixing deficits like iodine⁠ can lead to real IQ gains, but almost always an initially promising intervention like creatine⁠ fades out with additional studies and reverts to no net effect - as has happened to dual n-back⁠. So I take this unreplicated study as being more evidence for the stimulating effect of nicotine rather than any genuine peak intelligence boost, in the same way that monetary payment can increase peoples’ scores on IQ tests - you wouldn’t say “the promise of money makes people smarter”, but rather, “the promise of money ‘enables’ people to work harder”. Attention is a recurring keyword; seems to be how it exerts many of its effects—“Cognitive effects of nicotine in humans: an fMRI study”⁠, Kumariet al2003: To elucidate the neural correlates of cognitive effects of nicotine, we examined behavioral performance and blood oxygenation level-dependent regional brain activity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during a parametric “n-back” task in healthy nonsmoking males after the administration of nicotine (12 ug/kg body weight) or saline. Nicotine, compared to placebo, improved accuracy (P ϭ 0.008) in all active conditions (2%-11%), and had a load-specific effect on latency (P = 0.004; 43.78% decrease at the highest memory load). Within a network of parietal and frontal areas activated by the task (P 300 µg/kg (figure 1); they give ⁠a reference⁠ that 180-320 µg/kg for rats is similar to some unspecified amount of smoking in humans.

It requires sustained, repeated consumption, like any physically addicting substances. And research has shown that different people have different propensities for addiction (same with cocaine and alcohol).But if you do become addicted to nicotine, and are one of the people with a high propensity for nicotine addiction, you&#x27;re fucked. It&#x27;s one of the most challenging addictions to quit, as we all know. Is this a risk you want to take for some mild stimulation? As a former smoker, I can only believe that anyone who takes this risk does not fully appreciate the consequences. The exception might be people who have consumed nicotine on and off but have never had addictive tendencies. Those people definitely exist, but it still seems like a risky thing to assume about yourself since being wrong could be life altering.I also take exception to the articles emphasis that moving on to cigarettes is the only real risk. Yes, that&#x27;s where the majority of the health problems come from. But don&#x27;t underestimate the negative consequences of a physical addiction, even one that does not lead to health problems. It is not fun to be addicted to anything that contorts your body and mind outside of your control. reply anbende 15 hours agoparentResearch anecdote here. I’m a psychologist in a different area and a friend who did his PhD in cocaine research with rats told me this.Addiction is highly dependent on the immediacy of the drug’s effect on the brain. For this reason, people who smoke cocaine (directly or as crack) are highly likely to get addicted. It may be the majority. People who snort it are less likely to get addicted. And there are a lot of casual cocaine users (snorting) who do not develop a long term life altering addiction. I believe he (researcher friend) said it was 10-15% who go on to become addicted. Still substantial and dangerous but much less than smoking.His research was looking at delayed onset of cocaine in rats after they pushed their cocaine lever. At longer delays more and more rats showed little interest.This is part of the overall addiction picture. Decoupling drug use behaviors (smoking, snorting, and lever pressing) from noticeable drug onset prevents reinforcement of the behavior and makes addiction less likely, often much less.This would explain why nicotine patches and gum would potentially be much less addictive than cigarettes. reply bilsbie 14 hours agorootparentI’ve never heard this idea. It seems like coffee bucks this trend though? I’ll take 20 minutes to drink a cup but still wildly addicted. reply baby 14 hours agorootparentI don’t think people are addicted to coffee in the same way they’re addicted to cocain reply GordonS 13 hours agorootparentAgreed. I drink coffee because I like the taste and the caffeine gives a little boost. I could be said to be dependant on caffeine, as I get withdrawal symptoms on cessation (headaches) - but I feel no compulsion to drink coffee, as there would be with addiction. reply standardUser 13 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;d be surprised! Some people have as hard a time quitting coffee as they do nicotine. And lots of people do coke and never become addicted. It varies a lot from person to person, which is a fact that is underappreciated. Luckily, there is a lot of research now to support this. reply friend_and_foe 15 hours agoparentprevI used to smoke cigarettes for many years. Over a decade. In the last few years of smoking, I tried to quit numerous times, trying to replace it with vaping because nicotine is what I&#x27;m addicted to, right? So I shouldn&#x27;t have that hard a time, it&#x27;s about breaking the physical habit not the drug addiction since I&#x27;m not quitting that. Often I would go a few months. The last failed attempt, withdrawals gave me panic attacks well into 3 months in. So I gave up, got some cigarettes, a year later I tried again and succeeded, I&#x27;m a few years smoke free.I&#x27;m still addicted to nicotine, I vape. But I wake up, where my vape is is not the first thing I think about. I dont plan my day by how much nicotine I have left. When I get under the weather I can give it up for a few days with no problem. This is not the same addiction I had when smoking cigarettes, this is a milder, more casual thing, I don&#x27;t get cravings, I get these small little desires for a puff. Whatever is going on with cigarettes, nicotine is only a small part of that. Quitting cigarettes is one of the hardest things I&#x27;ve ever done, I could not vape for the rest of the day and only feel a mild annoyance. In my experience the article is correct, there&#x27;s something more going on with cigarettes than just nicotine. reply api 14 hours agorootparentThe obvious question is whether there are other addictive compounds in cigarettes. I’ve heard stories like yours before. reply rapjr9 8 hours agorootparentDo some web research on the additives in cigarettes. What I have heard from people who do research into cigarette addiction is that the additives suppress the bad effects of smoking (such as coughing, lungs feeling burnt, not being able to breath, etc.) When you stop smoking you also stop getting the additives and you suddenly feel all the damage smoking has been doing, which makes it much harder to quit. You literally feel like hell when you stop. reply friend_and_foe 14 hours agorootparentprevThey say there are MAOIs in tobacco that increase nicotine uptake, but I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that that&#x27;s the sole culprit either. I could chew some tobacco right now, or smoke a pipe or cigar, I could even inhale it, and I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem. If I were to smoke a single cigarette I&#x27;d be smoking a pack a day within a week and who knows how many months or years it would take me to rectify that. Whatever it is I suspect it&#x27;s done deliberately in processing. reply kallistisoft 11 hours agorootparentTobacco contains Harmaline which is an MAOI - it both increases the bioavailability of nicotine as well as adding an additional psychoactive effect; stimulant + anti-depressantI&#x27;ve recently started adding free base harmaline to my vape juice to create a proper tobacco substitute...

If you become addicted to nicotine via smoking tobacco, then you&#x27;re possibly fucked, but nicotine by itself is nowhere near as dangerous for health, it even has some benefits for well-being.I don&#x27;t know why you take exception to some people or articles emphasizing the above, or that cigarettes are the major risk. It&#x27;s mostly true and addiction by itself specifically to a cheap, easily available substance like nicotine, which doesn&#x27;t devastate daily functionality or economic solvency as many other narcotics do, is not terrible by itself. reply rudasn 3 hours agorootparent> nicotine by itself is nowhere near as dangerous for health, it even has some benefits for well-being.So, recently I had to learn that nicotine is super toxic and can be lethal or at least severely damaging to internal organs, especially for children, toddlers, babies, small animals (dogs, cats), etc.Maybe Google it, or ask your doctor, if your assumption that \"by itself is nowhere near as dangerous for health, it even has some benefits for well-being\" stands. reply rodent_rodeo 1 hour agorootparentAre you referencing like pure nicotine liquids? Yeah vape juices that smell like jelly donuts, if a toddler&#x2F;animal drinks a month supply in a few minutes it’s going to be bad news. Also, when people were mixing their own juices they’d be buying pure nicotine and getting poisoned.“The dose makes the poison.”Anyways, not going to list out all the pros and cons of nicotine as Andrew Huberman did that for us. He has a decent podcast that’s goes through it all.No one really argues that it’s essential or beneficial in every way but it’s not the purported demon that the anti smoker lobby has made it out to be.Many years ago, I heard the Japanese even put it into their drinks.

Can any Japanese knowledgeable people confirm or deny this? reply dieselgate 11 hours agorootparentprevI understand what you&#x27;re saying and have mixed feelings. My opinion is that a nicotine addiction is terrible no matter how it&#x27;s consumed but smoking tobacco is the most harmful way to consume.I was able to switch from chewing tobacco to nicotine pouches and gum but still feel the addiction is terrible. reply throwbadubadu 15 hours agoparentprevAs a former smoker I think you didn&#x27;t fully read the article und understood author&#x27;s and other&#x27;s thesis that it is actually not the nicotine that makes for the strong cigarette addiction. reply dageshi 14 hours agorootparentSo I have some personal experience with nicotine in different formats. Cigars (not inhaled) and zyn packets you slip under your lip.My experience is that nicotine is highly addictive based on dosage and delivery.Cigars were in no way addictive, I suspect because the delivery of the nicotine takes quite a while.The zyn though, I quickly ramped up from low dosages (1-3mg) to the higest dosages (10mg+). And at my worst I&#x27;d go through a 20 pack of those per day.I tried quitting cold turkey multiple times from the zyn, failed each time. Tried slowly decreasing strength till I reached 3mg and then quit, that worked fine and was actually relatively easy.I still smoke cigars, they just don&#x27;t trigger the same reactions that the zyn did. reply dieselgate 11 hours agorootparentStrongly agree with the slow decrease method. One of the nice things about nicotine pouches&#x2F;gum is they come pre-dosed so it&#x27;s pretty simple in how to ramp down. Doing it is the tough part.For more fine grained decreases I&#x27;ve used the 3mg, then 2mg, then split up pieces of nicotine gum (2 or 4 mg) to get down to like 1 and .5 mg doses. reply dageshi 1 hour agorootparentI actually quit over the course of a week. Going from 10mg+ pouches down to 9, 6, 3 and finally quit.Going from 3mg to no longer using was relatively straightforward.Trying to quit from 10mg cold turkey was basically impossible. 4 days after going cold turkey I was still absolutely desperate for nicotine. The difference was massive. reply standardUser 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is no such thing as a cigarette addiction. Nicotine is the addictive chemical in cigarettes. Yes, method of consumption matters, but if you regularly consume an addictive chemical you are at risk to develop an addiction to that chemical, regardless of method (though not necessarily regardless of quantity). reply nrclark 15 hours agorootparentYou might be overlooking a chemical conditioning element. A smoker gets a dopamine hit every time they take a pull from their cigarette. The smell, the sizzle, and the routine - all become associated with a reward pathway.Nicotine is the chemical that causes this, but the addiction is far more than just nicotine alone. reply standardUser 13 hours agorootparentAs I just said in another comment, the fact that people can maintain their nicotine addiction with vapes or patches or gum shows that the primary addictive substance is nicotine and it can be effectively addictive all by itself. reply dieselgate 11 hours agorootparentDo you have personal experience with a nicotine or tobacco addiction? Many of us may agree that nicotine is the _primary_ addictive substance but there are other considerations. It&#x27;s not one size fit all and everyone is an individual. reply darkerside 14 hours agorootparentprevExactly. What is the chemical element in a smartphone addiction? Or a pornography addiction?What a shortsighted and close minded comment (talking about parent). reply throwbadubadu 14 hours agorootparentprevNot really right.. but again you also either didn&#x27;t read the article, didn&#x27;t get the point, or strongly object it? (And also ignore authentic experiences other people give here)? Beyond nicotine, which is addictive yes, there is more in the cigarette cocktail (especially in nowadays highly optimized industrialized ones) that is also addictive. So there is such a thing as a cigarette addiction.Or in other words: Why do people only get little addicted and can easily stop chewing nicotin gums, while for only a small percentage of smokers it is possible to quit via the nicotin gum replacement?Or in even other words: Both coffeine and heroine are addictive, but we can agree that there are differences? reply standardUser 13 hours agorootparentThird time I&#x27;m writing the same comment - nicotine addiction can be formed and sustained without tobacco. This is obvious. reply bilsbie 14 hours agorootparentprevYou seem pretty confident about this despite there being thousands of chemicals in cigarettes and presumably the companies being very interested in hooking their users. reply standardUser 13 hours agorootparentLots of people manage nicotine addiction with the patch or gum or vapes.

Addiction absolutely is.Addiction (substance use disorder) exists when a person exhibits two or more of the following symptoms: (1) impaired control, (2) social problems, (3) risky use, and (4) physical dependence.Impaired control means using more of a substance or more often than intended; or wanting to cut down or stop use but not being able to.Social problems includes things like neglecting responsibilities and relationships, abandoning activities the person used to care about, or failing to fulfill obligations at home, school or work - because of the substance use.Risky use includes things like using in risky settings, continued use despite known problems, engaging in risky substance-related practices like sharing needles, risky sexual activity (because of, or in order to obtain the drug), and driving while intoxicated.Physical dependence is needing more of the substance to get the same effect, or having withdrawal symptoms when a substance isn&#x27;t used.Two or three symptoms indicate mild substance use disorder. Four or five symptoms indicate moderate, and six or more indicate severe substance use disorder. When people talk about addiction, they are typically referring to severe substance use disorder.Physical dependence and tolerance are not the same as addiction. Substance use disorder is by definition problematic. reply huytersd 7 hours agorootparentThat’s just generic boilerplate addiction literature. None of those apply to nicotine. It’s cheap, legal and doesn’t have enough of an effect to be a public disorder risk. No one is committing domestic violence or impaired driving while being purely “hopped up on nicotine”. The most you might get is someone holding up a store to incidentally steal cigarettes while they go for what’s in the cash register, but that’s about it. reply trogdor 5 hours agorootparentI didn’t say anything about nicotine. You wrote that “Being addicted isn’t bad in itself.”That is incorrect.Addiction is bad by definition.That is what I was replying to.What you are brushing off as “boilerplate” are the DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder — colloquially known as addiction. reply huytersd 3 hours agorootparentWe’re clearly talking about nicotine in this thread. Your boilerplate addition did nothing to address anything about a nicotine addiction. Not all of them are the same- there is a stark difference in being addicted to caffeine and being addicted to heroin. Copy pasting information without context adds nothing useful. replyegnehots 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m concerned that many might miss the nuance and subtlety of the main issue:- Nicotine IS really addictive when distributed through common uses (smoking, vaping).Yes, if the absorption is progressive and in small dosages, the addiction is less severe, but this is not useful for smokers who want to quit and presents a dangerous introduction for others reply insanitybit 18 hours agoparentI have zero interest in cigarettes though. So like, let&#x27;s say I started chewing a gum and then I became addicted to the gum. I&#x27;m assuming the downside here would be primarily withdrawal effects of not chewing the gum? It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to be a gateway to cigarettes for me. You&#x27;ll experience caffeine withdrawal too, so I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s really a problem.From the article,> There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted,That is to say, it does not seem to present a dangerous introduction for others, assuming you mean an introduction to cigarettes. reply OfSanguineFire 18 hours agorootparentIndeed, there are loads of occasional-cigar smokers out there who have zero interest in smoking cigarettes, and in between the times they feel they can afford a quality cigar, simply do not smoke at all. reply nickstinemates 5 hours agorootparentI just had my first cigar the other night at 38.

It&#x27;s a completely different thing in my mind. reply jtriangle 18 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotally, I&#x27;ve accidentally quit vaping several times, because I don&#x27;t vape when I&#x27;ve caught a cold and that&#x27;s coincided with me needing to buy supplies.I&#x27;ve gone back to it because I find it enjoyable, but, having watched my father quit smoking several times, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever had withdrawals like that, or really at all.So my theory is, really, that cigarettes and tobacco in general is far more addicting and therefore far more bioactive than just consuming nicotine is. reply nannal 17 hours agorootparentI have quit cigarettes successfully (for ~10 years now) and found it wasn&#x27;t too difficult. However, I have known people who could quit indefinitely and pick it back up without issue and people who are going through rounds of quitting, returning, quitting and so forth.I personally believe there are additional elements involved that could be genetic or psychological. reply pawelwentpawel 17 hours agorootparentI used to both smoke and extensively used pure Nicotine (gums, sprays etc.)In my opinion, majority of the people who are stopping Nicotine (not just smoking) approach it as an incredibly hard challenge. The process is demonised and described as something that is really hard to complete. That&#x27;s exactly what I would like people to think if I&#x27;d be to work in a marketing department for tobacco corporations.While there is a longer story behind it, I quit cold turkey in March this year. This time was much easier - I didn&#x27;t approach it as something that is hard to do. While this might sound banal, I focused on what am I getting out of it, not what I&#x27;m loosing. Everything, from my gums to my muscles got better.Nicotine in its pure form is definitely great brain stimulant, I&#x27;m still a big fan. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost, both from financial and health perspective to use it often. reply jihiggins 16 hours agorootparentprevcigarette smoke also has a bunch of other stuff, including MAOIs. it&#x27;s definitely not _just_ the nicotine. iirc, cigarettes also have additives to make the nicotine hit harder &#x2F; cross the blood brain barrier faster, which probably doesn&#x27;t help reply saila 14 hours agorootparentprevI was an occasional smoker for over a decade and only got addicted to nicotine when I started vaping. It&#x27;s more anecdata, but I don&#x27;t think vaping is any less addictive than smoking cigarettes, and for many people vaping will increase their likelihood of addiction just because it&#x27;s easier to vape unnoticed and there&#x27;s no natural stopping point like there is with cigarettes.I&#x27;ve also temporarily quit nicotine and caffeine when I got sick, and I think part of the reason is that the withdrawal effects are less noticeable and&#x2F;or maybe you attribute them to the illness. Also, if you get sick enough to take time off from work, that tends to coincide with the worst withdrawal effects, which last about three days in my experience. reply dml2135 16 hours agorootparentprevI dunno about that. Personally, I smoked cigarettes for about 5 years, then quit for about a decade, and then picked up vaping a few years ago.I’m definitely just as addicted to the Juul as I ever was to cigarettes, if not more so, and it definitely seems like it will be harder to quit. Cigarettes are so gross it’s almost a benefit, you need to go outside to smoke, the vape is just so easy and so much cleaner, I’ve definitely found it much harder to cut down. reply xorbax 16 hours agorootparentMy friends who took up vaping (esp in pandemic) ended up vaping near-constantlyIt&#x27;s not the 80s, so vaping allows one to sit around the house and duff it in a way that most people wouldn&#x27;t do with cigarettes.I feel like nicotine intake can dramatically increase with vaping. reply jtriangle 14 hours agorootparentMathwise it&#x27;s about 6mg of nicotine adsorbed per cigarette. That gives you a way to compare dosage of nicotine to vaping a certain concentration of juice.Probably not a great 1:1 because there are other things in play with smoking, but, ballparky enough.If you wanted something closer, you&#x27;d need to figure out how the other compounds in cigarette smoke affect nicotine adsorption and activity. reply reactordev 18 hours agorootparentprevThe withdrawal effects are more like kicking a heroin addiction. reply jdietrich 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not really sure whether I can or should dispute your basic point, but I will say that pharmaceutically pure nicotine is radically different to tobacco smoke.People who quit smoking are actually quitting a synergistic cocktail of drugs - nicotine and a variety of MAO inhibitors found in tobacco smoke. There is good evidence to suggest that these MAOI components dramatically increase the addictiveness of nicotine.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S01618... reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn&#x27;t sound true. reply reactordev 18 hours agorootparentTry it then.

I decided not to buy a pack that day and then never bought another pack. That&#x27;s my anecdotal contribution to the discussion.Less anecdotally:Opioid withdrawal, in extreme cases, has killed people from persistent vomiting and diarrhea. It has measurable physical symptoms with an understood pathophysiology largely connected to the cAMP-signaling system.Nicotine withdrawal is far less understood, to the degree it has been classified at all (mostly in studies of mice). It certainly has never killed anyone, you&#x27;re not going to shit yourself to death.

Coffee is everywhere, cheap, and consumption is all but encouraged. If I were to smoke I take on all sorts of baggage. Much of smoking is about being a smoker which is a mindset and community that is hard to leave. Social effects can be much stronger than physical dependence. reply Turing_Machine 16 hours agorootparent> For me, quitting smoking was easier than quitting coffee addictionOperative phrase here: \"for you\". reply trmonx 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, but only because nicotine is cheap, easily available, won&#x27;t cause any real immediate problems or drain your bank account.As a substance its no where near as addicting as heroin, no one would actually ruin their lives for nicotine in case it was illegal and expensive. reply insanitybit 13 hours agorootparentprevThat is not surprising.a) The downsides to smoking are far longer term and harder to feel dailyb) You&#x27;re surrounded by smokers, you can literally smell them smoking just by walking down the streetc) Smoking is legal. You can just go buy a pack.I am unsurprised that quitting smoking is harder for some people, given that. But in terms of withdrawal symptoms, that&#x27;s where I think heroin is probably worse. But I also don&#x27;t really know. So far someone linked a Google search and an irrelevant paper. reply incrudible 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is different from withdrawal being worse. Opiate withdrawal can be rather severe from a physical standpoint. Nicotine withdrawal simply is not. reply meepmorp 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s somewhat person dependent.

Took like four full days for cravings to go away.Haven&#x27;t had a cigarette in 10 yrs. Occasionally enjoy a cigar without problems reply retrac 16 hours agorootparentprevI was terribly addicted for a decade, smoking and then vaping, and for me, withdrawal was almost intolerable. For about three days, it was a terrible experience. I felt sick, raged with anger, cried, felt unhinged, and even had minor visual disturbances. It can really only only be compared to a bad psychedelic trip. But once I did manage to get through it, that was it. It hasn&#x27;t much bothered me since. Stopped thinking about smoking about a week after. I can&#x27;t say I crave it really, and I cannot relate to the long-term experiences where people say it takes months or years to get fully over it. We&#x27;re all different. reply reactordev 17 hours agorootparentprevI also believe it’s the duration of use and not the concentration of use that plays more a role here. Being a heavy smoker for 4 years isn’t the same mentally as someone who smoked normally for 20 years. I think past the 10 year mark and your brain has suffered damage to the point where the addiction becomes life. However, in about 10% of cases, smokers who quit were able to because the effects of nicotine addiction hadn’t taken hold. Much like some people feel nothing from taking cocaine.IANAE though.Either way. I was a smoker but not a heroin user and quitting was the hardest thing for me.

If you were used to something like Zyn & tried a cigarette, you probably wouldn&#x27;t even like it that much in my opinion. It may kick in significantly quicker, but there&#x27;s also substantially less nicotine in a cigarette vs a nicotine pouch and it would probably leave you dissatisfied and annoyed at the bad taste in your mouth. reply petesergeant 18 hours agoparentprevI used gum to come off vapes, and I still use gum.

To me any use beyond this small period is just not efficient, performance wise.I used to smoke a pack a month, last year i discovered this pouches from a Swedish friend (he was talking about the under-average incidence of lung cancer there). I got hooked, and it was really bad to quit. Yes its not like its crack&#x2F;heroine and ill go steal or stop showering, but i had sever trouble sleeping (of course i slept with them many times).

Just awful.All said, I don&#x27;t think nicotine is a wise thing to mess with. Vaping especially to me seems like a slippery slope because it kind of gives the vibe of a kind of \"consequence-less\" interaction with the drug. If you smoke a pipe or cigar, you stink, you might get a headache, and it actually costs quite a bit of $$. Vaping is set up to seem like this casual entertainment with few consequences.

(I never got addicted and never had any problem quiting cold turkey; I smoked because it was great social relationship builder - some of my best friends are people met on cigarette breaks).Sometimes I use nicotine gums &#x2F; patches as a dieting aid (effective appetite suppressant).And I want to warn against this premise of short half life. This is not true in general. There are active metabolites like cotinine with elimination half life of 20h+, depending on your liver enzymes, gender, ethnicity.If I chew a nicotine gum around noon, I have trouble sleeping the whole following night with my brain unable to calm down, mild jaw clenching etc.So yes, moldafinil is a terrible stimulant due to too long half life, but so is nicotine (for many).

Prone to fits of paranoia and delusions of a grandiose conspiracy - which they were the only people who could see the truth.Later, on of my fellow IRC opers followed this path, I gave strict warning that it was hubris to believe himself smarter at drug use for brain optimisation than the scores of admittedly intelligent people who came before. He (much) later would become unhinged and fly cross continent to find me at my irl work location where he threatened my mother.He was incoherent most of the time and dropped out of university.So, forgive the hesitance, but I am even more hardened on the notion that we should probably not mess with our brains too much. I know some people must be pioneers to understand what works but I always took “YOLO” as a warning and not as a reason to throw caution to the wind.That said, I am a heavy user of caffeine in adulthood and I am more susceptible to pressure on drinking alcohol now. So I will admit to being hypocritical when it comes to the socially acceptable brain altering drugs.NB: Nicotine itself is addictive mostly because it has such a long half life, it stays in the body for multiple weeks; so if you decide to take this advice, make sure you wait at least a fortnight between doses. reply yojo 17 hours agoparentI think it is useful to draw a distinction between “new” nootropics and those with hundreds of years of demonstrated use.While nicotine has not historically been used in isolation, it has been used both in recreation and religion settings for around 2000 years.

Definitely. Is it \"too much?\" well, perhaps you think so. Is drinking coffee \"too much\"? Apparently we both agree that it is not \"too much\", I&#x27;m drinking some caffeine right now.One thing about Choline and Caffeine is that they are very well studied, especially in terms of safety. The further you go into the nootropics world the less studied options you&#x27;ll find - things range from \"zero data\" to \"used for 1000s of years by an unscientific people\" to \"animal studies exist\" and beyond.My personal \"too much\" is when there&#x27;s a combination of weak evidence to support benefits and weak evidence to support safety in humans. reply dijit 18 hours agorootparentWell said.I think that is definitely a strong and salient way to think about mind altering chemicals. reply financltravsty 18 hours agoparentprevI would say that&#x27;s a sampling bias, considering the type of people that frequent IRC.

And you don’t want to have something like nicotine withdrawals slowing you down when you’re hitting a yellow like my interview which was a disaster. Having quit amphetamines, coffee, and nicotine multiple times, it’s not that bad, but it’s still a hassle and there’s never a good time and you’re better off eliminating as many hassles as you can from your life imo.I definitely think the more addictive than heroin line is likely not accurate for nicotine itself but I’ve never been addicted to heroin so idk. I actually still think about starting it up again sometimes even though it’s been 15 years since I quit, maybe 3 since my last lozenge, but overall this experiment for me is concluded and nicotine is something I’m better off living without. reply whalesalad 14 hours agoparentprevSwedish snus is my preferred delivery mechanism. reply pasquinelli 17 hours agoparentprevi wonder why the author needs stimulants so much. reply ThrowAway1922A 17 hours agoparentWhy not?

I wouldn&#x27;t have commented to disagree with a statement like \"nicotine&#x27;s addictiveness is exaggerated because it&#x27;s conflated with tobacco&#x27;s addictiveness\", but that wasn&#x27;t what goodluckchuck said reply goodluckchuck 18 hours agorootparentprevAddiction is complex. Folks are generally addicted to a combination of things. For example they’ll do a particular drug, sit in a particular environment, with or without a social element, with or without food.

Absolutely, but not because it contains nicotine. reply bumby 18 hours agorootparentThe articles seems much more inconclusive than your comment implies. On one hand, yes, they point out that MAOIs may be confounding. But they also say:“additional work since 2002 has clearly shown that nicotine alone does have some addictive properties”And, frustratingly, they point out that addiction effects can’t be parsed out using smokers because of the confounding effects of other chemicals present in tobacco yet they quote a study using smokers to support the non-addiction claim. reply Findecanor 18 hours agorootparentprevIf nicotine wasn&#x27;t addictive then kids who never used tobacco wouldn&#x27;t get hooked on vape, which they do. replytrident5000 18 hours agoparentprevNicotine is just terrible for you. Smoking is linked to alzheimers and I watched my grandfather smoke his pipe and decline cognitively with that disease. Im not sure if its only proven from the toxins in smoke or the nicotine but I would assume constricting the blood vessels (with nicotine) leads to plaque buildup in the body and brain.Because of the vessel constriction is stops healing in the body as well all the way to your bones dealing with microfractures and remodeling.That said, Ill have the occasional cigar. reply carlmr 18 hours agoparentIsn&#x27;t caffeine a vasoconstrictor as well? Wouldn&#x27;t that make coffee a silent killer? reply vik0 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t get how so many people like coffee. I&#x27;ve tried it maybe a handful of times in my life, getting the type that my friends said is great, and I&#x27;ve always found it to be reminiscent of dirty water, that is, water that has been contaminated with dirt.Why do so many people like it?My friends say they like the taste, but I don&#x27;t believe them. I think it has to do with them being coerced into liking coffee at a young age, and now they&#x27;re addicted to it because of its caffeine content.I come from a country (Macedonia, ruled over by the Ottomans for more than 500 years. The Ottomans liked their coffee) where every going out with friends is centered around coffee. So when people want to hang out, they never, ever, say stuff like \"Hey, let&#x27;s hang out\", but always \"Let&#x27;s drink coffee\" (I understand people in the civilized world, people say stuff like this too to hang out with friends, particularly in America (I&#x27;m not familiar with Western Europe as I haven&#x27;t lived there, though I assume its similar to the US), but not like they do here, and the surrounding regions.)And when you do go out to hang out casually with friends, it&#x27;s always to a fucking cafe because they want to get their daily dose of caffeine in, because they&#x27;re totally not addicted to it.(The overwhelming majority of people here go to cafes every day to drink coffee with their friends, who also drink coffee. It&#x27;s become something like a ritual for them at this point.)When I hang out with my friends in a cafe, naturally as their sacred ritual insists, and I order anything other than coffee, which I always do, other than those 2 times, they look at me like I&#x27;ve just committed the mother of all sins.I apologize for my off-topic rant, but I had to get it off my chest. reply laurentlassalle 16 hours agorootparent> My friends say they like the taste, but I don&#x27;t believe them.

Maybe I&#x27;m in the minority but I really enjoy the taste (strong espresso without sugar&#x2F;milk) and really dislike the caffeine content (always prefer decaf, if available). reply jrmg 15 hours agorootparentAlso a daily coffee drinker.I have a theory that humans like _complexity_. I’m pretty sure I didn’t originally like coffee (or e.g. scotch), but I do now because part of my brain really enjoys analyzing the flavor.It’s a different enjoyment than e.g. donuts or bananas, which just ‘taste good’. Coffee (and whisky) ‘tastes interesting’ to a degree that overcomes the initial harshness.So GP is sort of correct for the most basic interpretation. They’re just not appreciating that enjoyment and liking are not always straightforward. reply pasquinelli 17 hours agorootparentprevi can&#x27;t taste cardamom. when i taste freshly ground cardamom it&#x27;s like eting a pinch of sand.maybe you have something like that going on with coffee.i&#x27;ll say i had no interest in coffee until i tried it in my early 30&#x27;s and really enjoyed it, though i found the caffine too strong. now i drink it every day (smaller cups though.) point being, i wasn&#x27;t made to like coffee at a young age, and i&#x27;ve liked it ever since i started drinking it. reply aappleby 16 hours agorootparentprevCoffee is delicious and worsens my arthritis.

I know people who drink a very large amount of coffee, who “can’t function” without it, and who generally seem to be in a pretty bad shape.The behavior of a certain segment of the population with regard to coffee looks a hell of a lot like the stereotypical addictions to drugs, including just ending up in bad shape. Totally anecdotal of course but “caffeine in large amounts bad” aligns with a lot of human behavior. reply radicaldreamer 18 hours agorootparentCoffee is linked with significant health benefits for most people, but it isn’t the caffeine that responsible.Coffee has a significant amount of antioxidants and Is the most significant source of antioxidants for many people. Even decaf coffee has health benefits. reply dist-epoch 18 hours agorootparentprevCaffeine physiological addiction is very light.

Caffeine does indeed constrict blood vessels and thats probably not great tbh. But people (including myself) love their cup of coffee. reply goodluckchuck 18 hours agoparentprevYou mean smoking is terrible for you. As the cited studies indicate, nicotine itself (delivered by patched &#x2F; gum) is fairly harmless. Not completely risk free, but nothing at all like smoking. reply steeleyespan 18 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s some studies suggesting nordic Snus (like all natural chew w&#x2F;o chemicals added) is fairly harmless. Anecdotally I&#x27;ve read people highly addicted to it, so very suspicious of any claim that nicotine itself isn&#x27;t addictive and just smoking is. reply Findecanor 18 hours agorootparentSnus is quite common in my country, Sweden. Many users are former smokers who \"quit\" by using snus instead as their source of nicotine. Users I know have said that they feel that it is highly addictive.Studies of snus users have indicated increased risks of cancer in the mouth, throat and gastrointestinal system but have not been conclusive as to how. There&#x27;s also a newer type of snus not made from tobacco, with pure nicotine as a separate ingredient, but it has been studied much less.Nicotine is still widely considered harmful for the cardiovascular system though. I&#x27;ve had two surgeries this past year and been told to not even chew nicotine gum for a week before because of how nicotine in my system could lead to complications. reply steeleyespan 17 hours agorootparentIt appears there are some conflicting studies, like with everything.My best interpretation is that nicotine itself probably isn&#x27;t the-worst-thing-ever if it was restricted to occasional usage, like having a beer on the weekend.It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to make a habit of though like with coffee.There&#x27;s a theory floating around that it may help with long-Covid symptoms, but there&#x27;s not a lot of evidence. This may be in part due to the general opposition towards tobacco as extremely unhealthy.I only heard of this because a neighbor says using nicotine gum restored her sense of smell.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC9845100&#x2F;Again, anecdotally I had a relative, very heavy smoker, who got Delta and had very mild symptoms. She&#x27;s 80 and in pretty poor health.

I&#x27;ve wondered if the psychological part of nicotine addiction is much stronger when there&#x27;s a smell&#x2F;taste association with the drug effect. (I&#x27;m not a smoker, just seen a couple hints suggesting this.) reply jddj 16 hours agorootparentIt does. It has a slight burning sensation on the gum (salt?) and has an earthy &#x2F; spiced flavour.You don&#x27;t taste it much unless you consume beer&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;water at the same, but if so the right brands and combinations can be quite pleasant.They also make menthol ones. reply goodluckchuck 18 hours agorootparentprevThat computes with this article which discusses the addictiveness of naturally occurring MAOIs found in organic tobacco. reply trident5000 18 hours agorootparentprevNo, I mean nicotine as I clearly indicated in my comment.

    "originBody": "What is this? win-vind provides a lightweight hybrid UI system of CUI and GUI for Windows. By installing this tool, you will be able to control the Windows GUI in the same way as Vim. 1. Vim-user friendly. All configuration methods and mode concepts are derived from Vim, allowing for Vim-like UI operation. Vim users only need to understand win-vind’s macro features and additional mode concepts with little learning cost. 2. There are many useful built-in commands. You don’t have to worry about complicated scripts and dependencies like with traditional key binding tools. You can freely create user-defined commands by combining low-level optimized built-in commands. 3. Very portable and fully open source. win-vind is a small single binary with no dependencies that runs with user permissions. It is also available from the command line as a command for UI operations like $ win-vind -c \"ggyyGp\". Top Feature Demo Configuration File Example You can configure it in .vimrc style. What you can do in .vindrc is switch options, set parameters, remap low-level keys, and define function bindings. \" options set shell = cmd set cmd_fontsize = 14 set cmd_fontname = Consolas set blockstylecaret set blockstylecaret_mode = solid \" bindings imap{} inoremap inoremap inoremap noremap:! gvim noremap:e http://example.com enoremap t ggyyGp autocmd AppLeave *autocmd AppEnter,EdiNormalEnter vim.exeLicense This software is provided by MIT License.",

Unfortunately, querying AT-SPI2 for all buttons takes too long in complex apps. And even if it was fast, many apps (especially non-GTK ones) implement accessibility poorly or don&#x27;t implement it at all, so I abandoned the project.I guess it would be possible to make a framework specific implementation, for example by replacing the GTK shared library with a modified version, but that&#x27;s too much effort and I lost interest in the whole &#x27;mouseless&#x27; thing anyway. reply mpaepper 56 minutes agoparentprevWow, does something like this exist for Ubuntu as well? reply godelski 42 minutes agoparentThere&#x27;s a bunch of things like i3wm.
