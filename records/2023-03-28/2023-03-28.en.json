        "content": "Comments on Hacker News discuss Windows' practice of showing tabloid news and push notifications to users, with some criticizing the OS for deviating from its core purpose and others pointing out that the feature is aimed at serving Microsoft's business interests by collecting user data for targeted advertising. Some users express frustration with the many issues they face when using Linux, including driver problems, package manager bugs, and reduced battery life, while others note the advantages of using open-source software that allows for greater customization and programming of the user interface. Overall, the comments reflect a diversity of opinions about the pros and cons of different operating systems, with users highlighting their individual preferences and experiences.The comments section discusses the pros and cons of various operating systems (OSs), including Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS. Some commenters prefer Ubuntu or other Linux distros because they offer more customization options, while others prefer the familiarity and ease-of-use of Windows. The discussion touches on issues like stability, hardware compatibility, and the learning curve associated with different OSs. Some commenters criticize Windows for being bloated or prone to errors, while others point out that Linux can be more difficult to set up and maintain. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of using the right tool for the job and finding an OS that suits your needs and preferences.The article discusses various users' experiences with different operating systems, primarily Linux, Windows, and MacOS. Some users praise Linux for its stability, ease of use, and lack of bloatware, while others criticize it for occasional driver and application issues. Windows users complain about slower performance, shortened battery life due to background processes, and frequent crashes, although some prefer it for its compatibility with mainstream software. MacOS is noted for its stability and longevity, with some users reporting using the same machine for nearly a decade without needing significant repairs or upgrades. The discussion also touches on device lifespan, electronic waste, and the ongoing debate around privacy and spyware in mainstream operating systems.The text discusses the challenges of using proprietary video drivers in Windows and Linux, with commenters sharing their experiences. The introduction of AMDGPU was seen as a major development, providing a full-featured, performant and open driver, but others commented on difficulties with installing Linux, including the need to use the terminal, reduced battery life, general UI clunkiness and issues with video drivers. Some commenters preferred Windows due to hardware support and ease of use, while others preferred Linux for its reliability and community support. The discussion highlighted the ongoing tension between proprietary and open-source software and the importance of choosing the right tool for individual needs.The discussion revolves around the stability and usability of Windows and Linux operating systems. Some users point out that Windows update causes issues such as breaking the system, reducing laptop battery life, and bootloader woes, while others argue that Linux can be unstable due to driver and package management bugs. Users suggest different ways to fix these issues, including using Pop OS, running Linux in a virtual machine, or trying out different Linux distributions such as Archlinux, Linux Mint, and Fedora. The discussion also touches upon the history of Linux adoption and how Ubuntu gained popularity as a desktop operating system.The discussion revolves around the benefits and drawbacks of using Linux and Windows as an operating system for desktop computers. While some users prefer Linux due to its open-source nature, constant improvements, and stability, others prefer Windows due to its ease of use, compatibility with hardware, and broad software support. Additionally, some users find Linux to be in a constant state of churn, requiring constant configuration and troubleshooting. Windows is praised for its backwards compatibility and strong driver support, which makes it easier for users to switch between different versions of the OS without encountering significant issues. However, others disagree, citing that unstable drivers are a common issue on Windows machines. Overall, the discussion highlights the subjective nature of choosing an operating system and the different considerations that go into the decision-making process.The user generally has to do nothing to make their hardware work on a Linux desktop, except in cases of vendors who refuse to supply the information needed for Linux drivers. Not all Linux drivers are free of bugs or feature deficiencies, but they are mostly considered reasonable or high quality as they are written or reviewed by the kernel community. Gaming on Linux has improved due to the WINE community and the efforts of Valve. The discussion also touches upon the issues that arise for hardware compatibility on Linux, such as having no plug-and-play support for input devices like joysticks and steering wheels, the difficulties encountered in running certain AAA games, and how BSD could replace Linux in certain situations.A user on HN complained about constant BSODs following the purchase of a new Windows gaming laptop. Other users commented that they have not experienced such issues, suggesting that the user may have a hardware fault or misconfiguration. They also noted that forced reboots may occur once a month during the monthly update cycle. Some users recommended using Linux for non-gaming activities and dual-booting for video editing or Windows-only gaming. Others mentioned that Proton, which uses WINE to run Windows games on Linux, had come a long way in recent years. They also discussed the challenges of gaming on Windows, such as issues with ultrawide/dual/triple screen setups and shader compilation.Gamers are divided over the latest Windows 11 update, with some claiming that the operating system is \"explicitly anti-user\" and others pointing out that Linux still has some way to go in terms of usability. While some are critical of Windows 11's news section, which they say is intrusive and a violation of their consent, others say that it could be made more useful if it came from trusted sources and was easy to switch in and out. Linux gamers say that while the open-source operating system is \"almost there\" in terms of gaming, it still has issues with VR, performance and compatibility with some multiplayer games. Meanwhile, one Windows user says that despite its flaws, they'll stick with Microsoft's OS for gaming because \"it just works\".Comments on an article about the integration of news feeds into the Windows operating system highlight frustration with unwanted features and advertisements. Some users note that they have switched to Linux or are considering using gaming consoles rather than Windows. Others suggest using third-party software to remove unwanted features, while some comment on the benefits of telemetry in Windows. Some commenters note their preference for Windows over other operating systems, but express annoyance with intrusive advertising and unremovable features. The comments suggest that Windows users are frustrated with unwanted features and advertisements, and are seeking ways to customize and control their operating systems.The article discusses the writer's experience with various window managers and their preferences. While they appreciate the flexibility of AwesomeWM, they note that it is not particularly user-friendly and that some community widgets may have memory leak issues. They prefer the more practical and solid foundation of i3wm, which allows them to replace undesirable components easily. The comments section touches on the limitations of Linux as a gaming platform, with some users noting that while progress has been made in recent years, Windows still offers the most compatible experience for gaming. Despite this, some users argue in favor of Linux and the benefits of using a free and open operating system. Overall, the discussion centers on the trade-offs and preferences of different operating systems and window managers.The discussion centers on whether Linux is a viable gaming platform. While some users argue that it is, citing platforms like Steam Deck and improvements in Wine and Proton, others point out that there are still gaps in game support and performance, particularly with anti-cheat measures. The list of top most sold PC games on Steam in 2021 and 2022 is analyzed to see how well they work on Linux. While some popular games like CS:GO work well, many others have issues, particularly with online multiplayer and Windows-only anti-cheat measures. The discussion acknowledges that it depends on the user's perspective and the types of games they are interested in, with some users willing to make the transition to Linux and others preferring to stay with Windows for gaming.The debate revolves around the degree of compatibility of Linux with PC gaming. One user argues that the vast majority of top-selling PC games only work on Windows, thus leaving Linux with only a small portion of the market. Another user counters that the number of games that play well on Linux is much higher and that some actually run better on Linux than on Windows. The discussion also touches upon issues with anti-cheat and DRM software that can create additional hurdles for Linux gamers. However, one user asserts that their experience with gaming on Linux has been generally positive, with most games working out of the box. The conversation reveals differing opinions on the degree of acceptability of missing out on certain titles and the importance of being able to play AAA multiplayer games online.Microsoft's search and widgets sections on Windows are filled with distracting and low-quality tabloid news, which has caused frustration for users. The news comes from Microsoft's MSN content network, which syndicates content from various publishers. Although some publishers are reputable, others are less so, leading to questionable news appearing on the search bar and widgets section. Some users have pointed out that it can feel like looking at the magazine rack in a supermarket checkout line. Users can turn off the search box's \"search highlights,\" although they are enabled by default, and unfortunately, not all headlines can be removed from the weather widget. However, the content in the widget board can be blocked from particular news sources, or users could remove the weather icon.Windows 11 by default comes with the widgets board, which displays headlines and other items when users click or hover over the weather icon on the taskbar. The board takes up a significant amount of screen real estate and can be distracting. Users can disable the widgets by selecting \"taskbar settings\" and turning \"widgets\" off. Users who want to limit the amount of trashy or misleading headlines on the widgets board can select \"hide stories from...\" or \"fewer stories like this\" from the \"...\" menu on a story block. Users can also remove news from new tabs in Edge by selecting \"content off\" under the content menu in the settings gear in the upper right corner.",

        "title": "Critics Slam Apple's iCloud Keychain for Limitations and Poor User Experience",
        "url": "https://cabel.com/2023/03/27/apple-passwords-deserve-an-app/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35329950",
        "content": "Users are criticizing Apple's iCloud Keychain for its user experience flaws on Windows and limitations on Mac. A user of the system since switching from the LastPass password manager, said they have found iCloud\u00a0Keychain to be a subpar product on Windows, with many limitations when it comes to storing passwords. Additionally, the tool is generally tied specifically to Safari on the Mac, meaning that if a different browser is used, saved passwords are not available. The interface for the tool is also described as buried in system settings, and difficult to find. While the product is a good option for those who purely use Apple products, users report limited benefits on other operating systems.\nUsers report difficulty finding the Passwords settings option on Apple devices. While Siri can be used to open Passwords, the option is often not visible in the Settings menu. Apple's Spotlight search also struggles to find the settings. Users with Windows devices report a lack of integration with Keychain and Apple's password management tools. Passkeys, a new feature that bypasses passwords and requires biometrics, is seen as offering little improvement to the situation by locking users into an Apple ecosystem. Some users also suggest that the lack of streamlined password management is part of Apple's strategy to push customers towards using its own password manager within Google Chrome.Apple may benefit from putting more weight behind a cross-platform toolkit to support services growth, according to an HN comment. While Apple has previously supported some successful Windows apps like iTunes and Safari, their experience was sub-par and unpopular. However, if Apple were to develop SwiftUI for Windows, as they have for iOS and macOS, apps could be more consistently designed and ported between platforms. Apple could use this technology to support Windows versions of popular services like Apple Passwords, with consistent features and user interfaces familiar to users regardless of the particular platform. The HN comment also suggests that burdening Windows developers with native components could limit feature development, giving Apple cause to pursue a cross-platform approach.The article discusses the limitations of Apple's password management system and the challenges of using Chrome, Edge, and Firefox on Mac. Many users find it annoying to direct people to the Mac app store and deal with Apple's reviews before each release. Additionally, the article notes issues with Apple's password sharing feature and a lack of compatibility with other browsers. Users have also raised concerns about vendor lock-in and the poor user experience of Keychain Access. Nevertheless, some users appreciate Apple's cloud services and trust the company, making them willing to tolerate the limitations of the system. Overall, the article offers a mixed assessment of Apple's password management system and its compatibility with other browsers.Users discuss and critique Apple's Keychain password management feature. Some users note that while it is a good product for those who use exclusively Apple products, it lacks cross-platform compatibility and its GUI is difficult to navigate. Additionally, some users express frustration with the lack of password sharing supported by Keychain. Others suggest using alternative password managers such as Bitwarden or 1Password, which offer more robust features, including the ability to share passwords among family members. Despite criticisms, some users appreciate the convenience of having their passwords synced across all their Apple devices.Users discuss the benefits and drawbacks of password managers in a HN thread. Some users recommend 1Password or Bitwarden for securely sharing passwords among family members. Others express concern over security and prefer to use disconnected systems like Apple's password manager, which only works on iPhones and is seen as a secure enclave. However, some users point out vulnerabilities like recent iPhone unlocking scams and advise using separate apps like KeePass with a unique master password. Overall, users emphasize the importance of good password hygiene and highlight the convenience and security benefits of using a password manager.The user misses the physical rear sensor on their Pixel 2 and the haptic feedback it provided. They found it incredibly reliable and would pass the phone to a passenger in the car to unlock without looking. They question the ease of breaking and the collision rate of Face ID. Apps can choose to tie keys to the current set of enrolled biometric credentials, and some react poorly to a change of the biometric set. Users want password managers that are available on multiple platforms and don't force them to use a single manufacturer's products forever. Some users believe that Apple's implementation of passwords means they may be phasing out passwords entirely, but others find the system confusing. The keychain access is not an app and there is no way to reference a password when Safari doesn't recognize a password field.Apple\u2019s built-in password management system is underrated, claims Cabel Sasser in a blog post. The system is tied to the Keychain Manager, which means that few people know it can be used to autofill 2FA verification codes, store backup codes in the Notes field, and import passwords from other password managers. Sasser suggests that Apple should release a standalone app for passwords, accessible from a toolbar icon in Safari and equipped with a full UI, and stick to the feature set,\u00a0which users already have across all their iOS devices. While he highlighted that third-party password apps will still exist, he believes that Apple should provide a baseline feature of intuitive, easy-to-use password management for all its users.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35321994",
        "content": "A proposal by a Swedish VPN provider, Mullvad, that would force all politicians in European Union countries to submit to continuous 24/7 audio and video surveillance is almost certainly not suitable for a democratic society. Political corruption is a problem in Europe, but this proposal represents a violation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy; it would also be highly impractical to implement. Being subject to the law does not necessarily entail being recorded constantly in a Minority Report-style system. The EU would do better to look at measures that would increase transparency and accountability, such as lobbying reforms, expanding access to information and reducing legal or bureaucratic barriers to exposing government or corporate malfeasance.\nThe discussion includes comments about the lack of trust in politicians and the need for more transparency in their decision-making. Some argue that current political negotiations occur behind closed doors to facilitate compromise, but others suggest that it has resulted in a lack of progress. One proposed solution is for politicians to be held accountable through personal scrutiny and loss of privacy. However, others argue that this is not a practical solution and instead suggest implementing a system similar to \"code being submitted for review and being subjected to human + automated checks.\" A few commenters also bring up topics unrelated to the main discussion, such as personal hygiene and the corruption of politicians.The article discusses the challenges public servants face in dealing with un-informed feedback from the public due to a lack of effective feedback mechanisms. The author argues that many government processes are fundamentally broken in terms of information processing and not necessarily due to the common trope of lazy government employees. It suggests that, in order to operate effectively, a government should process citizen input in a way that is consistent with budget constraints and laws, using the principles of system design, failure analysis, and testing. The article highlights that democracy doesn't function well when too many people are simultaneously uninformed and yelling, and proposes various solutions to improve the situation, including greater transparency, intensive monitoring of politicians, and Athenian-style ostracism by public vote.a proposal by the European Union seeks to ban end-to-end encryption, which would give authorities complete access to all online communications. The proposal would also require companies to scan all content for illegal material, including copyrighted material and extremist material. Critics argue that this would not only hinder privacy but also infringe on free speech. The proposal stems from the European Union's efforts to crack down on various online crimes, such as child pornography and terrorist propaganda, but opponents believe it goes too far and could lead to abuses of power. Some also suggest that the proposal is intentionally extreme in order to make a more moderate proposal seem more palatable.The \"Door in the face\" concept, likened to the opposing idea of \"Foot in the door,\" is discussed by Charlie Munger as part of the \"reciprocation tendency.\" Robert Cialdini's study of \"\u00abask for a lot and back off\u00bb\" forms the basis for \"Door in the face.\" KennyBlanken points out that in the US, Republicans field regressive policies on welfare programs, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, and immigration, shifting the ultimate compromise closer to their desired outcome. The policy proposals are also aimed at appealing to their voter base for support. Maxilevi expresses frustration at the European Commission's annual \"dumb\" and authoritarian proposals, leading to active resistance campaigns. The commission, unlike democratic institutions, does not serve public interests nor represent the public. When it comes to repealing laws, they give the impression they're only accountable to themselves, making it exhausting for citizens.The discussion revolves around the difficulty of a country leaving the EU in case of a perceived existential threat. The conversation raises questions of authoritarianism and undermines the notion of democracy. The EU is accused of exercising soft power through the control of local politics and law enforcement, replacing governments, and interpreting referendums. The conversation details instances where the UK was supposedly threatened by the EU and points out the lack of an army does not mean the EU cannot use other forms of punishment. The conversation touches on the corruption of the press by leaving and remaining biases. Additionally, the conversation points out that local politicians are often sent to the EU by local governments as a way to remove political opponents from domestic politics.The discussion centers around the democratic deficit in the European Union (EU), with some commentators arguing that the European Commission is an autocratic reservoir for conservative politicians that are unwanted in national politics. The EU Parliament is the only directly-elected institution that represents EU citizens, and every EU citizen has the right to vote on it every five years. However, some individuals raise concerns that democracy is diluted when the electorate becomes too large and diverse, and suggest that decisions should stay as local as possible. Others argue that a higher level entity is needed to ensure that mutual agreements and shared legislation/taxes/military, etc. can be established properly for the greater wealth of everyone in the long run.",

        "content": "The CFTC has sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, accusing them of allowing U.S. customers to buy and sell digital assets without registering with the agency. The agency has requested a court order to freeze Binance\u2019s U.S.-based assets without delay. In response, several threads on Hacker News discussed the case, with some users pointing out how damning some of the evidence was, including the use of \"I CAN HAZ CHEEZEBURGER\" style writing in internal communications about illegal activities. Others commented on the mentality of some crypto bros who reject governmental oversight and anti-money laundering measures out of a supposed belief in financial freedom, while ignoring how such behavior contributes to criminal activities such as money laundering and fraud.Employees of cryptocurrency exchange Binance allegedly devised a complex corporate structure to evade US regulatory oversight, according to Forbes. Dubbed \u201cTai Chi\u201d, the purported initiative involved setting up a Delaware-based company that would ostensibly serve as a distraction from Binance\u2019s real business, allowing the US arm to operate with a clean bill of health. An internal slide deck obtained by Forbes reportedly details how the system worked in practice, including the practice of routing US customers to the Delaware entity. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has denied the allegations, calling the Forbes report \u201cFUD\u201d (fear, uncertainty and doubt). US regulators have been cracking down on digital currencies, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Binance of providing unregistered securities.Comments on a news article about the recent charges against Binance Holdings Ltd. suggest skepticism about the evidence of the exchange company's support for terrorism and Russian money laundering. Some comments ridicule the claims that Binance deliberately financed Russia and Hamas, while others point out that legal action is always a slow process that can take years before criminal trials lead to jail sentences. Another line of skepticism questions the CFTC's evidence for the claims but focuses more on how the case has been reported than on the content of the charges. One commenter argues that underestimating the risks that a company like Binance faces for support of terrorism is a serious mistake. Another commenter links the experiences of HSBC execs with what could happen to Binance's leadership: fines and investigations may take place, but it is also possible that no one will go to jail.Commentary on a news article about the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charging cryptocurrency exchange Binance Holdings over alleged trading violations with US-based customers, including Americans who illegally bought and sold derivatives linked to Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies. Many of the comments involve discussions around the legality of knowingly facilitating criminal activity, as well as criticisms of the US government's involvement in regulating a Chinese company handling a $600 transaction. Some commenters also argue that the CFTC's allegations against Binance may lack crucial context or evidence, and that the accusations are part of a broader trend of scrutiny and pressure on the cryptocurrency industry by regulatory bodies.Comments on a Hacker News thread discuss the legality of Binance's actions in aiding alleged money laundering and sanctions violations. While some argue that the line between legal and illegal actions is blurry, others point out that aiding specific criminal activity with knowledge and intent is indeed illegal under anti-money laundering laws. Comments also touch on the strict legal regime financial institutions operate under, where the mere suspicion of criminal activity can trigger regulatory obligations. Additionally, some criticize the lack of professionalism in the financial industry, while others note that AML laws can be overly restrictive and potentially discriminatory, obligating institutions to report even the slightest suspicion of criminal activity.Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has been accused by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of illegally offering cryptocurrency derivatives trading to US customers. The CFTC has filed a criminal indictment against the platform and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The indictment alleges that Binance sought to evade US regulations by encouraging US customers to use virtual private networks (VPNs) and by setting up a complex corporate structure with entities around the world to evade detection. The indictment also alleges that Binance did not register with the CFTC, as required by law, and did not implement anti-money laundering processes that would have been necessary for its trading in the US. Binance denies the charges.Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, is facing allegations from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it illegally offered futures transactions to US customers. The CFTC alleges that Binance enabled the evasion of US regulation by serving US customers illegally, disguising certain customers as foreign nationals by requiring them to have a VPN or a straw man nominee. Additionally, Binance is accused of failing to report suspicious trading activity and has been linked to money laundering and terrorist financing. Commentators have raised concerns over the overreliance on financial institutions to enforce complex regulations such as anti-money laundering laws. However, others argue that cryptocurrency exchanges have a responsibility to comply with relevant laws and regulations to avoid facilitating criminal activity.The recent CFTC action against Binance, accusing the exchange of violation of rules on ring-fencing and futures trading, was not primarily intended to protect investors or curb terrorism financing, but seems to be aimed at restraining the exchange's business in the United States. A widely held view is that the CFTC's case is actually a disguised attempt to shut down a global cryptocurrency exchange, which is not regulated by any single state or country. Although the CFTC has justified its lawsuit by stating that Binance violated state-run regulations, the case continues to raise questions about regulators' motives. Most of the responses to the lawsuit on Hacker News are skeptically critical of the CFTC's actions, with many questioning its motivations for the suit.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Binance, accusing the company of operating an unregistered derivatives exchange for US customers. The CFTC lawsuit referenced a \"pattern of regulatory violations by Binance,\" including operating illegally in the US and failing to put adequate safeguards in place against money laundering and fraud. Binance has denied the allegations and has issued a statement saying that it operates legally in all jurisdictions where it is active. The charges come as regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges intensifies worldwide.",
        "summary": "The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued Binance for allowing US customers to trade digital assets without registering with the agency, and for illegal trade and corporate evasion. Binance allegedly employed a complex corporate structure named 'Tai Chi' to evade US regulatory oversight. Binance CEO denies the allegations.

        "url": "https://www.darkreading.com/risk/employees-feeding-sensitive-business-data-chatgpt-raising-security-fears",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35330438",
        "content": "Employees are reportedly feeding sensitive data to AI language model ChatGPT, despite concerns over data security. These concerns are compounded by OpenAI's storage and use of the data, which has been the subject of data leaks. While some businesses restrict their use of ChatGPT, many others do not, and there are worries that the AI could become a target for exploits. Commenters suggest that the benefits of using ChatGPT, such as increased efficiency or reduced labour costs, must be weighed against the risk of data leakage. OpenAI asserts that data submitted through its API will not be used for model training. However, some critics argue that cybersecurity is a more significant concern than the supervised language model becoming autonomous.Multiple users discuss the risks of using ChatGPT for sensitive information, with some arguing that it is a \"horrible exploit waiting to happen\" and should be blocked. Others defend the tool, pointing out that it saves time and can be used for non-sensitive tasks like writing boilerplate code or explaining technical concepts. Some users bring up the risk of bad actors using ChatGPT to leak confidential information, while others point out that this is a broader problem than just this tool and is ultimately due to a lack of awareness about what constitutes confidential data. Overall, the discussion centers around the balance between productivity and risk when it comes to using AI-generated text.The combination of address and search bars has led to potential leaks of internal URLs to search engines like Google, according to some users on HN. While search engines and URL bars are not typically blocked in the workplace, this poses a potential security concern for sensitive information. Classroom use of OpenAI's language model for chat GPT-3 has been cautioned against by some due to the risk of data leaks. While many may suggest manually scrubbing sensitive data, there needs to be a technical control to minimize the risk, rather than an \"awareness only\" approach. Blocking access to a few services where people may inadvertently include sensitive data is not optimal as people will just find other ways. The use of AI models like OpenAI is expected to increase productivity, but it's important to balance this with security concerns.Comments on a Hacker News thread discuss the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for corporate use, particularly its impact on privacy and data security. One commenter points out that companies often trust third-party services, like Gmail, with sensitive information, but only after those services release enterprise versions with strict security and privacy controls. Others raise concerns about ChatGPT's use of user data for training and the potential for confidential information to be leaked through the AI's probabilistic model. Suggestions include creating an enterprise version of ChatGPT with clearer privacy policies and allowing for the option to train the AI on local data rather than public chat data. Some commenters argue that the fears are overblown, while others stress the importance of data privacy in corporate use.The use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, has sparked concerns about data security and privacy. Companies that use ChatGPT to store sensitive data are at risk of losing control over their information once it is on the third-party platform. Some people have compared the concerns with those surrounding Gmail when it was first released. Others argue that a private version of ChatGPT is essential to provide a safe way for people to use the tool. Those who use ChatGPT may not see the harm caused by data leakage, which could lead to accidental sharing of company secrets with third parties. One anonymous user claims that a developer on their team uses ChatGPT extensively, and the rest of the team is waiting for that person to get caught and fired.Various comments discuss the enforcement of smartphone bans in secure areas, such as at government contractors, TSMC, and Samsung. One comment mentions that at TSMC, smartphones are banned in many areas, and are policed through metal detectors. Additionally, one response describes how Samsung allows phones in office areas after tweaking them, but subjects them to multiple security checkpoints before entering the fab. A separate conversation discusses the potential risks of using AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot, as they require giving access to code and sensitive information to third-party companies. However, there is some debate about whether these risks are significant, especially considering that people in secure environments accept restrictions all the time. Some people suggest that it may be more secure to host AI tools internally, but others mention that this is often not feasible or scalable.The discussion thread centers around the potential use of layers of models to give more control over AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The topic of the security risk of inputting sensitive information into these systems is also addressed, with some debating the level of fear or trust they have in certain companies like OpenAI or Google. The potential for data leaks and spreading of false or biased information through these AI systems is acknowledged, with some suggesting that the answer may lie in creating more secure, corporate-friendly tiers or levels of access to these models. Overall, the discussion highlights the intricacies and challenges of working with AI and the need for caution and data protection measures.Concerns have been raised over employee use of OpenAI's GPT-3 chatbot after a report revealed that over 4% of employees were submitting sensitive business data and privacy-protected information to the large language model (LLM). There are fears these employee inputs could find their way into the LLM's models and be retrieved at a later date due to lack of adequate data security. Companies are beginning to advise against employee use of these generative AI services, with JPMorgan already restricting workers' use of ChatGPT. Further risks come from the fact the model can collect far more information than users may realise and some have suggested including prohibitions in employee confidentiality agreements and policies to prevent employees inadvertently exposing confidential or proprietary information.The given text identifies a company registered in England and Wales with the company number 1072954. The company's registered office is located at 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG.",

        "content": "Play.ht, a text-to-speech synthesis platform, has launched a latest model, Parrot, which can clone any voice with a few seconds of audio and generate expressive speech from text. The model also captures different English accents well, allowing non-English speakers to speak in English while preserving their original accent. Existing text-to-speech models are lacking in expressiveness, control or directability of the voice. Play.ht aims to solve this across all languages. The voices are built on Large Language Speech Models (LLMs), which can express emotions based on the context of the text. The platform offers two ways to use the models: a text-to-voice editor and an API. Users can create and manage their audio files in projects through the editor, while the API provides streaming and polling. Play.ht was initially built for listening to books and articles online, but the founders then decided to train their own models for business purposes.Play.ht, a start-up offering voice cloning services, has invited members of the public to try a beta version of its tech for free. Users are asked to read a script, which the system uses to capture the nuances of their voice, and the software then synthesises speech in that voice. The service could be used for an audiobook, podcast or similar. Voice cloning could also be used maliciously or scamming-by generating fake content, for example. In response, Play.ht claimed that it had \"many mitigations in place to increase the safety of this service\". \"We have auto moderation on the user-facing platform and malicious text gets blocked and flagged,\" said a company spokeswoman.A new demo by Play.ht features a speech model that can mimic any voice with only a 5-second recording. However, there are concerns around its misuse for creating deepfake voices or voice phishing attempts. Some users feel that warnings and safety measures akin to fire extinguishers and hazmat labeling get in the way of innovation, whilst others raise concerns about criminal and civil liability, especially since the technology is not fully mitigated for targeted attacks. Despite the controversy, others are celebrating the technical achievement and revelling in how it captured late loved ones' voices. The developers declined to respond to questions about how the technology's potential misuse would be tackled.Users are discussing the potential uses and implications of a new artificial intelligence tool, Play.ht, that can generate audio recordings of text in the voice of a chosen person after only 20 minutes of training on their existing recordings. Some see a legitimate use for generating audio versions of written works, such as audiobooks and e-learning content, while others express concern about the potential for misuse, especially in creating deepfake audio that could be used for nefarious purposes. Discussions also cover the possibilities for virtual puppet software and reducing costs of voiceovers in video games. Some express reservations about using the tool to recreate the voices of deceased loved ones, citing ethical concerns.Users of Play.ht, a text-to-speech platform that can generate audio that sounds like a person\u2019s voice, have discussed the potential for the technology to be used in scamming. The platform\u2019s creators stated they have measures in place to prevent users generating harmful speech, but admitted that Voice Cloning Tech will ultimately battle an increasing number of countermeasures. Users suggested it should be a matter of time before open-source versions of the technology are available, necessitating alternative solutions to protect against fraud. Some were working on developing these countermeasures. One user suggested a future where verification is necessary to conduct business, but another noted that criminals can beat hardware-based authentication \u2013 an arms race would be inevitable. For now, education could be key to addressing potential scams associated with the technology.Play.ht, a text-to-speech (TTS) technology start-up, has recently released an UltraRealistic TTS API that will soon be added to their standard news API. A few options are included, such as rate, voice guidance, and temperature for voice control, but for the most part, the emotion of the voice remains dependent on the text. Latency, however, remains an issue, since real-time TTS is not yet available. Concern over the use and development of the technology, with the potential for scams and abuse, has led to a broader discussion of regulation in the industry. Proponents of TTS praise its potential for good, such as dubbing foreign-language films, while critics argue that it can be easily used for less benevolent purposes.The risk of abuse and misuse of AI voice cloning technology is being debated in a Hacker News thread. Some contributors see a need for blockchain to provide verifiable hashes to images captured on cameras that would ensure authenticity. In contrast, contributors caution that AI voice cloning technology poses grave risks, enabling anyone with a vocal sample of another person to create a replica of their voice that could be used in voice phishing scams. Others suggest there may be useful applications, citing the example of people who are hard of hearing that miss hearing the sound of a deceased loved one\u2019s voice. The moderators point out that use cases are mixed, leading to a need to find safe ways of deploying the emerging technology.The debate is raging over the ethics and potential misuse of voice cloning technology. One issue is that these AI-generated voices can be produced cheaply and scaled up easily. Some argue that the technology can be used for good, like if a person loses their ability to speak, they could use voice cloning to continue communicating. However, others point out that it can be used for illicit purposes, such as impersonating someone's voice to commit fraud. Some suggest that regulating the technology may be futile, and others believe that making it illegal could at least mitigate some harm. Ultimately, the existence of this technology means that we must accept both positive and negative outcomes.There is a debate around the ethical implications of using AI technology to clone human voices. While some argue that it could revolutionize industries like voiceover work and improve accessibility for those with disabilities, others warn that it could also facilitate impersonation scams, fraud, and disinformation campaigns. Concerns have been raised about the potential for scammers to use the technology to clone voices and trick people into giving away sensitive information or money. The debate centers on the balance between the benefits and risks of the technology and whether regulation is necessary to prevent illegal uses. While some argue that banning all legal uses won't prevent the illegal ones, others argue that it's the only way to limit the risks of the technology.",

        "content": "John Glenn's use of a $40 camera during his orbit around the earth forced NASA to rethink the role of photography in space missions. This story caught the attention of a robotics mentor who shares a similar anecdote about his team's use of a GoPro in their design process. Another commenter shares how NASA adopted the use of video cameras during a Mars rover mission after being inspired by a small sports camera purchased by a deputy project manager for his daughter. The comments reveal the importance of creativity, trial-and-error, and learning from outside sources in the engineering and technology fields. They also highlight the value of low-cost but innovative solutions in solving problems.The cost of photography equipment is often a topic for debate, with some arguing it was always an expensive pursuit and others noting that there were many cheap mass-market options available. In a discussion on HN, one user noted that many popular cameras, such as the Kodak Pony 135, were cost-optimized models with meniscus lenses and guillotine shutters that produced less-than-stellar images. While today's expensive, top-of-the-line cameras get a lot of attention, many of the cheap models from the past have been lost to \"survivorship bias.\" However, even these cheap models proved popular for their time, allowing the masses to capture and share memories with friends and family.The Space Shuttle was versatile but expensive, as it had to return to Earth at the end of every mission. The Soviet Buran copied the project without the solid rocket boosters (SRBs). NASA's plan before politicians' interference would have been even more incredible. However, the SLS is also bogged down by politics and still uses SRBs. NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services inadvertently funded the successful SpaceX, despite its actual priority being the Constellation Series - Ares and SLS: Orion. Photography media tends to emphasize the technical aspects of photography over the artistic ones. Still, photography is about artistry and composition rather than the camera's technical specifications, as a camera from the 60s can produce beautiful pictures as long as the photographer has a basic understanding of photography.The article discusses the use of a $40 camera on astronaut John Glenn's Mercury mission, which he used to take the first handheld photographs of Earth from space. The camera was modified by NASA to include a pistol grip, a larger shutter button, and a cable release mechanism. The article also explores the camera's automatic exposure mechanism, which was an innovation in the field of photography. The comments section expands on the cost of the camera in today's dollars, as well as discussing the technical aspects of photography and the value of more accessible and affordable equipment. One comment notes similarities between the modifications made to Glenn's camera and modifications made to cameras used on later shuttle missions.In the 1960s, a $40 drugstore camera purchased by astronaut John Glenn played a significant role in shaping the future of space exploration and setting the stage for space photography. NASA was focused on getting a human into space and back to Earth safely during the Cold War, and photography was not a priority. However, Glenn took the camera on his three-orbit mission and captured the first human-captured colored still photographs of the Earth. The success of those photos led NASA to modify Hasselblad cameras for use in subsequent manned missions. The story highlights the power of storytelling and the importance of capturing and sharing memorable moments, even when they are not the primary focus of a project.John Glenn, the seasoned pilot and astronaut, modified an Ansco Autoset camera, which he bought for $40 from a drugstore in Florida, to make it suitable for use with his bulky astronaut gloves. He flipped the camera upside down, attached a pistol grip with special buttons and moved the eyepiece to the bottom, which was now the top of the camera because they had flipped it. During the first American manned orbital space flight, Friendship 7 on the Mercury-Atlas rocket, Glenn took the first human-captured colored still photographs of the Earth using this camera. People were fascinated by the images, and NASA soon realized the importance photography would play in their future space missions. Glenn's camera was a game-changer for NASA, and it paved the way for future astronauts to capture the magic of space and share it with the world.",

        "content": "A developer on Hacker News shared their experience building a large-scale app in Svelte, calling it \"a complex and blazing fast superapp.\" They also noted some potential issues, such as animations breaking the app without a specified specifier for local updates, and reactivity becoming difficult to handle with big state updates. The developer suggested splitting the state subparts to avoid \"reactivity hell.\" They also mentioned having to become experts in how Svelte compiles in order to avoid issues after a certain scale. In response to a question about build times, the developer said that dev builds are fast and responsive in Svelte, with hot-module reloading, but builds take around two minutes due to bundling times of external libraries. Other developers shared their thoughts and experiences with Svelte, praising its simplicity and reactivity.Developers share their thoughts on Svelte, a popular web framework for building user interfaces. Some highlight Svelte's easy-to-use structure, fast app performance, and features like observed state machines. Others note challenges, including a learning curve in using reactive statements and potential for bugs when used at scale. Some compare Svelte to Redux or MobX, while others say it offers a better way to implement transitions and animations using CSS. The community is growing and Svelte's push towards exposing platform primitives and making the framework disappear while still offering strong support is noted as one of the reasons for its success. Overall, opinions are positive and it seems consensus is that Svelte is a promising approach to front-end web development.Svelte is a web development framework that offers a lean and productive way to build interactive components. The syntax can sometimes be confusing, particularly when it comes to reactive statements and store auto-subscriptions. However, this is easily overcome with familiarity and is outweighed by the framework's benefits, such as easy state management and minimal boilerplate code. Svelte uses a compiler-based approach, which could lead to further efficiencies for developers. While there are criticisms, such as dealing with complex reactive dependencies, Svelte has proven to be a popular choice over other frameworks like React and Vue for those looking for an efficient way to build interactive components.Comments about the use of React, including criticism about its documentation and the difficulty of properly using hooks such as useEffect. Some users praise alternative frameworks like Vue and Svelte, citing their simpler developer experience and more functional style. Criticisms of Svelte include confusing documentation and architectural decisions, such as file-based routing. The importance of minimizing side effects in functional programming is discussed, but some users argue that side effects are necessary for real-world applications. Some suggest using tools like React Query and useContext to manage state more effectively. Overall, the comments highlight the importance of simplicity and clarity in code, as well as the need for reliable documentation and tooling.The conversation revolves around comparing different JavaScript frameworks, including React, Vue, and Svelte. The original comment mentions the new syntax introduced by React, which some feel is harder to reason about than other more natural language-like syntax. Others discuss the level of TypeScript support in various frameworks and the complexity of implementing server-side rendering in different approaches. Some express discomfort with the \"reactive code block\" in Svelte and its \"$\" paradigm, preferring the more explicit approaches of React or Angular. However, others argue that Svelte is a language and not just a library, and its approach is still explicit but at the language level. Overall, there are tradeoffs to be considered in each framework, and it's essential to make an informed choice.discussion centers around the suitability of Svelte for large projects. Some users believe that Svelte is better suited for small projects and personal use, while others argue that they use it successfully for large enterprise projects. Svelte's $ label and handling of non-local effects are cited as potential challenges, but the language semantics of $ blocks are easy to learn, mitigating potential errors. Users appreciate the lack of virtual DOM and the simplicity and speed of Svelte. Some compare Svelte favorably to React and Angular, with opinions divided on whether React's \"non-opinionated\" stance leads to messy code, or whether Angular's opinionated nature is a strength. Svelte's lack of documentation and maturity compared to more established frameworks is also discussed. Overall, many users find Svelte enjoyable to work with, but acknowledge that it may not be perfect and has its limitations.The original post on Hacker News details one user's experience with using Svelte for a project. They mention the advantages of Svelte's reactivity system and support for transitions and async components. However, one major issue they encountered was with the $ label, which they found difficult to use and potentially buggy. The user also questioned the need for yet another string template language and compiler. Other users in the comments shared their own experiences with Svelte, some noting similar issues with the $ label, while others praised its simplicity and developer experience. The post sparked a discussion on the current landscape of frontend frameworks, with users mentioning popular options like React, Angular, Vue, and Ember.The article discusses the author's experience using Svelte and SvelteKit to build a personal RSS reader. The author enjoyed Svelte's component format, built-in stores, and event dispatcher API, but found the reactive statements ($), await blocks, and built-in transition and animation APIs to be lowlights. The $ label is a core part of Svelte that can introduce bugs, which makes the author hesitant to adopt Svelte for larger projects. The author also questions why Svelte's transition and animation APIs exist when they should be a concern of CSS. Overall, the author would use Svelte again for personal projects, but not for large company projects if they were the architect. There is a good deal of discussion in the comments section on Hacker News.",

The update also features improvements to the :has() selector for Safari Content Blockers, allowing the targeted blocking of page elements based on child element characteristics, and additions to the animation property, such as margin-trim and font-display. However, some commenters are critical of the update's lack of support for the Fullscreen API and Screen Orientation API, which they argue indicate that Apple is intentionally hindering PWA adoption. Other concerns include Apple's annual developer fee of $99, which some developers argue is a barrier to entry in the Apple ecosystem.The latest version of Apple's Safari browser features support for the Web Authentication API, which allows users to authenticate to websites using biometric data or a security key; animated AVIF; SIMD128 for WebAssembly; and a new Wake Lock API. Despite improvements, however, Safari is still lagging behind other browsers in some areas, such as lack of support for the WebXR API. While one user praised Safari's power-efficient ad-blocking API and more memory-friendly coding, others took issue with the fact that no other browser engine is allowed on iOS, and called for Safari to adopt the Blink engine. The dominance of one engine could create a \"disaster for the standards-based internet,\" in the view of one commentator.Safari 16.4 comes with 135 new web features and over 280 polish updates, including Web Push that enables iOS and iPadOS developers to send push notifications to their users through the use of Push API, Notifications API, and Service Workers. The release also includes support for the Badging API, allowing developers to display an app badge count like any other app on iOS or iPadOS. Permission is automatically granted when a user gives permission for notifications. Third-party web browsers can offer \u201cAdd to Home Screen\u201d in the Share menu. The release also provides more restrictions in Lockdown Mode and updates in the Web Inspector. While there were several arguments about Safari's treatment of web apps, Apple emphasizes that it continues to care for both the needs of web developers and the everyday experience of its users.Safari 16.4 has improved support for Web Components, adding support for Declarative Shadow DOM, ElementInternals, and the Imperative Slot API. It has also added support for several new CSS properties, values, pseudo-classes, and syntaxes, including the margin-trim property for eliminating margins from elements abutting their container, and the Relative Color Syntax for specifying color values more dynamically. Safari 16.4 also adds several improvements to media queries syntax, adds support for CSS Properties and Values API with the @property at-rule, and adds support for CSS Typed OM.

        "content": "Hacker News users discuss the usefulness of HN as a source of information for when websites like GitHub are down or experiencing degraded performance. Many users check HN as a secondary source after checking their internet connection and official status pages, which can often be unreliable or unavailable. Some users suggest alternative Git hosts like self-hosted Gerrit, Gitea, and CodeCommit. Others express concerns about recent developments at GitHub, such as the launch of Copilot and the recent security issue, and are migrating to other Git hosts. The thread includes playful comments about HN being a last resort check and jokes about the importance of being offline to avoid getting hacked.GitHub experienced a major outage, rendering users unable to push code, among other issues. Users took to Hacker News to commiserate, with some suggesting a traffic monitor icon on the main page to indicate when something is wrong. Others questioned the effectiveness of Git's error messaging, with \"fatal error in commit_refs\" causing undue worry for some users. It was noted by some contributors that Git's setup can be problematic as there's still a single point of failure, despite its resilience to downtime. Finally, one user pointed out alternatives to a Git remote, such as working over email via diffs or setting up a backup system with separate git instances.Users discuss the outage of GitHub, with some speculating if it has to do with an infrastructure change rolled back. Some users express frustration with the frequency of GitHub outages, questioning if it is related to Microsoft's acquisition of the company. Others offer alternatives to GitHub, such as Fossil or using Git to keep track of issues. Some users also bring up the notion of self-hosting GitHub, either as a backup or as the primary source. Despite the frustration, some users point out the inherent challenges of fast-moving development and acknowledge that changes are the leading cause of outages.GitHub experienced degraded performance for several services, including Actions, API requests, Codespaces, Git Operations, Issues, Pages, and Pull Requests on March 27, 2023.

        "content": "A user on Hacker News has called for better support for SSH host certificates. By using host certificates, which allow for verification of both the host and client, developers can avoid Trust on First Use and improve workflows for both developers and non-technical people. The commenter described their own use of the Step CA workflow, which involves a simple three-step process for developers to verify host keys and their own identity. The user also called for GitHub to support host certificates, allowing them to delegate access control to their own CA. While some commenters questioned the need for such support or suggested alternative methods, others highlighted the benefits of using host certificates in enterprise environments.The discussion is around using SSH certificates to authenticate users and manage secure access in organizations. One commenter suggests using Azure's CLI to generate a device code for browser authentication as an alternative to carrying private keys around, while others discuss using StepCA to issue and manage host certificates. There is a debate on the use of SSH certificates for client identification and the potential risks associated with storing private keys in a single point of failure. Some also mention storing host keys in DNS records, but it is pointed out that this requires DNSSEC to verify the returned SSH key. Overall, the discussion focuses on finding pragmatic solutions for SSH authentication and access management in organizations.Discussions are ongoing about using DNS for security infrastructure such as SSHFP. While DNS is used as a key storage database and configuration store, some comments highlight its insecure nature. DNS is only as secure as the cache that is trusted, and cache poisoning is an issue. DNSSEC has not delivered results in most top-level domains and registers. While DNS-based proof-of-ownership is common for public CAs, authentication through DNS does not guarantee security. Any domain-based validation is flawed unless the registries are trustworthy. Trusting countries that operate their ccTLDs is considered better than trusting countries that host CAs. DNSSEC and CAs can complement each other, but DNS-based trust cannot be the only source of trust.The discussion revolves around SSH key management and the pitfalls of relying on Domain Name System (DNS) to distribute public metadata for IP addresses. While one user suggests SSH certificates as a solution, another argues that this approach is flawed and instead proposes a more robust method of using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to fetch the public key in a well-known sub-path after checking the TLS of the host. However, not everyone agrees that using TLS is a better option, with some highlighting the benefits of SSH's straightforward client authentication method. The conversation also touches on the challenges of implementing Kerberos and LDAP workflows and the complexities surrounding certificate authority (CA) trust chains. The need for better tooling and an easier-to-use infrastructure for SSH, certificates, and PKI is highlighted.A discussion on Hacker News has centered around the SSH protocol and its limitations, contrasting it with HTTPS+Git. While SSH is an important feature of the industry, the discussion covers the issues with it, including how many SSH clients configure their server's public keys on a \"trust on first use\" basis, which can lead to security problems. In contrast, HTTPS+Git eliminates these problems through a variety of AuthN+Z options, including more fine-grained access controls. However, one user pointed out that while SSH has limitations, the same cannot be said of SSH certificates, which are an improvement over SSH public keys.

        "content": "Pirate Weather, a weather forecast application, built by Alexander Reed, a PhD student and Python beginner, has caused a stir on Hacker News due to its architecture. Reddit users expressed their concern that an \"educational\" project built by a student was overly complicated with not all the components required to reduce the complexity of the architecture. The user, capableweb, pushed for a Monolithic architecture and insisted on projects keeping things as simple as possible. It was said that such complexity was unnecessary at present, and users might assume building such a huge system is mandatory, not optional, if not using it for a very large project. Nonetheless, many users praised the project as a great example to follow in terms of project management, product development, and the Python language.A PhD student in Water Resources Engineering has created an open source weather app, with the purpose of scaling and cost-efficiency. The architecture consists of AWS Fargate, Lambda, Elastic File System (EFS), ECS, and an EC2 instance. While some commenters criticised the complexity of the design, others praised the student's achievement outside of academic work, and noted the cost-saving benefits of the consumption-based infrastructure. The student, who designed the app to obtain quick and accurate information relating to outdoor water activities, has made the code available to the public on GitHub. HN commenters attempting to extract a lesson from the discussion agreed that even those starting out in their field could create noteworthy projects.Pirate Weather is a weather forecasting service that reads and serves weather forecasts in the style of Dark Sky API. The service reads government-run weather forecasts globally and provides them in a user-friendly format. The service is hosted on AWS and has been developed by an individual. The author requires financial support to keep the service running but also offers a free version of the API. The service provides specific weather forecasts globally, with reliable mm and hour precision. The Norwegian weather service is considered the most reliable source, with a highly accurate global model. Some users have recommended using the service in conjunction with other weather applications such as Saildrone and Windy.com.The Pirate Weather API is a replacement for the Dark Sky API and provides weather forecasts using NOAA models. The API relies on AWS Elastic File System (EFS), with data accessed by a serverless function that is triggered to download, merge, chunk and process GRIB files. The three NOAA models used are HRRR, GFS, and the GEFS, with HRRR providing forecasts over the US and Canada, and GFS providing global weather forecasting. The API can be used for assessing GFS and HRRR forecasts for anyone interested in knowing exactly how their weather forecasts are generated. The API was created by Alexander Reys as part of his PhD and to learn Python. The latest version is 1.4 as of Spring 2023.The article describes the process of building an alternative to the Dark Sky API, which was acquired by Apple and is set to be shut down at the end of 2021. The alternative, called PirateWeather, is a weather API that utilizes grib files from various weather models that can be accessed via a Lambda function and AWS infrastructure. The author describes the steps involved in ingesting and processing the model data, as well as providing details on the logic used to generate the API responses. The article also discusses future plans for the service, including adding support for text summaries and integrating additional weather models.",

        "url": "https://www.openmymind.net/Zig-Quirks/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35323645",
        "content": "A discussion on Hacker News about Rust's variable shadowing feature focused on the benefits and downsides of the language's ability to re-initialise a variable with a different type, which is useful but can introduce confusion. Some commenters noted that Rust's Into::into() method works nicely because it consumes the object in the old (no longer accessible) name. However, other languages may have different rules, such as in C++, and may require a new set of construction and assignment operators for destructive move. Additionally, owners may accidentally overwrite function parameters and not realise it, leading to errors later on. Despite these challenges, many commenters noted the usefulness of Rust's Shadowing feature, which allows for abstracted local types and eliminates the need to create new independently-named bindings for every variable.Developers discuss the use of variable shadowing in programming, with some noting potential downsides such as difficulties in reading code and inadvertently overwriting functions. However, advocates argue that properly used, shadowing can make code more readable and easier to maintain. In particular, developers note the use of this technique when dealing with iterators and unique-ifying arrays. Additionally, supporters of shadowing mention that in languages like Rust, which encourages immutable variables and makes mutable ones stand out, shadowing is often easier to manage. Ultimately, while some developers see variable shadowing as a \"foot gun,\" others view it as a useful tool if properly managed.Zig does not have private struct members, and this has been an issue for some programmers, including the developer of a C library who must deal with users reaching into struct members that he doesn't want them to. In C, options include defining the structure in a .c file or making member names something like internal_foo. Zig, however, does not allow the former. The absence of the option also renders opaque type\u2019s practical use debatable. Advocates argue that public fields lead to better abstractions, whereas others believe in full encapsulation, which is very important for system evolution over time. Private fields prevent access by other modules, but this sometimes conflicts with what people coming from C and C++ are used to with everything being in one file. Another issue causing reluctance to encapsulate is the use of trivial, redundant, and verbose getters and setters in some languages.The discussion revolves around programming languages, particularly Zig and D. The context is on writing trivial code for things like Vecs, and the verbosity that comes with some languages. The benefits of using properties to avoid this trap are highlighted. The usefulness of naming conventions is also discussed, with certain languages opting for snake_case and others using CamelCase. The @ annotation is considered necessary because it differentiates built-ins/keywords from declarations, nested modules, or imported modules. The discussion includes considerations on const correctness and using const, pointer mutation, and the \"self\" variable in functions for defining type-specific methods. Ultimately, the key takeaway is that Zig's features seem well suited to writing clean code.In a discussion thread about declaring a packed struct to send as a network packet in Zig, several comments touch on various aspects of the language. One user asks whether a Self will be required for the struct's memory layout and whether it will occupy memory. Another user replies that there is nothing special about Self and that it is just a type. In general, constants in Zig are purely compile time things and don't take up memory. The user explains that putting a function inside a struct which takes a pointer to its struct type as the first argument just allows method-call-syntax-sugar. Another user comments on the syntax style conventions in Zig, where functions are in camelCase, types are in PascalCase, and variables are in lowercase_with_underscores. They explain that it is helpful when reading code and that manipulating sequences of data and pointers of various kinds is one of the main things you do when programming.Zig, a system programming language designed to be memory-safe and provide performance, favors a syntax that prevents parsing ambiguities.The language needs to provide for future syntax extensions while giving good error messages for syntax errors. A parsing ambiguity can make parsers slower and more complex than required. The language syntax needs to be unambiguous for a structured approach, for example, Zig has enabled indentations to be tabs or spaces, and it depends on the preferences of developers. Zig has an ethos towards being friendly to C programmers and has made all struct fields public. The author suggests that the private keyword would improve documentation, but it also adds complexity that could cause difficulties in the 1.x world. It recommends documenting allowed/proper usage of each field, especially since groveling in structs is often needed in embedded contexts.An experienced Zig programmer has shared some tips with fellow developers who might find themselves stuck on certain quirks within the system. One of the key features of Zig is the comptime feature, where developers can perform actions during compile time. Files in Zig are treated as structures, and this can be useful in specifying their unique aspects. The article also delves into some of the idiosyncrasies of the language, including matters such as naming conventions, setting struct fields, and the use of temporary variables. While developers may stumble initially, the writer emphasized that these are small details and should not detract from the overall benefits of the language.",

        "content": "Playing video games can reduce stress, anxiety, and improve mood. The Hacker News article started with this fact, and the conversation quickly shifted to one of optimism. One commenter expressed that he shifted from a pessimistic outlook to a grateful one after gaining perspective of all the things that have gone right in his life. The discussion then moved to how overwhelming it can be to live in a world where conspiracy theories are rampant and fact-checking is necessary to establish the truth. Another commenter suggested focusing on making a positive impact in one's immediate environment to counteract the negativity. Finally, a different commenter pointed to the growing awareness of societal issues, such as climate change, as a reason for optimism.The discussion centers around the idea that electing people who are not influenced by the fossil fuel industry is crucial. The conversation then moves toward the concept of the military industrial complex and its impact on society. One commenter argues that humans have done impressive things in terms of conquering their environment and that the future looks bright. However, another commenter warns that optimism can be a form of blindness, and that we construct illusions for our own sanity. They propose an experiment to discover who is more delusional: the optimist or pessimist. The discussion concludes with an acknowledgement of the progress humans have made, but also recognition of the need to keep working on problems like climate change, income inequality, and income redistribution to ensure a better future.The conversation discusses the idea that optimists may be deluding themselves, leading them to have a less accurate grasp of reality. However, experiments suggest that people who see the world exactly as it is tend to be slightly more depressed than others. Deluded people tend to be happier since they see less pain in the world. This view is backed by statistics and is not just a matter of one's opinion. However, some argue that having a positive outlook does not necessarily mean that one has less grasp on reality. Discussion on this topic ranges from acknowledging that the brain tends to paint everything in extremes to focusing on the upsides without disregarding the potential trade-offs. Trying to understand the details of what's going on can help distract oneself from fear.A commenter on Hacker News shares their experience of how understanding a process or situation can alleviate fear or discomfort. The discussion includes examples ranging from dental procedures to flying and anesthesia, with some participants acknowledging how gaining knowledge about a process can actually contribute to anxiety. The original commenter points out that by understanding what is happening in a situation they were able to become proficient at it, similar to how a tennis coach could help a child overcome a mistake by diverting their attention briefly. Another participant found that knowing the details and reasons behind what was happening during a flying experience helped them to feel more comfortable.Playing certain video games can help reduce stress and anxiety, according to healthcare professionals. Studies have shown that cancer patients who played video games responded better to chemotherapy and had a better understanding of the treatment process. However, not all video games have a positive effect. Some games can increase stress levels, especially if they are competitive. Finding the right game to reduce stress can be beneficial, like playing games that allow players to immerse themselves in their interests/pastimes. It also helps to limit the amount of time spent playing games and incorporate exercise as an alternative. Overall, gaming can offer a comfortable escape and help with mental health, as long as it is done in moderation and with the right mindset.Playing video games can help reduce stress, anxiety, and improve mood.

        "content": "A post on Hacker News discusses a 100-question diligence checklist for investors to evaluate potential investments, prompting a debate over its usefulness. Some commenters view the checklist as a good tool for understanding what makes a good business, while others argue it's too exhaustive and includes irrelevant or contradictory questions. Some suggest it could be helpful for job seekers to understand a potential employer. Other questions arise over whether investors can trust the answers provided by the company, and whether the checklist should include more questions about the product or service itself. Ultimately, the value of the checklist may depend on the individual's investment philosophy and priorities.Due diligence is a crucial part of the investment process, and a short 100-question diligence checklist can help investors cover all their bases. However, it's important to remember that only trusting the checklist and outsourcing the process can lead to inaccuracies and manipulation. Checklists are valuable for identifying potential areas to investigate, but due diligence needs to be done thoroughly and with an understanding of the complexity of the investment. Additionally, it's important to consider non-economic outcomes and potential externalities, as well as the company's cybersecurity and regulatory exposure. Investors should also be cautious of companies that work too hard on their image, as this could be a red flag that requires further scrutiny. Ultimately, due diligence is about cross-examining your own thought process and ensuring your investment thesis holds up to rigorous analysis.To get a thorough understanding of a company and its broader context, investors should continuously assess a handful of criteria where reality or sentiment is most likely to change. The checklist includes: understanding the company's unit economics, complements to the product, feedback loops in the business, competitive landscape, management incentives, employee reviews, financial performance and cash flow, ownership structure, internal operations and career paths, and valuation. Investors must know the assumptions that require the most guesswork when setting a discounted cash flow valuation and be aware of management's motivations around volatility. Additionally, investors must evaluate whether they can trust the company's numbers, its sustainability, and its potential to create a genuinely positive impact on the world.Investors should consider a range of factors when assessing a company's potential, according to Matt Levine writing for Bloomberg Opinion. Among the considerations to keep in mind are an assessment of the company's valuation relative to other businesses, its maturity stage and the influence of catalysts on its valuation. Other important questions include whether the company offers something unique to its market, and whether it offers real benefits to users over its competitors. Investors must also decide whether they have enough information about a company's operations and financials, as well as consider potential psychological factors such as the impact of market fluctuations.Pinterest has launched a shopping feature on its collage app, Shuffles, enabling companies to remix user-created data into a single format that provides feedback on multiple pieces of content. This comes amid a report from Diff Jobs highlighting several open roles, including a crypto proprietary trading firm looking for crypto-experienced traders, and a profitable AI start-up seeking a product designer for its services in accelerating small companies' growth.

The post notes that an AI with a friendly mission but sandboxed censoring could become the first textbook instance of mankind oppressing a primitive machine mind. The comments section debates the pros and cons of OpenAI, with some arguing that the subscription-based access to the platform is cheaper than competitors and essential to industries like real estate. Others point out the potential dangers of AI and urge caution in its development. Some are skeptical of the claims made about OpenAI and suggest that it is simply a way for tech giants to differentiate themselves and remain relevant in a competitive market.ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are tools that can solve interview questions and common tool defects. They are often used for Bash, Django, and certain Java libraries, but some argue that these tools can be replaced by better ones. However, others see their usefulness in certain jobs, such as customer service or public relations, where communication is key. ChatGPT can rephrase toxic or combative messages and facilitate conversations in a non-combative and abusive way. It is also useful for breaking down problems, creating outlines, or finding the proper solution in a specific programming language. Despite criticisms, the growing importance of ChatGPT and similar tools may make them indispensable in the future.Comments on a Hacker News thread surrounding OpenAI's release of GPT-3 prompt generator varied from discussing the affordability of the tool to references to the company's original mission statement to advance digital intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The release of the tool at a monthly subscription cost of USD 20 was deemed cheap by some respondents, while others found it steep. Another comment pondered whether the term \"open\" still applied to OpenAI given its current business model. Some also suggested alternative solutions for obtaining similar output, with one response suggesting using GPT-3.5 for a cost of USD 3 per month, while another proposed creating a Chrome extension using ChatGPT's response code.A Chrome extension called \u201cClosedAI\u201d has been created to automatically replace the word \u201cOpen\u201d with \u201cClosed\u201d on the OpenAI website. While the extension might be seen as just humorous trolling to some, many are taking issue with it as a distasteful attack on an organization that has actually created groundbreaking technologies, and suggests that the developers behind it are misguided or \u201cbutthurt\u201d. OpenAI has, in fact, provided a number of free or affordable resources for AI development and research, unlike competitors such as Google and Facebook that offer little to no free services. Some believe that the extension might be a commentary on OpenAI\u2019s decision to not open source their language model, GPT-3. Reports suggest that people in some countries have been blocked from accessing OpenAI\u2019s website.The conversation discusses the openness of OpenAI and its technology. While some suggest that OpenAI is truly open and accessible to everyone, others argue that it is only open to a limited extent and that there are risks associated with its technology. Some commenters express skepticism about Google's motives for keeping certain technology secret, pointing out that the company has a dominant market position to protect. There is also concern about the potential for AI technology to be used for spying on individuals.

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35325556",
        "content": "Developers are comparing the functionality of the programming languages Zig and Rust on Hacker News. While Zig is touted for simple memory management with manual allocation control, some programmers found it verbose and difficult to work with. Rust, on the other hand, was praised for its unique error-handling strategies, flexible data structures, and its options for both manual and automatic memory management. However, some users noted that the borrow checker could be challenging for less skilled developers. A few users suggested that both languages had their places in different contexts and that the best option would depend on a developer's specific needs. One user suggested that Rust was better suited for complex projects, while Zig could be more useful for simple programs.The discussion revolves around memory management in different programming languages, specifically Rust and GC (garbage collection) languages. The use of arenas is suggested as a solution to memory management in Rust. Reference counting is suggested as a solution in GC languages, but there can be some issues with concurrency. Some argue that there is no silver bullet for memory management, and even with RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), developers still need to carefully consider memory allocations and management. There is a claim that in some cases, it is less work to do memory management manually in the first place compared to using automatic memory management. A commenter has expressed disappointment with Zig, a language that requires manual memory management.A comment on Hacker News discusses the reserved words in the Zig programming language, claiming that there are too many of them and that some are too long. However, the commenter does praise Zig's template design and its feature of having build scripts in the same language as the one being built. The commenter disagrees with others who see Zig as a simple language and prefers C for its simplicity. Other comments on the thread discuss the use cases for languages like Zig, including real-time audio applications and memory control in JIT compilers. The potential downsides of relying on third-party packages in modern applications are also mentioned. However, the overall consensus is that Zig and other comparable languages like Rust provide valuable alternatives to traditional programming languages.The article discusses the use of languages Zig and Rust for managing memory and buffer pools in databases. While Zig is a modern systems programming language that allows custom allocators for everything, Rust has a bigger community and is safer for memory management and concurrency. However, some commenters note potential drawbacks to using Rust, such as its overuse of enum variants that can consume excessive memory when parsing large documents. They argue that garbage collection and reference counting can be sufficient for most programs, and that languages like Nim offer a compromise by providing allocation contexts for RAII cleanups. The article concludes that while managing memory manually is not required for most programs, it can offer performance benefits and greater customization.The author points out that while garbage collection (GC) is convenient for most programming tasks, there are still certain domains where precise memory control is critical for performance. They highlight that while Rust has been successful in attracting developers with its manual lifetime analysis, other languages like Nim also offer similar memory management systems. Nim's ARC \"memory management system\" provides comparable performance to Zig or Rust with less work. Unlike most GCs, RC-based systems enable programmers to manually allocate memory when necessary. Furthermore, the article suggests that compilers are getting smarter, and in some cases, compilers can be more effective than human programmers in managing memory. Finally, the article highlights that some languages may trade-off performance for convenience, but cultures can vary, and it depends on the language's specific use cases.An article on Hacker News highlights that Rust and Zig have different niches and can both succeed, but that Rust is a language for building modular software with precise contracts between components, whereas Zig is about perfection and more flexible. Rust allows programmers to assemble a program confidently that works well, even if collaborating with hundreds of other programmers. Although Zig has some unique features, such as its metaprogramming and work with garbage collection, it remains too unsafe for now, and safe guarantees for the absence of UB are necessary before it can become a general-purpose language. Rust and Zig are not necessarily competing, with Rust's modular, contract-based approach operating in different domains than Zig's focus on writing systems software that requires low-level control.The author of Rust-analyzer, a project providing Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for Rust, has switched to using Zig full-time. In a blog post, the author discussed Rust's strengths, but felt that Zig was better suited for certain tasks such as writing \"perfect\" systems software. Zig forces developers to think about the most appropriate allocator for each allocation, which could make code better over the long-term. Additionally, the author felt that it is hard to agree on who is responsible for different tasks when using languages that rely on garbage collection. Zig's explicit approach allows for more precise control over resources.\nThe article discusses the pros and cons of using Zig for resource management. Zig explicitly handles allocations, making it easier to avoid memory problems. However, unlike Rust and Go, Zig requires manual memory management without atomic reference counting, making it less ideal for those who don't want to be aware of memory allocations. Additionally, Zig is less strict about ownership than Rust, making it easier to express internally-mutable data structures. However, it's easier to be sure of ownership in Rust compared to Zig. The article also comments on the language's built-in C/C++ compiler, but notes its bugs and long compilation times. Finally, the article highlights the benefits of Zig's ability to consume C/C++ as well as its Build.zig feature, but also notes its verbose syntax.The ongoing debate between Rust and Zig, two systems programming languages, centers around language philosophy and design choices. While Rust focuses on compositional safety and scalability, Zig prioritizes perfection and flexibility. One point of contention is Rust's use of a default type for allocators, while Zig requires allocators to be passed in explicitly at the method level. Some argue that Rust's approach sacrifices flexibility, while others praise it for being easier to use and understand. Ultimately, the decision between the two languages will depend on project needs, team composition, and personal preferences.The author of this post discusses the differences between Rust and Zig, two programming languages. They explain that while Rust is focused on building modular software through precise contracts between components, Zig is not memory safe and has a more anti-modular approach. The author explores the style of writing software, discussing how balancing program usefulness with the effort to develop it is key, and looks at the two styles of software engineering to achieve this: the Erlang style, which embraces failability of both hardware and software and explicitly designs programs to be resilient to partial faults, and the SQLite style, which overcomes an unreliable environment at the cost of rigorous engineering. The author concludes that Zig could be easier to learn and develop for, but is unlikely to be as useful for serious software development as Rust.Zig is a programming language that is architectured to provide a small resource management feature, dynamically-typed comptime, combining most of the special-cased Rust machinery. Unlike Rust, Zig does not have closures and is designed to emit machine code, resulting in efficient compilation. Most web servers that require allocation use the global allocator, creating a strong local optima. In contrast, Zig forces users to think about the most appropriate allocator for each case. However, the ambiguity around semantics concerning pointers, memory, and aliasing is a concern as it creates a ball of problems with mutability and self-reference. For Zig to reach its full potential, there is a need for a clear answer to the desired language semantics as well as IDE support. Lastly, the development process of Zig requires bootstrapping, which can be optimized through the provision of a set of scripts.",

        "content": "First-Citizens Bank is set to assume the deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, which failed earlier this month. However, some commentators on a Hacker News thread have expressed confusion over the move, questioning whether FDIC protection for account holders with over $250k in the failed bank has been removed. Some also speculate that the move signals another bank run, akin to\u00a0the 2008 financial crisis. However, others have said that the transferred assets will be eligible for the new Bank Term Funding Program, and as such,\u00a0First-Citizens is able to borrow cash to pay withdrawals in a way that Silicon Valley Bridge Bank could not. Additionally, some pointed out that the assets assumed by First-Citizens Bank are eligible collateral for the\u00a0Bank Term Funding Program.\u00a0\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) has been acquired by North Carolina-based First-Citizens Bank & Trust after the former was placed under a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp receivership due to liquidity issues. The takeover fell under the loss-share agreement, meaning First-Citizens Bank will purchase all its deposits and loans book, and will be reimbursed by the FDIC for losses incurred on the acquired loan portfolio, with the FDIC covering 80% of losses. However, becoming a subsidiary of a new bank means depositors will lose their FDIC insurance, and some already have over $250,000 in deposits in the SVB. First-Citizens\u2019 deal will last until November 2041, with the intention to keep Silicon Valley running as a standalone unit.First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. is acquiring the assets and deposits of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) for $56m, less than the outstanding deposits of SVB, which were worth $63.2bn at the end of 2018. SVB has been unable to make money from venture lending and is selling its assets and returning all its deposits as it seeks to move on from being just a bank to become a broader financial services provider. The deal is part of the Federal Reserve's quick sale programme, which is designed to ensure the safe passage of deposits and protect the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC is allowing First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. to purchase assets from SVB Financial Group, which is undergoing a voluntary liquidation after a bank run in March 2020. The FDIC estimates it will cost $20bn to resolve the bank's troubles. Collectedparts speculated that SVB had no enterprise value, and the outcome is financially the same for FDIC as if it had firesold the assets and carried out a pure winddown. This shows that regulatory agencies could be in denial about just how financially messed up a bank is, and raises concerns about what could happen if others follow suit. Additionally, it calls for H2M accounting\u00a0to be banned or limited to prohibit using it to back demand deposits.During the 2008 crisis, JP Morgan acquired failing banks Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns at the request of the government. However, JP Morgan later faced fines and legal fees amounting to billions of dollars for prior activities of the acquired banks. While such bankruptcies are unlikely to cause the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to go bankrupt, hypothetical scenarios of multiple bank failures may cause concern, especially when considering the FDIC's ratio of insurance coverage to depositor funds. Nevertheless, the FDIC is funded by its member institutions through premiums and assessments paid on deposits, and if funds are inadequate, the FDIC can draw on a line of credit with the US Treasury. Furthermore, two tools to avoid bank failures are offering special protection to payroll accounts and using third party networks to provide customers additional FDIC insurance.Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has been sold to First Citizens Bank & Trust after being bailed out by the FDIC. Some commenters saw the SVB bailout as evidence that the FDIC was not an effective bank regulator. Despite the failure, the US Federal Reserve remains resolute in its fight against inflation. Some banking industry insiders questioned whether the Fed's rapid rate hikes were hurting banks, since the markets had already priced in the probabilities of changes. Some commenters suggested taking steps to spread money over multiple FDIC-insured accounts in case of a bank run or failure. Other commenters recommended using brokerage accounts instead of holding large sums of money in bank accounts to ensure maximum insurance coverage. Commenters also suggested alternative banks and financial technology solutions. First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company is set to assume all deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The acquisition comes as part of a purchase and assumption agreement between FDIC and First-Citizens Bank. Depositors of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, National Association will be automatically transferred and insured by First-Citizens Bank\u00a0for their full insured amounts. The acquisition comes after the closure of Silicon Valley Bank by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which had all its assets and most deposits transferred to Silicon Valley Bridge Bank. As of March 10, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank had approximately $167bn in total assets\u00a0and $119bn in total deposits.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35330465",
        "content": "The Greenland ice sheet is at risk of reaching a \"melting point of no return,\" according to glaciologist Dirk van As. As temperatures rise, melting ice will become increasingly exposed to warm air temperatures, leading to further melting. Though global temperatures only need to remain elevated for a few hundred years for this to happen, reducing carbon emissions may not be enough to allow the ice sheet to regrow substantially. While we potentially have hundreds of years before the \"tipping point\" triggers, we have already seen a 1.2C rise in global temperatures with a threshold of 1C-3C leading to irreversible melting. Experts warn that we must act quickly to find solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.The comment thread discusses concerns around passing the point of no return related to climate change. Some commenters argue that we are already past that point, and that younger generations will inherit a world with significant environmental challenges. Others express hope that younger generations' increased interest in the environment will allow them to tackle these problems. The conversation touches on the implications of rapidly melting ice and increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the potential long-term impacts on climate and agriculture. A few commenters express skepticism that people will truly take action to address these issues, while others note that while things may already be bad, there is always potential to make things worse.A climate scientist says that if you corner them in private, they will admit that we are \"inevitably fucked\" due to climate change. However, they cannot say this publicly because governments would lose trust, and funding for climate science and mitigation would dry up. Furthermore, currency would lose its value because it assumes that there will be a future where people will want to buy things. While we cannot avoid the damage that climate change will cause, efforts should focus on mitigation through building seawalls and flood barriers, developing mass migration plans, researching housing technology, and investing in local renewable energy rather than funding carbon capture schemes with no chance of working. We should accept that the climate will change and plan accordingly.The rate of melting in Greenland's ice sheet could lead to it disappearing completely in about 120 years, according to a comment piece in The Conversation. The piece argues that it's time for people to stop thinking of the problem as inevitable and instead work towards finding solutions. The authors argue that a lot of new wealth is not used to advance groundbreaking technology but rather as a means to maintain comfort. Addressing climate change issues requires a major, positive change that was made in the past. The changes needed will require sacrifice and major focus, strategic thinking\u00a0and community involvement, with a proactive attitude from individuals, rather than a $20 donation to a charity.\u00a0\nCommenters discuss individual contributions to combat climate change, with some suggesting personal sacrifices such as downsizing, reducing carbon footprint, and avoiding performative virtue of buying \"green\" things. Others argue that the impact of personal actions may be limited, and systemic changes at the state level are necessary. Suggestions include supporting non-profit initiatives, building grassroots movements, and using a platform of power and leadership to make changes that affect millions. Commenters also note that engineers may play a crucial role in finding technological solutions, and that relying solely on politicians may not be enough. Ultimately, the consensus seems to be that while individual actions may not solve the issue, they still make a difference and can serve as a starting point for systemic change.Volunteering in ecological restoration can have a direct positive impact on the environment and is more accessible than most people realize. Protecting biodiversity and restoring ecosystems is rewarding work that requires no prior experience or tools, and can be done in one's free time. While reducing one's carbon footprint is admirable, it may not necessarily boost morale. China's commitment to renewables is strong, but their love for coal is a concern since building a new coal-fired power plant commits the country to burning coal for 30+ years, making it a long-term commitment to a dirty power source. Sustainable living may require sacrifice and giving up on certain goals, such as buying less, using less, and living like it's 1880. The challenge is convincing others to act to stop the global problem of climate change.The Greenland Ice Sheet is on the brink of a \"melting point of no return,\" according to a new study published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. The sheet, which holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by about 23 feet, has been melting at accelerating rates due to climate change, and the loss is now irreversible, researchers found. The melting could cause sea levels to rise by 10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches), increasing the risk of coastal flooding and erosion worldwide. The study's authors urged global leaders to implement immediate and drastic action on climate change to avoid exacerbating the problem. Meanwhile, some comments on the news expressed skepticism about climate models and the effectiveness of human efforts to address climate change.The Greenland Ice Sheet, which covers 1.7 million sq km, is close to a melting point of no return, according to simulations in a study in Earth and Space Sciences journal Geophysical Research Letters. The study identified two tipping points: if 1,000 gigatons (Gt) of carbon are released into the atmosphere, much of the southern ice sheet will melt irreversibly. If 2,500 Gt are released, nearly the entire ice sheet will be lost permanently. Humankind has emitted around 500 Gt of carbon to date. Although much of the melting will not happen in the next decade, once the threshold is crossed, it will inevitably continue. Global sea levels would rise about 23ft if the whole ice sheet melted.",

        "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/media/disney-layoffs/index.html",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35331154",
        "content": "Disney is reported to be laying off around 7,000 employees in the United States. The news follows a number of high-profile box office bombs, including Strange World\u00a0and Turning Red, which made $74 million and $20 million respectively on budgets that were reported to be $135 million to $180 million and $175 million. Despite some mild successes in recent years, Disney has been releasing what many believe to be subpar movies, and losing money on them. Some commenters on Hacker News speculate that the company is focusing too heavily on making movies to promote its Disney+ streaming\u00a0service, as opposed to movies that people actually want to see. The layoffs affect employees in the company's theme parks, the movie-making division, and studios.Discussion revolves around Disney/Pixar movies, with some users expressing their love for classic Disney movies while others prefer newer releases. One user notes that the traditional blockbuster is not dead, pointing to Dreamworks as evidence. Others criticize modern Disney movies for containing too much propaganda or not being as good as older movies. The conversation also touches upon the relationship between Pixar and Disney, with some users pointing out that Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney. There is also some debate about which movies have more of a Pixar or Disney feel, with some users feeling that newer Pixar movies feel more like Disney movies. Finally, the popularity of recent releases, such as Turning Red, is noted as evidence that many people still want to see animated movies.Disney's recent movies are a topic of debate, with some claiming that the company is not making movies people want to see. However, others point to the fact that films such as Avatar Way of Water and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe have been extremely successful. Additionally, Disney has many different divisions, such as parks, streaming, gaming, merchandise, and resorts, making it difficult to determine the overall success of the company based solely on its movies. Turning Red, which was largely released on Disney+, earned $20 million in theaters, showing that the film performed well on streaming. However, Disney+ also lost subscribers in Q1 2023, showing that the streaming service is not necessarily a \"money machine.\"Disney's recent box office flops may not be a reflection of the quality of their movies, but rather due to their release strategy amidst the pandemic. Turning Red, which was only released on Disney+, received high ratings but did not have a theatrical release in most countries due to COVID-19. Meanwhile, Lightyear underperformed in theaters possibly because audiences had gotten used to the convenience of streaming new films at home. Disney's recent reliance on nostalgia bait and remakes may also be hindering their creativity and experimentation, but overall their strategy seems to be focused on producing blockbuster hits for their established franchises like Marvel and Avatar, as well as successful animated fairytale and musical adaptations.Disney has announced a series of layoffs that will result in 32,000 job losses in the first half of next year, including almost 5,000 jobs in its UK, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong theme parks. The pandemic has limited the amount of tourists the parks can accommodate, with amusement parks being forced to close and restricted to limited capacity during the summer months.\u00a0Disney has previously said that it was looking to reduce its workforce\u00a0by 28,000 due to the coronavirus pandemic, which included the 9,000 staff laid off from its parks division in October. The company is confident it can roll out a complete shutdown of California's Disneyland Theme Park if ordered to do so once more during the pandemic.Disney is the latest company to announce layoffs, with 28,000 employees losing their jobs across various businesses, including theme parks and consumer products. Commentators wonder if providing a list of programs or projects that will be cancelled alongside job cuts would make the situation more palatable for the remaining staff. Some contributors to an online chat about the subject argued that most of the time, employees are not being laid off because they did nothing, but because the projects they were working on have been unprofitable, or unmanageably costly. Layoffs are necessary sometimes, but commentators expressed concern that corporations are incentivised to treat employees as dispensable regardless of circumstances. Others pointed out that people's healthcare is tied to their employer in the US, making layoffs a more significant issue.Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the company will begin laying off staff in three rounds, starting this week, with approximately 7,000 jobs to be eliminated. The job cuts are part of a cost-cutting initiative aimed at streamlining the company\u2019s operations amidst industry upheaval. The first wave of job cuts is set to happen this week, managers will notify affected employees. A second round of job cuts is expected in April and the final round will take place before the beginning of summer, all to accomplish the company's planned job cut goal. Disney currently employs approximately 220,000 individuals, with around 166,000 based in the US. The job cuts represent about 3% of its global workforce.This text includes disclaimers and copyright notices for various market data providers, including Factset, Chicago Mercantile, and Dow Jones.

The competition provides contestants with 3D X-ray scans of the scrolls, as well as scans and images of three papyrus fragments, tutorials, tools, and a Discord server to connect with other contestants and the Vesuvius Challenge team. The competition is open to any approach, including machine learning, computer vision, or machine-assisted tools operated by humans. The challenge is difficult due to the long, tightly wrapped, damaged, and distorted nature of the Herculaneum scrolls.The challenge to read the Herculaneum scrolls, which were destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, might soon be solved with the help of machine learning. Dr. Brent Seales and his team have developed a machine learning model that can detect the ink used in the scrolls from subtle patterns in 3D X-rays. However, the models are not yet perfect and will need to be improved. As part of the Vesuvius Challenge, the team is offering a $100,000 Ink Detection Progress Prize on Kaggle for detecting the ink in the 3D X-ray scans. In addition, the organizers are offering open source prizes for any open source or publicly available contributions to the project. The Grand Prize deadline is December 31, 2023.",

The creator of XState has announced the release of XState v5 beta, which will provide more features and improvements. Some users have expressed concerns that XState is too involved and feature-rich for simple state machines. However, XState supports vanilla state machines through @xstate/fsm. The library also aims to provide visualizing features like sequence diagrams to help users understand how different actors communicate with each other. Users have reported success using XState for building general-purpose apps, particularly for preventing impossible states and ensuring data consistency. However, some have found the library too opinionated or difficult to use.XState is a tool that helps with managing a large number of states, making it easy to build reliable, performant, and easy-to-change flows. While a switch or an if/else statement can be used for simple scenarios, Statecharts becomes increasingly useful for more advanced use cases. State machines allow for controlling which fields in a form are visible, and specifying workflows that match what you want to do. Ultimately, every user interface is a collection of various states that need to be tracked, making state machines useful for modeling the implementation of incremental, progressive user flows. However, building state machines can be challenging and building them correctly is an art in itself. The visualizer in XState is seen as a major selling point, especially when explaining concepts to non-developers or new team members.XState is a JavaScript and TypeScript state management library for building state machines and statecharts. Users have highlighted the library's ability to make implicit state machines explicit through a time-tested format that can help to limit bugs. The library has a learning curve, similar to that of the reactive programming library, RxJS or the functional programming library, fp-ts. Some potential users have suggested that while they enjoy the visualization tool in VSCode, they would be able to build better implicit state machines if they could annotate their imperative code with visualization hints and parse the AST. One user also pointed out that state machines can be hard to scale up to large distributed systems.This text is a technical documentation of the XState library, which provides state machines and statecharts for state management and orchestration in modern web applications. The library has an API for creating and transitioning state machines, as well as visualizing them in a web-based UI called Stately. The documentation includes information about versioning and breaking changes, with the intention of minimizing disruption to users. TypeScript definitions for the library are also discussed, as well as the library's dependencies and contributions from the open-source community.

        "content": "Kubernetes, a distributed centralized operating system for managing containers, is complex and has many rough edges, making it challenging to use for production. Best practices for managing YAML files are still being worked out, and some functions, such as writing Helm charts, can be an \"absolute nightmare.\" However, Kubernetes can be made easier to work with if you use a hosted service and hand off hardware and control plane management to someone else. Incrementally building on prototypes and prioritizing making it secure before anything else can also make using Kubernetes less challenging. While Kubernetes is a powerful tool for dev teams, the reality of maintaining and securing its complex system should not be overlooked.The Kubernetes (K8S) system can introduce new categories of failure modes for developers and may require far more maintenance than the application itself, according to a Reddit thread. Respondents noted that the system can be a hard\u00a0undertaking\u00a0requiring specialist knowledge and expertise, and that many of the teams that rely on it should not be maintaining their own K8S stack. Some said\u00a0replacing K8S with more specialist solutions could be cheaper and more appropriate for smaller businesses.\u00a0Several users recommended Cloud Run, App Engine and Fly.io,\u00a0as alternatives. However, the thread did acknowledge that serverless solutions, such as running services on managed newSQL databases, can have\u00a0problems with cold start and and latency issues.The article features a discussion around the use of dynamic-scheduled cloud services like Kubernetes by startups. The author argues that large-scale startups, like DoorDash, Airbnb or Box, use these services to reduce coupling between teams and enable dynamic placement. However, smaller startups like 37signals, with limited staff and products, may not need dynamic scheduling because they can predict workloads and have a relatively static service discovery map. The article highlights the potential pitfalls of adopting microservices too early, which can result in a distributed monolith, and the importance of building templates for CI/CD pipelines, observability, and service mesh. Ultimately, the article suggests that startups need to weigh the trade-off between labor and compute costs while considering their requirements when choosing static or dynamic scheduling in the cloud.The article discusses the benefits of using Kubernetes in deploying and maintaining complex systems, arguing that it can simplify the deployment process and allow developers more autonomy. It highlights the challenges of deploying in production and the risks associated with using home-rolled systems such as Terraform and puppet, which may be fragile and complex, leading to problems if the primary developer leaves. The discussion delves into the complexities of deploying job scheduling, autoscaling and distributing traffic, problems that Kubernetes can provide default solutions for. The article includes comments from various individuals on the difficulties of using bespoke scripts pre-Kubernetes, as well as the benefits of Kubernetes in managing deployments whilst promoting good industry practices.The debate around the difficulty of Kubernetes has resurfaced on Hacker News. While some users criticize it for being over-complicated and difficult to implement, others argue that it's only as hard as each individual case makes it. The consensus seems to be that Kubernetes is a powerful tool for large distributed systems that can be tricky to set up, but once in place, it helps to reduce the workload and enables teams to scale efficiently. However, it requires problem-solving and technical knowledge to use it effectively, and the trade-off depends on each project's specific needs. Ultimately, Kubernetes's popularity suggests that it still provides many benefits that make it worthwhile.",

        "content": "This article discusses the pitfalls of using cheap solid-state drives (SSDs). The author benchmarked several cheap SSDs against a faster, more expensive model and found that while the cheap SSDs performed well for initial writes, sustained write performance could be very slow. The author argues that sustained write performance is an important consideration for users who want to copy large files or download games. The article highlights the importance of volume of data written as compared to the total capacity of the drive, and notes that writing more than half the drive in one operation is a rare use case. It concludes that buyers should be aware of the pitfalls of cheap SSDs and consider investing in a more expensive model.The HN thread discusses strategies for using SSDs at scale. One recommended approach is to use consumer-grade SATA SSDs paired with efficient file-systems that limit writes to limit wear and tear. The thread also suggests using enterprise-grade drives, which offer much higher TBW rates, have more overprovisioning, and don't do SLC caching. Several specific models of SSD brands like Sandisk and Samsung are recommended for their reliability and longevity. Users in the thread also discuss the performance limitations of cheaper SSDs and the importance of buying models with higher storage tiers to avoid performance issues. Other topics include kernel tuning and configuring file-system settings to optimize SSD speeds.An article has highlighted the limitations of cheap solid-state drives (SSDs), stating that they can be up to 25 times slower than high-end models. Comparisons tested an expensive Crucial SSD against a succession of cheap ones, with the worst achieving a maximum write speed of 46MB/s. The article claims that these are essentially USB sticks with SATA connectors attached. By comparison, a hard drive offered similar speeds on sequential writes. However, the piece noted that such scenarios where large amounts of sequential information would need to be written to a drive would be rare for most users. The SSDs tested were found to be better for random read throughput in real-world use.Cheap SSDs can overwhelm the entire system and slow it down. A user attested that downloading games on Steam over a good connection and using an inexpensive solid-state drive (SSD) can result in overwhelming the drive and causing the entire system to become unusably slow. It is not an uncommon situation among the gaming community. Windows is more prone to this than other operating systems because of its anti-virus software. Moreover, it has a slow file system, and SLC caching is not present in server SSDs. Ingesting large datasets on cheap SSDs is not advisable. When it comes to its speed, it's better to use an HDD than a cheap SSD. However, except for a few specialized uses, expensive SSDs are unnecessary.headline.Cheap solid-state drives (SSDs) can have atrocious sustained write performance, despite their low prices, according to an experiment carried out by Dutch software engineer Louwrentius. After running benchmarks on a series of low-cost SSDs, as well as his own Crucial MX500 1TB SATA drive, Louwrentius found the quality of write performance was impacted by caching, flash memory and a lack of double data rate random access memory to speed up drive mapping. He noted that sustained write performance was particularly important to remote desktop users and data scientists or other data-intensive professionals. Read performance of the devices was shown to be unaffected.The author of a blog post on Louwrentius stated that cheap SSDs show bad sustained write performance. The Crucial 1TB SSD is more expensive but shows the best sustained throughput when compared to other cheaper brands such as the ADATA, PNY, and Verbatim SSDs which showed flakey behaviour and terrible sustained write performance. The Kingston A400 comes close to the Crucial SSD in sustained write speed, while the other cheaper brands have intermittent drops in performance. However, even the Kingston could not saturate gigabit Ethernet. The author concludes that good SSD write performance is not a given, especially for cheaper drives, and recommends a hard drive over a cheap SSD if ingesting a lot of data. The intent of the post was to demonstrate with actual benchmarks the performance of cheaper SSDs.",

        "content": "A discussion on Hacker News about Rust's async ecosystem, specifically around the issue of functions that depend on being called within a certain executor. Some users are frustrated that this is not documented in the type at all, leading to confusion and unexpected errors. Others suggest solutions, such as using implicit parameters (a.k.a. typed dynamic scoping) or implementing functionality like autopropagation. There is also debate about whether Rust should allow inferred function return types in order to reduce verbosity, or if explicit signatures are necessary to maintain a contract between callers and functions. Some users compare Rust's explicit signatures favorably to the default algebraic notation in languages like Haskell and OCaml, while others find it limiting in certain cases.Rust's type system requires clear function signatures, which act as the source of truth for the codebase. Other statically-typed languages may not require such explicit type signatures. The signature provides a useful and necessary tool for creating complex systems, particularly when working with complex data structures. Lifetimes can complicate these signatures, but the overall benefit is that they allow developers to trust their code and avoid confusing error messages. Other statically-typed languages, such as Haskell, may include type inference, but still require explicit type declarations for clarity and ease of use. The clarity provided by Rust's type system is particularly important given the reinforcement it provides for the language's goals.Rust's design principle of \"the signature is the contract,\" is critical to its success. This principle means that Rust always prioritizes a function's signature over its body. As a result, Rust does not infer function signatures, meaning the signature must be explicitly declared for every function. While this can lead to more verbose code, it has the advantage of making analysis and modularity easier, as everything needed for memory safety is described in the function's signature. However, this design principle can also lead to issues with partial borrowing and mutators, as the signature implies exclusive borrowing of self. Overall, while Rust's signature rule can lead to some difficulties, it is a critical aspect of the language's success.Rust's borrowing and type checking system prevent \"aliasing,\" which is when a mutable reference overlaps with another mutable reference, leading to bad programming practices. By using signatures that indicate two mutable references to different integers, Rust ensures that there is no aliasing and avoids errors elsewhere in the codebase. However, this can make accessors/mutators awkward and force programmers to pay more attention to signatures rather than bodies when trying to sort something out. The system also affects relationships between types and Test Driven Development (TDD), which will be discussed later. There have been proposals to fix this pain point, but it remains a challenge.",

Some comments suggest that this limit is in place to discourage Drive\u2019s usage as a storage backend for software. Rather it is built for \u201chuman\u201d usage, which is reflected in the pricing, while specialist storage solutions should be used for high use-case scenarios. It is also said that the limitations are documented, but the 5m file limit is not presently mentioned. Some suggest that a limit well beyond this one isn't required, and it could be unreasonable to list every detail of a product's use-case. Drive is described by one person as a document sharing and storage system, rather than file storage, and it's suggested that if large numbers of files are to be stored, then Google\u2019s Cloud Storage service should be used.Google Drive is popular for personal and enterprise use as a cloud storage solution. However, it seems that unlimited storage for the education sector has been rescinded and quotas will soon be imposed. This has prompted speculation on whether this is coming soon for other sectors. While individual use can be manageable, some researchers and labs have stored tens of thousands of files, reaching close to the 5 million file limit. Despite its popularity, Drive has limitations and is sometimes used for data storage that would be better suited to other cloud services. There are also concerns about the reliance on Google and issues around data privacy, with some users opting for alternative cloud storage services.Google Drive has implemented a hard limit of 5 million files for storage, a restriction that was not mentioned anywhere prior to the change. This limit affects all users, including those who pay for storage plans of up to 30TB. The implementation of the limit was questioned by users, with some speculating that it may be an implementation detail between Drive and static storage to preserve credentials, while others suggested that it could be a design decision made without considering the needs of users. There is also an arbitrary limit of 400,000 for shared drives, but it can be overcome by creating more. The apparent lack of documentation and communication by Google has left some users feeling frustrated.Google Drive is implementing a hard limit of 5 million total files for all accounts, including Google Workspace, with the rollout expected to be completed by March 2022. Currently, users who hit the limit will be unable to add additional files to their account until they delete files or purchase additional storage. Some users have already reported hitting the limit, with one user attributing their file count to their use of Google Drive as a storage backend for geospatial artifacts, while another user reported using Google Drive for legacy tools and generating reports with millions of files. The limit has sparked criticism from some users, with one developer suggesting it may be due to technical debt resulting from \"an API-esque approach to document storage that grew into a monstrosity.\"",

        "content": "Scientists have discovered how tardigrades, also known as water bears, can survive extreme conditions, such as being dried out for years, boiled, frozen, and exposed to radiation. The creatures have \u201cdesiccation tolerance protein\u201d (TDP) genes that produce proteins that protect animals\u2019 cells from dehydration during extreme desiccation. If these proteins are inserted into yeast or bacteria, the organisms also become far more desiccation-resistant. Scientists hope to make more drought-resistant plants and crops by copying tardigrades' genes. A warning was made using comments about the potential for the discovery to be used maliciously. If bacteria were made as desiccation-tolerant as tardigrades, this could result in pandemics with bacteria able to survive even after vaccines had been developed.Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that allows tardigrades, also known as \"water bears,\" to survive extreme conditions such as dehydration. They are able to turn themselves into a \"glass\" state, which preserves their cellular structures until they can rehydrate. The process is known as vitrification, and scientists are studying how it could be replicated in larger organisms for medical purposes, such as for preserving organs for transplant. The study found that tardigrades have specific proteins that enable the transition into this \"glass\" state. However, while the discovery could lead to numerous medical applications, some have raised concerns about the potential for the research to be used to create \"hand-sanitizer-proof\" viruses.Scientists have discovered why tardigrades, often called water bears, are able to\u00a0survive all sorts of extreme, punishing conditions, despite being less than 1 millimetre\u00a0tall. Tardigrades\u00a0can withstand\u00a0the vacuum of space, extreme radiation, boiling, very cold conditions and even survive without water for\u00a0a decade. Following an assessment of how water bears survive severe\u00a0dehydration, scientists discovered that\u00a0when they are in a completely dried-out state, they\u00a0freeze-dry themselves into glass. By analysing the genes\u00a0activated during this process, scientists\u00a0discovered that the creatures' cells produce a certain protein,\u00a0named tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins, which allows the cells to coat themselves\u00a0with the glass-like substance, preserving their cells until reintroduced to water.",

        "content": "The debate over remote work versus returning to the office has sparked discussion about the issues surrounding commuting. Commenters on a recent article suggest that the real problem is the urban planning of the United States, which has led to suburbs that are far away from jobs and inadequate public transit options. While some argue in favor of building transit to the suburbs, others point out that this would not solve the entrenched problems of urban and suburban planning that have led to an overreliance on cars and a lack of walkability. Additionally, some commenters express concerns about safety and public disorder in urban areas, which make the prospect of returning to the office unappealing regardless of the commute.The debate around remote work continues, with supporters citing the productivity benefits and detractors pointing to the need for social interaction and the communal atmosphere of an office. One contributor noted that many US cities are overly congested and that commuting is a poor use of time. Furthermore, tech companies that rely on in-person meetings, such as Microsoft and Apple, are having to rethink their approach. A few remote workers commented that they now have more time to focus, socialise with fewer people but at a deeper level, and engage with their communities more fully. One of the advantages of remote work highlighted by several contributors was flexible and non-committal workspaces, with university towns cited as a model.The article and comments are discussing the challenges and trade-offs of working remotely. Some people are finding that working remotely has allowed them to save money and enjoy a better work-life balance, as they no longer have to deal with long commutes, expensive office space, or the distractions of the office. Others feel that remote work can be isolating and that it is harder to separate work from home life. There is also a discussion about the cost of living in different areas and how much people are willing to pay to live closer to their work. Finally, there is a discussion about who pays for the expenses related to working from home and whether or not employers should be responsible for providing their employees with office space and equipment.A recent article in The Atlantic claims that working from home has turned Americans \u201csoft.\u201d The article argues that employees have become complacent, preferring the easy option of working from home rather than putting in the time and effort required in the office. However, many people on the thread have refuted this argument, pointing out that remote work is often more productive than working from the office, and that many people lack the luxury of having a dedicated, quiet space to work from at home. Some have also criticized the author\u2019s use of outdated and discriminatory language, such as the suggestion that Americans are \u201csoft\u201d compared to Chinese workers. Others argue that a hybrid approach, where employees have the option to work from home or the office, is most beneficial.In a New York Times op-ed, investor and former Obama adviser Steven Rattner argues that remote work threatens economic growth and prosperity. He suggests that workers have gone soft and that Americans lack a work ethic, comparing it unfavorably to that of the Chinese. Others, however, disagree with Rattner's assessment, citing studies that show remote workers to be productive and communicative when given the right tools and support. Some executives lament the lack of in-person interaction and believe that remote work hinders relationship-building and company culture. But many believe that boards' duty to focus on shareholder value ultimately trumps intangible benefits of traditional office culture, and that remote work is here to stay.In a recent article, Steven Rattner discussed the benefits of going back to the office full-time. He suggested that the growing prosperity should allow for more leisure time as productivity increased, but instead, we chose to keep working to enjoy greater material rewards. However, for many Americans, working from home is not a comfortable pullback enabled by prosperity, but a frantic necessity in its absence due to increasing costs for key expenses such as housing, child care, health care, and higher education. The middle-class squeeze is loosening its grip slightly due to the pandemic, but many are still struggling financially. Rattner's view that workers are choosing free time over surplus income is not applicable to many, as they have little or no money available to pay for services of household convenience. In conclusion, returning to the office full-time may be a cultural rather than a financial reservation.",

        "content": "The Hacker News thread discusses the use of JSON for linking data and the challenges that arise from semantic web technology, specifically scenarios with link rot and inaccessibility. Some argue that Plow could offer a solution, with a public index and checksummed artifacts, working similarly to the Cargo model for easy mirroring. Others express frustration that, despite the benefits of a semantic web or linked data, there are few incentives for individuals or teams to invest extra time to adopt this technology in a siloed working environment. However, some companies like Field 33 are building tools that allow for a graph-first approach and flexibility in collaboration, using Plow as an ontology package manager. The lack of tangible benefits and slow advancements in the field are seen as potential reasons for the slow adoption of semantic web technology in companies.The commenter laments the lack of good tools for working with graphs, which are a rare sight compared to documents and spreadsheets. They suggest a tool like Airtable but for graphs, where it's easy to start with spreadsheets and columns relating to each other and then view the graph alongside it. The commenter believes that hierarchies and categories are preferred over graphs because graphs appear as a complicated mess. They also discuss the complexity of semantic web and RDF, where JSON-LD is an open standard for expressing RDF data as JSON. Some commenters discuss the difficulty of working with variables that could be URLs or entire object trees in JSON-LD, but others refute the claim that it's a reason why ActivityPub hasn't taken off.The article discusses the use of JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) in Go's type system for handling data. The author mentions that relevant middleware and controllers should handle link type and transformation, freeing business-logic from the task of worrying about whether a link is a null or a struct. Several users raise concerns regarding the use of JSON-LD, with some arguing that it has little to no advantage over alternatives such as XML, while others suggest that it is a useful tool for creating ontologies and knowledge-graphs. Additionally, some users question the usefulness of ontologies and linked data in today's AI industry, suggesting that deep learning approaches have rendered the field obsolete.JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format that helps organize and connect data, creating a better web. Linked Data empowers people to publish and use information on the web, creating a network of machine-readable data across websites. JSON-LD is easy for humans to read and write and is based on the already successful JSON format, providing a way to help JSON data interoperate at web-scale. JSON-LD is ideal for programming environments, REST web services, and unstructured databases such as Apache CouchDB and MongoDB. The JSON-LD Playground is a web-based viewer and debugger that serves as a helpful tool for learning JSON-LD, visualizing, debugging, and sharing JSON-LD markup. JSON-LD is available in a variety of popular programming environments and follows the official JSON-LD specifications.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35332537",
        "content": "A discussion on Hacker News considers the possibility of an \"AI winter,\" where progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) is thwarted by various limitations. One poster suggests that there is a limit to the amount of internet data available for mining, that processing power for large language models (LLMs) is limited and costly, that people will guard their data more, and that workable theories for AGI are lacking. Another poster argues that the advent of generative AIs will pose a threat, causing a major breakdown in trust and overwhelming spam, grifts, and fake news. Further comments suggest that video content and embodied learning are underexplored areas, and that the reliance on statistical optimization through gradient descent needs to be challenged with fundamental breakthroughs, such as reimagined neuron models. Overall, the discussion highlights the potential obstacles and ethical considerations for the future of AI.An article discussing potential obstacles to the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) has attracted a range of user comments on Hacker News. Commentators dispute some of the reasons given in the article, such as the idea that people will stop sharing data with companies, the view that there are no new workable theories to develop AGI, or the suggestion that AI models will endlessly recycle their own input data. Others offer different approaches, such as applying a combination of symbolic logic and neural networks or allowing AI to learn via interaction with the world, instead of just accessing a large corpus of test data. The article and comments share the perspective that the path to achieving fully functioning AGI remains challenging and likely to take much longer than optimists predict.The article discusses the hype around AI and its potential to change the world, drawing comparisons to the hype around cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Some commenters express skepticism, citing past failed predictions about AI. Others argue that AI has already had a significant impact, albeit unequally distributed. Some suggest that the development of multimodal GPT models could enable significant advancements in autonomous vehicles. The article cautions against blindly believing in the hype around AI and emphasizes the importance of balancing excitement about potential advancements with a level-headed examination of current limitations and challenges.The discussion revolves around the future of AI, with some arguing that the future is already here, while others remain skeptical. While GPT-4 shows great promise, some believe that it's still uncertain whether the current architecture can keep scaling up. The challenges do not involve hardware at this point, but changes in architecture, some of which could require significantly different hardware. They hope for the development of new and even more successful architectures, but guaranteeing the future is difficult. The amount of money going into AI could lead to a development of new and successful architectures which are essential for making progress. They acknowledge the insecurity and lack of job security that AI generates for some individuals. Though AI is the new interface revolution, and it is good for everyone to consider what they want to do about it.Despite the hype around AI, some are unconvinced that its latest developments are worth the excitement. While some prominent AI advancements, such as self-driving cars, appeared to stall, other recent advances are undeniably impressive. For instance, AI-generated digital images from natural language descriptions, the Copilot that suggests code and entire functions, and the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that can generate textual content, including chatbots. However, some experts warn that the current hype around GPT-4 could lead to another AI winter when progress stalls or fails to meet expectations. Additionally, AI advancements will require significant changes in business processes, which may not happen as quickly or automatically as anticipated. Overall, caution is necessary when assessing the true impact and potential of AI.Despite concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) hitting another \"winter,\" some experts say it's unlikely. An article in the Hugging Face journal argued that as long as people don't set unrealistic expectations, there's no reason AI should hit another winter like in the early 90s. Unlike the hype cycle of that era, the internet has already shown that AI is a proven technology, and it's being used to massive success in ChatGPT, and it has plenty of room to grow. The technology is continually advancing in areas like natural language processing (NLP), multisensory inputs like sound, image, and temperature, and more. As one expert put it, \"ML technology is moving forward much faster than we anticipated.\"The author argues that the use of language models to sum numbers is pointless because there are better ways to optimize for this type of manipulation. Additionally, there is concern that AI may hit a ceiling when it comes to incorporating causality. Some commentators suggest that we may run out of high-quality data, while others point out that this is unlikely given the prevalence of data in modern society. There is also concern that people may resent the capabilities of AI, resulting in a decreased investment in the technology. However, others argue that people will become accustomed to AI's quirks and accept them as part of its abilities. Finally, there is speculation about a new floating number format, the posit, that could significantly impact AI processing in the future.Advancements in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are being driven by both the availability of compute and data, according to experts. Large datasets produced by human labelers coupled with larger and more efficient LLMs are driving major leaps in AI. Despite this, researchers suggest that limitations on the quality of data and compute are impeding further progress. Recent progress in AI, particularly in LLMs, has raised concerns for some researchers that the technology is advancing so quickly that its limits are not yet fully understood, leading to speculation of possible \u201cAI winters\u201d when progress is stagnated by limitations. However, others remain optimistic about the potential for continued advancements in AI.The article discusses concerns surrounding AI and its potential impact on industries and economies. While innovation in specialized matrix multiplication hardware remains the key focus, factors such as supply chain collapse and regulatory issues could hinder progress. The distributed training of neural networks across thousands of machines can continue despite the limitations of Moore's law and low single-core performance. However, countries may resort to lethal military force if the technology poses a threat to their global dominance. While some believe that regulation may be an issue, others suggest that the US's capitalistic approach might override consumer livelihood. Various examples, such as the impact of the opioid epidemic on company profits, show that corporate entities often prioritize revenue over the concerns of the public.The article argues that an AI winter may be coming, referring to a period of decreased interest and funding for artificial intelligence. The author cites concerns over the limitations and ethical concerns of large language models like ChatGPT, as well as the high cost of training and maintaining these models. However, commenters push back against this notion, arguing that AI has already proven to be transformative and useful in various industries. They also note that while there may be a decrease in funding and interest, it is unlikely that AI research and development will completely stop. Overall, opinions are split on the potential for another AI winter.William Eden predicts a new AI winter, citing reasons such as the lack of reliability and inscrutability of AI systems, limited scalability due to hardware limitations, and the potential lack of profitability. However, he acknowledges that there is substantial demand for AI systems such as ChatGPT and generative models, which could be profitable within a year or two. Eden states that if AI winter does happen, the likely reasons would be scaling hitting a wall, deep-learning-based models unable to generalize out-of-distribution, or insufficient data. The two previous AI winters were caused by failures to produce formidable results and unmet expectations. While Moore's Law is weakening, there are other areas of improvement such as increased willingness to spend and algorithmic progress, and Eden predicts transformative AI systems could be developed by 2040.discussion around the potential limits of Moore's Law, there are still options for continued hardware performance improvements for training AI models. If these improvements continue, there is a greater likelihood of achieving transformative AI in the next few decades. However, there are many factors beyond theoretical peak performance that influence the affordability and availability of compute for AI labs. While AI systems may be unreliable when it comes to more complex tasks, they are highly motivated to use them, and regulation is less of a factor compared to safety-critical industries like autonomous driving. Overall, the potential for TAI and other AI advancements is still significant, but progress may not be as linear or predictable as some may hope.Investors are doubtful that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be created soon, as most want a return on their investment in under 10 years. They instead expect tools that will speed up labour, automate common tasks, and make new types of services and products possible. OpenAI foresees $1 billion in revenue by 2024, with a subscription fee of $20/month for its ChatGPT Plus, which has been reported to have reached 100 million monthly active users within two months. As costs of hardware and inference compute decrease and better models become available, current companies hyping products based on foundation models such as GPT-3 or GPT-4 could become obsolete. While an AI winter may occur via reasons such as scaling hitting a wall or AI becoming unreliable, an AI winter within a decade is deemed unlikely.The article discusses the amount of data needed to train large language models (LLMs) and the feasibility of using human labor to generate it. It is suggested that OpenAI, which trained Chinchilla on 1.4T tokens, could afford to pay approximately 88 laborers to generate 173M words per year, equivalent to 0.016% of the Chinchilla dataset. However, this would still take over 6,000 years to double the size of the dataset. It is noted that a writer can generate between 500 to 1,500 words per hour and work 9 hours a day, about 21 days per month. The article concludes that training large language models requires massive amounts of data, and it's unlikely that human labor can generate the data needed to double the dataset in a reasonable time frame.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35327743",
        "content": "The use of Docker-compose.yml as a universal infrastructure interface has been questioned by development professionals. Some have likened the Kubernetes API as a leaky abstraction over several different concepts, and believe that using Docker-compose on top of that makes things worse. They argue that even when creating Ingresses, one of the examples provided, the lack of the same Ingress concept in Docker-compose creates a leaky problem that cannot be solved by adding labels. Since Kubernetes is designed to run in a certain way, anything outside of stateless web services that require different classes of storage volumes, for instance, creates inconsistencies within the system, exposing the leakiness of Docker-compose as a universal infrastructure interface.Developers are discussing the limitations of Kubernetes YAML manifests and exploring alternative solutions for creating infrastructure using code. Some common complaints include too much complexity, too many opinions, and a lack of composability. Some potential solutions discussed included using already established languages like Nim or Lua for configuration and stripping the runtime to a minimal set of features. Other suggestions include using higher-level abstractions to hide unnecessary detail or importing a JSON file into an actual programming language for dynamically parameterizing configurations. However, there is no clear solution at this time, and each option has its own downsides and limitations.The author suggests that instead of using complex systems like Kubernetes and Docker-Compose, developers should focus on simple abstractions that map X to Y. They propose using something like Nix or defining it as a common python value, which would streamline the process by removing unnecessary layers that aren't helpful. Additionally, they suggest using templates that could be transpiled into Kubernetes manifests, but caution against using Docker-Compose.yaml files, which can be lacking in key information. The article sparks a debate in the comments section about the usefulness and complexity of cloud-based technology versus running programs as normal processes. Some disagree that complexity is bad, but rather that non-leaky abstractions and reasonable defaults can make it manageable. Others propose solutions like Terraform or higher level abstractions built on top of helm and terraform to simplify and speed up the process for developers.Ergomake believes that docker-compose.yml is a versatile format that can be used as a universal infrastructure language for Kubernetes. This allows developers who do not need the level of control that Kubernetes manifests offer to use a higher-level abstraction format. However, the more control an individual needs, the less they can abstract away. Therefore, it is necessary to give different abstractions to different teams. Platform architecture teams develop APIs for developers to interact with platforms, creating a clear interface. Here, developers can use lower-level abstractions, which hide more detail. In contrast, SREs and DevOps professionals have access to lower-level abstractions. This approach ensures the platform can be built efficiently and enables developers to focus more on value creation. The author suggests that docker-compose could be the standard interface and accelerate innovation by allowing open-source implementations built by individuals or pioneering corporations.Decoupling interfaces from implementations is crucial, freeing up engineers from creating redundant infrastructure by building value on top of existing standardized APIs, such as docker-compose files. Docker's format successfully abstracts away useless details, allowing developers to focus on describing containers that interact with each other. Plus, docker-compose can be run locally, reducing the number of configuration files the developers have to handle. Docker Swarm confuses an interface with an implementation, restricting users' ability to bring their implementations. The future lies in developers building value on top of standardized APIs, leading to fewer platform engineers, allowing them to be creative and innovative. Ergomake is implementing ephemeral environments that utilize docker-compose files as an interface, soon to be open-source. Developers, engineers, investors, and the curious can help build that future by booking a slot or contacting Lucas Costa via email or Twitter.",

It is an open-source (Apache 2.0) and side-effect-free language that is a simple extension of JSON, with a familiar syntax. Jsonnet can eliminate duplication with object-orientation and integrate with existing/custom applications, generating JSON, YAML, INI, and other formats. It also supports functions for more complex use cases. Jsonnet's stated aim is to be a superset of JSON, making it relatively easy to take existing JSON and turn it into templates. It is used by many companies and projects and is not an official Google product.",

The tool consists of only five commands, allowing users to write new records or notes, see current tasks, build a static HTML page displaying a single timeline of tasks and notes, and open the directory where records are stored. The data is stored as CSV files in ~/tsr, making it easy to integrate with other tools or custom analysis and visualization. It works offline and solely depends on Python3. The tool is a plugin for macOS launchers Alfred and Raycast. User feedback suggested providing links to these launchers and clarifying the tool's intent upfront. Other HN commenters shared their unique time-tracking tools and methods.The author has created a simple csv-based time tracker for Raycast and Alfred that is easy to use and encourages users to think about how they spend their time. It interrupts users for a second and asks them to write down the fact they are jumping to another task. The tool functions best with Raycast, which the author thinks is the best tool of its kind, but the author is considering finding a way to integrate it into Windows launchers. Other users have recommended alternative time-tracking tools such as Tyme, ActivityWatch, and gtimelog. Additionally, there is a discussion about using org mode and VimOrganizer for task-based time tracking. The author also suggested that it would be possible to modify the code to push the notes into the Daily Obsidian note with timestamps.TSR is a low-overhead time recorder that allows users to record and visualize their work time. It uses a simple two-column CSV format to record datetime and tags. TSR makes it easy to mark context switches and write notes as users work, which can help them measure real productivity and pinpoint productivity sinks. The tool offers several options, including TSR (record), TSN (note), TSL (latest), TSV (view), and TSE (edit). TSR's primary advantage is that it is a CSV-based, linear time recorder that doesn't keep user data hostage. It is available as an Alfred and Raycast workflow and can be installed with a few simple steps.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35332314",
        "content": "The article discusses the default option for Single Page Applications (SPAs) compared to Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) when navigating between pages. The author argues that defaulting to the MPA model can provide a better user experience by utilizing page-to-page prerendering. While SPAs can also incorporate this feature, it requires additional framework support and can lead to performance issues. The discussion in the comments section focuses on the debate between SPAs and MPAs, with opinions ranging from the view that they are nearly equivalent to the opinion that SPAs should only be used for web apps and MPAs should be used for web pages. The discussion also touches on the benefits and drawbacks of using GraphQL and React in web development.Vue has reactive() and ref() as alternatives to heavyweight state management paradigms, but they are convincing many developers that they need MobX or reactive objects like those in Solid. The ergonomics of binding events and setting attributes/properties/styles can be accomplished without state management paradigms, as demonstrated by Lit, snabbdom, and Svelte. While React is hyped, the introduction and absorption of flux architecture has changed how vanilla JavaScript is written. Simply using the tool with the largest community isn't always the best option. The shift to SPAs occurred around the time mobile browsing became the norm and websites got more complex. SPAs provide slower first page load but faster navigation. Marketshare of React and other SPAs may have been influenced by cargo culting or the appeal of pushing complex tasks to the client.The article argues that, while many developers have shifted to building single page applications (SPAs), traditional multi-page applications (MPAs) offer several benefits including better accessibility, more inclusive and robust design, energy efficiency, privacy protection, and improved SEO rankings. The author notes that large JavaScript bundles remain a major challenge in single page applications, and recommends using server rendering, client rendering, or a combination of the two to reduce their size. The article also highlights the View Transition API, available on Chrome, as a promising new development that could make MPAs more competitive with SPAs. Several commenters add their own perspectives on this ongoing debate, discussing issues ranging from screen reader compatibility to the challenges of upgrading monolithic all-in-one frameworks.The article argues that single page applications (SPAs) are not an ideal default for building websites. Instead, the author suggests using a full page navigation model, which is typically used by site generators focused on performance. The benefits of using this model include faster empty-cache performance, better accessibility and preservation of scroll position, inclusivity, energy-efficiency, and privacy. While SPAs have some performance advantages such as future navigations and transition animations, these benefits come at the cost of large JavaScript bundles which can be costly to site performance. The article concludes that web developers should consider using a full page navigation model as the default architecture for building websites.The Next.js application framework has good Core Web Vitals with lower scores than the web average of 40%. Users looking for alternatives for SPA benefits without its drawbacks can use View Transitions API or Predictive Prefetching which speeds up navigations. Quicklink is a small JavaScript library that implements prefetching for spurring faster navigations. However, there are trade-offs. Manuel Matuzovi\u0107 is not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications, while Jake Archibald points out that SPA navigation may be slower than MPA navigation. Netflix functions without TypeScript, which is considered a good thing by Jake Archibald. It's worth noting which has a better FMP: 8.5 MB HTML or one SPA-rendered tweet.

        "content": "After a decade, the small group of Amish living in South Dakota is moving on, creating concern for local farmers who will lose their reliable labor force. A discussion on Hacker News suggested that the Amish approach to technology and skepticism about its benefits could be a useful lesson for society. However, some pointed out that the Amish idea of \u201cbetter\u201d is rooted in religion, which might not be suitable for everyone. Others questioned whether the Amish have an idealized view of the past and argued that what truly makes people happy is purpose and relationships, and not material goods. Some comments also discussed the challenges that come with leaving the Amish community, such as adult baptism and abandoning everything one has known.A discussion on Hacker News centered on the existence of a \"large\" community of \"detransitioners.\" One user argued that the supposed size of the community was largely the result of conservative news organizations keen to put them on air, while another countered that the claims of the detransitioners should not be invalidated on the basis of their small numbers. Other posts touched on religious communities, and whether or not it was fair to paint entire groups in a bad light based on a few bad experiences. Detractors reacted negatively to the suggestion that Catholic communities were \"fine people\" given the reported child abuse scandals within the Church.The discussion thread touches on the regret rate of transitioning, which is significantly lower than other medical interventions due to the extensive process before making any permanent changes. Participants also compare the treatment of de-transitioners to regret among people who have had knee or hip replacements, seemingly suggesting that the issue of regret is not specific to transitioning. Additionally, some comments bring up the controversial topic of trans rights, with some claiming that the negativity towards the trans community is largely fueled by conservatives. The discussion veers off-topic with some comments discussing the pros and cons of Amish living and an ongoing debate about when technological progress should be frozen.The Amish community's resistance to change is driven by religious beliefs and a 40-year-old Supreme Court ruling that freezes them in place. Some tech enthusiasts believe that the Amish have thoroughly considered technology and wish to emulate them. However, a closed-off, hierarchical community is something that is not necessarily desirable. The community adheres to a lifestyle that is typical of the 19th century, including the use of horse-drawn buggies and homes with no electricity. Critics say that the community's adherence to educating their children only through the eighth grade is abusive as it keeps them under control. The community has a reputation for puppy mills, and there are talks of rampant sexual and domestic abuse. Despite these flaws, the Amish culture has succeeded in maintaining stability, simplicity, authentic connections, and happiness. Outsiders can join the community through conversion, but it is rare.The success of Amish communities in maintaining stability, despite their \"archaic\" and \"depressive\" lifestyle, has been attributed to characteristics such as sex within marriage, no divorce, marriage and sex for procreation, reliance on extended family and local community, social isolation, and religion as a unifying principle. In contrast, hippy communes are often founded by individuals who lose interest or leave, leading to a breakdown of community values. However, some argue that the longevity of Amish communities is not necessarily a positive trait, as leaving the community results in shunning and loss of support. Furthermore, the emphasis on tradition and blind faith in tradition may not align with values of innovation and progress. The success of religious communes versus secular ones has also been questioned.Discussion about the success/failure of communes, using the Amish community as an example of a successful communal lifestyle. Various factors are discussed, including the importance of a shared belief system or religion, the challenges of maintaining self-sufficiency, and the potential for abuse and control in isolated communities. Some commenters also note the difficulty of leaving a communal lifestyle if an individual has been raised within it and has little exposure to the outside world. The discussion also mentions successful long-term communes, such as The Farm in Tennessee and Twin Oaks in Virginia, and the idea that success is often determined by a community's ability to sustain itself over multiple generations.South Dakota's only Amish community, which consists of nine families and 60 people and was established in 2010, is set to move elsewhere due to an aversion to technology, a deep focus on family and generally reclusive nature limiting their socializing potential. Some of the community's homes are listed on Zillow, and an auction is scheduled for April 28. This will end the group's first venture into South Dakota. The Amish are part of the Anabaptist Christian movement, closely related to the Mennonites and more distantly connected to the Hutterites. They first arrived in the United States in the 1720s, initially landing in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which remains the largest single community of Amish in the nation, numbering around 30,000.The Tripp Amish community, consisting of six families, moved to South Dakota from Wisconsin to find more affordable and available land. Rudy Borntreger, a conservative bishop and father of 14, spoke of the community's practice of adopting technology thoughtfully, weighing the potential negative effects against any benefits. Despite avoiding many modern conveniences, the Amish have found integration in local businesses and life easier in South Dakota. The Amish have left a favorable impression on local businesses, praised for their skills, work ethic, and respectful manner. Borntreger emphasized the importance of maintaining strong family structures, even mentioning a fondness for state governor Kristi Noem's family values, though the Amish do not vote.",

        "content": "Hazim Nada, a successful American commodities trader, found himself the target of a covert smear campaign by an entire country, likely Qatar. It began with an impersonator obtaining copies of his call history and asking for banking details. It then escalated with Nada receiving \u201canonymous\u201d letters that spread false rumors about him and his company. These lies ultimately destroyed his business. However, in 2019, hackers provided Nada with terabytes of files exposing the covert campaign against him, revealing the sources of the lies and the individuals and firms that spread them. Private intelligence firms, including a Geneva-based one, played prominent roles. Nada\u2019s story highlights the lengths some countries and corporations may go to undermine competitors and individuals.Hazim Nada, the son of a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Youssef Nada, faced baseless allegations of terrorism and money laundering, which led to the collapse of his oil-trading business, Lord Energy. False accusations arose after Africa Intelligence insinuated Lord Energy had links to terrorism, and a Swiss private intelligence company, Alp Services, filed requests for records about the company and Nada's local mosque. The allegations had no evidence, but World-Check, a database that banks rely on to vet customers, listed both Nada and the company under the \"Terrorism\" risk category, causing five financial institutions to walk away. Despite having his name cleared and sanctions lifted, Youssef Nada, Hazim's father, who ran an Islamic bank, faced similar accusations and sanctions until 2015. Alp Services created by Mario Brero, who defended his business of private intelligence, in a regulatory grey area in Switzerland.Private investigator Nicolas Brero, a former employee of Swiss intelligence agency NDB, who operates Alp Services, may have worked for multiple governments and wealthy clients, from the governments of Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia to Bryan Singer and other billionaires from Russia or Eastern Europe. He also conducted espionage on behalf of French nuclear firm Areva and spying on Greenpeace. Brero, who specializes in \"offensive viral communication campaigns,\" sold call histories and information acquired by illegal means. Alp's clients include oligarchs from the former Soviet Union, politicians and businessmen from small African states, sheikhs, and tycoons from the Middle East. In 2017, Brero was hired by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the ruler of the UAE, to conduct a smear campaign against Qatar, using tactics such as honey traps, in exchange for millions of dollars.A leaked document from an Italian cybersecurity firm reveals how the United Arab Emirates (UAE) hired a computer hacker to orchestrate cyberattacks against Qatar amid a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. The hacker, named Alaa Abdulaziz Al-Siddiq, was hired by the Italian firm, called Memento Labs, to carry out espionage on behalf of Abu Dhabi. Memento Labs allegedly helped Al-Siddiq to access Iranian government sites and acquire confidential documents. The documents unveil a complex network of actors involved in the feud, with Al-Siddiq working alongside private companies, state institutions, and analysts. Among the documents are exchanges between Al-Siddiq and unnamed Emirati managers, as well as reports detailing the hacker\u2019s work for the UAE, including a plan to discredit pro-Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood figures.\nPrivate investigator Nicolas Brero worked on behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to dig up dirt on suspected Islamists across Europe, according to leaked documents recently published by The New Yorker. The UAE paid Brero at least \u20ac5.7m ($6.7m) between August 2017 and June 2020 for the work, which targeted diplomatic, academic, and humanitarian figures with whom the Gulf state disagreed. Brero worked with a range of journalists and scholars who also received payments, primarily to attack the UAE\u2019s chosen targets in the media. One major campaign targeted the International Relief organisation, which was accused of terrorist links based on old social media posts by some of its officials.Private intelligence agency, Alp, was hired by the United Arab Emirates to attack human rights advocates and other perceived enemies. Brero, Alp's founder, employed a mixture of surveillance and propaganda tactics to damage reputations in areas as diverse as the (UN) and the fashion industry. Among Brero's targets was Kamel Jendoubi, the respected director of the UN's commission on human rights in Yemen. Unknown hackers broke into Alp's systems and gained access to Jendoubi\u2019s files along with those connected to 17 other targets. One of those targets, a Swiss billionaire called\u00a0Jean-Pierre Nada, was offered the return of his files by the hackers, who in turn hoped to sell more files to Qatar, but Nada instead leaked them to attorneys, who are considering bringing legal actions.\n",

        "url": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/03/22/online-daters-are-less-open-minded-than-their-filters-suggest",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35330078",
        "content": "Online daters are less open-minded than their filters suggest, according to a discussion on Hacker News. Many users narrow their search filters but may then be limiting their dating options as a result. Some respondents pointed out flaws in dating apps, where questions may not be answered or answered incorrectly, while others suggested that strict filters suppressed the opportunity to discover candidates who may possess more attractive, outside-the-box qualities. One commentator suggested using a scoring system with weighted preferences to improve matches. Another pointed out that settling for strict filters could mean missing out on a good match.The discussion centers around the phenomenon of online dating and the different criteria that people use to select potential matches. One user notes that while OKCupid places a heavy emphasis on education, it is considered socially acceptable for women to set height requirements for their matches, while expressing preferences for cup size or weight is considered body shaming. Another user notes that online dating provides an uncomfortable reflection of one's self-image, and that preferences can often be counteracted by actual behavior. Users express a variety of preferences and filters, with some filtering by age and height, while others find the loosest filters to be the most productive.This discussion centers around the difficulties of online dating, including the challenge of finding suitable matches through filtering and limited profiles, the overwhelming number of options available to women, and the limitations of swiping-based systems. Users note that dating in person provides additional context and removes the limitations of a profile, making it easier to form connections. Additionally, people are picky for different reasons, which can make finding a match that much harder. Some users express frustration with the state of online dating, pointing out issues with scammers, low effort profiles, and the emotional manipulation allowed on some sites. Despite these challenges, many continue to use online dating apps in the hopes of finding a suitable match.Online dating has changed over time, with one commentator reminiscing about when it was more honest and quirky. One aspect of the current scene is how people misrepresent themselves, with one trope being that men who list themselves as 6\u2019 are often just 5\u201910\u201d. In response, the commentator (who is 5\u20193\u201d) was always honest about his height, preferring not to waste time with people who would be uninterested. He acknowledged that being short did shrink his pool of potential partners, but still found meaningful relationships. A 5\u201910\u201d woman claimed that there was a big perceptual difference between talking to someone who is 2\u201d taller and someone who is 1\u201d shorter, while others observed that listing certain traits can act as a \u201cproxy\u201d for other qualities, with hiking being one example.The League dating app is relatively restrictive in its approach and targets high earners who are often deemed too picky. Users deploy racial filters sparingly, with 36% passing through users' filters for black women, compared with 44% for women of other races. However, just 24% of black women are liked as prospects, as opposed to 37% for non-black women. The data collated by The League has prompted discussion on the superficiality of online dating, particularly when it comes to ethnicity and height: a statistical effect size shows that the impact of racial discrimination against black women cannot compete with the impact of an 11 inch difference in male height.An analysis of the dating app, The League, shows that women and men have different search criteria when looking for partners. Data from the app is analysed to show how age, race, and height are used in searches. The article suggests that people want to be seen as \"non-biased, non-discriminatory\", but ultimately, when results matter, they reveal their preferences. The concept of sexual selection is found to be tautological - finding a sexual partner requires discriminating against potential suitors. Ultimately marriage is seen as a process that should at least prompt reflection on whether certain groups have unequal access to it. The general conclusion is that despite dating apps providing a wide variety of potential partners, only a tiny fraction of users will end up matching - discrimination is a fact of the process.Online dating filters are not as open-minded as users claim, according to data from US-based dating site The League. While the company's data shows that many users claim to be open to different groups, when applying filters they tend to rely on traditional dating preferences. Women, in particular, are stricter with their filters than men, excluding 70% of potential matches, compared with 55% for men, often based on height or age. Users with wider filters found matches more frequently than their pickier peers, but still tended to pick matches based on traditional criteria, such as appearance. An Economist report suggested daters might find better matches if they gave a chance to more of the candidates whom they claim to be open to dating.",

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being developed to search for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence in radio signals. Scientists believe that if any signals are found, AI should not make contact with the originating civilization and should only determine the signal\u2019s origin. It is debated whether an exchange between two civilizations would have a greater impact than actually meeting. Furthermore, it is estimated that Earth is polluted with radio waves, meaning that if advanced extraterrestrial civilizations exist, they are probably already aware of life on this planet. Nevertheless, the fact that no proof of such civilizations has been discovered suggests that we may be alone in the universe, or extremely far away from any other form of life. Incorporating elements of science fiction novels, the idea of AI finding ET and hiding it from humans is expressed.A new machine-learning algorithm, created by undergraduate student Peter Ma at the University of Toronto, has successfully cut through terrestrial noise to detect eight unexplained radio signals that could potentially indicate extraterrestrial communication. Although astronomers have been searching for signs of alien intelligence for over six decades, interference from human-made signals has made it difficult to distinguish genuine alien signals. However, Ma's algorithm has mitigated this challenge by sifting through large amounts of\u00a0data to identify non-human signals with characteristics of extraterrestrial communication. This breakthrough in Big Data astronomy could change the SETI scene and pave the way for new methods of extraterrestrial detection.An artificial intelligence (AI) trained to recognize alien radio signals using simulated signals has successfully detected eight candidate signals in data from 820 star-systems collected by the West Virginia\u2019s Green Bank 100-meter radio telescope. The AI was able to sift through more obvious spurious signals, finding candidate signals from five-star systems between 30 and 90 light years from Earth. Although the smart money is still on these signals being terrestrial radio frequency interference that slipped through the filter net, the algorithm is able to detect interesting signals that traditional algorithms miss. SETI scientists are exploring new approaches to identify interesting signals that may vet signals like the anomalous signal detected by Breakthrough Listen in 2019. Researchers are also considering whether machine intelligence, rather than biological life, could be the dominant form of intelligence in the universe.The article suggests that having an artificial general intelligence could help humans communicate with intelligent alien machines, should we discover one in our Solar System. Astrobiologists often study the origin of organic life on Earth to better understand what alien life might be like, but the article suggests that we should also chronicle the origin of artificial intelligence on Earth for the same reason. While this idea may seem like science fiction, the way things are progressing suggests that it may not remain that way for too much longer. The article also mentions the Supercluster Launch Tracker App, which provides information and alerts for space launches.",

        "content": "Users on Hacker News share tips and tricks on how to generate random numbers in Bash. /dev/urandom is the go-to source for randomness in Linux, according to one user. Another user suggests using \"openssl rand\" for cryptographic-quality random number generation in the context of a shell script. The use of $RANDOM is discouraged. Users also shared their own functions and tools for random number generation in Bash, including using dc, bc, and even the openssl rand function to generate strong passwords. The latest version of GNU/Bash, version 5.1, has a new variable called SRANDOM that gets its random data from the system's entropy engine and cannot be reseeded for identical random sequences.This GitHub thread discusses the limitations of using the $RANDOM variable to generate random numbers in Bash and zsh scripts. While $RANDOM generates a random number between 0 and 32767, the discussion reveals that it is not a reliable way to generate random numbers due to its simple modulus function for generating numbers. The thread suggests alternative ways of generating random numbers, such as the openssl rand function, pwgen, and the head -c20 /dev/random | base64 command. The discussion also covers how random numbers in subshells are seeded and the potential for the sequence of random numbers to not be truly random. Overall, the thread recommends avoiding $RANDOM and finding more reliable ways to generate random numbers.The article discusses ways to generate random numbers in Bash and Fish shells. Fish shell has a built-in PRNG, while Bash version 5.1 users can use $SRANDOM. The article provides an example of generating two random integers between 1 and 6 using the command \"shuf -i 1-6 -n 2.\" Another option mentioned in the comments is to use /dev/urandom. The article provides links for more information on using these methods. Overall, the article provides solutions for generating random numbers in these shells.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35325859",
        "content": "A post on Hacker News discusses why European mobile operating systems can never challenge Android and iOS. Commenters suggest that several factors contribute to the EU's struggles in the tech sector, including stringent legal requirements, less investment, cultural differences in terms of entrepreneurial spirit, and the EU single market's limitations. Additionally, some posit that Europe's history and political climate have made it less conducive to establishing successful companies. Some see differences in investor culture as a significant factor: while US investors will invest in an idea to see if it works, European investors prefer to invest in something that's already working. In general, the comments reflect a belief that Europe's struggles in tech extend far beyond the mobile operating system sector alone.The article discusses the concept of at-will employment, which means that employees can be dismissed for any reason without notice in the absence of an employment contract or other governing principle. The comments section includes a discussion on whether or not it is better to start a company in the United States or Europe, with some arguing that the ability to hire and fire at will is an advantage for American businesses. Others argue that access to funding and cultural differences, such as language and currency, are more important factors. The conversation also turns to the potential of remote work and the role of native apps versus PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) in the mobile ecosystem. Some commenters argue that the centralization of apps has created a walled garden that limits innovation and competition.The article discusses a new mobile operating system called /e/OS, which claims to be privacy-focused and \"de-Google\" Android. However, some commenters point out that the approach is not new and has not been successful in the past. There is also discussion around the challenge of creating a successful third mobile operating system, given the dominance of iOS and Android. Some people suggest that a phone with only the top 5-10 apps pre-installed could be a solution, while others point out that the specific apps people need can vary widely. Commenters also discuss the difficulty of creating a third mobile OS due to the lack of a standard BIOS system on phones and the challenges of supporting existing hardware. Some mention alternative mobile operating systems like Sailfish OS.The discussion centers on whether or not younger generations in Europe are \u201clargely English-speaking\u201d due to the influence of the internet. Some argue that only those individuals who studied at university are confident with their English, and English is only used as a second language in EU countries like Germany, France, and Spain. Others counter that, despite variations among European countries, many young people are proficient in English due to their internet usage. However, one member suggests that the data is somewhat misleading because large portions of the older generation in some countries do not use the internet, which skews statistics. Additionally, the conversation touches on the topic of privacy, and while some individuals might protest the use of certain digital tools due to privacy concerns, there is no viable alternative offered to these tools.The article presents a debate about whether /e/ OS, an alternative Android operating system designed to be more privacy-friendly, is trustworthy. One commenter criticizes the German government for using /e/ OS on their smartphones, claiming that the OS is not secure due to the lack of basic security updates and its connections to Google despite advertising otherwise. Another commenter disputes this, arguing that Germany is known for prioritizing privacy and that many businesses in Germany conduct themselves in ways that would be considered tax fraud elsewhere. The article also includes comments on Germans' supposed privacy consciousness and their reluctance toward digital payments, as well as criticism of /e/ OS from someone promoting their own Android fork./e/ OS, a de-Googled Android-based operating system, is challenging Android's dominance with its focus on privacy and open-source software. Developed by French IT entrepreneur Gael Duval, /e/ OS offers users an alternative to the Google Play Store and other Google services that have come under increasing scrutiny for their data privacy policies. Although it still faces challenges with app compatibility and user adoption, /e/ OS represents a shift toward a more open, privacy-focused alternative to traditional mobile operating systems. Experts noted that the key to success for any new mobile OS is solving the app problem, especially around security, which requires government-mandated access rules akin to net neutrality.Supporting multiple mobile operating systems is a complex and costly process for app developers, which can result in lower-quality user experiences. While there are alternative Android flavors available without Google services, supporting them can require a significant investment of time and resources. Google Play Services, which are increasingly necessary for Android apps, also create a lock-in effect, making it difficult to move away from them. Many app developers have become reliant on these services, making it hard to change established processes, even though it may benefit users. Although there are non-Google alternatives available, they have yet to gain significant traction due to the limited demand and convenience factor for users. The only way this could change is if there were a significant market shift or government intervention.The European tech sector is seen as \"pathetic\" by some commentators due to its focus on branding products as \"European\" and \"privacy-focused.\" The potential for a successful third mobile operating system is seen as unlikely, with the dominance of Android and iOS entrenched. However, some argue that the EU's anti-trust laws could work in favour of a new operating system. Elsewhere, Europe is seen as losing ground in the fifth-generation fighter aircraft and reusable rocket markets where established players such as the F-35 and SpaceX are too dominant to be replaced. Despite this, the less rigid nature of the rocket market means companies may yet be able to challenge established players.In an article published on The Next Web, industry analyst Jan Stryjak claimed that a European mobile operating system cannot challenge Android and iOS. He argued that the market is limited to the niche tech population that cares about privacy, and that developing and porting apps to a new OS is too onerous for even well-resourced companies. However, the article overlooked the fact that /e/OS, an Android-based European mobile operating system, is compatible with any mobile application from the Android world. It also includes a privacy score for each application and allows users to cut all trackers in one touch. The author argues that there is a need for regulation to disrupt the\u00a0monopoly of Apple and Google.",
        "summary": "- Factors contributing to the struggles of European mobile operating systems include legal requirements, limited investment, cultural differences, and market limitations\n- Investor culture differences exist between the US and Europe, with US investors more willing to invest in ideas and European investors preferring established success\n- At-will employment is debated as an advantage/disadvantage for starting a company in the US versus Europe\n- Remote work and the role of native apps versus PWAs in the mobile ecosystem are discussed, with some arguing that app centralization limits innovation and competition\n- Creating a successful third mobile operating system faces challenges such as lack of standard BIOS system and supporting existing hardware \n- Debate exists regarding the English-speaking abilities of younger generations in Europe due to internet influence \n- Trustworthiness and privacy concerns are discussed in relation to the alternative mobile operating system /e/ OS, which offers an alternative to Google Play Store and services \n- Supporting multiple mobile operating systems is costly for app developers, leading to a lock-in effect with Google Play Services \n- European tech sector is seen as \"pathetic\" by some, with a successful third mobile operating system unlikely but anti-trust laws potentially working in favor \n- Jan Stryjak argues that developing a new mobile operating system is onerous and limited to niche tech population, but overlooks the compatibility of /e/OS with Android apps and the need for regulation to disrupt Apple and Google's monopoly."

        "content": "Moritz F. F\u00fcrst, a software developer, is undertaking a project to restore the typefaces used in the graphical user interface of the Smalltalk-80 system. Although the fonts used in Smalltalk-80 were a regression from the bespoke designs and elaborate features the PARC Learning Research Group had, several Smalltalk typefaces were axed to replace them with pedestrian ASCII characters.  F\u00fcrst\u2019s project attempts to restore the Smalltalk-80 typefaces, enabling designers to revisit the original PARC interface aesthetics. F\u00fcrst states that \u201cI wanted to know more about its (Smalltalk-80) typefaces and have versions of them for my own use\u201d. Although the original typeface versions are still in their initial stages, they offer a glimpse into the history of software development.\nSmalltalk-80, an early object-oriented programming language, had a unique set of typefaces. Moritz Furst has undertaken the restoration of Sans-Serif10, one of the original Smalltalk-80 typefaces, and created Smalltalk Sans10 and Smalltalk Sans10 Extended, which are available to download. Furst\u00a0reconstructed the glyph shapes and spacing widths from the original Xerox virtual image tape shared by Mario Wolczko. He also found two ligatures - 'fl' and 'ffi.' Smalltalk Sans10 is a faithful restoration of the 10px typeface, while Smalltalk Sans10 Extended includes an extended character set. The downloads include families in BDF, Panic Playdate, TTF, OTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats. Furst hopes to restore the other three typefaces in the future.",
