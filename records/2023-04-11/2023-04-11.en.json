        "hn_content": "Microsoft has fixed a five-year-old Defender bug that reduced Firefox-related CPU use by 75%. The bug was caused by Microsoft Defender, but Firefox was the worst affected due to the sheer number of events it generated, and other anti-virus products caused similar, though less severe, CPU impact. The energy saved from the bug fix could be equivalent to the output of an average coal power plant. One HN user pointed out that tech firms should focus on optimising small, accessible things, instead of agonising over personal CO2 footprints, which are largely irrelevant for companies with billions of users.The discussion on HN revolves around the energy efficiency of web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, with some suggesting that Firefox is more energy-efficient than Chrome due to its efficient GPU-accelerated video playback, while others argue that Chrome's performance rivals or exceeds Firefox's. Some comments explore the possibility of energy savings if everyone used ad-blockers or alternative browsers, while others argue that energy prices are not high enough to incentivize users to optimize their power usage. Ultimately, the conversation highlights the importance of considering energy efficiency in software development and user behavior.The cycle of developers buying new, faster computers and users experiencing a slower performance continues with the exception of AI, video production & animation, and massive cloud services that actually optimize their code. General-purpose computing, however, does not have any meaningful difference between current and older computers, but modern programs won't work well on older versions. There would not be any difference in consumer experience or budget if computers and phones stopped getting faster tomorrow. It is quite limited to throw away a machine's hardware in the laptop and PC space currently. Although not the same for smartphones, the tide seems to be turning too.A bug in Microsoft Defender's anti-virus software has led to increased energy consumption by Firefox, highlighting the inefficiencies of Electron apps. Despite potential drawbacks, one HN user supports the use of Electron if it allows developers to prioritise more significant issues such as crashes, bugs, lost data, and bad usability. Others point out that it is not just a software issue that is straining the environment, advocating for concerns around heated driveways and gaming's potential environmental impact. Meanwhile, users discuss Firefox's lacking compatibility with the Windows cert store and why non-Microsoft browser usage is low at the company.Firefox users on Windows using third-party AV software may experience reduced energy consumption after a recent fix was provided for a bug that caused high CPU usage. While some users noted Firefox is not the only app that causes the issue, calculations suggest a lower average energy consumption of around 250 MW. Microsoft released an update for mpengine.dll on 4 April, so the fix may be available to all. Mozilla engineers were also able to solve an issue resulting in a net improvement for all users, demonstrating open collaboration.An HN user found that turning off YouTube's \"ambient mode\" on Firefox can save 30% CPU on a Mac. Other users provide instructions on how to disable this feature. Some express frustration over the seemingly unnecessary feature and its default setting, but others suggest that it is just a feature and not necessarily a bug or mistake. The discussion also touches on the idea of websites determining a device's power and adjusting their performance accordingly.Users on Hacker News are discussing a default YouTube feature on Firefox and Safari that makes video-watching in dark mode more 'immersive', but is wasting electricity and CPU usage. While some users like the feature, others, including power users and Linux enthusiasts, have called for opt-in settings and seem to prefer command-line use and alternate frontends. One user points out that it is a YouTube, not a Firefox feature, yet some suggest Firefox's UI gimmicks might have influenced YouTube. One user calls the feature a 'less important project that could have been easily given to an intern'.Users discuss the benefits of using Mac vs Linux for troubleshooting computer issues, with some finding Mac easier to deal with while others prefer Linux for its stable performance. One user notes the limitations of needing to take a Mac to the Genius bar while another argues that Linux cannot match MacOS stability, while some prefer open-source add-ons and mods on MacOS. There is no clear winner between the two, but personal preferences play a key role in their choices.An HN user reveals the frustration of the discussion taking five years to resolve a bug, highlighting how long some Windows bugs have existed. Another user claims that Windows Defender is notorious for eating up massive amounts of CPU power due to the lack of incentive to perfect it. However, there are those who point out that software interference with system calls is not a developer's responsibility, and Mozilla's responsibility is to ensure their app runs as optimally as possible. One user suggests that the issue could be that Firefox was calling an expensive platform feature too often instead of blaming Defender. Another user complains that the bug comes as no shock since Microsoft makes upgrades that nobody wants.Mozilla's Firefox team was criticized on Hacker News for generating many more system calls, which resulted in high CPU usage compared to Chrome. The criticism, however, did not mention the specifics of the type or function of calls. One commenter argued that Chrome's more efficient use of system calls could be entirely attributed to luck, with the Firefox team perhaps missing out on opportunity analysis. The root issue reportedly seems to be with the ant-virus process and Zeroing a megabyte of memory unnecessarily. Responding to the bug report,\u00a0one commenter said that Mozilla should reduce the number of calls to VirtualProtect by grouping them, which would still trigger computation in MsMpEng.exe but at a more reasonable rate.Various Hacker News users discuss the recent bug found in Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), with some calling for simpler algorithms and more periodic verification of tests. A comment summarizes that the bug was in ETW and was not related to malware protection or branch prediction. Users also noted the importance of avoiding unnecessary system writes and working around quirks of different platforms. A specific comment is mentioned as a good summary of the issue once it was understood. There is also mention of an unrelated problem with Defender causing a significant performance drop in PowerShell operations. YC Summer 2023 applications are currently open.",

The floor features animated rooms and pop culture references with a unique take on typical scenes, such as a gymnasium, classrooms, etc. While the references vary from content created in the past few months to the 80s, the animation is not propelled by AI. The project appears to be a fun indie endeavor dedicated to artistic expression.An artist's ever-expanding art project, periodically updated and intended to continue growing exponentially, has been praised by users of Hacker News for its quality code base that avoids excessive use of frameworks and dependencies, whilst an HN user suggests the use of Web Components custom elements for component encapsulation. Some users express disappointment that the project is not 'infinitely scrolling', but others defend the artist's use of 'ever expanding' to depict a work of art that will continue to grow. A user suggests AI may be able to co-pilot such a project, but another warns against underestimating the creativity inherent in human art. Finally, users recommend the artist's animation editor as a useful tool in building similar projects.",

HN users discuss the issues and barriers around the medical system's adherence to proven, first-line treatments and its reluctance to adopt new methods, as well as the potential benefits of alternative therapies without historical scientific validation. However, it is stressed that patients should not solely rely on unproven treatments and should incorporate traditional care to avoid delays in treating medical issues.An HN user suggests that diet, sleep, and exercise can help with various conditions, while another mentions a treatment for sinus inflammation using baby shampoo and iodine. Psychedelics, despite being anecdotal, appear to help with depression, though real research is being done. Some people suggest unproven methods, but it does not necessarily mean they are ineffective. Science is a questioning and skeptical process. A user criticizes the CPAP industry for being condescending and infantilizing-for-profit.Users on Hacker News discuss the acceptable degree of risk among different industries to draw attention to rent-seeking in medical devices. The debate highlights the importance of medical equipment being open and data accessible. Some users argue that there are elements of direct and indirect dangers that need to be taken seriously with CPAP machines. Patients should advocate for themselves and manage their own health by carrying out detailed research and keeping detailed, intricate logs. However, it is essential to be careful when taking health into one's own hands and consult a medical professional when necessary.The article is about an established diagnostic and treatment flow for sleep apnea, not an experiment. Some HN users discuss the definition of experiments and how they relate to science. Experiments are potentially science, but not all are done in a scientific manner, and constructing a hypothesis is key to the scientific process. It is possible to conduct experiments on almost anything, but most are only conducted if there is a solid theory about the process, and not a shot in the blue. Patients need to be their own advocates for healthcare, but it's concerning when people ignore expert advice.An individual provided an example of utilizing proto-science to hack personal health problems; a treatment that worked for them should not be advertised as a universal solution. Several comments discussed taking personal responsibility for one's health and well-being; some people make mistakes that professionals would not, and some medical treatment can be done safely without medical supervision. The article raises the issue about the usefulness of science as a tool for problem-solving and how the over-reliance on scientific authority can have negative consequences. Readers also shared some insights into sleep apnea treatments, expressing the need for alternative treatments other than using CPAP machines.Hacker News users share their experiences and opinions on the use of supplements for sleep disorders, particularly magnesium. While some are skeptical of the supplement industry and label it \"woo,\" others have found success with magnesium and believe it to be medically necessary. Additionally, CPAP/APAP machines are recommended as an effective treatment for sleep apnea instead of home remedies or alternative treatments. Zinc and magnesium deficiencies are also common with athletes during training periods. Overall, users recommend seeking medical advice before trying any supplements and not relying solely on them for treatment.Discussion amongst HN users revolves around sleep quality, including potential remedies. Some suggest camping as a short-term solution, while others discuss the effectiveness of CPAP machines for sleep apnea. A user recommends reading \"Breath\" by James Nestor for those with sleep apnea. Other potential remedies suggested include adjusting sleeping positions, maintaining nasal breathing, and reducing sugar and caffeine intake. Users report mixed results with various strategies and note that there could be numerous reasons for poor sleep quality causing brain fog.The post discusses various potential causes of \"brain fog,\" including allergies, food sensitivities, poor sleep, caffeine, undiagnosed medical conditions, hormone imbalances, and vitamin deficiencies. Anecdotes and suggestions from HN users include testing for sleep apnea, getting a blood test, trying a gluten-free vegan diet, avoiding bread, pasta, and coffee, and improving indoor air quality. A user shares their experience with CPAP machines and how open-source resources and knowledge helped them revive a broken machine, highlighting the importance of building open medical devices and knowledge. There is criticism of the healthcare system's handling of sleep apnea, but some pushback suggests the usage of CPAP machines is not always easy or comfortable.A personal account of a positive experience with CPAP treatment for sleep apnea is shared, highlighting the benefits of consulting with an oral maxillofacial surgeon or otolaryngologist for alternatives to CPAP. A discussion in the comments section includes advice on surgeries for sleep apnea, personal experiences with sleep apnea treatment, and recommendations for monitoring oxygen levels. The importance of raising awareness about sleep apnea is also emphasized.The article discusses a YouTube channel run by The Quantified Scientist that reviews health tracking devices and compares them to medical equipment. Some commenters suggest alternatives to traditional sleep apnea devices, including free apps that record audio of the sleeper throughout the night and cheap video cameras. Others discuss the difficulties of obtaining medical care and sleep studies in the US and UK, with some noting long wait times and inadequate treatment. One commenter recommends nasal vents as a helpful solution for better breathing during sleep.A Reddit user asks about the feasibility of doing a sleep study in one day. One responder in the US claimed they can do it in a day. Others note that the process can take months, including GP visits and insurance companies fighting payment. Diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea in the US can be a long and costly process. Insurance companies may refuse to cover costs, despite having decent insurance coverage as a hospital employee. Studies can be expensive in the UK, costing around \u00a32500 a couple of years ago. Dental health care is comparatively more affordable, and insurance premiums are not high, contributing to the complexity of the US medical system. One responder suggested that the burden of insurance would be relieved if primary medical costs were in line with dental costs. Medical care could become less of an issue if people set money aside for dental or other \u00a0possible medical issues, since one can pay out of pocket for medical care.\u00a0An individual can always go see a doctor who does not take insurance at their own expense but this is absurd as they are also paying for insurance separately.\u00a0An individual in the UK who had trouble accessing sleep apnea treatment turned to self-diagnosis and treatment; the individual's experience underscores the importance of taking responsibility for one's own health. The NHS test for sleep apnea can take up to a year to obtain, and CPAP works better for those with severe sleep apnea. Green vegetables seem to trigger sleeplessness for some. A dating app for people who need CPAP machines to sleep was semi-jokingly proposed. Although ADHD and sleep apnea are common and can be debilitating, they can be expensive to diagnose, and a wrong diagnosis for ADHD can be harmful. Vitamins and low doses of acetazolamide can potentially provide relief, but orthodontic treatment is emerging as a cure for sleep apnea.Sleep apnea may lead to food sensitivities and autoimmune diseases like allergies and arthritis. Invisalign is reportedly working on adding clasps to keep the jaw closed during sleep. Tongue posture exercises taught by Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy doctors may be key. A thick neck increases the odds of sleep apnea. Using breathe right strips may help in getting a good night's sleep. Personal recovery methods such as cognitive load monitoring and regular downtime may aid in managing symptoms.",

Another user recommends using brain dumps in coding to stay focused, and a third describes ways to use Palm devices nowadays, including syncing with modern computers using various software. Any political or religious statements in comments should be avoided, while remaining neutral and professional.Users reminisce about the unique features of non-smartphone PDAs, which were designed to serve users entirely without network connectivity. They highlight the devices' offline-first capabilities, excellent UI, week-long battery life, and functionality, such as encrypting notes, project management, and period trackers. Users also recommend modern standalone devices, such as FiiO M3k, with good Rockbox support, expanded storage, and which are devoid of wireless connectivity or Android. They are ideal for audiophiles and individuals in remote areas. Overall, these devices provide a forgotten UX advantage compared to current smartphones, making them relevant and practical today.Experts analyze the factors that led to the demise of PalmOS, including design mistakes and technical weaknesses. However, some enthusiasts still use the outdated platform for its unique features, such as air-gapped apps and compatibility with old hardware, including automotives. The conversation delves into the shortcomings of competing mobile platforms of that era, such as Windows Mobile and BlackBerry. The decline of PalmOS is attributed to the company's inability to evolve the platform and address technical debt, as well as endless M&As that led to a lack of long-term focus and hubris.Corporate buyers favored enterprise groupware, but the ease of use, cloud services, GPS/Media features of Android and iOS won out, alongside increased cost-cutting measures by employers. Bad developer experience aside, the primary cause of Palm's failure to meet user demand was the same as Windows Mobile and Symbian: the iPhone's superior user experience and app distribution model. PalmOS was declining, but not dead when the iPhone launched, which had a greater market advantage with good branding and a mass market story. Microsoft had a superior kernel and SDK but lacked in tailoring to the form factor and usage that would have better served their UX. Good tips for continuous improvement include finding satisfaction in small gains and picking up projects when you have time and inclination.Experts discuss the slow progress and value of incremental achievements in tech projects. A CTO of Cloudflare requests repairable laptops with great keyboards. Some users recommend the Framework laptop, while others express dissatisfaction with its keyboard and shipping capabilities. Project RePalm, which aims to revive the PalmOS, receives mixed reactions, with some considering it anachronistic while others praise it as a labor of love.

Users express nostalgia for retro tech devices like Palm and continue to use them despite new technology's availability.The article discusses an open-source project called RePalm which emulates the Palm OS on a Raspberry Pi Pico CPU, allowing it to run PalmOS apps. Comments discuss the possibility of emulation being more practical than developing for PalmOS and its usefulness for those who care about organizing their lives, play old Palm games, and avoid distractions. The project has sparked interest among readers, some of whom even express their wish to create a modern Palm device, while others suggest using an iOS keyboard to write Graffiti. Dmitry Grinberg, the creator of RePalm, hinted at working on a Graffiti emulator, but progress may take some time as it is a side hobby.An HN user is developing a modern version of PalmOS, including higher density screen support and modern WiFi capabilities. Several other users express nostalgia for Palm devices and share their experiences with the OS. One user suggests that porting WinCE to modern standards might be more promising, but another disputes this claim.

This post provides rules for writing effective flashcards for spaced repetition, including understanding first, being honest, keeping it fun, repeating, organizing by source, writing atomic flashcards, and asking questions in multiple ways. The limiting factors include habit formation and writing skills. The primary goal is to maintain a skilled habit and avoid dropping the use of Anki. Developing good writing skills takes time and practice. The post emphasizes the importance of maintaining a diverse knowledge base to keep the process enjoyable.To effectively learn hierarchical knowledge and retain information, one should ask questions in a top-down and bottom-up direction, breaking down large flashcards into smaller ones. Flashcards should include questions about sequence, such as the position and order of elements within it. When dealing with multiple concepts, breaking them down into a hierarchy can be helpful in creating linked flashcards. When dealing with complex concepts, breaking down information into separate cards is key. In order to master formal concepts such as vector spaces, it is important to break down definitions and operations efficiently.Vector spaces: A set of axioms (commutativity of addition, associativity of addition, identity of addition, inverse of addition, identity of scaling, distributivity) that describes a set whose elements can be added or scaled. Parity Group: A group that represents the rules for adding even and odd numbers. Logical Consequence: The two notions of logical consequence, semantic consequence and syntactic consequence, and their definitions. Geologic Time Scale: The units of the timeline, their order, and duration. Rational Numbers: The set of fractions with integer numerator and denominator. Regular Expressions: Regex for matching start/end of a line and digits. Voltage: Two definitions, difference in electric potential and work done by a particle, and their terms.The post explains the definitions and hierarchy of isomers, months of the year, and powers of two.

The article suggests using quality over quantity when creating flashcards for spaced repetition algorithms. It advises putting in only the perfect nuggets of information and learning from personal \"aha\" moments or connections. Several comments suggest alternative tools for spaced repetition, such as Duolingo and Math Academy. An Anki user also shares their experience of using an e-Ink review system. However, some users criticize Duolingo's efficacy in language learning, stating it only teaches a subset of the language. The article emphasizes the importance of enjoyable review sessions, prioritizing adherence over algorithmic efficiency.Users on Hacker News praise a variety of online tools for learning new skills, including Mochi for language learning and WaniKani for memorizing Japanese kanji. Some users share advice for using spaced repetition software such as Anki effectively, including starting with small daily review sessions and accepting that occasional lapses in study may result in backlogs of review cards. A $49 math course with a focus on methods of proofs and abstract algebra draws excited anticipation from one user. Meanwhile, a tool called LogSeq is praised for its seamless integration of note-taking and spaced repetition.An HN user points out that the Anki flashcard app accumulates cards which can build up and become overwhelming, leading to missed reviews. Another user expresses interest in a new algorithm he is working on that solves this issue and allows users to review when they have time and skip days they cannot. Anki's algorithm is based on an older version of the SuperMemo algorithm, and while the settings can be fine-tuned, returns are diminishing. Individual cards should be brief, but the deck as a whole can be as repetitive as desired. Some suggest limiting the number of daily cards or removing easy cards to learn efficiently, while others emphasize creating multiple cards on similar topics for better retention. Tips and tricks for effectively using spaced repetition are shared, including creating good prompts and formulating knowledge efficiently.HN users discuss different methods for utilizing spaced repetition in learning fields like mathematics and electrical engineering. Some suggest using \"spaced free recall\" or breaking down proofs into small steps on flashcards, while others recommend using resources like CodeWars or Clozemaster to learn through smaller, contextual components. Users also mention the importance of associating new knowledge with existing knowledge and focusing on both semantic and procedural learning in mathematics. Some users have experimented with using GPT-4 or other AI to make flashcards or distill knowledge. There is a desire for apps combining bite-sized tutorials and quizzes with ordinary internet usage.An article on the effectiveness of Anki and spaced repetition for learning prompts questions and comments from Hacker News users. Users suggest methods for using Anki effectively, mention premade decks and topics that suit spaced repetition, and ask about how to balance memorization and learning. An experienced user advises on the importance of recall rate in Anki stats and recommends using Anki as a tool to memorize information. One user raises concerns about the failure mode of including too much information in flashcards.Anki and space repetition systems were discussed in a post on Hacker News. Users shared their experiences and tips for effective use, such as being selective about what to memorize and using mnemonic devices. One user noted that space repetition is commonly used in studying for tournament Scrabble. Some users also asked for advice on using space repetition for history or other non-factual subjects. The author of the original post shared their personal use case and recommended Mochi with default settings. They also stated that writing their own flashcards helped with recall. No high-quality public decks were recommended.Users on Hacker News are discussing the use of spaced repetition, memory techniques, and flashcard programs in context-based learning.

Valuable insights are provided on the benefits and limitations of spaced repetition for language learning, and the potential risks of relying on it for more complex concepts.An HN user seeks advice on memorizing the shapes of guitar modes using spaced repetition software (SRS) and flashcards. Other users suggest physically playing the guitar; using specific patterns on top of the modes; thinking of the guitar as a pentatonic instrument; and creating decks for targeted learning. HN users testify to the effectiveness of SRS and practicing in intervals to memorize things like guitar modes and Japanese characters quickly. However, they also advise that physically playing the guitar is integral to learning. Creating your own flashcards may be useful for comprehending abstract concepts better.Anking provides high-quality shared decks for medical students, with geography/maps being another subject with good shared decks, but most subjects have low quality shared decks. Using Anki for med school demands a long-term commitment as some cards will be due much later. Going through a whole deck in one sitting is not the correct way to use Anki as the brain gets tired and needs rest. Using Anki requires commitment, and every classmate at med school uses Anki or a local commercial SRS specifically made for their country's curriculum. Some users can generate content for cards using AI tools. Effective learning includes using a typeface that doesn't get in the way of reading at smaller point sizes.An HN user asks about the supposed ease of reading serif fonts and what studies show for objective measures.

But for recycling startup Ascend Elements, other people\u2019s garbage is basically a\u00a0gold mine, if not better.The Massachusetts-based company opened a\u00a0recycling plant in Covington, Georgia in late March that it says is the largest electric-vehicle battery recycling facility in North America. It can process 30,000 metric tons of input each year, breaking down old batteries and prepping the most valuable materials inside to be processed and turned into new batteries.That capacity equates to breaking down the battery packs from 70,000 electric vehicles annually, said Ascend CEO Mike O\u2019Kronley.Subscribe to receive Canary's latest newsThis is an early example of a\u00a0nationwide movement to cost-effectively recycle and repurpose EV batteries as more and more drivers go electric. In previous decades, companies hadn\u2019t invested much in lithium-ion recycling, but investment soared in the last few years to match the spiking demand for battery materials.Recycling can deliver new battery materials without the expense and environmental impact of new mining. It is extremely hard to develop new mines in the U.S., but the federal government is lavishing funds on new battery recycling plants. The revamped EV tax credits also call for increasing shares of domestically sourced batteries and battery materials.Those market and policy shifts made recycling sufficiently desirable that Ascend is paying other companies for their old batteries. At the moment, those deals are mostly with EV or battery makers that have high volumes to get rid\u00a0of.\u201cPaying for these spent batteries keeps them from going into the landfill,\u201d O\u2019Kronley told Canary Media. \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s better to get paid for it rather than throw them\u00a0away.\u201dAscend also accepts used consumer electronics from battery-collection programs, such as Call2Recycle.That\u2019s not to say there are enough old batteries coming in to fill the factory. Currently, 80 to 90 percent of what\u2019s going into Ascend\u2019s Covington facility is scrap materials from battery factories, including SK Battery America\u2019s plant in Commerce, Georgia.Get Caught UpHere\u2019s video proof that solar panels can be recycledJulian SpectorThat relationship influenced Ascend\u2019s choice of location: Covington sits in the emerging \u200b\u201cBattery Belt,\u201d a\u00a0swath of new battery factories and electric-vehicle plants opening up across the Midwest and the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky (look for all the blue icons in this White House map of new industrial investments). Fellow battery-recycling startup Redwood Materials also chose South Carolina for a\u00a0forthcoming $3.5 billion recycling facility.\u201cThere will need to be a\u00a0recycling plant within about an hour\u2019s drive of every single one of those [new battery gigafactories],\u201d O\u2019Kronley said. \u200b\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be [long-distance] shipping these very large, heavy EV batteries that are classified as Class 9\u00a0hazardous materials.\u201dAs it stands, the nearby battery factories send their scrap down the road to Ascend for what\u2019s called \u200b\u201cpre-processing.\u201d The scrap and used batteries go through mechanical shredding and sieving, which produces \u200b\u201cblack mass.\u201d Ascend extracts lithium carbonate from the mass; the remaining mass contains materials such as graphite, nickel, cobalt and manganese.Currently, Ascend sells most of these substances to the market; it also converts some black mass into cathode precursor and cathode active materials at its Massachusetts R&D center. But the company is building a\u00a0second commercial-scale facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky that will take the outputs from Covington and convert them into cathode precursor and cathode active material so that they\u2019re ready to go into new battery manufacturing. That $1 billion plant received $480 million in grant funding from the Department of Energy as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2019s investment in domestic supply for critical materials.The Covington plant operates similarly to existing battery recycling plants; the Kentucky location will introduce a\u00a0brand-new technique for efficiently extracting cathode materials from black mass, which Ascend has dubbed \u200b\u201chydro to cathode.\u201d\u201cThose two facilities represent the investment that we are making in key infrastructure to recover these batteries, retain these critical elements in the United States and return them into the supply,\u201d O\u2019Kronley said.But that\u2019s just the start, because the surging popularity of EVs will produce far more worn-out batteries than the country\u2019s recyclers can process. Ascend is already out raising money to build more plants, according to O\u2019Kronley.Other emerging recycling startups are at it too. Redwood Materials, founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, won a $2 billion loan from the DOE for a\u00a0Nevada plant to make new batteries from recycled materials. Canada-based Li-Cycle received a $375 million DOE loan for its own facility to process lithium carbonate from a\u00a0network of recycling plants. Canary Media recently profiled Cirba Solutions\u2019 efforts to expand a\u00a0battery-recycling plant in Ohio.All of these facilities tie into the Biden administration\u2019s goal to make the U.S. more capable of supplying itself with the batteries that will be pivotal to electrifying transportation and decarbonizing the\u00a0grid.Recycling renewablesBatteries Julian Spectoris senior reporter at Canary Media.Hide Commentsread nextSolarA huge community solar order is latest in US clean manufacturing boomEric Wesoff \u00a0.\u00a010 April 2023Marine transportVideo: Canary talks ammonia-powered ships on the Weather ChannelMaria Gallucci \u00a0.\u00a010 April 2023Corporate procurementCompanies need a faster way to buy clean energy.

        "hn_content": "The US's largest EV battery recycling plant is now operational. While recycling batteries requires processing, removing non-recyclable materials, and discharging them correctly, recycling is seen as a more sustainable alternative to producing new materials. There is a shortage of metals refining in the US, which makes it highly specialized work. HN users were curious about recycling processes and labor costs. The recycling plant shreds batteries into a black mass and extracts lithium carbonate to turn into lithium hydroxide, the stuff we use for batteries. A major issue of e-waste not getting recycled enough is disposability- products such as disposable vapes should not exist. The recycling process generally \u201cworks\u201d by shredding/melting the materials to separate components by liquid or magnetic means, with machines and humans in combination.A firm extracts lithium and other materials from used lithium-ion batteries through mechanical shredding and sieving, which creates \u201cblack mass\u201d, producing lithium carbonate and graphite, nickel, cobalt and manganese. Lithium-ion batteries contain very little lithium, and it's not elemental \u2013 an extremely common misconception that leads to people thinking they can't use water to stop a pack undergoing thermal runaway or fire \u2013 something that can only be stopped via the cooling effect of water. Lithium is at the top, so you get the most voltage per molecule. Lithium-ion batteries are composed mostly of nickel and steel, both of which are highly recyclable. Lithium iron phosphate does not show the kind of reaction that is seen in reaction to other metals and oxides, making it less likely to burn. There are efforts to develop rechargeable batteries using pure lithium metal at the anode for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries do not tend to break even without externalities such as constructing additional rail networks.A recent report investigates the costs and benefits of freeway projects to make clear the overall impact on the environment, but opponents argue that it ignores the potential benefits. Although last-mile services may appear to be a trivial part of building a train network, they pose a significant challenge that may require a cultural shift in favor of new transportation modes. Such cultural change may demand a change in values with the implementation of last-mile solutions that must be respectful of existing values. Personal preference also comes into play since people prefer living in suburbs for low population density and quality-of-life. Trains and planes have different models and network effects, although both require multiple modes of transport for long-distance travel.The convenience of travel becomes important for people, where traditional travel systems may not be ret based on Freeways being cheaper than railroads to construct at ~3 million/mile. Long term maintenance costs and land use opportunities, however, are not taken into account. Trains are 9 times more energy-efficient than road vehicles, and rail travel produces less CO2 emissions. China, Japan, France, and Germany have shown that frequent-service electrified passenger rail is perfectly possible and can be a significant public good. Train platforms are almost always maxed out at well below 10 cars, limiting the number of passengers they can transport.Hacker News users discuss the feasibility of running 20-car trains and the passenger capacity of various transit systems, with particular attention paid to rail systems in Europe, the US, and Asia. The comments also touch on the economic benefits of transit systems, the low percentage of electric vehicles that require battery replacement, and the current state of lithium recycling. One user highlights a company working to increase battery recycling capacity in the US.The Ascend battery recycling plant features 80 to 90 percent scrap materials from battery plants, including SK Battery America's facility; recycling batteries domestically may become a matter of national security, given the US goals for EVs and energy storage; the infrastructure bill had funding for critical minerals; EV batteries are used in whole-house battery systems, potentially making recycling premature; with most EV batteries still in the middle of their respective bathtub curves, it's uncertain how much end-of-life batteries Ascend will receive; as a result of the high cost of replacing EV batteries, consumers would rather buy a new car than replace the battery, for second-life stationary storage systems.Experts discuss the longevity of car batteries, with mentions of the infamous 2011 Nissan Leaf battery design and the poor cooling system, limited thermal management, and fast degradation in hot climates leading to battery life concerns. Many modern EVs have active cooling beyond just a fan, but climate remains an important factor to consider. While some hobbyists buy old EV batteries for stationary storage, issues surrounding safety or documentation remain. Despite some teething pains, advancements in battery technology suggest that EV batteries will likely outlive the car, and the development of liquid-cooled battery packs with improved management capabilities has spurred optimism regarding the future of EVs.A new battery recycling plant called Li-Cycle has opened in Ontario, Canada, boasting a unique process that leaves valuable metals in solution and cuts out multiple steps in the recycling process. Currently, Ascend sells most of the most valuable extracted elements, ranking from 24 to 30 in the periodic table, to the market. However, there are concerns that developing a process to extract the \"black mass\" cheaply and efficiently may be extremely difficult. While Li-Cycle's technique is reportedly the state-of-the-art at scale, questions remain over the value and scalability of the byproduct mixture they produce.A recycling facility efficiently manages old battery cells and stores concentrated ores with a stable commodity value, while removing fire risks. The separation of cathode and anode foils during cell disassembly simplifies downstream material processing. However, there remain challenges in separating expensive elements occupying positions #24 through #30 in the periodic table. The facility could potentially be focusing on complexity at the cell disassembly level to further process individual cells to mechanically separate components. The article reports that relatively cheap lithium can be extracted using a combination of electrolysis, electrowinning, leaching, and other refining processes.",

        "hn_content": "Cryptocurrency exchange FTX stored private keys in plaintext without access controls, according to a tweet by a security researcher. One individual on Hacker News drew parallels between traditional financial institutions' use of low-entropy personal data and FTX's approach to storing private keys. Another user suggested companies such as FTX should use asymmetric encryption, while a third explained that the SEPA Direct Debit framework used in Europe is effective because risks are squarely placed upon the party initiating a direct debit.The slow speed of traditional banking is intentional and designed to prevent mistakes. However, customers now expect higher speeds, and the lack of quick final settlement options is causing problems. Adding strong asymmetric encryption could prevent most fraud and save a lot of effort in fraud schemes, but it should not be forced onto every user. Small personal transactions happen without much issue or friction, but large business transactions generally do not require fast settlement. Crypto's biggest benefits are not for the average consumer, and speeding up financial systems may be good for some but bad for others. Traditional financial systems have their own issues, such as using credit card numbers as public numbers, causing confusion when traveling and posing security risks.HN users discuss the flaws in current financial systems, including the use of social security numbers and the lack of due diligence by banks. A user points out the irony in asking for help from the government to recover stolen crypto while trying to avoid taxes and government oversight. Another user notes that the size of the market for identity theft protection and credit card fraud is billions of dollars, indicating that the current system is not working well enough. However, some users argue that fixing these problems would add considerable complexity and may not have a net positive effect on the world.Crypto users who transfer money through traditional means face various obstacles and often want governments to stay away from the technology. Some cryptocurrency advocates argue that money could be better managed outside of government control, though this does not imply that they favor lawlessness. Nevertheless, some users still want equal application of existing laws to crypto and more traditional forms of property. A few users suggest that bad actors will be a part of both the traditional and crypto systems. The primary advantage of crypto over the traditional financial system may be avoiding cross-border controls.A discussion on the security protocols of crypto exchange FTX raises concerns about the company's inadequacy in safeguarding billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. One user purported that FTX kept crypto keys in Google Drive, while others commented on inadequate security engineering and employed mechanics. Using an unreliable wallet app is highly discouraged; instead, a Trezor or hardware wallets are safer options. Although hacking into wallets through malicious crypto spam is a common industry occurrence, it highlights the importance of strengthening security measures to protect funds. The conversation emphasizes the need for robust security when dealing with cryptocurrencies, especially when millions or billions of dollars are at stake.FTX cryptocurrency exchange faced criticism after it was revealed private keys were stored in plaintext files, accessible to all employees. The security breach was discovered when one employee accessed a file and found private keys there in plain sight. The revelation drew immediate backlash from users, who accused FTX of gross negligence and disregard for basic security standards. Experts recommend using hot and cold wallet tiers, where a hot wallet is used to hold smaller amounts for daily use and a cold wallet has heavy-duty security. It's unclear if the FTX breach was an act of incompetence or criminal negligence.FTX's handling of security has been called into question after personal laptops belonging to executives were confiscated by Bahamian authorities. The accounting system, an Excel spreadsheet manually maintained by the CEO himself, contained entries like \"Hidden, poorly internally labeled fiat@ account\" (sic) that was purportedly worth $8 billion. The shared Google Drive contained plaintext private keys. Some HN users comment on the situation, with some pointing out that keeping a small number of things secure for yourself is easier than doing it for thousands in an automated way. Others suggest a link between social media craziness and poor internal security. It\u2019s suggested that FTX is a catastrophic mess of multiple failure modes in a race.A report reveals that FTX used plaintext keys to store users' funds, leading to concerns about the company's security practices. The incident has raised questions about whether software engineers should have licensing requirements or guilds\u00a0similar to medical practitioners. Some HN users have criticized FTX's overall approach to risk management and security. While FTX is a crypto company, some have suggested there is a distinction between legit crypto firms and \"crypto\" ones. FTX has also been accused of stealing all the money depositors entrusted to it. Some HN users have suggested that such security exploits often go unpunished in practice.",

        "content": "How I Fixed a Parasitic Drain on my Car in 408 Days | David MullerDavid MullerMy book: Intuitive Python \u2197How I Fixed a Parasitic Drain on my Car in 408 Days10 April, 2023I almost lost my mind fixing a persistent battery drain on my 2013 Mazda3 hatchback. I want to share how I fixed my car in case it helps you fix a similar problem.Short version: I manually disconnected the key fob computer system to stop the battery from draining.Finding the Parasitic DrainMy car battery would drain itself in a matter of hours or days starting in January 2022 until I fixed the issue in March 2023. This kind of unchecked battery drain\u2014where your car does not have enough power to start itself after its parked for a short time\u2014is sometimes called a parasitic drain.To diagnose the drain, I parked and locked my car. Then, I measured voltages across some of the exposed fuses in my car. The idea is to find components in the car that are drawing power when the car is off. A few fuses showed constant power consumption including the TCM Transaxle control system fuse:Using a lookup table for my brand of fuses, I converted the 0.9mV voltage on TCM into a current draw. My car drew significant current over four fuses even when it was off:FuseDescriptionCompartmentCurrentTCM15A - Transaxle control systemengine0.9mV -> 197mAENG+B10A - Engine Control Systemengine0.2mV -> 27mAROOM15A - Overhead lightsengine0.4mV -> 87mAESCL15A - [Electric Steering Wheel Lock]interior left0.4mV -> 87mAAccording to one mechanic who worked on my car, the total draw on my 2013 Mazda3 should be 50mA or less when the car is parked and locked. So, the 197mA to the transmission computer (TCM) was especially troubling. Why would the transmission computer remain on when the car was parked and locked, anyways?When my car first started dying in Februrary 2022, the key fobs started malfunctioning. Sometimes when I tried to use a fob, the car would sound warning chirps for ~10 seconds. Paranoid the key fobs were causing the drain, I hadn\u2019t used the fobs since the car first died. I had removed the batteries from the fobs, and only used my metal backup key.Now over a year later, I guessed that the keyless system was still malfunctioning even though I wasn\u2019t using the fobs. Perhaps, the car thought a key fob was present in the car, and it was keeping systems like its transmission computer (TCM) switched on endlessly by mistake.The FixOne of the keyless troubleshooting sections in the workshop manual mentioned the ENG+B, ROOM, and ESCL fuses could be related to keyless system malfunctions. Since I\u2019d also seen power going over thoses fuses, it seemed plausible that the keyless system was still acting up.I was already only using my metal key and not the fobs, so I had nothing to lose. I opened up the dash behind the glove compartment to see if I could disable the key fob system directly. After disconnecting my car\u2019s negative battery cable, I unplugged wiring harness 4 from the keyless control module:Wiring harness 4 is almost exclusively communications lines to the different radio antennas and switches that comprise the keyless system.After unplugging wiring harness 4, the instrument cluster now showed a red warning light that keyless system was malfunctioning (what I wanted):When I drive the car, I see the red keyless system warning light. However, when I park the car and lock it, the TCM fuse (and the others) go to sleep and stop drawing power over the course of several minutes. My car no longer dies after a day or two of sitting. Success!FAQWhy did you almost lose your mind?I suspect the drain was intermittent: sometimes the car would go to sleep properly, and sometimes it wouldn\u2019t. Intermittency made the problem hard to diagnose.Also, two real mechanics told me my car didn\u2019t have a parasitic draw.What did the real mechanics say?Different mechanics told me different stories:Dealer: said my car was fine and returned it to me. My car died the next morning.Second mechanic: said my battery was degraded, and low voltages from the battery were freaking out the keyless sytem.  Indeed, the car lasted 12 months problem free on a new battery before it started dying again.(I still was only using my metal backup key, and had removed the batteries from the fobs.)A second new battery did not fix the issue when the problem resurfaced after the 12 months.Why did it take so long to fix?I think it was because the problem was intermittent. See the full timeline at the end of this post.Is your car still safe to drive?As far as I can tell, yes. The #4 cable I disconnected only makes connections to the keyless system, and the only warning light is a red one indicating the keyless system isn\u2019t working (expected). All other systems seem to be operating normally. You should probably consult an actual mechanic if you\u2019re considering this change, though.If the parasitic draw is intermittent, how do you know you fixed it?All the evidence I have points to the keyless system: key fobs malfunctioning, measuring the draws on the same fuses in both Feb 2022 and Mar 2023, and the implication of some of the related fuses from the workshop manual that mentioned the ENG+B, ROOM, and ESCL fuses. My car also hasn\u2019t died again yet.What mistakes did you make troubleshooting the draw?Too many to count. Most important is to make sure your car is locked with the doors closed before you run any experiemnts to look for parasitic draws. Cars can take a while to go to sleep.Did you use a diagnostic code reader to look for errors logged by the car?No, I probably should have.

Conceptual descendants of the Phoenix Hyperspace hack are shipping today on millions of Android and Windows systems, calling for the industry to need an OSS Type-1 L0 hypervisor.HP has designed an OS without its own scheduler that is loaded into the TE at runtime. This allows hardware modules to be marked as secure or non-secure by the main OS. Some HN users debate whether this is a hypervisor or an interrupt handler. Experts in the field may appreciate HP's experimentation with non-Windows environments. Some HN users express security concerns. The post generated diverse reactions ranging from admiration for cool hack to criticisms of bad PHB ideas. HN users ponder questions such as the feasibility of writing complex programs to run inside EFI and who buys this type of device.",
        "hn_summary": "The article discusses complexities in writing UEFI applications and BIOSes' handling of sleep behavior. Some users push back on the author's assertions. Laptop OEMs expose valuable functionality via pre-defined WMI ACPI callouts. Some see Windows as bloated, and the EFI environment has a vague resemblance to a 32/64-bit MS-DOS. The boot process of x86 PCs is still slow. Capacitive buttons on laptops are missed. HP has designed an OS without its own scheduler that is loaded into the TE at runtime.

        "content": "We Need To Talk About Vercel - Max CountrymanMenuAboutArticlesUsesWe Need To Talk About VercelApril 9, 2023Recently there's been some discussion around Vercel and its hefty markup over AWS Lambda or its surprise runaway costs.1 That said, there's an argument to be made that the development experience value add is worth the pretty penny. And indeed for some, that may be the case.However, as I've spent more time working with the Vercel Content Delivery Network (CDN) product, I've encountered technical deficiencies which have been met with a customer support response that not only leaves me skeptical of the proffered value add, but has left me to question the product altogether.Some BackgroundI've been working on remotejobs.org, which is largely static but updates periodically throughout the day. I'll spare readers the technical details here but what's important is to understand that this is implemented via Astro's Server-Side Rendering and is intended to be cached by the CDN.To do so, we make use of the s-maxage and stale-while-revalidate directives of the Cache-Control header. The goal here is to have the surrogate, i.e. the CDN network appliance, cache the content for a set amount of time and then to lean on the stale-while-revalidate directive to serve cached content while fresh data is fetched in the background.As of writing the Vercel docs give this description of stale-while-revalidate:This allows you to serve content from the Edge cache while simultaneously updating the cache in the background with the response from your Serverless Function.Offering some relevant use-cases and overlap with what we want:Some situations where stale-while-revalidate is of great value:Your content changes frequently but it takes a significant amount of time to regenerate. For example, an expensive database query or upstream API request.Your content changes infrequently but you want to have the flexibility to update it (to fix a typo, for example) and don't wait for the cache to expire.Fortunately Vercel makes configuring such a header easy via the vercel.json configuration:{  \"headers\": [    {      \"source\": \"/(.*)\",      \"headers\": [        {          \"key\": \"Cache-Control\",          \"value\": \"public, max-age=0, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=3900\"        }      ]    }  ]}Mission accomplished.Not So Easy After AllOnly it doesn't work the way it's advertised.Bizarrely, Vercel's network appliance mangles the Cache-Control header and indeed does not respect the configured values as it should.2 For some resources, things work as expected, but for e.g. our index page the s-maxage and stale-while-revalidate directives are both missing.In fact, only resources like JavaScript and CSS see the correct header value with everything else being configured such that Cache-Control has a value of public, max-age=0. Not what we wanted or configured.Looking for SupportAfter messing around with this for some time, ensuring we were manually setting the headers on our origin, I had no luck and reached out to Vercel's support.Over the course of a couple of weeks I was told by their support team:This is not a real issue, try these various configuration tweaks (none worked and they would later admit they could easily reproduce the issue independently).This is a real issue, but it's Astro's fault (it wasn't, as the Astro team would trivially demonstrate) and I should do free work for Vercel to poll their community regarding how widespread the issue is.Vercel's support staff is only trained to handle frontend issues, therefore I can't expect helpful responses (Vercel sells a CDN product, so this is surprising).3The internal team is working on an RFC to make documentation changes (odd, but okay; the issue still remains).I would receive an update within one week (now a month later, I have had no update whatsoever and the issue persists).I was also told that because I haven't graduated to a high-enough service tier, my issue wasn't important. I find this a strange response, because other customers, who might be paying lots of money to use Vercel's product, would benefit from the CDN operating as it's advertised.On March 9th, 2023, Vercel's support team promised to follow up \"next week\". They have not done so and the issue remains an issue.\"Please keep an eye out for a message from our team next week.\"Where We Go from HereCDNs are hard. There's no doubt a lot going on in the background here that we can't see. For instance, later on in the support thread, Vercel's support said this:\"After catching up with our CDN team, it's worth sharing that we'll be reviewing docs on s-maxage/stale-while-revalidate/stale-while-error and how they are consumed by our proxy. Slight overshare but there's an active RFC internally to review this behaviour in its entirety.\"While this is a somewhat odd response, it demonstrates that Vercel is aware of these problems and that they can be difficult to tackle.4However, for me the bigger issue is how Vercel's frontline support team responds and behaves. I was repeatedly told my issue wasn't real, a fairly blatant attempt to gaslight me, and then when it had been confirmed multiple times that I should just go away already.Now I'm clearly not worth enough for Vercel to care about. Fair enough. They're right that I won't independently bring them large bags of money in the form of recurring revenue. But being so blunt about that seems shortsighted at best: Should I ever be in the position to bring more business to Vercel, I now won't.Contrast this approach with Cloudflare or AWS: Even as a free or essentially free customer, both platforms invest in their customers because it's part of a larger customer acquisition strategy.Good support is not just a resource to fallback to.Take AWS as an example, which has for years invested heavily in customer success. AWS offers a wide array of resources, including dedicated support teams, structured programs, and ongoing training. Without such things in place, AWS wouldn't just be more difficult to use, but would also likely have a far less commanding hold of the cloud market. While Vercel may not be at AWS scale, even in the beginning Amazon has had a reputation for being \"customer obsessed\".Given where Vercel is today, I'll be moving on. Most of remotejobs.org is already hosted on a VPS and so in my case I'll move the web pieces there with a CDN like Cloudflare in front of it.AddendumI reached out for comment before publishing this piece, but Vercel did not provide one. However, there's since been active discussion on Hacker News with Vercel's CEO, Guillermo Raunch, explaining that this behavior is in place to protect users:\"Vercel strips them because (1) at the time this RFC didn't exist and (2) most of the time you we found customers don't want to cache on the browser side or proxying CDNs, which makes purging and reasoning about cache staleness very difficult.\"[...]'Customers want to deploy and see their changes instantly. They want to their customers \"go to our blog to see the news\" and not have to second guess or fear the latest content will be there.'FootnotesNote that the latter was due how the deployment process was structured, however billing limits or quotas would have prevented such a thing from happening in the first place; such misconfigurations can and do happen and shouldn't bankrupt a small business. \u21a9I spent some time trying various things, ordering the directives differently, duplicating them, etc. Some combinations produce different results, but none I could find consistently set the correct header value. \u21a9To clarify, this was directed at a specific support team member, who I won't name; presumably other support team members have different backgrounds and may be better equipped to field these issues. However, that's in fact the issue: if you sell a CDN product, it's important your staff is trained in supporting it. \u21a9It could make some sense to update the docs in the meantime at least. \u21a9A Newsletter to Share My KnowledgeI built this site to share everything I know about leadership, building startups, and indie hacking.

        "hn_content": "An investigation into Vercel, a cloud provider for web and front-end development, has raised concerns about the company's customer service, pricing, and potential issues with scaling. While some users have praised the company's ease-of-use and Next.js integration, others have criticized their management and handling of technical problems. Vercel's moat and reputation have been called into question, with some users suggesting that alternatives such as GitHub Actions, DigitalOcean, and Cloudflare could provide a more sustainable and cost-effective solution. Vercel's acquisition of React has also been debated, with some suggesting it gives the company a competitive edge, while others question its significance. Criticisms of Vercel's practices and behavior include deceptive messaging, inadequate documentation, and poor response times.Users on a Next.js forum discuss server-side rendering vs static site generation, with some arguing that the distinction is unnecessary. One user proposes disabling optimization to make Next.js behave like an image tag, but others criticize this approach. A user takes issue with Vercel\u2019s design, stating that they want the option to use the image tag without being forced to serve images over Node or use Vercel. Commenters debate the benefits of fat index files, which download all necessary assets at once, versus splitting assets up. Lastly, a user criticizes Vercel for breaking Next.js with AsyncLocalStorage and for not providing a specification.HN users criticize new features of NextJS from v.10 after its latest investment round, mentioning issues with API Middlewares, pages layout, release versioning and more; a user recommends an alternative open version, 'vite-plugin-ssr'; some users express frustration at the lack of clear release information and changelogs, while others complain about customer support and bugs in the system; one user mentions the high cost for bandwidth usage; HN users express concern over the lack of transparency in NextJS's development process.Vite-plugin-ssr plans to introduce built-in renderers to achieve a zero-config developer experience like Next.js, while maintaining an open and collaborative foundation for meta frameworks. Some comments criticize Vercel for their billing practices and urge users to consider other CDNs like BunnyCDN or use R2 with Cloudflare. Additionally, the conversation includes debates about cache-control headers and the benefits of stripping versus supporting them.Developers discuss the pricing and benefits of CDN services such as Vercel and Cloudflare. One user warns about potential TOS violations with Cloudflare regarding JSON API caching. Other users mention alternatives such as Hetzner and R2, which may be cheaper. There is also discussion about the value of using a CDN versus hosting content on a VPS. Some users express frustration with Vercel's pricing and business practices. A representative from Vercel responds to a user's issue and provides updates on their investigation.An investigation into caching on Vercel's Edge Network and the use of SWR cache-control headers in Astro apps was conducted. It was found that Vercel's Edge Network does respect 'stale-while-revalidate'. However, Vercel's server strips 's-maxage' and 'stale-while-revalidate' from the response, requiring a closer look at 'x-vercel-cache'. Comments indicate that Vercel's actual support is terrible despite its efforts on public image and marketing. The post also discusses different ways of adding caching headers in Vercel, but the preferred method is to use the framework or product native way. Criticisms of Vercel's service are made, while comments on the author's purpose for their app are considered irrelevant.Vercel's pricing and feature list is criticized, with one user finding it over-engineered for a simple job board, another distrustful of its generic marketing website, and a third highlighting the absence of rate limiting or DDoS prevention options. However, some praise Vercel's superior developer experience and per-branch deployments. Users also discuss the support for stale-while-revalidate by some CDNs, including Fastly and Vercel. Despite debate, Vercel remains a popular front-end deployment platform.",

        "hn_content": "Dashcam footage shows driverless cars causing traffic congestion in San Francisco according to a post on Hacker News. Some users fear a future where relentless driverless cars circumnavigate roads seeking passengers or parking spots, potentially leading to congestion pricing. Others believe that when humans are taken out of the driver\u2019s seat, a potentially new infrastructure could be built, and mass transit could win out. There are concerns over the ability of autonomous vehicles to handle unforeseen and complex situations and the possibility that city streets will clog up excessively due to a proliferation of empty driverless cars.Self-driving cars could drastically improve parking by dropping off passengers and parking elsewhere, even if it's a few minutes away. In addition, self-driving cars can cooperatively pack themselves into compact configurations, freeing up even more space. Laws and regulations will ensure self-driving cars follow proper parking etiquette, potentially limiting congestion. Self-driving taxis could reduce the number of cars parked in a city, making traditional parking lots obsolete, and leaving room for new urban designs. Charging self-driving cars can be done through rows of charging stations that automatically plug in, or wireless charging methods underneath the parking lot. The shift to autonomous cars could be complicated, but self-driving cars could reduce driving-related stress, parking fees and costs, and could eliminate the need for car ownership altogether. Scarcity of parking could be addressed through road pricing, making access a monetized, scarce resource. Despite fears, the idea of self-driving cars circling around forever in search of a parking spot is not a realistic concern, and cars can be programmed to park away and return for their owners when needed.A proposed solution of having self-driving cars circle around to park elsewhere to reduce congestion may actually lead to more traffic and less availability of parking. Additionally, some individuals have commutes up to 4 hours long and may benefit from extra time to nap or relax. Though free parking subsidies are insidious and paid for by non-drivers, pricing and managing spots through a web service or market rate can be implemented. Some European and Asian cities have successfully utilized this solution. However, it's essential to enforce the \"unoccupied vehicle\" rule and consider congestion pricing for all road use time in high congestion areas.San Francisco has limited off-street parking, which leads to expensive parking on the streets with high car break-in rates. Some argue that mandating minimums of free parking is absurd. Self-driving cars could coordinate with each other to park as well as pick passengers up, but many are skeptical of the potential issues. There may be a moonshot idea that cars talk to each other, but shared, open standards and protocols are unlikely to be established. Simple tech solutions such as implementing a standard way to cast your phone onto the screen in the car is still lacking despite the advancement in tech.A discussion on self-driving cars prompted HN users to debate the potential impact of the technology on public transportation, urban density, housing, parking, and labor markets. Some noted a fear that self-driving cars will lead to unclear ethical decisions around their behavior in accidents. Others used examples of long commutes to propose living in self-driving cars instead of traditional housing. However, many HN users agreed that self-driving cars have the potential to lower transportation costs and produce a more efficient use of available parking options. Overall, HN users were intrigued by the new possibilities self-driving cars may offer but remained cautious in their expectations.HN users discuss the realities of long commutes, with some citing examples of extreme length, and others pointing out the negative consequences of spending so much time in transit. Self-driving cars are suggested as a possible solution, with some users envisioning new infrastructure and rules to support them. However, others caution that densification may not be the best option for already-crowded cities like NYC and SF, noting that such cities are already struggling with issues such as increased traffic and high costs of living. Some users argue for the benefits of public transit, while others express skepticism.The potential for cities to turn parking lots into parks or multi-purpose areas is being discussed on Hacker News, with one user suggesting cars that never have a driver could be much smaller. Some users suggest that in ten years time fewer people will be owning vehicles, with more using autonomous transport. It's also pointed out that as efficiency increases, usage also increases, due to Jevon's Paradox. Finally, there is discussion of how future transportation technology will affect pedestrians and bicyclists.A user claims that \"voting with your wallet\" happens every time someone spends money on a product, indicating approval of the company's practices. A user suggests that not buying self-driving cars won't stop companies from creating them, but it's their preference. The younger generation may lose the option to own a regular car over time. There is debate about the efficiency of idle self-driving cars on the road. Self-driving cars may not be wholly dystopian, and there are potential benefits, such as reduced pollution and noise; however, some risks include increased traffic and decreased safety for pedestrians and bikers. Mass car rental services can rationalize ownership, reduce the number of cars on the road, and improve parking.Experts predict that self-driving cars will lead to companies purchasing large fleets rather than individuals owning cars, with people paying for transportation services instead. The best self-driving cars will be too expensive for most to buy, so fleets will become more commonplace. With AI optimizing fleet usage and governments taxing companies per km/time interval/peak hours, transportation services will become more effective and efficient. However, some experts predict that most people won't think of their cars as investments, so they will not care about them being on the road as much as possible. The cost of manned vehicles and storage for cars will remain high. Public transit in North America is generally inadequate, so self-driving cars are seen as a cost-effective alternative, and roads will communicate with these cars, which could make roads safer.Experts discuss the potential for self-driving technology to revolutionize public transportation and reduce emissions. One user notes the importance of dedicated bus lanes to prevent buses from slowing down as traffic. Another proposes applying self-driving technology to buses, while others discuss the potential for small self-driving cars to replace personal vehicles. The issue of microplastics from tire emissions is raised as a potential downside. Finally, the potential drawbacks of self-driving public transportation are discussed, including the need for surveillance and potential social credit score systems.Self-driving cars can lead to real-time traffic management at scale, reduce pollution, and make transportation cheaper with ever-faster sandwich delivery. Concerns about the negative aspects of self-driving cars arise like pedestrian safety,\u00a0governance and ownership issues, and investments in transit infrastructure. Some users foresee teleoperated car compartments that transport not just passengers but also sandwiches.\u00a0Automobile-focused infrastructure needs massive investment in traditional forms of transit. The future of self-driving cars looks promising and may not look like Tesla but more like a moving office or comfortable family room to enjoy quality time without worrying about\u00a0driving. Cars may talk to each other to utilize the road better, but failure of these systems is catastrophic in nature. There is a huge opportunity waiting for brighter minds to figure out how to make our transportation safer and more efficient.San Francisco officials blame driverless cars for congestion, yet experts claim that these cars will not clog the streets but instead wait in inaccessible areas for new orders. Some commenters defend driverless cars, claiming they are safer for pedestrians than human drivers. The article also addresses the problem of sideshows that frequently occur in San Francisco. Overall, driverless cars may not be the main cause of traffic jam, but city officials and drivers alike are quick to point fingers.An article about Cruise cars causing traffic congestion has attracted sarcastic comments, with one person comparing the problem to boat traffic blocking bridges in Seattle, and another suggesting a reverse-toll system where drivers, pedestrians and bus passengers are paid a small amount when boats create delays. However, some comments suggest the article highlights issues with bus rules as much as it does driverless technology. Commenters also warn that an enforcement mechanism must exist for self-driving technology, which will be scrutinized more closely and must perform better than traditional human drivers.",

Users discuss the effectiveness of ChatGPT 3.5 versus GPT 4 and the issue of token pricing. While some note the limitations of current AI, others propose potential uses such as creating a personal AI assistant. Importantly, the post draws attention due to the novelty of using ChatGPT for personal concierge services, leading to discussions about its practicality and limitations.A recent Hacker News post discusses the improvements made to an open-source ChatGPT artificial intelligence model that can help improve productivity. Users could use the chat interface to prioritize and remember tasks with more human intuition, although the various questions around embedding data storage and historical limits remain. Some users have created their own version of this app on platforms such as Discord and WhatsApp. Despite the interest in the new technology, some users criticize the high cost of Twilio, which powers ChatGPT's voice-to-text input.Users on Hacker News are discussing ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses GPT4 and Langchain to assist with tasks and provide information. Some users express concerns about privacy and information sharing, while others share their experiences using ChatGPT in various contexts. Some users have developed their own versions of ChatGPT, and there are suggestions for using similar technology over SMS. Overall, the technology is still relatively new but is being integrated into more projects and products. It remains to be seen how privacy laws like GDPR will affect the future of LLM technology.OpenAI clarifies that running inference does not change the trained weights, and any updates to GPT-4 running a LoRA-pass will be an explicit decision by OpenAI. While OpenAI is saving ChatGPT data for later training purposes, they claim they are not retaining data through the API, though there are privacy concerns. OpenAI's \"reliably isolate sessions\" reference seems to point to protecting data when using non-API consumer products like ChatGPT and DALL-E.",

O'Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. BernsteinDownload a PDF of the paper titled Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, by Joon Sung Park and 5 other authorsDownload PDFAbstract: Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applicationsranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonalcommunication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generativeagents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiateconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the nextday. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends alarge language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiencesusing natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-levelreflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiategenerative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired byThe Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agentsusing natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents producebelievable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting withonly a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine'sDay party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over thenext two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to theparty, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. Wedemonstrate through ablation that the components of our agentarchitecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute criticallyto the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models withcomputational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural andinteraction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.

        "hn_content": "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior is an arxiv.org paper that has gained attention on Hacker News. The topic includes people asking the question of how to reduce behavior to discrete actions and gridded regions. Bots are a topic of discussion, with some wondering if they can be programmed to make data-driven stories. A 'inner voice' idea is discussed, one similar to how the hosts in Westworld hear programming directives. Lastly, it's concluded that creating a deep intelligence depends on the environment and that lack of universal entropy can be a crutch for the creation of a simulator.AI researchers discuss the limitations of language models, citing the need for training algorithms for modeling unarticulated common senses and inner voices. The experts also assert that LLMs are primitive and require higher-level algorithms for more control while addressing a simple simulated world. Although LLMs are also being studied for possible use in social sciences, an expert argues that bias from online sample sources may affect these models' accuracy. Researchers continue to develop knowledge-transfer mechanisms for artificial general intelligence (AGI) to refine and enhance models.Experts discuss the level of handholding required for complex tasks in AI and the limitations of models like ChatGPT. Two papers present memory-augmented GPT models- Self-Refine and Reflexion and examine their performance on simple tasks. Augmented models improve upon the baseline but the process requires specific scaffolding, branching decisions and prompting, interpreted as handholding. Comments question the definition of handholding and the limitations of the models in more complex domains. A few comments highlight their potential use in the gaming industry, while others discount the overstatement of the AI overlord potential.Researchers at Google have published a paper outlining their latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI), which includes the development of a \"generative transformer\" named Dreamer who can navigate a 3D room and interact with objects. Unlike most text-generation models, Dreamer is able to accumulate memories and use them to inform responses. While it's still a far cry from true consciousness, generating interactions based on prior experiences is a significant step towards self-direction, and could pave the way for self-learning chatbots and video game characters. The paper has sparked a debate about how AI agents should make ethical decisions, and whether they ought to be modelled on real or fictional characters.An AI experiment describes an environment where multiple #LLM (#GPT)-powered agents interact in a small town, displaying \"emoji summarization\" for actions in the world. They also cover \"inner-voice\" interactions and user interference on the simulation. The study focuses on agent memories, personality development, and planning interactions, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative measures. The study was expensive, taking substantial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, prompting ideas for coding more efficient character models. It is noted that the language is still stilted, and the simulation could benefit from future LLM designs.",

There have been numerous documented instances of such uncontrolled dancing throughout history, often during times of stress or fear. Possible explanations include LSD-like food poisoning or mass psychogenic illness. The cause of ancient dances and movements in religion is unknown, but there is a thread linking them. Modern medicine is unable to definitively explain restless leg syndrome, which is similar to the uncontrolled movements seen in the dancing epidemic of 1518.The Tech Times editor received user comments about a fun way to discover unusual historical events. Some users had questions, such as how to use the site, while others pointed out notable facts. An HN user drew parallels with recent cases of mass hysteria.

Here's the truth.By Tim NewcombPublished: Apr 8, 2023Save ArticleMirageC//Getty ImagesA Northwestern University study shows a decline in three key intelligence testing categories\u2014a tangible example of what is called the Reverse Flynn Effect.Leading up to the 1990s, IQ scores were consistently going up, but in recent years, that trend seems to have flipped. The reasons for both the increase and the decline are sill very much up for debate.Scores in verbal reasoning, matrix reasoning, and letter and number series all declined but, interestingly, scores in spatial reasoning went up.Americans\u2019 IQ scores are trending in a downward direction. In fact, they\u2019ve been falling for over a decade. According to a press release, in studying intelligence testing data from 2006 to 2018, Northwestern University researchers noticed that test scores in three out of four \u201ccognitive domains\u201d were going down. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a consistent negative slope for these testing categories, providing tangible evidence of what is known as the \u201cReverse Flynn Effect.\u201dIn a 1984 study, James Flynn noticed that intelligence test scores had steadily increased since the early 1930s. We call that steady rise the Flynn Effect. Considering that overall intelligence seemed to be increasing faster than could be explained by evolution, the reason increase became a source of debate, with many attributing the change to various environmental factors.More From Popular Mechanics\u00a0play iconThe triangle icon that indicates to playBut now, it seems that a Reverse Flynn Effect is, well, in effect.The study, published in the journal Intelligence, used an online, survey-style personality test called the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment Project to analyze nearly 400,000 Americans. The researchers recorded responses from 2006 and 2018, in order to examine if and how cognitive ability scores were changing over time within the country. The data showed drops in logic and vocabulary (known as verbal reasoning), visual problem solving and analogies (known as matrix reasoning), and computational and mathematical abilities (known as letter and number series). Related StoryHow Will AI Ruin Humanity?On the flip side, however, scores in spatial reasoning (known as 3D rotation) followed the opposite pattern, trending upward over the 12-year period. \u201cThere\u2019s a debate about what\u2019s causing it, but not every domain is going down; one of them is going up,\u201d Elizabeth Dworak, a research assistant professor at Northwestern University and one of the authors on the study, says in a news release. \u201cIf all the scores were going in the same direction, you could make a nice little narrative about it, but that\u2019s not the case. We need to do more to dig into it.\u201dDworak, a research assistant professor at Northwestern University and one of the authors on the study, is very clear that these results don\u2019t necessarily mean Americans are getting less intelligent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean their mental ability is lower or higher; it\u2019s just a difference in scores that are favoring older or newer samples,\u201d she said in a press release. \u201cIt could just be that they\u2019re getting worse at taking tests or specifically worse at taking these kinds of tests.\u201d And, it should be said, there has long been debate over how accurately IQ tests are able to gauge overall intelligence and potential for success in society in the first place.Regardless, scores are falling, and there\u2019s got to be a reason for the decline. Dworak says it might have something to do with \u201ca shift in perceived values in society.\u201d She offers up the potential explanation that an increase in focus on STEM education may have allowed other areas, like abstract reasoning, to fall by the wayside.Related StoryShould We Worry About AI Reaching Singularity?\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about what society cares about and what it\u2019s emphasizing and reinforcing every day,\u201d she says, \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility of that being reflected in performance on an ability test.\u201dA few other hypotheses have been put forth to try and explain the reverse Flynn Effect, such as falling nutritional standards, the worsening of school systems, social media, increased air pollution, or the idea that people just be less interested in portions of the SPAP Project personality survey.Falling IQs have become yet another mystery for scientists to solve.

        "hn_content": "American IQ scores have seen a rapid drop that indicates the \"Reverse Flynn effect\". While the trend overall shows a decline, the year-by-year variation across education groups is highly correlated, which could point to an issue with measurement validity. An IQ test is a relative measure that compares an individual's score to the population at a point in time. IQ tests usually require a set of questions, a sample group and comparison between scores on previous years\u2019 tests. Flynn effect occurred when researchers noticed people who scored 100 on a recent test scored higher on previous years' tests. Understanding the primary readers\u2019 needs and interpreting comments correctly is crucial in writing concise and precise summaries.An HN user debates whether raw scores on IQ tests can be compared across time and tests. Another implies that normalization is meant to make scores outside of the test meaningful. A new test must be compared to ensure it measures the same thing. YouTube video cited providing info on IQ tests. A user offers the theory that early test-takers failed to understand questions' puzzle nature. STEM majors\u2019 ability to teach critical thinking challenged. Academics in humanities struggle to define critical thinking. Rigor in non-STEM academia may lack clarity and suffer from obfuscating language.A discussion on abstract reasoning and critical thinking skills in non-STEM fields sparks debate among HN users. Google autocomplete results and personal experience indicate a common criticism of STEM majors lacking critical thinking skills. However, some argue the opposite may also be true, and language imprecision can add a layer of complexity to tests of critical thinking skills. Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of different ways of thinking and the need for improving critical thinking skills across all fields.A blog post argues that IQ scores of the population as a whole are not dropping, but rather the change in composition of each group is causing the drop for each individual group. HN users point out the author's infamous viewpoints, and some recommend RationalWiki or a related Wikipedia article for more information. The use of ad-hominem is debated, but the argument is plausible and aligns with personal experience. The author of the blog post is unknown, so some caution is advised.A commenter on a recent Hacker News post discusses logical fallacies and how knowing who is making an argument can sometimes influence people's opinions. Another commenter critiques a blogger who appears to have made a mistake about dropping IQ scores, while a different commenter muses on the concept of measuring intelligence through IQ tests. The primary subject of the post itself is unclear from the raw content provided.A new study analyzing the cognitive ability scores of nearly 400,000 Americans found a decline in IQ, with vocabulary, numeracy, and analogies tests faring worse than spatial reasoning. However, some question whether IQ tests are measuring the right skills, as an expansive vocabulary may be less relevant in today's society. There is debate among academics regarding IQ decline, with experts disagreeing on whether genetic or environmental factors are at work. While psychometrics is dismissed by some, experts assert that there is no link between racial demographics and IQ scores when accounting for socioeconomic factors.Language skills are more than just vocabulary, as it can influence one's thinking and ability to categorize. Linguistic determinism is disproven, but the value of vocabulary lies in its ability to contextualize and identify concepts. A larger vocabulary sets one apart from others, making it valuable, especially when quick contextual shifts are necessary. There is a shift away from teaching critical thinking in schools, which is a departure from problem-solving to group thinking and memorizing 'correct' answers. The rate of stay-at-home parents has mostly stayed unchanged, but fewer parents in general have children, and the trend may reflect a decrease in IQ related to communication skills. The high heritability of IQ within races does not mean that race differences are genetic, and interventions can affect IQ by environmental means. From the macro scale, high IQ moves society forward while affecting individuals negatively, showing that high-level selection pressure is active in human nature.Comments on an article about \"The Bell Curve,\" a controversial book on the relationship between genetics and intelligence, include critiques of the book's bad science and policy proposals, as well as its use of a disgraced eugenicist as a source. Some commenters also discuss the heritability of IQ and how social welfare programs may have influenced the evolution of human intelligence. One commenter notes the role of sexual selection in evolutionary processes, while another jokes about the impact of their own comments on IQ levels. Despite differing opinions, the article leaves the possibility open that both genes and environment contribute to racial differences in intelligence but refrains from making any claims as to the exact proportions of each.A discussion on HN about the validity of IQ tests and the possible reasons behind rising or falling IQ scores over time. An article was criticized for lacking specific results and quantifiable data. One user shares a summary of \"The Flynn Effect,\" which explains the observed rise of IQ scores over time. The concept of genetic determination and natural selection pressure on IQ is challenged, and alternative theories include cultural shifts, exposure to media, and a possible decline in population health. The thread includes sarcastic comments and some political accusations.The heritability of IQ is being discussed in the comments section of a post, with some users pointing out that heritability does not necessarily mean genetic or biological factors are at play. Twin studies have shown a genetic component to intelligence, but more research is needed to determine how much is biologically likely for high-IQ parents to produce high-IQ kids. Anecdotal evidence suggests that high-IQ parents often have high-IQ children, but this correlation could be due to other factors such as socioeconomic status. There has been a distancing from the whole field of IQ research in modern psychology and policy makers, with many believing that the supposed heritability was observed because of bias within the research.The argument over IQ's heritability has historical context with eugenics and racial discrimination, which has led to a social policy that attributes outcomes to other factors. Accepting IQ as heritable would lead to better-targeted social policies and resolution of current divisive issues. Heritability refers to genetic contributions and not necessarily genetically determined factors. The demon-haunted world of quasi-religious opposition to IQ research has contributed to a lack of research on the subject.Comments on an HN post argue about the heritability of IQ as a genetic trait, with one user suggesting that the taboo around researching genetic determinism in this area reflects a fear of the implications for society, and another user pointing out that there is no evidence to support the claim that IQ is genetically determined. The discussion also touches on the operational definitions of intelligence and the potential implications of accepting IQ as a valid science, including the allocation of resources for equal opportunity programs, the potential for corrupt political activity, and the establishment of targeted social programs.Experts on Hacker News are debating the role of IQ in society and AI research. Some argue that understanding IQ as largely genetic would improve resource allocation, while others warn against eugenicist arguments. The validity and heritability of IQ have been discussed, but some suggest that IQ has lost relevance to modern psychology. Researchers are also examining IQ data in other countries to address potential biases. Overall, the debate highlights the complexities of measuring intelligence and the ethical considerations when discussing genetics and resource allocation.New research shows that IQ scores in developed countries have decreased steadily since the 1970s while spatial reasoning has gone up, prompting many to suggest the rise of video games as a possible factor. However, some attribute the decline to income inequality and reductions in wages, the prevalence of safety measures and an increase in the number of larger family sizes among lower-income families. Despite the widespread use of these tests, some claim that IQ research has no theory of behaviour other than this hypothetical general intelligence with no successful double blind trials to back up its claims. Meanwhile, other experts have suggested IQ tests are useful in several areas including college admissions, magnet schools and military recruitment.Five children, including two born addicted to heroin, have apparently succeeded in Darwinian terms, and one of them is now confidently pursuing a career in retail management. The relationship between education and IQ was discussed in the comments, with one user pointing out that while education and IQ may be correlated, there are other factors involved, and IQ itself is disputed as a reliable measure of intelligence. Some users argued that dismissing someone's intellect based on their profession may be unfair and pointed to examples of highly intelligent individuals who worked in seemingly menial jobs. The IQ test was also criticized as being largely pseudoscientific. Overall, the post did not seem to have a clear central topic or significant new information.",

The display is poorly designed according to users, and the sample code is beyond awful, making screen updating a challenge. Despite the lack of an indexed color or grayscale support, touch data can be copied to memory, allowing users to explore further. The maximum possible framerate in ideal conditions is 50.86fps, but noise requires touch to be sampled precisely, subtracting some CPU-free time.A new article on RP2040 microcontroller discusses using a display controller alongside DMA and PIO machinery. The post describes the creation of different modes, including 1bpp, 2bpp and 4bpp modes, with 16, 4 and 2 greyscales respectively\u00a0and an indexed-colors mode. One DMA channel is used to program another to copy actual RGB565 values to the display, while a bidirectional pushback mechanism is used to allow touch sampling. The post explains that while working on the project, the author\u00a0ran into an issue with DMA chaining, which was resolved by always triggering a channel using certain register addresses.A touch display is unreliable due to noise and improper sampling, while also sharing an SPI bus with an SD card; it is suggested to wire the SD card to different pins for better performance. The clock speed should be set correctly to avoid data being sent too fast for the display to handle. The setup involves bit-banging SPI using GPIO until enabling all machinery, and API includes dispSetDepth(), dispSetClut(), dispInit(), dispOn()/dispOff(). The code can be downloaded with a BSD 2-clause license, and can be modified for use with Arduino or Micropython.",

Other users commented on the flexibility of the DMA units, temporal resolution, and oversampling for smoothing. The post stands out due to its unique tech details and ability to offload the work to the PIO. This is not a dull post on a new technology as it provides insights on how to drive an outdated design. The readers are experts in the tech field, and the post offers a new and exciting solution to an old problem.A user on Hacker News presents their project using the PIO (Programmable IO) system on a RP2040 microcontroller to drive a Waveshare 2.8-inch TFT touch display with minimal CPU usage. This is accomplished by creating a custom PIO program that runs directly on the display's pins to handle all the graphics tasks, bypassing the need for DMA or software updates. Other users express their admiration and interest in the project and PIOs' potential use for handling interfaces like flash or cursed displays found on AliExpress. The article reminds readers that PIOs can be used to manage various peripheral hardware resources creatively by efficiently utilizing the CPU to perform more demanding tasks.An HN user reveals that the RP2040 is a $1 MCU that can be overclocked to 300MHz. Another user suggests that the ubiquitous ILI9488 3.5 in displays with resistive touch screen for less than $6 (not including shipping) could work. However, the original poster needs a screen with less pixels (320x240) due to RAM limitations. The comments include discussions regarding various types of screens and MCUs and their prices for those looking to experiment with the original poster's project.",

This is just a small thought experiment for a different ranking algorithm for HN. There's nothing wrong with the current one, but it's just a small thought experiment.Just to refresh, according to Paul Graham's comment and FAQ, the HN algorithm is...\\(rank = {\\frac {P - 1}{(T + 2)^G}}\\)P = Points T = Age in hoursG = 1.8Minus one removes the user's own upvote. By default, HN upvotes its own user submission.I\u2019ve seen one with penalties but let\u2019s stick to what\u2019s official. Also, I just did a quick Grep search and found this article and wonderful repo about \u201cReverse Engineering the Hacker News Ranking Algorithm\u201cIntuitively, the ranking algorithm is simple: the more upvotes a link receives in a short amount of time, the higher it will be ranked at the top. As time passes, the post will gradually move down the rankings.Here is my approachI can't find the official page on why Paul Graham created HN, but to me, HN is the place to find the most interesting links and have a healthy discussion about various topics. In fact, discussions are my favorite part, except for the useless comments.Given that discussions are my favorite part, why don't we apply PageRank for every user based on the upvotes they receive for the comments they leave on any post, and replace the P (points) value in the current version of the HN algorithm?PageRank is an algorithm created by the founders of Google. It is used to determine the popularity of web pages on the internet.By the way, the name PageRank did not suit this use case. I am going to call it HackerRank (HR). Here is a visualization if you are trying to picture it.Since it's likely that one user may upvote multiple comments from the same user, we check whether a user has already upvoted a comment from that specific user before considering their upvote. In other words, we treat user profiles as nodes and upvotes for comments as edges.Considering this, a HackerRank user profile will look like this:\\(HR_{i}={\\frac {1-D}{N}}+D\\,\\sum _{{j\\in \\{1,\\dots ,n\\}}}{\\frac {HR_{j}}{TU_{j}}}\\)N = Total number of user profiles on HND = Damping factorHR = HackerRank score for the user who upvotedTU = Total upvotes givenBy default, the HR for every profile will be 1/N.But I won't consider HackerRank as it is. Sometimes, HN comments are inappropriate, and they will be flagged. We should consider the flagging because, remember, HN should be a place to have healthy discussions. Let's consider that 1 flag equals a deduction of 20% from the HR score. However, we will only take into account the flags received in the current month, as people can change from being unpleasant to becoming better human beings.So, HR with \u201cflag\u201d consideration will look like this.\\(HR_{with flag} = HR - ((TF * FP) * HR)\\)\\(HR = max(0, \\space HR_{withflag})\\)TF = Total flags received in the current monthFP = Flag penalty which is 20%If HR is negative, then it will be 0.We now have HR for every user profile, so the final ranking algorithm will look like this by hooking HR into the current version of the HN algorithm.\\(rank_{i} = {\\frac {\\sum_{{j\\in \\{1,\\dots ,n\\}}} (HR_{j})}{(T + 2)^G}}\\)HR = HR value represents the HackerRank score of the profile that upvoted this postT = Age in hoursG = 1.8 This is a very simple approach, but here are some other ideas that are worth exploring.HackerRank score, which is also determined by the upvotes a user receives for their submissions.Reading time for the article.Track how well a website is performing on HN and put it on the front page if the website has a high reputation for performing well.Will I ever publicly write about how HN ranks posts if I am Dang (HN moderator)? No, because Pagerank can be manipulated by people despite its reputation. In fact, Pagerank is being exploited for years. Moreover, there are financial incentives for companies to get on the first page in HN.I would use HackerRank for ranking posts but publicly say that we are using original PaulGraham\u2019s algorithm for ranking posts, and hide the upvotes for comments since it is powering HackerRank, also take some additional steps to avoid reverse engineering and rank manipulation.But, I am curious. How would you have done it? If you were designing the HN algorithm, please leave your thoughts in the comments. I am curious to know.Discussion on HN \u2192 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35510413Plug: Hey, we are building a new kind of search engine.

One commenter suggests that the entirety of HN's codebase should be made public, while others caution against using PageRank due to the potential for manipulation. Some users question the necessity of having a ranking/voting system at all, while others suggest using reading time and word count as starting points for determining rankings. The author suggests adding a decay factor for PageRank to encourage active engagement in the community.Comments on a Hacker News article discuss the ambiguous nature of the upvote button, highlighting the need for two dimensions: one for the quality of the comment, the other for alignment with the voter's perspective. Some suggest the LessWrong forum's split between \u201cupvotes/downvotes\u201d and \u201cagree/disagree\u201d could be a possible solution. Other users note shortcomings in the system for comment-ranking within an article, specifically with the conversational flow and difficulty in catching up with comments later on an article. An interface that prioritizes high-quality comments and popular viewpoints during various modes may offer the best solution.Hacker News users discuss the flaws of social media websites in concentrating power among a few users with massive influence. Users try to reverse-engineer the HN ranking algorithm by discussing and suggesting new metrics to improve it. The post includes a discussion on how HN started and the nature of the site. There are also suggestions on how to make commenting on HN better. HN users reflect on the possible trade-offs of using machine learning to rank content on the site. Some HN users resist the idea of implementing a reputation-based ranking system in the site. Other suggestions were given such as using downvotes to regulate content. Users point out the potential impacts of adding more complexity and tabs. HN users discuss ways to detect and handle manipulated postings on the site.An HN user suggests changing HN's algorithm to fix several problems, including spam and the exclusion of valuable users. The proposal involves creating a bipartite graph of users and comments and using upvotes and flags as directed edges. Another user explains the \"gameability\" of PageRank and provides a solution to personalize each user's PageRank based on their past upvotes. Some comments argue against changing HN's algorithm, while others point out issues with the current system, such as mass flagging and the rapid disappearance of popular posts.The article warns against the use of HN for political discussions and encourages curiosity. There is a distinction that must be made to weigh whether a post is on-topic based on the framing. HN seems suitable for engaging in discussions, as comments that do not contribute or are inappropriate do not remain visible for long. Even though some may disagree on what to upvote, the community could uphold guidelines. The blog post cited is confused, but it touches upon the potential gaming of HN ranking. Despite any issues with HN, it is best not to fix what is not broken.",

        "content": "Shutting down all of the US nuclear plants could increase air pollution and result in over 5,000 pollution-related deaths, according to a study by MIT researchers. Coal, oil, and natural gas would increase air pollution if nuclear power were phased out, increasing pollution-related deaths. However, if renewable energy sources became increasingly available to replace nuclear plants, pollution-related deaths should drop. Black communities who are primarily based near fossil fuel plants would experience the largest exposure to increased pollution. Overall, the study reveals that air quality has not been adequately discussed in conversations regarding the power of nuclear plant closures.MIT's Center for Transportation and Logistics examines automation's impact on jobs. Scientists map winds in a neutron star system to understand galaxy formation. MIT develops D2X, a tool to debug domain-specific programming languages. MIT engineers create modeling framework to speed up development of flow batteries. MIT mourns Nelson Yuan-sheng Kiang, who conducted pioneering research on auditory physiology. Runako Gentles, an environmental engineering major, seeks to lead projects to improve society's relationship with the environment.",
        "summary": "Shutting down US nuclear plants may raise air pollution by over 5,000 deaths, MIT researchers warned. The increase in pollution will be due to coal, oil, and gas being used instead. Renewables replacing nuclear plants, however, may reduce pollution-related deaths. The Black community will be most exposed to increased pollution as these groups tend to live closer to fossil fuel plants. The MIT study indicates that air quality hasn't been fully addressed in conversations about closing nuclear plants.",

        "hn_content": "Shutting down nuclear power plants could lead to an increase in air pollution, according to a study from MIT. Commentators on Hacker News questioned the validity of the report, with some differing on the degree of air pollution caused by nuclear power and the nature of its replacement. Some remarks included sarcastic comments and were flagged as inappropriate. Nonetheless, nuclear power is considered to be a more efficient and cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.The comparison of the US to individual western countries in news outlets is often misleading but seemingly popular, according to some HN users. A comment pointed out that while the US has more nuclear reactors operating per person than the EU, over half of the EU's reactors are deployed in France. Another user added that France enjoys the lowest per capita CO2 emissions for electrical generation in the world, and the parent commenter countered with the downsides of nuclear energy. There is a debate over whether the US would be better off with nuclear or by investing in renewables.News outlets are unfairly comparing the US to other countries, which is misleading and marginalises the reader's understanding of competing arguments; darknavi asks if EU nations have a nuclear agreement to work together in space, to which c4mpute replies EURATOM is not running any commercial reactors, and acts more as a political body for control and exchange of knowledge; opinion on nuclear power is divided, some argue it could become a vital solution while others argue it isn't safe; advocates also established that modern nuclear reactors are safer than legacy reactors such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima reactors, but its opponents believe the tail risk is enormous; finally, dam failures are responsible for most hydroelectric power disaster casualties in history, Chinese dam failure is responsible for the majority of dam-related deaths.A conversation on Hacker News about nuclear power vs. other forms of energy highlights concerns over radioactive pollution but also acknowledges that the risk profile of nuclear power is different than other forms of power. The discussion also touches on the cost of renewable energy versus nuclear, the concerns over accidents and their potential harm to the biosphere, and the need for seasonal storage. Many believe nuclear power is too expensive and takes too long to build, but others suggest scaling it up could make it cheaper and safer. The conversation overall emphasizes the need for investment in renewables and a long-term strategy for energy production.Comments on a Hacker News post about nuclear power and renewable energy cover a variety of topics, including cost, regulation, and safety concerns. One user laments the political polarization around different forms of energy and proposes a technology-independent law for power plant accidents. Another user notes the success of Germany's rapid decarbonization without nuclear power but receiving less criticism than coal-heavy Poland due to not appearing to make nuclear look unnecessary. The discussion also covers the cost of building new nuclear power plants and the risk of disasters in newer generations of reactors. Despite the risks, some users favor nuclear power over fossil fuels, citing the latter's immediate health hazards and contribution to climate change. The potential of fusion power remains a topic of conversation, with some predicting it will be attainable in 50 years or so, though there is skepticism based on previous optimistic predictions.Comments on a Hacker News post discuss the potential limitations of nuclear power towards energy transition. Some comments suggest the need for significant energy production for possible future use of fusion power technology. However, others argue the dangers of nuclear power and the advantages of wind energy as an alternative. The comments also highlight various benefits of wind energy production over solar energy, such as lower land use per GW and lesser costs for operations and maintenance. There are also concerns about China's heavy reliance on the solar supply chain.",

        "hn_content": "Apple has seen the steepest plunge in PC shipments among major computer makers. However, some users are still reluctant to upgrade their Macbooks. The demand created during the pandemic showed an unusual spike. People with pre-2016 models upgraded to M1 models, which were a significant jump from Intel MBPs. Despite people upgrading, it seems that the M1 models will not need to be upgraded for a while. The performance increases were incremental, the most significant jump in performance was observed in the Air. The Macbooks' tight integration of the whole platform gives a better experience overall.Apple laptop users are using a patch to run Catalina despite it being past its end of life, while some users prefer to wait for an Mx upgrade, others are happy with their older models, and some are drawn towards the M1/M2 processor's longer battery life. The soldered memory boosts the machine's performance, but soldered storage can make it difficult for users requiring more storage space. Mac shipments have increased more than other PC makers, with Apple being the only company above its 2019 figures. The jump in demand might be correlated with the government's stimulus checks.Stimulus checks may have contributed to a surge in Macbook sales, especially the entry-level Macbook Air. The M1 processor and improved I/O and form factor may have also convinced customers to upgrade. Apple's success with the M1 means customers might not need to upgrade for a while. Many people find 8GB of RAM sufficient, and tech companies often provide their employees with Macbooks. However, some people are finding other options due to Apple moving away from Intel and not supporting GPU-intensive apps. Overall, it appears that Apple may continue to gain market share with its Macbooks.Discussion on the reliability of laptop PCs across different brands and comments on Apple's OneDrive equivalent, iCloud. Users debate the quality of hardware and operating systems between different manufacturers. The conversation turns to gaming capabilities, touchscreens as a mandatory option, and the decline of quality on hardware for Thinkpads. A user praises Apple's devices, claiming that they \"just work\", while others note the problems with sleep mode and speakers on Lenovo laptops. There is also speculation that Windows is \"spyware\", leading some to remove the entire operating system from their machines.While a user raves about the quality of a laptop they purchased from Apple, other users criticize the company's software and services, such as iCloud, for being subpar and lacking transparency. Commenters mention issues with sync time, lack of versioning, and poor diagnostics. Apple's upgrades for storage and RAM are also criticized for being expensive. In response, some users defend Apple, arguing that the company offers enterprise-grade SSDs and that alternatives to iCloud exist.Some Hacker News users are discussing why people are holding off from upgrading their Macs. Factors include financial shifts due to Covid-19 and the longevity of existing Macs among users, while some note the leap to M1 convinced them to upgrade. Some HN users report that their Macs are still working fine after six or more years, while others cite e-waste and cooling issues as reservations against purchasing a new Mac. A few users mention that traditional tech industries, banks or large enterprises still primarily use Windows machines. One user who recently bought an M1 states they don't feel tempted to replace theirs anytime soon.Apple users have different opinions about upgrading to newer models, with some preferring to stick with older devices that are still functional. Some users prefer desktop machines over smartphones or laptops, while others worry that desktop and laptop computers may become niche platforms. A debate ensues about whether people need Apple products or not, with comments about the cost and availability of alternatives. An argument also arises about whether smartphones could replace computers or not, with some users pointing out the limitations of the form factor. Overall, the comments highlight varying perspectives on the use and necessity of Apple products in light of changing economic and technological factors.Apple's declining sales may be due to everyone buying M-series laptops, leaving their macbook pipeline dry. The pandemic telework shift forced new purchases for many, reducing the number of people who think they need a new computer to be more productive. A sarcastic commenter claims that 99% of Apple customers don't know what an M1 processor is or why it matters, they just want something new and different. Others point out that EU pricing for Apple products is insane compared to other PC laptops with similar specs.Swedes are paying significantly more for MacBooks than Americans due to high tax rates, but some are joking it's cheaper to fly to the US, buy one there, and fly back. However, Americans should remember that foreign visitors must pay VAT and possible duty on goods at customs, otherwise, it's tax evasion. Some states in the US, like Delaware and Oregon, have no sales tax. Apple's pricing policies for its MacBooks are becoming too steep, according to some HN users, with lower-end models being too expensive for most non-tech users.While Apple's \"obsolete\" designation only means they will no longer get software updates, one HN user thinks that Linux would make the MacBook viable, saying that macOS is hostile. However, another user says that they have root access on their MacBook and can install any UNIX package using homebrew; there are few things a Linux workstation can do that a MacBook cannot, except for niche technologies. A HN user suggests that Apple would do well to support non-Apple software platforms, such as Linux, on Apple hardware. Another suggests that an Apple Linux gaming console based on a Mac Mini would not require many changes, but Apple would need to give up their proprietary 3D API in favor of a standard.MacBooks are praised for their longevity, with some users going up to 10+ years before replacement, even for development tasks. Despite high sales in 2020/2021, sales are expected to decrease due to the saturation of the market coupled with mobile devices taking over most computing needs. Apple's pricing model for the M1 generation was criticized by some users, who felt it was too expensive for what it offered. Asahi Linux for M1's is a great option for those who prefer a more work-oriented OS alongside their Mac. The debate on upgrading PC hardware is ongoing as CPUs and GPUs have been overpowered for all but niche markets.",

An HN user suggests a graduated pay system based on revenue growth, while others note that non-founder employees may not benefit as much from equity compared to working for established companies. A user suggests co-ops as a potential solution to sharing rewards. It is acknowledged that many employees overvalue startup equity, but this may be changing. Founders are encouraged to pay employees closer to market rate.Tech industry employees should focus on getting what's best for them, as they are adults who can choose what works. A startup CEO shares his experience with paying himself a salary, and suggests that founders should pay themselves enough to focus on growing their business without worrying about personal finances. Equity valuation and the value of work are the most challenging aspects to consider in compensation. Crypto startup compensation is competing with FAANG startups, and most of them offer additional, liquid non-cash compensation. Finally, some people have high expectations for the industry, while others find $130K to be a reasonable salary for entry-level employees.Entrepreneurship requires paying oneself fairly for legal reasons, as advised by both lawyers and tax accountants. However, determining an appropriate salary can be challenging since it's tricky to balance the company's financial stability while providing a reasonable compensation. Startups receiving venture capital often face the obstacle of balancing market-competitive compensation packages with retaining equity. While paying oneself equitably is a must-do, the counter-argument is often that starting a profitable bootstrapped business is risky and can sometimes still fail to turn a profit. Receiving below-market-rate pay can result in founder burnout, so a salary that mimics what one would expect to pay a salaried employee could be an optimum solution.Tech Times reports on a diverse set of comments on Hacker News regarding payment and compensation for startup founders. One comment notes that great caution should be taken with regards to venture capital, as, \"if you've raised venture capital, you have let the leaches in.\" Another comment argues that startup founders should be compensated generously, provided the salary doesn't overly drain company funds. A third comment states that founders should pay themselves comfortably and charge investors a carry only after becoming a unicorn.

        "content": "Ben Greenberg | Developer Advocateskip to main content About Blog Home Projects Talks WritingsAbout Writings Talks Projects BlogUse GitHub Actions to Make Your GitHub Profile DynamicBen GreenbergApril 9, 2023Where do people first discover you online? Perhaps your social media presence is the first thing people find when they search for you, or perhaps it\u2019s the portfolio site you created for yourself. However, if you use GitHub to share your code and participate in open source projects, then your GitHub profile may be the first place people go to in order to learn more about you.What do you want your GitHub profile to say about you? How do you want to express what is important to you and who you are in a concise and easy to read manner for visitors? Whether they are a prospective employer or a prospective partner in an open source project, it\u2019s imperative you have a profile that stands out.Using GitHub Actions, you can turn a static markdown document into a dynamic experience that stays up to date on the latest information about you. How do you do that?I\u2019ll show you an example of how you can do this quickly and without too much effort. In this example, you\u2019ll learn how to scrape a website and use that data to dynamically update your GitHub profile. We\u2019ll show this example in Ruby, but you can do this with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or other languages.How Your GitHub Profile WorksYour GitHub profile is found by going to github.com/[your-username] in a web browser, here\u2019s mine for example. Where does the content for that view come from?It lives in a special repository in your account with the name of your account username. If you do not have this repository yet, you will not see any special content when you visit github.com/[your-username], so the first step is to ensure you have that repository created, and if you do not, go ahead and create it.Exploring the files in the profile repositoryThe only required file in the repository is a README.md file that is the source of your profile page../\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.mdGo ahead and add some content in that file, save it, and refresh your username homepage, and you will see that content reflected there.Adding the right folders for dynamic contentBefore we create the code to make our profile dynamic, let\u2019s add the folder structure.Inside the top-level add a new folder called .github and inside .github add two new sub-folders: scripts/ and workflows/.Your file structure should now look like this:./\u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows/\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.mdMaking a Dynamic ProfileWe need to do three things for this example:Define a place in the README where the dynamic content will beAdd a script inside scripts/ that will do the scraping workAdd a workflow for GitHub Actions inside workflows/ that will run the script on a scheduleLet\u2019s do each of those steps now.Updating the READMEWe need to add a section to the README that can be grabbed using Regex by the script to modify. It can be whatever you need it to be for your specific use case. For this example, we\u2019ll add a section for recent blog posts in the README.Open up the README.md file in a code editor and add the following:### Recent blog postsNow we have an area for the script to find.Creating the scriptThe example script we are building is written in Ruby and uses the GitHub gem octokit to interact with your repository, the nokogiri gem to scrape the website, and the httparty gem to make the HTTP request.In this example below, the element to be scraped has already been identified. In your own use case, you\u2019ll need to discover the path to the element on the site you wish to scrape, and it will undoubtedly be different than what is shown below as defined in the posts variable and for each title and link of each post.Here is the example code, which goes in the scripts/ folder:require 'httparty'require 'nokogiri'require 'octokit'# Scrape blog posts from the websiteurl = \"https://www.bengreenberg.dev/blog/\"response = HTTParty.get(url)parsed_page = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body)posts = parsed_page.css('.flex.flex-col.rounded-lg.shadow-lg.overflow-hidden')# Generate the updated blog posts list (top 5)posts_list = [\"\\n### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n\"]posts.first(5).each do |post| title = post.css('p.text-xl.font-semibold.text-gray-900').text.strip link = \"https://www.bengreenberg.dev#{post.at_css('a')[:href]}\" posts_list << \"* [#{title}](#{link})\"end# Update the README.md fileclient = Octokit::Client.new(access_token: ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'])repo = ENV['GITHUB_REPOSITORY']readme = client.readme(repo)readme_content = Base64.decode64(readme[:content]).force_encoding('UTF-8')# Replace the existing blog posts sectionposts_regex = /### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n[\\s\\S]*?(?=<\\/td>)/mupdated_content = readme_content.sub(posts_regex, \"#{posts_list.join(\"\\n\")}\\n\")client.update_contents(repo, 'README.md', 'Update recent blog posts', readme[:sha], updated_content)As you can see, first an HTTP request is made to the website and the section with the blog posts is gathered and the data is assigned to a posts variable. Then, the script iterates through the blog posts inside the posts variable and gathers the first 5 of them. You may want to change that number for your own needs. Each loop through the blog posts, a post is added to an array of posts_list with the title and the URL to the blog post.Lastly, the README file is updated by first finding it using the octokit gem, and then locating the spot in the README to update with some regex: posts_regex = /### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n[\\s\\S]*?(?=<\\/td>)/m.This script will do the job, but nothing is actually invoking this script. How does it get run? This is where GitHub Actions comes to the rescue!Creating the Action workflowNow that we have the script in place, we need a way to automatically run it on a schedule. GitHub Actions provides a powerful way to automate a wide variety of tasks, including running scripts. In this case, we\u2019ll create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the script once a week at midnight on Sunday.The workflow file should be placed in the .github/workflows/ directory and can be named something like update_blog_posts.yml. Here\u2019s the content of the workflow file:name: Update Recent Blog Postson: schedule:  - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Run once a week at 00:00 (midnight) on Sunday workflow_dispatch:jobs: update_posts:  runs-on: ubuntu-latest  steps:  - name: Check out repository   uses: actions/checkout@v2  - name: Set up Ruby   uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1   with:    ruby-version: 3.1  - name: Install dependencies   run: gem install httparty nokogiri octokit  - name: Scrape posts and update README   run: ruby ./.github/scripts/update_posts.rb   env:    GITHUB_TOKEN: $    GITHUB_REPOSITORY: $This workflow is triggered on a schedule defined by the cron syntax, which specifies that it should run at 00:00 (midnight) every Sunday. Additionally, the workflow can be manually triggered using the workflow_dispatch event.The update_posts job consists of several steps:Checking out the repository using the actions/checkout@v2 action.Setting up Ruby using the ruby/setup-ruby@v1 action, with the specified Ruby version of 3.1.Installing the required Ruby gems (httparty, nokogiri, and octokit) using the gem install command.Running the script update_posts.rb located in the .github/scripts/ directory. The GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPOSITORY environment variables are provided to the script, allowing it to interact with the repository.With this workflow in place, your script will automatically run every week to scrape the blog posts and update the README file. GitHub Actions takes care of all the scheduling and execution, making the process seamless and efficient.Putting it all TogetherNowadays, your online presence is often the first point of contact for people looking to connect with you\u2014whether they\u2019re prospective employers, collaborators, or contributors to open source projects. Your GitHub profile, in particular, is a valuable platform for showcasing your skills, projects, and interests. So, how can you ensure that your GitHub profile remains up to date, relevant, and truly reflective of who you are?By harnessing the power of GitHub Actions, we\u2019ve demonstrated how you can transform your GitHub profile from a static Markdown document into a dynamic, ever-changing example of who you are. Through the example provided in this guide, you\u2019ve learned how to scrape data from a website and use it to dynamically update your GitHub profile. And while our example was implemented in Ruby, the same principles can be applied using JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or any other language of your choice.To recap, we walked through the process of creating a Ruby script that scrapes blog posts from a website, extracts relevant information, and updates the \u201cRecent Blog Posts\u201d section of your README.md file. Then, we used GitHub Actions to set up a workflow that runs the script on a regular schedule, ensuring that your profile remains current with your latest content.But our journey doesn\u2019t end here! The techniques and approaches shared in this guide can serve as a foundation for further exploration and creativity. Whether it\u2019s pulling in data from other sources, integrating with APIs, or experimenting with different content formats, the possibilities are endless.So go ahead and make your GitHub profile a vibrant and dynamic extension of yourself. Let it tell your story, highlight your achievements, and invite collaboration with others.\u2b50 Was this blog post helpful?

        "content": "The writer shares their experience learning about formal methods through master's degree courses and summarizes key concepts, including the use of mathematical techniques to verify software properties. They argue that while formal methods may have a reputation for being costly and not applicable to all software engineering processes, they are increasingly accessible and valuable, particularly in cases where software reliability is critical. The writer also discusses \"lightweight\" formal methods, such as Alloy and Forge, which take high-level specifications and validate properties. Finally, they provide an example of using Alloy to check the implementation of a file system.The article discusses a problem faced by the kernel when freeing a block that was previously in the file system. It explores questions such as how to determine if there is a ZFS snapshot that refers to a deleted file, or which files should be freed when a snapshot is deleted. The article uses Alloy as a tool to model the problem and shows how to encode the file system operations using predicates. The author also emphasizes the advantages of using Forge, which forces explicit enumeration of assumptions and ensures the constraints provided are respected. The article ends with questions posed to Forge to test if the predicates are satisfiable and valid.An article on 'The Tech Times' explores a new technology for detecting vacuity; the article discusses the use of Forge, a first-order logic solver, for detecting vacuity and ensuring that the implication isn't \"vacuously\" true; HN users point out that Forge is a useful tool for ensuring model upholds invariant; the article examines an example of a failed test and how to fix it; it goes on to explore how snapshots can be checked to determine if a file is referenced by an earlier snapshot before being deleted.Forge, a testing tool, checks every possible input for a given set of rules and produces counterexamples, using SAT and SMT solvers that translate abstract specifications to boolean constraints. Margrave Policy Analyzer, a model checker, analyzes access-control policies using similar techniques, including change impact analysis. In contrast, formal specification and theorem proving aim for rigorous verification, as exemplified by the seL4 microkernel, using proof assistants like Isabelle/HOL and Lean, which allow reasoning about logical proofs through dependent-typed programming languages. Lean, in particular, enables constructing proofs as code that generates values of specified types.The post discusses different approaches to proof assistants such as Lean and the benefits and disadvantages of using them. It compares the forward-style and tactical-style of proofs and explains how predicates are defined in Lean. The post highlights the importance of formal semantics in reasoning about source code and briefly explains big-step and small-step semantics. The author also mentions denotational semantics but admits to not feeling qualified to provide an explanation.The article discusses programming language semantics and the meaning of refinement in mathematics, related to software verification. The author shares their experience with proving the correctness of a subset of Scheme and creating a lexical analyzer and parser in Lean. They also mention the use of inductive data types and automation for printing atoms. The article showcases the author's knowledge and usage of Lean, a general-purpose programming language.The post introduces a type for language semantics errors in Lisp, and the author implements evaluation of procedures such as primitives and lambda forms. They also introduce the notion of \"state\" and \"frame\" and demonstrate how to update variables defined in previous \"frames\". The post concludes with a discussion about the limitations of implementing a full Scheme interpreter in Lean and introduces the notion of a maximum evaluation depth to ensure well-founded recursion.The article discusses the approach taken for program semantics in compiling expression to a 'statement' type and reasoning about big step semantics in Lean. The 'evaluation state structure' is used to reason if an evaluation is finite or not. The 'compile_stmt' function is defined for different arities to compile expressions, and 'is_lambda' and 'seq_from_list_stmt' functions are used to identify lambda and statement from lists. The post is technical and may not be suitable for general readership.This post contains program code and related proofs demonstrating the correctness of a factorial program using big-step semantics. The proof involves many obligations and is fairly involved, but serves as an example of leveraging mathematical tools in programming. The author uses a variety of lemmas and definitions to demonstrate correctness, including a proof of the factorial function and the use of casting in primitive operations. The post may be of interest to experts in programming or computer science.The article explains the concept of formal methods, which utilizes mathematical techniques to verify software correctness beyond testing. It provides an overview of verification techniques suited for high-level (Alloy and Forge) and low-level (Lean, Isabelle, and Coq) systems, focusing on analyzing software properties. The author shares their experience learning and using the tools for verifying and testing software, highlighting the challenges and benefits of adopting formal methods. The article concludes with a goal to continue learning about the topic to become a domain expert in the field.",

One particular commentator recommends Frama-C and SPARK for those looking to learn more about the topic, while others point out the usefulness of formal methods in determining \"what was expected\" and breaking down complex assertions into smaller units. Despite some hesitation from some about the amount of study required to fully utilize formal methods, others point out that one can quickly get started with TLA+ with just a three-day workshop.Apple uses formal methods to verify hardware, and is looking for people in this area. Formal methods have niche applications in safety-related software, but are not always considered worth the effort for most software. Formal methods may not be powerful enough to prove assertions about expectations and invariants, but they excel at design by contract. Writing a specification can help avoid errors from the start instead of encountering them one by one. Contract tests and data flow analysis are valuable for catching bugs that cross code/organization boundaries. Formal methods were developed for aerospace interoperation, but the era when the buyer had more clout than the seller has passed.Ten years ago, formal verification was just starting to be viable in semiconductor verification. Formal tools could find difficult test cases and prove assertions or test failures could not occur, but it couldn't read higher-level models of code. Some suggest using AI systems like ChatGPT to track system requirements and validate code against them. Some express poor results with current LLMs, and others suggest combining LLMs with AI and hardcoded knowledge. The use of mathematical notation in formal proofs is appropriate and efficient, and natural language expressions of proof would result in longer proofs and make it harder to identify patterns.The article discusses interactive theorem provers and how they differ from reading and writing source code, as stepping through lines of code is a given. The article also notes that democratizing tools is important in today's age, as making things obscure and less obvious leads to anti-intellectualism.

The best models are from the Flan family by Google but they perform slightly worse than GPT-3/4 which currently dominates the market. Google chose not to commercialize some of their research e.g. with GMail or Slides, which is seen by some as a missed opportunity. There are a number of other open source models available, with training and fine-tuning becoming cheaper and more efficient. The market for high quality AI models is not like the software marketplace, and developing an open source LLM requires a lot of resources. Some datasets for training models may contain copyrighted materials.Experts anticipate that large tech companies, such as Nvidia, will release initial \"base\" models for large language models (LLMs) in the near future, while other companies scratch their own itches and push the needle forward with their own customised LLMs. Companies may be inclined to publish base models as foundational enablers of the ecosystem, where the \"real\" value from a commercial standpoint is something like 5-10 layers up. OpenAI has stated that it does not use data submitted by customers via its API to train OpenAI models or improve OpenAI\u2019s service offering, however, this promise is not useful for some companies where the secrecy of trade secrets is their only protection. Machine learning models likely have zero intellectual property rights protections, unlike source code, due to their algorithmic process, and so a LLaMA release should not have a license issue after distilled.Various alternatives to OpenAI's GPT, like BERT, opt series, and GPT-J, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks more cheaply. A mention of GPT4all indicates that the team is working on training GPT-J as an open alternative to the Llama-based model.

Almost all grammar-of-graphics transforms such are handled on the GPU,  which allows for interpolated transitions with calculations  done in parallel.It also runs in completely static settings, so you can host a million-point scatterplot over something like Github Pages.# Examples* [1 million+ documents from arxiv.com](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/arxiv) rendered inside an Observable notebook.

There is also a dedicated [Deepscatter Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deepscatter/shared_invite/zt-17kbudjhj-zVzt26zddEpSyACe2E71Fw) which you are welcome to join.I came into doing this stuff from a very non-technical background and welcome people to join with naive questions.# Quick start## Importing the module.See the [arxiv example above](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/arxiv) to see some basic examples.## Running locally.First, install the companion tiling library, which is written in python, and generate a million points of test data in tiles of 50000 apiece.```shpython3 -V # requires Python 3.9.x or 3.10.xpython3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/bmschmidt/quadfeatherquadfeather-test-data 1_000_000quadfeather --files tmp.csv --tile_size 50_000 --destination tiles```Then setup this library to run. It will start a local dev server.```shnpm inpm run dev```If you go to `localhost:3344`, you should see an interactive scatterplot. To dig into what you're seeing, open `index.html`.(In 2021, this development site works in Chrome, not Safari or Firefox, because it uses ES6 module syntax inside the webworker. The distributed version of the module should work in all browsers.)## Your own data.1. Create a CSV, parquet, or feather file that has columns called 'x' and 'y'. (Or a feather file that has columns `x`, `y`). Any other columns (categorical information, etc.) can be included as additional columns.2. Tile it:```shcd deepscatter # if you're not already therequadfeather --files ../some-path-to/your-data.csv --tile_size 50000 --destination tiles```3. Assuming your dataset has an `x` and `y` column and the `tiles` folder is in the root directory of this project, you can see the data visualized by running```shnpm run dev```and opening `http://localhost:3345/index-simplest-way-to-start.html` in your browser.To edit the visualization, or to troubleshoot, look at the file `index-simplest-way-to-start.html`, where you should find a bare-bones implementation of deepscatter.Explore `index.html`, and render it at `http://localhost:3345/index.html`, for a more advanced example.Note: Ideally, in a future release you'll be able to create these specs in away that doesn't require coding JSON directly.## Build the module```shnpm run build```will create an ES module at `dist/deepscatter.es.js` The mechanics ofimporting this are very slightly different than `index.html`.Note that this is an ESM module and so requires you to use ```` See `index_prod.html` for an example This is currently bundled with vite and rollup. There is/will be a further interaction layer on top of it, but the core plotting components are separate and should work as a standalone layer that supports plot requests via an API. # Code strategy Any interaction logic that changes the API call directly does not belong in this library. The onlyinteraction code here is for zooming and interacting with points.## Future codebase splits.The plotting components and the tiling components are logically quite separate; I may breakthe tiling strategy into a separate JS library called 'quadfeather'.Apache Arrow would still be a necessary intermediate format, but it could be generated from CSV filesusing, say, `arquero` or a WASM port of `DuckDB`.# APIThis is still subject to change and is not fully documented. The encoding portion of the API mimics Vega-Lite with some minor distinctions to avoid deeply-nested queries and to add animation and jitter parameters.```js{  encoding: {   \"x\": {     \"field\": \"x\",     \"transform\": \"literal\"   },   \"color\": {     \"field\": \"year\",     \"range\": \"viridis\",     \"domain\": [1970, 2020]  }}```## Implemented aesthetics.1. x2. y3. size4. jitter_radius: size of jitter. API subject to change.5. jitter_speed: speed of jitter. API subject to change.6. color (categorical or linear: range can call color scales explicitly, or accepting any d3-color name.)7. `x0` (for animations; transitions between x0 and x)8. `y0` (for animations; transitions between y0 and y)9. `filter`. (Filtering is treated as an aesthetic operation by this library.)## Planned1. Symbol (Mapping of categorical variables to single unicode points in a single font; probably 255 max.)2. Label (Full-text label)3. Image (Like PixPlot)## JitterJitter is a little overloaded with features right now, but some are quite fun.jitter method is set on 'method' key of the 'jitter_radius' field. Possible values are:1. `circle`2. `spiral`3. `time`4. `normal`# Principles1. This is a 2d library. No fake 3d.2. The central zoom state is handled by d3-zoom.3. That zoom state can be used to render to webgl. Don't know webgl? You  should be able to use the zoom state to draw to canvas or svg layers using the  same zoom and underlying data, so that you can draw point with webgl  and then build a callout using d3-annotate.",

It's simply too noisy.The way to do it is to reduce the graph to some 300d or 500d embeddings, then use TSNE/UMAP/PACMAP to reduce that to 3d. Then visualize.My prefered way is to use some first order embedding method like GGVec in this library [1] (disclaimer I wrote it). Node2Vec and ProNE don't yield great embeddings for visualization (the first is too filamented, the second too close to the unit ball).Another great library to do this work is GRAPE [2]. Try first-order embedding methods, or short walks on second order methods to avoid the embeddings being too filamented by long random walk sampling.[1] https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors[2] https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/ reply  larsrc 12 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] Thanks! reply  lordwarnut 3 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I don't suppose you have a link to that game?

        "hn_summary": "Nomic AI's zoomable, animated scatterplots scale more than one billion points in the browser via webGPU, and GitHub issues are welcomed; however, the background map may not always be accurate, and Highcharts has a similar module but with fewer points. Nomic AI also released gpt4all, and libraries like GRAPE and nodevectors could yield better results for embeddings at scale. Visualization fans may be interested in Galapix, Pix-image-viewer, and GGVec, but rendering issues may arise with mobile devices."
