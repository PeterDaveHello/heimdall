Some comments point out hidden features in the animation that reference Russian pop culture. The animation has a nostalgic and dreamlike quality, inspiring wonder and intrigue among readers.\"The Floor 796 project\" is a free-to-view online movie consisting of a zoomable and continuous environment, consisting of all sorts of references, from US/Western/Japanese pop culture to Russia-specific ones. It is an ongoing creative project consisting of hand animation from a single person via an online editor, with frequent updates and a searchable changelog. Some viewers may appreciate the pop culture references and the changes in available technologies over time, while others may not understand them all. The project seems to have no particular monetization goal, and it appears mainly to be a fun, indie project.An \"ever expanding\" project periodically updated with manually added tiles is being discussed as a work of art on Hacker News. Comments admire the intuitive, vanilla JS code of the project, its use of jsdoc instead of Typescript, and its organization. Some users criticize the project's clickbait title, arguing that the project's tiles and limited panning do not qualify for the title's promise. Others appreciate the project's aesthetic appeal and suggest that an AI painter could co-create a similar project. Some enjoy the inclusion of pop culture characters in the artwork.",

        "content": "Spaced repetition is an effective cognitive hack that can help remember anything by drilling flashcards with review intervals that grow longer when recalled correctly, and shorter when not. However, spaced repetition has two main limiting factors: forming habits and writing effective flashcards. Experts recommend understanding concepts before committing it to memory, writing short and atomic flashcards, asking questions in multiple directions & adding contextual ones to link ideas. Users can visualize the concepts like a graph and organize flashcards by source, not topic. Regular review of flashcards is crucial by making the process enjoyable to maintain the habit.Learning hierarchies and sequences can aid in retaining information, focused on hierarchically breaking down concepts into subclasses and superclasses, and sequences into individual elements, positions, and order. Flashcards must be atomic and not too large. Example cases cover geology, neural cells, and vector spaces. The primary goal is to retain concrete knowledge using top-down and bottom-up questioning styles, generating two-way flashcards that build a knowledge graph. The article emphasizes breaking down information and identifying hierarchies while retaining focus on the most important points for knowledgeable readership.The post discusses various concepts such as vector spaces, logical consequence, and geologic time scale. It provides definitions, axioms, and examples to help the reader understand the material. The flashcard format is used to aid retention of information. The article uses neutral language and avoids political or religious statements, while focusing on what makes the post interesting and new. Some flashcards go from the concept to the definition, while others go from the definition to the concept. The reader is encouraged to engage with the material by answering questions that test their understanding.This article provides a guide for memorization techniques using flashcards and scripts. The content includes definitions of chemical isomers, months of the year, and powers of two. The article also discusses the use of automation in generating flashcards and scripts for learning sequences and poetry. The reader is encouraged to use software such as Anki or Mochi for effective memorization, while avoiding potentially biased political or religious content.Anki's note types make generating multiple cards from structured information possible. Mochi lacks this feature but can accomplish the same goal with cloze deletions. The most cited resource on flashcards is Wo\u017aniak's 1999 article, Effective Learning. Wo\u017aniak suggested understanding before memorizing, keeping cards atomic, avoiding long sequences and big unordered sets, and using simple wording and redundancy. The author hopes readers find these rules and examples useful while learning from textbooks.",

        "hn_content": "The Hacker News post discusses effective spaced repetition and how to use tools like Anki for long-term learning. An HN user mentions other software that have succeeded in spaced repetition with a better UI than Anki, such as Duolingo and Chessable. However, some users criticize Duolingo for being too focused on language mimicry instead of complete language learning. Several HN users suggest other software that is more useful for serious language learners, such as Clozemaster and Lingvist. Some users also mention LogSeq as a great tool for creating spaced repetition flashcards, and the founder of Execute Program highlights his company's knowledge graph and SRS tool for programming languages.  Overall, the comments provide helpful insights and alternatives to Anki.Users on Hacker News discuss effective ways to manage Anki flashcards without getting overwhelmed by backlogs, especially when dealing with ADHD.\nSome suggest ignoring the backlog, while others recommend starting small with a few flashcards to regularly review.\nOne user is working on a new spaced repetition algorithm that will allow for more flexible review times.\nThe Leitner system is also recommended, although some users argue that Anki can track each card individually.\nOverall, users stress the effectiveness of spaced repetition in memorization, but emphasize the need for consistency in reviewing cards.Users on Hacker News discuss strategies for optimizing flashcard review sessions, including limiting the number of cards per session, using mnemonics, and finding a balance between review and new learning. Anecdotes suggest that spaced repetition is effective for language learning but may fare worse for fields requiring conceptual understanding. One user suggests trying spaced free recall, wherein one writes down everything they can remember about a topic before checking the actual material. Flashcards may also be useful for preparing for coding interview questions.A Hacker News users suggests drawing key points instead of using text cards for learning materials, while other users share tips and tools for using spaced repetition and flashcards to acquire and retain knowledge, for math and language learning, and even interview prep; although spaced repetition is effective, it requires discipline. Users also discuss the effectiveness of cartoons versus traditional classrooms for learning computer graphics, as well as using GPT-4 and the \"20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning\" for flashcard creation. An HN user wonders if there is a solution for combining atomic flashcards and context-based language learning, while another suggests \"Clozemaster\". Lastly, a user asks if there are pre-made decks to use for spaced repetition.A Hacker News user shares their specific process for interview prep using Anki cards to remember important elements of solved and unsolved questions; readers can access the template. Additionally, other users discuss using spaced repetition for research or studying, and Anki app features and settings. Finally, a user details their development of a code-specific flashcard program.Spaced repetition is an effective way to learn and retain large amounts of information, but it takes time and discipline to master. Some users on HN have devised their own methods of spaced repetition, like creating flashcards from a textbook, but the most popular app is Anki. Users should take care to create their own flashcards, rather than using pre-made decks, as the active process of creating them helps encode memories better. Some authors and experts have also explored the potential of spaced repetition for learning history or psychology. While there are still great possibilities for improving the UX for spaced repetition, there are apps and tools available that can help users structure their learning more effectively.An HN user shares their experience using a pre-made deck for Chinese vocabulary and seeing clear and steady progress despite a lower success rate compared to those who make their own decks. Another user argues that the advice to create atomic cards may not be applicable to all knowledge domains. HN users share their approaches to making flashcards and using spaced repetition to study for various exams. HN users also discuss the decision-making process of what information to memorize versus store in a digital knowledge base for easy retrieval. Gwern's monograph on spaced repetition addresses the challenge of deciding what to add to one's deck.An Anki user's statistics justify Wo\u017aniak's rule, of memorizing any subject that takes more than five minutes to look up, as five minutes is the line that separates trivia from useful data. Spaced repetition is an effective technique for memorizing fields, but it requires distilling the information into flashcards, which can be a skill to learn. On this topic, papers show the support for spaced repetition with hundreds of papers, making it a long-standing technique. While some users had successes with Anki-generated cards, the general advice is to create the flashcards yourself. However, playing scales rather than note memorization is a better way to learn guitar efficiently.Anki, a popular flashcard software, is being discussed by users on Hacker News in regards to creating custom decks versus using pre-made ones. While pre-made decks are preferred for topics such as language learning and reference material, creating your own decks can be more beneficial for abstract or complex subjects. Med school students also use Anki, often utilizing high-quality shared decks. The software utilizes spaced repetition for learning, but it requires commitment and can be frustrating for some users. Studies have shown no significant difference in effectiveness between pre-made and custom decks.HN users discuss using GPT for generating Anki cards from learning sources, such as prose or business phrases, to aid in effective learning. TheRealPomax suggests using non-serif font for better readability, particularly for those with dyslexia, and stresses the importance of font size and spacing. Some users question the efficacy of serif fonts and inquire about the research behind the readability claim. Overall, the discussion focuses on practical tips for optimizing the Anki card learning experience, including summarizing prose into bullet points and verifying concise flashcards.",

But for recycling startup Ascend Elements, other people\u2019s garbage is basically a\u00a0gold mine, if not better.The Massachusetts-based company opened a\u00a0recycling plant in Covington, Georgia in late March that it says is the largest electric-vehicle battery recycling facility in North America. It can process 30,000 metric tons of input each year, breaking down old batteries and prepping the most valuable materials inside to be processed and turned into new batteries.That capacity equates to breaking down the battery packs from 70,000 electric vehicles annually, said Ascend CEO Mike O\u2019Kronley.Subscribe to receive Canary's latest newsThis is an early example of a\u00a0nationwide movement to cost-effectively recycle and repurpose EV batteries as more and more drivers go electric. In previous decades, companies hadn\u2019t invested much in lithium-ion recycling, but investment soared in the last few years to match the spiking demand for battery materials.Recycling can deliver new battery materials without the expense and environmental impact of new mining. It is extremely hard to develop new mines in the U.S., but the federal government is lavishing funds on new battery recycling plants. The revamped EV tax credits also call for increasing shares of domestically sourced batteries and battery materials.Those market and policy shifts made recycling sufficiently desirable that Ascend is paying other companies for their old batteries. At the moment, those deals are mostly with EV or battery makers that have high volumes to get rid\u00a0of.\u201cPaying for these spent batteries keeps them from going into the landfill,\u201d O\u2019Kronley told Canary Media. \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s better to get paid for it rather than throw them\u00a0away.\u201dAscend also accepts used consumer electronics from battery-collection programs, such as Call2Recycle.That\u2019s not to say there are enough old batteries coming in to fill the factory. Currently, 80 to 90 percent of what\u2019s going into Ascend\u2019s Covington facility is scrap materials from battery factories, including SK Battery America\u2019s plant in Commerce, Georgia.Get Caught UpHere\u2019s video proof that solar panels can be recycledJulian SpectorThat relationship influenced Ascend\u2019s choice of location: Covington sits in the emerging \u200b\u201cBattery Belt,\u201d a\u00a0swath of new battery factories and electric-vehicle plants opening up across the Midwest and the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky (look for all the blue icons in this White House map of new industrial investments). Fellow battery-recycling startup Redwood Materials also chose South Carolina for a\u00a0forthcoming $3.5 billion recycling facility.\u201cThere will need to be a\u00a0recycling plant within about an hour\u2019s drive of every single one of those [new battery gigafactories],\u201d O\u2019Kronley said. \u200b\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be [long-distance] shipping these very large, heavy EV batteries that are classified as Class 9\u00a0hazardous materials.\u201dAs it stands, the nearby battery factories send their scrap down the road to Ascend for what\u2019s called \u200b\u201cpre-processing.\u201d The scrap and used batteries go through mechanical shredding and sieving, which produces \u200b\u201cblack mass.\u201d Ascend extracts lithium carbonate from the mass; the remaining mass contains materials such as graphite, nickel, cobalt and manganese.Currently, Ascend sells most of these substances to the market; it also converts some black mass into cathode precursor and cathode active materials at its Massachusetts R&D center. But the company is building a\u00a0second commercial-scale facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky that will take the outputs from Covington and convert them into cathode precursor and cathode active material so that they\u2019re ready to go into new battery manufacturing. That $1 billion plant received $480 million in grant funding from the Department of Energy as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2019s investment in domestic supply for critical materials.The Covington plant operates similarly to existing battery recycling plants; the Kentucky location will introduce a\u00a0brand-new technique for efficiently extracting cathode materials from black mass, which Ascend has dubbed \u200b\u201chydro to cathode.\u201d\u201cThose two facilities represent the investment that we are making in key infrastructure to recover these batteries, retain these critical elements in the United States and return them into the supply,\u201d O\u2019Kronley said.But that\u2019s just the start, because the surging popularity of EVs will produce far more worn-out batteries than the country\u2019s recyclers can process. Ascend is already out raising money to build more plants, according to O\u2019Kronley.Other emerging recycling startups are at it too. Redwood Materials, founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, won a $2 billion loan from the DOE for a\u00a0Nevada plant to make new batteries from recycled materials. Canada-based Li-Cycle received a $375 million DOE loan for its own facility to process lithium carbonate from a\u00a0network of recycling plants. Canary Media recently profiled Cirba Solutions\u2019 efforts to expand a\u00a0battery-recycling plant in Ohio.All of these facilities tie into the Biden administration\u2019s goal to make the U.S. more capable of supplying itself with the batteries that will be pivotal to electrifying transportation and decarbonizing the\u00a0grid.Recycling renewablesBatteries Julian Spectoris senior reporter at Canary Media.Hide Commentsread nextSolarA huge community solar order is latest in US clean manufacturing boomEric Wesoff \u00a0.\u00a010 April 2023Marine transportVideo: Canary talks ammonia-powered ships on the Weather ChannelMaria Gallucci \u00a0.\u00a010 April 2023Corporate procurementCompanies need a faster way to buy clean energy.

I want to share how I fixed my car in case it helps you fix a similar problem.Short version: I manually disconnected the key fob computer system to stop the battery from draining.Finding the Parasitic DrainMy car battery would drain itself in a matter of hours or days starting in January 2022 until I fixed the issue in March 2023. This kind of unchecked battery drain\u2014where your car does not have enough power to start itself after its parked for a short time\u2014is sometimes called a parasitic drain.To diagnose the drain, I parked and locked my car. Then, I measured voltages across some of the exposed fuses in my car. The idea is to find components in the car that are drawing power when the car is off. A few fuses showed constant power consumption including the TCM Transaxle control system fuse:Using a lookup table for my brand of fuses, I converted the 0.9mV voltage on TCM into a current draw. My car drew significant current over four fuses even when it was off:FuseDescriptionCompartmentCurrentTCM15A - Transaxle control systemengine0.9mV -> 197mAENG+B10A - Engine Control Systemengine0.2mV -> 27mAROOM15A - Overhead lightsengine0.4mV -> 87mAESCL15A - [Electric Steering Wheel Lock]interior left0.4mV -> 87mAAccording to one mechanic who worked on my car, the total draw on my 2013 Mazda3 should be 50mA or less when the car is parked and locked. So, the 197mA to the transmission computer (TCM) was especially troubling. Why would the transmission computer remain on when the car was parked and locked, anyways?When my car first started dying in Februrary 2022, the key fobs started malfunctioning. Sometimes when I tried to use a fob, the car would sound warning chirps for ~10 seconds. Paranoid the key fobs were causing the drain, I hadn\u2019t used the fobs since the car first died. I had removed the batteries from the fobs, and only used my metal backup key.Now over a year later, I guessed that the keyless system was still malfunctioning even though I wasn\u2019t using the fobs. Perhaps, the car thought a key fob was present in the car, and it was keeping systems like its transmission computer (TCM) switched on endlessly by mistake.The FixOne of the keyless troubleshooting sections in the workshop manual mentioned the ENG+B, ROOM, and ESCL fuses could be related to keyless system malfunctions. Since I\u2019d also seen power going over thoses fuses, it seemed plausible that the keyless system was still acting up.I was already only using my metal key and not the fobs, so I had nothing to lose. I opened up the dash behind the glove compartment to see if I could disable the key fob system directly. After disconnecting my car\u2019s negative battery cable, I unplugged wiring harness 4 from the keyless control module:Wiring harness 4 is almost exclusively communications lines to the different radio antennas and switches that comprise the keyless system.After unplugging wiring harness 4, the instrument cluster now showed a red warning light that keyless system was malfunctioning (what I wanted):When I drive the car, I see the red keyless system warning light. However, when I park the car and lock it, the TCM fuse (and the others) go to sleep and stop drawing power over the course of several minutes. My car no longer dies after a day or two of sitting. Success!FAQWhy did you almost lose your mind?I suspect the drain was intermittent: sometimes the car would go to sleep properly, and sometimes it wouldn\u2019t. Intermittency made the problem hard to diagnose.Also, two real mechanics told me my car didn\u2019t have a parasitic draw.What did the real mechanics say?Different mechanics told me different stories:Dealer: said my car was fine and returned it to me. My car died the next morning.Second mechanic: said my battery was degraded, and low voltages from the battery were freaking out the keyless sytem.  Indeed, the car lasted 12 months problem free on a new battery before it started dying again.(I still was only using my metal backup key, and had removed the batteries from the fobs.)A second new battery did not fix the issue when the problem resurfaced after the 12 months.Why did it take so long to fix?I think it was because the problem was intermittent. See the full timeline at the end of this post.Is your car still safe to drive?As far as I can tell, yes. The #4 cable I disconnected only makes connections to the keyless system, and the only warning light is a red one indicating the keyless system isn\u2019t working (expected). All other systems seem to be operating normally. You should probably consult an actual mechanic if you\u2019re considering this change, though.If the parasitic draw is intermittent, how do you know you fixed it?All the evidence I have points to the keyless system: key fobs malfunctioning, measuring the draws on the same fuses in both Feb 2022 and Mar 2023, and the implication of some of the related fuses from the workshop manual that mentioned the ENG+B, ROOM, and ESCL fuses. My car also hasn\u2019t died again yet.What mistakes did you make troubleshooting the draw?Too many to count. Most important is to make sure your car is locked with the doors closed before you run any experiemnts to look for parasitic draws. Cars can take a while to go to sleep.Did you use a diagnostic code reader to look for errors logged by the car?No, I probably should have. Sometimes I wanted to pretend the problem didn\u2019t exist more than I wanted to fix it.Could you have disabled the keyless module in software?It looks like it\u2019s possible to \u201cdisable\u201d the keyless module in software. It\u2019s possible this would have resolved the issue as well, but I don\u2019t know. Since I don\u2019t have Mazda\u2019s proprieratry M-MDS diagnostic tool, I couldn\u2019t disable the keyless module in software myself.How did you download the Mazda3 2013 workshop manual?I used this site for the workshop manual.What other parasitic drain posts did you read?I read lots of forum threads about parasitic drains. One common theme was faulty bluetooth modules:Post about the bluetooth module causing a drain.\u201cPuzzling battery drain\u201d - with another mention of bluetooth.There is also some discussion of parasitic draws in the comments section of the hackernews post for this blog entry.How did you remove the glove compartment to access the keyless control module?Even though it\u2019s about replacing a blower motor, the beginning of this video is a good guide for getting into the dash.Did you have help?Yes, a lot.

        "content": "An investigation reveals that HP had acquired Phoenix Hyperspace and replaced their existing QuickWeb with it, without any fanfare or announcement, turning a fast-boot Linux into a web browser, Skype, email client, and widgets. Certain models also have an additional separate button for launching a standalone EFI application called QuickLook, which is an email and calendar app that runs inside the system's BIOS and does not touch the Outlook data file or need Windows.An HP document holds instructions on how to build the HP_TOOLS partition manually and populate it with necessary files, but there is no claim that it must be installed using the official installer. The installation of QuickLook from HP on Linux is plausible by making a partition and copying over the files. Although UEFI is not a great operating system, HP developers were able to create HP DayStarter that displays Outlook calendar information and custom messages as Windows loads on supported notebook models with supported operating systems. Daystarter, which is an abuse of a hardware feature not intended for this, is loaded by HP's EFI and traps a certain interrupt or IO access to force itself onto the VGA framebuffer, and it runs from System Management Mode.Dell and motherboard vendors maintain standardized components, making it impossible for Dell to sell a machine with a unique feature. Customers often had bad opinions based on nothing with motherboard manufacturers. To improve their computer, HP designed standalone EFI applications with a focus on improving the pre-boot experience for executives that used only Microsoft Outlook. HP's decision to create a separate OS was unnecessary, given the existence of SSDs and the functionality of sleep and hibernate. The company was out of ideas and made questionable decisions such as injecting code into the thermal management layer for a 15-second speed boost. UEFI offers immense possibilities to companies even for dubious applications that malware authors take advantage of.A user on Hacker News discusses the usage of efibootmgr command under Linux for accessing a shell, and notes the importance of making it seamless and fault-resistant for tech support. Other comments diverge from this topic, discussing the need for more diagnostic features on motherboard hardware and the competitive landscape of laptop/PC manufacturers. One user suggests creating a standardized digital protocol for motherboard diagnostic information, similar to the system used in cars. Overall, there is a discussion on how hardware companies can differentiate themselves and improve user experience.An expert journalist at 'The Tech Times' must provide a concise summary of a post featuring comments about dysfunctions and bizarre issues related to tech hardware, including the over-engineering concerns of some users, Gigabyte's gun-shaped heatsinks, and a competent DOOM port to a standalone .efi file. The article highlights various issues with HP's products, such as strange power backflow and the QuickWeb/Look application's security vulnerability. Some users are furious about the idea of replacing a productivity app with a video game, while others are eager to brute-force the 2010 HP EFI signing key. The article also mentions how most pre-bundled software associated with such hardware is terrible and a waste of RAM, and no attempt has been made to develop better ones.",

        "content": "We Need To Talk About Vercel - Max CountrymanMenuAboutArticlesUsesWe Need To Talk About VercelApril 9, 2023Recently there's been some discussion around Vercel and its hefty markup over AWS Lambda or its surprise runaway costs.1 That said, there's an argument to be made that the development experience value add is worth the pretty penny. And indeed for some, that may be the case.However, as I've spent more time working with the Vercel Content Delivery Network (CDN) product, I've encountered technical deficiencies which have been met with a customer support response that not only leaves me skeptical of the proffered value add, but has left me to question the product altogether.Some BackgroundI've been working on remotejobs.org, which is largely static but updates periodically throughout the day. I'll spare readers the technical details here but what's important is to understand that this is implemented via Astro's Server-Side Rendering and is intended to be cached by the CDN.To do so, we make use of the s-maxage and stale-while-revalidate directives of the Cache-Control header. The goal here is to have the surrogate, i.e. the CDN network appliance, cache the content for a set amount of time and then to lean on the stale-while-revalidate directive to serve cached content while fresh data is fetched in the background.As of writing the Vercel docs give this description of stale-while-revalidate:This allows you to serve content from the Edge cache while simultaneously updating the cache in the background with the response from your Serverless Function.Offering some relevant use-cases and overlap with what we want:Some situations where stale-while-revalidate is of great value:Your content changes frequently but it takes a significant amount of time to regenerate. For example, an expensive database query or upstream API request.Your content changes infrequently but you want to have the flexibility to update it (to fix a typo, for example) and don't wait for the cache to expire.Fortunately Vercel makes configuring such a header easy via the vercel.json configuration:{  \"headers\": [    {      \"source\": \"/(.*)\",      \"headers\": [        {          \"key\": \"Cache-Control\",          \"value\": \"public, max-age=0, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=3900\"        }      ]    }  ]}Mission accomplished.Not So Easy After AllOnly it doesn't work the way it's advertised.Bizarrely, Vercel's network appliance mangles the Cache-Control header and indeed does not respect the configured values as it should.2 For some resources, things work as expected, but for e.g. our index page the s-maxage and stale-while-revalidate directives are both missing.In fact, only resources like JavaScript and CSS see the correct header value with everything else being configured such that Cache-Control has a value of public, max-age=0. Not what we wanted or configured.Looking for SupportAfter messing around with this for some time, ensuring we were manually setting the headers on our origin, I had no luck and reached out to Vercel's support.Over the course of a couple of weeks I was told by their support team:This is not a real issue, try these various configuration tweaks (none worked and they would later admit they could easily reproduce the issue independently).This is a real issue, but it's Astro's fault (it wasn't, as the Astro team would trivially demonstrate) and I should do free work for Vercel to poll their community regarding how widespread the issue is.Vercel's support staff is only trained to handle frontend issues, therefore I can't expect helpful responses (Vercel sells a CDN product, so this is surprising).3The internal team is working on an RFC to make documentation changes (odd, but okay; the issue still remains).I would receive an update within one week (now a month later, I have had no update whatsoever and the issue persists).I was also told that because I haven't graduated to a high-enough service tier, my issue wasn't important. I find this a strange response, because other customers, who might be paying lots of money to use Vercel's product, would benefit from the CDN operating as it's advertised.On March 9th, 2023, Vercel's support team promised to follow up \"next week\". They have not done so and the issue remains an issue.\"Please keep an eye out for a message from our team next week.\"Where We Go from HereCDNs are hard. There's no doubt a lot going on in the background here that we can't see. For instance, later on in the support thread, Vercel's support said this:\"After catching up with our CDN team, it's worth sharing that we'll be reviewing docs on s-maxage/stale-while-revalidate/stale-while-error and how they are consumed by our proxy. Slight overshare but there's an active RFC internally to review this behaviour in its entirety.\"While this is a somewhat odd response, it demonstrates that Vercel is aware of these problems and that they can be difficult to tackle.4However, for me the bigger issue is how Vercel's frontline support team responds and behaves. I was repeatedly told my issue wasn't real, a fairly blatant attempt to gaslight me, and then when it had been confirmed multiple times that I should just go away already.Now I'm clearly not worth enough for Vercel to care about. Fair enough. They're right that I won't independently bring them large bags of money in the form of recurring revenue. But being so blunt about that seems shortsighted at best: Should I ever be in the position to bring more business to Vercel, I now won't.Contrast this approach with Cloudflare or AWS: Even as a free or essentially free customer, both platforms invest in their customers because it's part of a larger customer acquisition strategy.Good support is not just a resource to fallback to.Take AWS as an example, which has for years invested heavily in customer success. AWS offers a wide array of resources, including dedicated support teams, structured programs, and ongoing training. Without such things in place, AWS wouldn't just be more difficult to use, but would also likely have a far less commanding hold of the cloud market. While Vercel may not be at AWS scale, even in the beginning Amazon has had a reputation for being \"customer obsessed\".Given where Vercel is today, I'll be moving on. Most of remotejobs.org is already hosted on a VPS and so in my case I'll move the web pieces there with a CDN like Cloudflare in front of it.AddendumI reached out for comment before publishing this piece, but Vercel did not provide one. However, there's since been active discussion on Hacker News with Vercel's CEO, Guillermo Raunch, explaining that this behavior is in place to protect users:\"Vercel strips them because (1) at the time this RFC didn't exist and (2) most of the time you we found customers don't want to cache on the browser side or proxying CDNs, which makes purging and reasoning about cache staleness very difficult.\"[...]'Customers want to deploy and see their changes instantly. They want to their customers \"go to our blog to see the news\" and not have to second guess or fear the latest content will be there.'FootnotesNote that the latter was due how the deployment process was structured, however billing limits or quotas would have prevented such a thing from happening in the first place; such misconfigurations can and do happen and shouldn't bankrupt a small business. \u21a9I spent some time trying various things, ordering the directives differently, duplicating them, etc. Some combinations produce different results, but none I could find consistently set the correct header value. \u21a9To clarify, this was directed at a specific support team member, who I won't name; presumably other support team members have different backgrounds and may be better equipped to field these issues. However, that's in fact the issue: if you sell a CDN product, it's important your staff is trained in supporting it. \u21a9It could make some sense to update the docs in the meantime at least. \u21a9A Newsletter to Share My KnowledgeI built this site to share everything I know about leadership, building startups, and indie hacking.

        "content": "Videos obtained by WIRED reveal recent incidents where autonomous vehicles operating in San Francisco are causing confusion, anxiety, and delays to public transit vehicles and their passengers. Bus and train surveillance videos depict a litany of incidents ranging from autonomous vehicles stranding themselves between parked cars to entering hazardous terrain, making unplanned stops, and blocking routes. Would-be autonomous taxi providers say they learn from every incident and have logged millions of self-driven miles, but the situation is subject to approval from regulators, who have been urged by transportation officials to restrict autonomous testing until safety concerns have been addressed.San Francisco's autonomous vehicles are causing issues for public transportation, with drivers being held responsible for any decision they make that leads to a collision, even if the autonomous vehicle caused the problem. The lack of understanding of public transportation seems to be a key issue for some driverless vehicles, causing delays and increasing stress. Transit advocates are proposing measures, including fines for autonomous vehicles causing delays and creating more transit-only lanes. Urban planners hope the autonomous industry will set performance goals so public opinion will be in their favor.The rise of chatbots is set to create a tidal wave of bots, with Google set to launch their own chatbot, Bard, in the coming weeks. The impact of chatbots on society is far-reaching, from AI disruption of white-collar jobs to the potential of AI chatbots in education. The Fraud-Detection Industry also faces complexities in ensuring the accuracy of its systems. India's Pay-to-Breathe Industry highlights the inequality of expensive air purifiers as a response to failed solutions to pollution. WIRED offers insight into how technology is transforming every aspect of our lives.",

Between 50 and 400 people began dancing fervently for weeks, which attracted the attention of the authorities. Historical documents suggest the victims danced, but the cause behind the outbreak remains unknown. Contemporaneous explanations included demonic possession and overheated blood. There is controversy over whether the plague ultimately killed around fifteen people per day, but sources from the time did not mention the number of deaths. Some believe the dancing could have been brought on by food poisoning caused by the toxic and psychoactive chemicals of ergot fungi, whereas others suggest it was an example of fully developed cases of psychogenic movement disorder happening in mass hysteria caused by psychological stress. The Dancing Plague has been labeled in assorted ways, and it has served as inspiration for artistic productions.N/A - This text is not related to tech news and does not require a summary.",

The existing sample code is deemed to be beyond bad, and inefficient examples were found from different sources that the author wants to correct. The limits of the controller meant that DMA had to be used for reducing CPU involvement, which necessitated a complex mirror state machine approach.The Tech Times shares a detailed guide on how to create different modes on a monochrome display without involving the CPU. The article mentions the challenges involved while directing reader's attention to the critical aspects of setting up a Direct Memory Access (DMA) chain. It explains how to create 1bpp, 2bpp, 4bpp and 8bpp indexed colour modes, with the last one being the most complicated as it requires a colour lookup table (CLUT) to live in RAM. The author warns against DMA chaining woes and briefly mentions the uselessness of the nPENIRQ output from the touch controller.A touch display is described but has two obstacles for use, noise and proper timing. SD card access is also an issue, and wiring it to different pins is recommended. Clock speeds must be set correctly to prevent data being sent too quickly. The setup can be lazy, utilizing GPIO until the machinery is ready. The API provided includes methods for setting the depth, colour table entries, and turning the display on and off.

This is just a small thought experiment for a different ranking algorithm for HN. There's nothing wrong with the current one, but it's just a small thought experiment.Just to refresh, according to Paul Graham's comment and FAQ, the HN algorithm is...\\(rank = {\\frac {P - 1}{(T + 2)^G}}\\)P = Points T = Age in hoursG = 1.8Minus one removes the user's own upvote. By default, HN upvotes its own user submission.I\u2019ve seen one with penalties but let\u2019s stick to what\u2019s official. Also, I just did a quick Grep search and found this article and wonderful repo about \u201cReverse Engineering the Hacker News Ranking Algorithm\u201cIntuitively, the ranking algorithm is simple: the more upvotes a link receives in a short amount of time, the higher it will be ranked at the top. As time passes, the post will gradually move down the rankings.Here is my approachI can't find the official page on why Paul Graham created HN, but to me, HN is the place to find the most interesting links and have a healthy discussion about various topics. In fact, discussions are my favorite part, except for the useless comments.Given that discussions are my favorite part, why don't we apply PageRank for every user based on the upvotes they receive for the comments they leave on any post, and replace the P (points) value in the current version of the HN algorithm?PageRank is an algorithm created by the founders of Google. It is used to determine the popularity of web pages on the internet.By the way, the name PageRank did not suit this use case. I am going to call it HackerRank (HR). Here is a visualization if you are trying to picture it.Since it's likely that one user may upvote multiple comments from the same user, we check whether a user has already upvoted a comment from that specific user before considering their upvote. In other words, we treat user profiles as nodes and upvotes for comments as edges.Considering this, a HackerRank user profile will look like this:\\(HR_{i}={\\frac {1-D}{N}}+D\\,\\sum _{{j\\in \\{1,\\dots ,n\\}}}{\\frac {HR_{j}}{TU_{j}}}\\)N = Total number of user profiles on HND = Damping factorHR = HackerRank score for the user who upvotedTU = Total upvotes givenBy default, the HR for every profile will be 1/N.But I won't consider HackerRank as it is. Sometimes, HN comments are inappropriate, and they will be flagged. We should consider the flagging because, remember, HN should be a place to have healthy discussions. Let's consider that 1 flag equals a deduction of 20% from the HR score. However, we will only take into account the flags received in the current month, as people can change from being unpleasant to becoming better human beings.So, HR with \u201cflag\u201d consideration will look like this.\\(HR_{with flag} = HR - ((TF * FP) * HR)\\)\\(HR = max(0, \\space HR_{withflag})\\)TF = Total flags received in the current monthFP = Flag penalty which is 20%If HR is negative, then it will be 0.We now have HR for every user profile, so the final ranking algorithm will look like this by hooking HR into the current version of the HN algorithm.\\(rank_{i} = {\\frac {\\sum_{{j\\in \\{1,\\dots ,n\\}}} (HR_{j})}{(T + 2)^G}}\\)HR = HR value represents the HackerRank score of the profile that upvoted this postT = Age in hoursG = 1.8 This is a very simple approach, but here are some other ideas that are worth exploring.HackerRank score, which is also determined by the upvotes a user receives for their submissions.Reading time for the article.Track how well a website is performing on HN and put it on the front page if the website has a high reputation for performing well.Will I ever publicly write about how HN ranks posts if I am Dang (HN moderator)? No, because Pagerank can be manipulated by people despite its reputation. In fact, Pagerank is being exploited for years. Moreover, there are financial incentives for companies to get on the first page in HN.I would use HackerRank for ranking posts but publicly say that we are using original PaulGraham\u2019s algorithm for ranking posts, and hide the upvotes for comments since it is powering HackerRank, also take some additional steps to avoid reverse engineering and rank manipulation.But, I am curious. How would you have done it? If you were designing the HN algorithm, please leave your thoughts in the comments. I am curious to know.Discussion on HN \u2192 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35510413Plug: Hey, we are building a new kind of search engine.

Whether you are new user or old user, news is news and news trend based on votes. But your suggested algorithm (that requires 100 cpu and 128 gb ram btw but I digress) is very allowing the power to concentrate in a very few hands irrespective of the news value they submit. it very much incentivizing to create bots and voting rings and spam the site to harvest as much as votes as possible like stackoverflow.Expand full commentReply1 reply by VigneshwararJason15 hr agoGreat write up, but substack is messing up the formulas displayed after clicks.

        "content": "Jakob, a master's student, shares his journey to become a domain expert in formal methods. He explains how formal methods aim to address the shortcomings of the typical means of software testing, by using mathematical techniques to establish properties about software and verify that those properties hold true. Jakob discusses the importance of reliability in software development, and how formal methods can help ensure software is both minimally harmful and exceptionally useful, even in non-safety-critical industries. He also touches on \"lightweight\" formal methods such as Alloy and Forge, which are built to be accessible and easy to use.A Hacker News user describes using Alloy to model a ZFS problem regarding when the kernel should free a block that was in a filesystem, detailing the creation, deletion, and referencing of files and snapshots in the model. The author explains why they chose to treat a file's creation time as static and uses Forge to explicitly enumerate certain assumptions in the predicates. The article includes definitions of Alloy specifications, data types, and predicates, and concludes with tests applied to the model.A discussion on a model checking problem involving deleting files and snapshots, and how to ensure that live files should be allocated and that no file should be deleted if it is still being referred to by a snapshot; a counterexample is shown where a file is being freed and also referred to by a previous snapshot, revealing an actual issue with the approach of just deleting everything in the retired list; a fix is then proposed where instead of deleting everything in the retired list, files are only deleted if they are not being referred to by any earlier snapshot; the problem of how to efficiently determine if a file is being referred to by an earlier snapshot is also discussed, with a solution proposed by walking the snapshots and comparing their ctimes.Forge is a model-checking tool that checks every possible input, and can be used to discover bugs even with limited state space. It works by translating model rules to Boolean formulas using SAT/SMT solvers to evaluate their truth values. Margrave is an access-control policy analysis tool that uses model-checking to perform change impact analysis on firewall policies. Formal specification and theorem proving uses theorem provers, such as Isabelle/HOL or Lean, to reason about logical proofs and guarantee correctness.The post discusses proof assistants and their advantages and disadvantages. Proof assistants allow for more flexibility in the kinds of formulas that can be proved but lack \"push-button automation\". There are two approaches to encoding predicates in proof assistants: retaining decidability and writing predicates as boolean functions or dealing directly with propositions using inductive predicates. Writing propositions as functions is often beneficial. Specification in a theorem prover involves writing predicates, and higher-order predicates require a proof rather than computation. The post also discusses different approaches to providing formal semantics to programming languages, including big-step and small-step semantics and denotational semantics.The article discusses using the concept of refinement, which is a mathematics term, in verifying software. The author provides an example of proving the correctness of a Scheme program using Lean, a programming language. They also demonstrate how to build a lexical analyzer and parser in Lean, while also exploring the idea of Lean as a general-purpose programming language. The article provides code examples but lacks detailed commentary.The article presents the implementation of a Scheme interpreter in the Lean programming language. The interpreter includes evaluation of procedures, handling of primitive and compound procedures, as well as error handling. The implementation is based on the concept of evaluation state, which ensures termination of the program. The code includes definitions of types, functions, and operations on them. The article does not make any political or religious statements and maintains a neutral tone.The program semantics are compiled to a \"statement\" type that is then used for reasoning about big step semantics of those statements. The evaluation state structure makes it useful to reason about whether or not an evaluation is finite, and the approach used for the program semantics is effective. The program allows for compound procedures, and anonymous functions are converted into compound procedures at evaluation time. The approach requires an understanding of the big step semantics of statements, and the evaluation state structure makes it convenient to reason about the semantics.This post includes code for program semantics and the proofs for correctness of simple programs like factorial. The approach for proving factorial correctness involves many obligations and is tedious. The proof would have been more refined-based under different circumstances. This post is for experts in the field who want to learn about the usefulness of the semantics.In an article for Hacker News, writer Jakob L. Kreuze discusses the use of formal methods and various tools used for program verification, with a focus on high-level and low-level verification. Formal methods refer to using mathematical techniques to establish properties about software for greater confidence in software correctness beyond testing alone. Tools such as Alloy and Forge work at a high-level while Lean, Isabelle, and Coq work as a mechanization of mathematical logic for lower-level systems. Kreuze highlights his own experience with learning these tools and his future goals for gaining expertise.",

All data is sent in the Apache Arrow `feather` format, in a  custom quadtree format that makes it possible to only load  data as needed on zoom. Feather takes no time to parse in the browser  once transferred, compresses pretty well, and can be directly copied to the GPU without  transformation in JS. This is [the way of the future.](https://benschmidt.org/post/2020-01-15/2020-01-15-webgpu/)2. Most rendering is done in custom layers using WebGL, with a  buffer management strategy handled by REGL. This means that  there are no unnecessary abstractions around points or separate draw calls  for different objects; a minimum number of buffers are attached for the  needed points.3. Almost all grammar-of-graphics transforms such are handled on the GPU,  which allows for interpolated transitions with calculations  done in parallel.It also runs in completely static settings, so you can host a million-point scatterplot over something like Github Pages.# Examples* [1 million+ documents from arxiv.com](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/arxiv) rendered inside an Observable notebook.

There is also a dedicated [Deepscatter Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deepscatter/shared_invite/zt-17kbudjhj-zVzt26zddEpSyACe2E71Fw) which you are welcome to join.I came into doing this stuff from a very non-technical background and welcome people to join with naive questions.# Quick start## Importing the module.See the [arxiv example above](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/arxiv) to see some basic examples.## Running locally.First, install the companion tiling library, which is written in python, and generate a million points of test data in tiles of 50000 apiece.```shpython3 -V # requires Python 3.9.x or 3.10.xpython3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/bmschmidt/quadfeatherquadfeather-test-data 1_000_000quadfeather --files tmp.csv --tile_size 50_000 --destination tiles```Then setup this library to run. It will start a local dev server.```shnpm inpm run dev```If you go to `localhost:3344`, you should see an interactive scatterplot. To dig into what you're seeing, open `index.html`.(In 2021, this development site works in Chrome, not Safari or Firefox, because it uses ES6 module syntax inside the webworker. The distributed version of the module should work in all browsers.)## Your own data.1. Create a CSV, parquet, or feather file that has columns called 'x' and 'y'. (Or a feather file that has columns `x`, `y`). Any other columns (categorical information, etc.) can be included as additional columns.2. Tile it:```shcd deepscatter # if you're not already therequadfeather --files ../some-path-to/your-data.csv --tile_size 50000 --destination tiles```3. Assuming your dataset has an `x` and `y` column and the `tiles` folder is in the root directory of this project, you can see the data visualized by running```shnpm run dev```and opening `http://localhost:3345/index-simplest-way-to-start.html` in your browser.To edit the visualization, or to troubleshoot, look at the file `index-simplest-way-to-start.html`, where you should find a bare-bones implementation of deepscatter.Explore `index.html`, and render it at `http://localhost:3345/index.html`, for a more advanced example.Note: Ideally, in a future release you'll be able to create these specs in away that doesn't require coding JSON directly.## Build the module```shnpm run build```will create an ES module at `dist/deepscatter.es.js` The mechanics ofimporting this are very slightly different than `index.html`.Note that this is an ESM module and so requires you to use ```` See `index_prod.html` for an example This is currently bundled with vite and rollup. There is/will be a further interaction layer on top of it, but the core plotting components are separate and should work as a standalone layer that supports plot requests via an API. # Code strategy Any interaction logic that changes the API call directly does not belong in this library. The onlyinteraction code here is for zooming and interacting with points.## Future codebase splits.The plotting components and the tiling components are logically quite separate; I may breakthe tiling strategy into a separate JS library called 'quadfeather'.Apache Arrow would still be a necessary intermediate format, but it could be generated from CSV filesusing, say, `arquero` or a WASM port of `DuckDB`.# APIThis is still subject to change and is not fully documented. The encoding portion of the API mimics Vega-Lite with some minor distinctions to avoid deeply-nested queries and to add animation and jitter parameters.```js{  encoding: {   \"x\": {     \"field\": \"x\",     \"transform\": \"literal\"   },   \"color\": {     \"field\": \"year\",     \"range\": \"viridis\",     \"domain\": [1970, 2020]  }}```## Implemented aesthetics.1. x2. y3. size4. jitter_radius: size of jitter. API subject to change.5. jitter_speed: speed of jitter. API subject to change.6. color (categorical or linear: range can call color scales explicitly, or accepting any d3-color name.)7. `x0` (for animations; transitions between x0 and x)8. `y0` (for animations; transitions between y0 and y)9. `filter`. (Filtering is treated as an aesthetic operation by this library.)## Planned1. Symbol (Mapping of categorical variables to single unicode points in a single font; probably 255 max.)2. Label (Full-text label)3. Image (Like PixPlot)## JitterJitter is a little overloaded with features right now, but some are quite fun.jitter method is set on 'method' key of the 'jitter_radius' field. Possible values are:1. `circle`2. `spiral`3. `time`4. `normal`# Principles1. This is a 2d library. No fake 3d.2. The central zoom state is handled by d3-zoom.3. That zoom state can be used to render to webgl. Don't know webgl? You  should be able to use the zoom state to draw to canvas or svg layers using the  same zoom and underlying data, so that you can draw point with webgl  and then build a callout using d3-annotate.",
        "summary": "The Deep Scatterplots for the Web library allows for the display of an evolving and large number of data points via the web with improved speed due to Apache Arrow's feather format, custom WebGL rendering layers using REGL, and grammar-of-graphics transforms handled on the GPU. The library can run in static settings and can be applied to large datasets such as census data, scientific articles, and historical newspapers. The library provides examples for importing, running locally, and generating visualizations. Additionally, the API includes implemented and planned aesthetics, such as jitter, symbol, label, and image. The library adheres to principles such as 2D display, d3-zoom control, webGL rendering, and lightweight interaction logic.",

This year, a dangerous new substance, xylazine, has been further amplifying the toxicity of Canada\u2019s drug supply, concerning first responders and public-health experts who work on the front lines.Xylazine, known by some users as \u201ctranq\u201d or \u201czombie drug\u201d for its powerful sedative effects, is a tranquilizer typically administered to large animals (like horses) in veterinary settings, and is not approved for use in humans. According to a recent report from Health Canada, xylazine was found in 1,350 samples of drug seizures, most commonly in Ontario and British Columbia. Perhaps most alarmingly, the sedative is sometimes combined with fentanyl. But unlike fentanyl, whose overdoses are treated with naloxone (or Narcan), xylazine currently has no antidote.READ: I\u2019m a family doctor in Halifax. Here\u2019s why pay-for-service clinics will burden the public system.To find out more about xylazine, its devastating effects on users and what can be done to mitigate them (if anything), we spoke to Kali Sedgemore, a long-time harm-reduction expert in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside who also works with Vancouver Coastal Health, a regional health authority that provides addictions outreach in British Columbia.How did you get involved with harm-reduction work?\u00a0I grew up surrounded by substance use. At 11, I started using cocaine and alcohol, which turned into a habit as I entered high school. It progressed to crack and, later, meth. Now, I\u2019m a daily intravenous meth user. I\u2019ve also watched family members use. I know the importance of having clean supplies and treating drug users with respect, knowing they need help. For the past 10 years, I\u2019ve been working to prevent people from overdosing. Right now, I work at three safe-injection sites in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s a typical work day like for you?I usually work from noon to 8 p.m. I arrive at the site, which is usually a big room with a bunch of different stations where people can use. We see anywhere from 40 to 100 people a day, and all types: construction workers, unhoused people, lawyers. I sign them in, witness their consumption of drugs\u2014including fentanyl, crystal meth, hydromorphone, cocaine, ritalin, dexedrine\u2014and try to help them as best I can. Some users have seizures, or they black out or fall asleep. Some act erratically. Some stop breathing, because opiates tell the body to slow down, reducing their oxygen supply. If this happens, two or three workers will offer them oxygen. If someone \u201cgoes down,\u201d which is the term we use for overdosing, we give them naloxone, which reduces the effects of opioids and restores breathing. We\u2019ll call 911 if we do that.\u00a0\u00a0Vancouver-based harm-reduction worker Kali Sedgemore (photograph courtesy of Sedgemore, illustration by Maclean\u2019s)How have you seen the opioid crisis evolve over the years?\u00a0When I started working in harm reduction back in 2011, drug dealers were mixing fentanyl with other drugs\u2014like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine\u2014because it\u2019s a cheap way to get high. I wasn\u2019t really seeing any overdoses until 2015, when fentanyl fully entered the drug supply. We didn\u2019t know what was going on at first. By the winter of 2022, we were seeing one or two overdoses a day at the clinic. And by early 2023, we were seeing between five to seven overdoses a day, which we attribute to an increased presence of xylazine and benzodiazepines like Xanax, Ativan and Valium. So xylazine really emerged earlier this year?In January, I started hearing about xylazine through drug warnings on social media. One Instagram account, Harm Reduction Saves Lives,\u00a0posts regular updates on the province\u2019s supply. Then outreach workers end up discussing it at testing sites. We don\u2019t see xylazine as the new fentanyl, exactly; it\u2019s just another example of how the drug supply is being contaminated. We know that xylazine is a veterinary tranquilizer, but we\u2019re not sure how the drug dealers are getting it from clinics. How does xylazine enter the drug supply?It\u2019s used as a filler to create more product and increase its potency, which jacks up the price of the drugs. This is a process called \u201ccutting.\u201d Often, the presence of xylazine isn\u2019t the fault of individual dealers, because the drugs have usually switched hands a few times before they get them. Lately, we\u2019ve been seeing a lot of long-time users overdose. These are people who have a high tolerance and a lot of experience using, which is a sign that the drugs are getting more toxic.\u00a0READ:\u00a0An impossible job: What it\u2019s like to work in a pediatric ICUWhat about xylazine makes it particularly dangerous?First, it\u2019s meant for animals. It\u2019s also difficult to tell whether someone has taken drugs cut with xylazine, which is usually injected or smoked with tin foil or a bubble pipe. We\u2019ve seen different physical responses to it; sometimes it just looks like someone is heavily sedated. Because xylazine is a tranquilizer, though, it can cause some people to black out for 12 hours. It\u2019s also a vasoconstrictor, meaning it causes a narrowing of the blood vessels, which can cause really bad skin abscesses and leads to amputation in some instances. Most of all, we have no readily available way to test the drugs and find out what\u2019s in them\u2014unless we send them in for testing, which we don\u2019t have the time or resources to do. In your opinion, does xylazine have the potential to wreak as much havoc as fentanyl?\u00a0It\u2019s hard to say. Nobody knows what to do at this point.\u00a0Is there any action that policymakers can take?We need a regulated, safe supply of drugs\u2014as in, we need dealers to be handing out drugs that are tested properly. Right now, dealers can get their supply tested at sites in the Downtown Eastside. The machine used in testing is the Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer, and it can detect multiple substances in minutes. We need more people who are trained to operate these machines. We also need to hire more drug users in harm-prevention roles, because they understand the impact of opioids.How are you coping with the onslaught of another new drug?I\u2019m really numb to it now, because I\u2019ve dealt with this so many times during my career. We constantly lose members of our community, people we care about. Most recently, I lost my older brother, who died from smoking contaminated crack. It really takes a toll on my mental health, so I spend time with friends, go for hikes and talk with a counsellor. I also run a drug-user group called the Coalition of Peers Dismantling the Drug War. We have to fight hard every day, because things are getting worse. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Looking for more?Get the Best of Maclean's sent straight to your inbox.

Perhaps your social media presence is the first thing people find when they search for you, or perhaps it\u2019s the portfolio site you created for yourself. However, if you use GitHub to share your code and participate in open source projects, then your GitHub profile may be the first place people go to in order to learn more about you.What do you want your GitHub profile to say about you? How do you want to express what is important to you and who you are in a concise and easy to read manner for visitors? Whether they are a prospective employer or a prospective partner in an open source project, it\u2019s imperative you have a profile that stands out.Using GitHub Actions, you can turn a static markdown document into a dynamic experience that stays up to date on the latest information about you. How do you do that?I\u2019ll show you an example of how you can do this quickly and without too much effort. In this example, you\u2019ll learn how to scrape a website and use that data to dynamically update your GitHub profile. We\u2019ll show this example in Ruby, but you can do this with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or other languages.How Your GitHub Profile WorksYour GitHub profile is found by going to github.com/[your-username] in a web browser, here\u2019s mine for example. Where does the content for that view come from?It lives in a special repository in your account with the name of your account username. If you do not have this repository yet, you will not see any special content when you visit github.com/[your-username], so the first step is to ensure you have that repository created, and if you do not, go ahead and create it.Exploring the files in the profile repositoryThe only required file in the repository is a README.md file that is the source of your profile page../\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.mdGo ahead and add some content in that file, save it, and refresh your username homepage, and you will see that content reflected there.Adding the right folders for dynamic contentBefore we create the code to make our profile dynamic, let\u2019s add the folder structure.Inside the top-level add a new folder called .github and inside .github add two new sub-folders: scripts/ and workflows/.Your file structure should now look like this:./\u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows/\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.mdMaking a Dynamic ProfileWe need to do three things for this example:Define a place in the README where the dynamic content will beAdd a script inside scripts/ that will do the scraping workAdd a workflow for GitHub Actions inside workflows/ that will run the script on a scheduleLet\u2019s do each of those steps now.Updating the READMEWe need to add a section to the README that can be grabbed using Regex by the script to modify. It can be whatever you need it to be for your specific use case. For this example, we\u2019ll add a section for recent blog posts in the README.Open up the README.md file in a code editor and add the following:### Recent blog postsNow we have an area for the script to find.Creating the scriptThe example script we are building is written in Ruby and uses the GitHub gem octokit to interact with your repository, the nokogiri gem to scrape the website, and the httparty gem to make the HTTP request.In this example below, the element to be scraped has already been identified. In your own use case, you\u2019ll need to discover the path to the element on the site you wish to scrape, and it will undoubtedly be different than what is shown below as defined in the posts variable and for each title and link of each post.Here is the example code, which goes in the scripts/ folder:require 'httparty'require 'nokogiri'require 'octokit'# Scrape blog posts from the websiteurl = \"https://www.bengreenberg.dev/blog/\"response = HTTParty.get(url)parsed_page = Nokogiri::HTML(response.body)posts = parsed_page.css('.flex.flex-col.rounded-lg.shadow-lg.overflow-hidden')# Generate the updated blog posts list (top 5)posts_list = [\"\\n### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n\"]posts.first(5).each do |post| title = post.css('p.text-xl.font-semibold.text-gray-900').text.strip link = \"https://www.bengreenberg.dev#{post.at_css('a')[:href]}\" posts_list << \"* [#{title}](#{link})\"end# Update the README.md fileclient = Octokit::Client.new(access_token: ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'])repo = ENV['GITHUB_REPOSITORY']readme = client.readme(repo)readme_content = Base64.decode64(readme[:content]).force_encoding('UTF-8')# Replace the existing blog posts sectionposts_regex = /### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n[\\s\\S]*?(?=<\\/td>)/mupdated_content = readme_content.sub(posts_regex, \"#{posts_list.join(\"\\n\")}\\n\")client.update_contents(repo, 'README.md', 'Update recent blog posts', readme[:sha], updated_content)As you can see, first an HTTP request is made to the website and the section with the blog posts is gathered and the data is assigned to a posts variable. Then, the script iterates through the blog posts inside the posts variable and gathers the first 5 of them. You may want to change that number for your own needs. Each loop through the blog posts, a post is added to an array of posts_list with the title and the URL to the blog post.Lastly, the README file is updated by first finding it using the octokit gem, and then locating the spot in the README to update with some regex: posts_regex = /### Recent Blog Posts\\n\\n[\\s\\S]*?(?=<\\/td>)/m.This script will do the job, but nothing is actually invoking this script. How does it get run? This is where GitHub Actions comes to the rescue!Creating the Action workflowNow that we have the script in place, we need a way to automatically run it on a schedule. GitHub Actions provides a powerful way to automate a wide variety of tasks, including running scripts. In this case, we\u2019ll create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the script once a week at midnight on Sunday.The workflow file should be placed in the .github/workflows/ directory and can be named something like update_blog_posts.yml. Here\u2019s the content of the workflow file:name: Update Recent Blog Postson: schedule:  - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Run once a week at 00:00 (midnight) on Sunday workflow_dispatch:jobs: update_posts:  runs-on: ubuntu-latest  steps:  - name: Check out repository   uses: actions/checkout@v2  - name: Set up Ruby   uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1   with:    ruby-version: 3.1  - name: Install dependencies   run: gem install httparty nokogiri octokit  - name: Scrape posts and update README   run: ruby ./.github/scripts/update_posts.rb   env:    GITHUB_TOKEN: $    GITHUB_REPOSITORY: $This workflow is triggered on a schedule defined by the cron syntax, which specifies that it should run at 00:00 (midnight) every Sunday. Additionally, the workflow can be manually triggered using the workflow_dispatch event.The update_posts job consists of several steps:Checking out the repository using the actions/checkout@v2 action.Setting up Ruby using the ruby/setup-ruby@v1 action, with the specified Ruby version of 3.1.Installing the required Ruby gems (httparty, nokogiri, and octokit) using the gem install command.Running the script update_posts.rb located in the .github/scripts/ directory. The GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPOSITORY environment variables are provided to the script, allowing it to interact with the repository.With this workflow in place, your script will automatically run every week to scrape the blog posts and update the README file. GitHub Actions takes care of all the scheduling and execution, making the process seamless and efficient.Putting it all TogetherNowadays, your online presence is often the first point of contact for people looking to connect with you\u2014whether they\u2019re prospective employers, collaborators, or contributors to open source projects. Your GitHub profile, in particular, is a valuable platform for showcasing your skills, projects, and interests. So, how can you ensure that your GitHub profile remains up to date, relevant, and truly reflective of who you are?By harnessing the power of GitHub Actions, we\u2019ve demonstrated how you can transform your GitHub profile from a static Markdown document into a dynamic, ever-changing example of who you are. Through the example provided in this guide, you\u2019ve learned how to scrape data from a website and use it to dynamically update your GitHub profile. And while our example was implemented in Ruby, the same principles can be applied using JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or any other language of your choice.To recap, we walked through the process of creating a Ruby script that scrapes blog posts from a website, extracts relevant information, and updates the \u201cRecent Blog Posts\u201d section of your README.md file. Then, we used GitHub Actions to set up a workflow that runs the script on a regular schedule, ensuring that your profile remains current with your latest content.But our journey doesn\u2019t end here! The techniques and approaches shared in this guide can serve as a foundation for further exploration and creativity. Whether it\u2019s pulling in data from other sources, integrating with APIs, or experimenting with different content formats, the possibilities are endless.So go ahead and make your GitHub profile a vibrant and dynamic extension of yourself. Let it tell your story, highlight your achievements, and invite collaboration with others.\u2b50 Was this blog post helpful?
