    "hn_content": "A discussion on Hacker News about learning assembly language; users suggest practical ways to learn and provide examples of jobs that still use assembly. Suggestions include writing a simple GUI from scratch, translating machine code to assembly instructions, studying 8086 manual, and reading assembly listings from C compiler. Jobs that still involve assembly language include compiler development, kernel development, driver development, security research, debugging in healthcare sector, and performance engineering. Assembly language is still used for small embedded systems and developing matrix and vector operation routines for BLAS libraries. Some legacy systems still require assembly language expertise and can be expensive to replace.The article explains how to open a new window in X11 and print \"Hello, world\" in assembly. The assembly code to achieve this is 618 lines long. There is a discussion on how assembly is needed for various tasks such as emulators, bootloader development, game engine development, deep learning, hypervisor work and high end malware development. It's worth mentioning there have been entire GUIs written in assembly, such as GeoWorks Ensemble. Assembly doesn't really have a concept of exceptions, and there is no one way to create a closure in assembly. Writing a simple Forth interpreter is recommended for those looking to understand how to compile to assembly. It's easier to understand high level concepts by writing assembly. Porting the program to other operating systems is not straightforward due to different syscall ABIs.A developer shares their experience writing a GUI in 8086 assembly language and discusses the challenge of maintaining perspective on the entire system. Other comments mention similar projects written in assembly, the use of LLVM as an alternative to directly working with assembly, and suggestions for learning different architectures. One comment requests a C implementation to help understand the code. The post does not introduce any new technologies or products, but sheds light on the challenges and benefits of assembly programming.",

    "hn_content": "CSS Pro, a re-imagined Devtools for web design has been launched, with features including a color picker, type scale, and sizing tool. Users are required to pay $30 per month, or $900 for a lifetime license which allows three activations. Comments on news aggregator Hacker News suggest developers are reluctant to pay for subscriptions, preferring perpetual licenses, and many view CSS Pro as too expensive, setting a negative tone that such projects are hard to sell. Developers are also regarded as being cheap, spending a lot of time to save just a small amount. The suggestion is made to sell CSS Pro to businesses.Monthly subscriptions to products may be alluring but carry the risk of vendor lock-in, which can cost more in terms of time and effort if switching to alternatives is necessary in the future. Subscriptions increase a product's stickiness and often come with various activation and renewal fees. Buying a perpetual license removes this risk but may still be vulnerable to being taxed perpetually; the pros and cons are present in either option. SaaS startups, due to their need for reliable income, prefer subscriptions over perpetual licenses. However, developers who charge a flat fee for their services and depend on reliable tools find buying lifetime access to a product better. Either way, the choice depends on the context and which choice better suits the customer's needs.Developers express reluctance towards subscription-based tools due to the excessive number of subscriptions they manage and the culture of startups flooding the market with subscription options. While developers acknowledge that subscriptions that can improve their developer experience or productivity are worth paying for, they must justify their value over other subscriptions. Developers tend to buy hobbies, while being reluctant to pay for development tools, which may help boost their productivity at work. Although businesses should be the ones paying for tools that help save time, they are typically cheap and multiply per-seat costs instead of realizing it's a rounding error on payroll. A $180/year tool may not appear to be expensive, but multiple subscriptions add up, especially if one has limited resources. It's more cost-effective for businesses to buy productivity tools that facilitate quick and easy collaboration rather than relying on single-seat subscriptions and having each employee manage multiple subscriptions. Finally, creating tools like this for UX designers, technical product managers, or similar individuals who work with code can save them time and resources while ensuring that they produce consistent results.Developers are being asked to spend money on themselves and invest in tools that can make their lives easier, even if those tools have a subscription-based pricing model. However, many developers are wary of spending money on tools that might not provide the promised benefits or that they perceive as unnecessary. The discussion also touches on the broader issue of how developers are often undervalued and overworked, with the responsibility for managing their workload and personal development falling on them rather than being supported by their managers or employers. The post highlights the importance of considering the value proposition of developer tools and the potential benefits they can provide, as well as discussing the pros and cons of subscription-based pricing models.MacOS diff tool, Kaleidoscope, has changed from a one-time purchase to a monthly subscription, causing frustration for long-time users. Developers, and particularly freelancers, face numerous subscription costs and may be resistant to adding more. The comment section offers varied perspectives on the value of subscriptions for developers and the practicality of the pricing model. Anecdotes range from frustration with having to subscribe to services not used regularly, to consumers being happy to pay for services that save them time. Ultimately, the debate between one-time purchases versus subscriptions continues, as companies try to find pricing models that balance the interests of both buyers and sellers.- Users suggest time-saving features for the CSS Pro tool, such as the ability to pause rebilling, export all data, or freeze accounts\n- Several users question the value proposition of the tool in terms of pricing compared to other options and suggest alternative open-source tools\n- One user suggests a potential killer feature would be 2-way-write integration with hosting platforms, allowing for real-time updates to the codebase based on changes made in the tool\n- Some users debate the benefits and drawbacks of subscription models versus a one-time purchase and upgrade model for software products.CSS Pro is a new design tool aimed at front-end developers that synchronizes their work in real time between the code and the browser. The company is charging $30 per month or $350 for lifetime access to the tool. Some users have commented that it is well-polished with useful features like a gradient/bkg generator, and real-time measurements of image content. Other users have criticized the pricing as steep and suggested that the software is too slow or too difficult to use due to the design. The tool is designed to handle front-end site design work more efficiently than is possible with existing browser dev tools, like inspecting HTML code, and instead allows for editing CSS in real-time.Users discuss the merits and cost of a visual CSS editor tool called Spiral, which allows users to visually edit and adjust CSS in real-time without code. Many express interest in the tool's capabilities but are deterred by the monthly subscription cost of $30. A few users suggest alternative tools and processes for extracting CSS properties or converting to Tailwind classes. The tool's website, video, and marketing are praised as being professional and thorough. Some comments express skepticism over the tool's usefulness or compare it to existing tools like DevTools.",

    "content": "I think Zig is hard...but worth itPage created: 2023-05-22 , updated: 2023-05-31\"I learned Zig in a weekend! \u2026Six hours! \u20266\u00b5s!\" say the blissful lizards. Followed by something to the effect of, \"It\u2019s easy to pick up because the syntax is so simple.\"That\u2019s a sentiment I\u2019ve seen thrown around a lot since 2016\u2019s announcement, Introduction to the Zig Programming Language (andrewkelly.me).Clearly, many folks really do find Zig easy to learn. Veteran C programmers, in particular, seem to find Zig a natural and logical next step. Kelley\u2019s fun and enlightening talk, The Road to Zig 1.0 (youtube.com), presents Zig as exactly this: \"C, but with the problems fixed.\"And it\u2019s also true that Zig has a relatively small amount of syntax. For some, it is apparently possible to \"pick it up\" in the span of time it takes to read a single page of documentation (ziglang.org). (Mind you, that \"single page\" is on the order of 256 printed pages.)The problem, of course, is that there\u2019s not a direct correlation between the slimness of a language\u2019s syntax and ease of learning. If there were, the simplicity of Lisp\u2019s S-expressions would make it trivial to \"pick up\" during lunch. Or Forth, with it\u2019s space-separated words would take, well, you just learned it. Enjoy! Of course, I\u2019m being a bit silly here. Zig is a relatively \"small\" and \"simple\" language and that does aid learning. (By contrast, nobody but a savant is going to \"pick up\" C++ or Rust from scratch in an afternoon. They\u2019re just too big for that.)But I\u2019d like to state for the record that if you find Zig difficult to master, you are not alone. If your programming background is like mine (or even if it\u2019s less weird than mine), Zig can be challenging.I\u2019d like to enumerate the reasons I believe this is, and why most of the reasons are actually very wonderful things about the language and well worth the effort to overcome.Zig is newLet\u2019s get this out of the way: You can\u2019t just go into the bookstore and buy a Zig book. And even if you could, it would be out of date in a month. Zig is changing rapidly. (If I didn\u2019t have help, I doubt I would have been able to keep Ziglings (github.com) up to date on my own when I was busy with other projects!)Crucially, there is basically no documentation for the standard library except for the source code itself. (To be fair, some parts are well commented and much of it is surprisingly readable.) Everything else is scattered across the Web, but you\u2019ll have to see for yourself if the examples still compile.Why that\u2019s good: It\u2019s not. It may be exciting, but it\u2019s terrible for learning. Let\u2019s move on.Zig forces you to make choicesDepending on your background, you might also not be used to having to think in terms of exact numeric types (u8, i16, f64, etc.) for every single runtime value in your program. Handling \"strings\" means dealing with pointers, sentinel termination, arrays, and slices. This will slow you down very quickly if you\u2019re used to dynamic languages which (very conveniently) handle these details for you.If you\u2019re new to manual memory management, you already have a pretty big hurdle to get over.That\u2019s true regardless of language.But Zig throws another level of decision-making at you that (most?) developers are rarely asked to make: Choosing a memory allocation strategy.And you won\u2019t get far without making a decision. A significant portion of the Zig standard library requires that you provide an allocator.That\u2019s a heck of a thing to ask of a beginner!Why that\u2019s good: This is actually one of the coolest things about Zig. To write performant software (or even just as a learning exercise), we should learn about obtaining and using memory. We should be allowed to pick the best types and allocators for our application.(It\u2019s also perfectly fine to pick something like i64 for numbers and the GeneralPurposeAllocator to get you going. You can always change strategies later.)Zig is pedanticSomething that makes Zig harder to learn up front, but easier in the long run is lack of undefined behavior. While C presents itself as a compact language, learning how to avoid undefined behavior takes time to master because the language itself is more than happy to let you do all sorts of incorrect things. Zig makes undefined behavior an error.I\u2019ve been a Rust noob and a Zig noob. The thing they have in common is fighting with the compiler because I know what I want to do, but I don\u2019t know how to express it.Zig\u2019s type system is logical enough, but it still takes time to learn how to create (and especially) cast types correctly because there are so many possible combinations of the basic building-blocks:var vs constoptional values (?)error unions (!)single vs many-item pointers (* and [*])slices of arrays ([] and [x..y])sentinel termination ([n:null])Put enough of these together and you can end up with something like [*:null]const ?[*:0]const u8 (a real example I personally struggled with early on).There are certain bits of code I could have written faster in assembly language than Zig because it took me a long time to figure out how to express my intent.Why that\u2019s good: Zig is trying to help. C and assemblers don\u2019t much care what I do with my memory, so they make it \"easy\" to write code that performs actions regardless of type. But if I get it wrong (and I will), the program will segfault. The language won\u2019t get in my way, but it won\u2019t help me either. Zig makes you get it right, and that\u2019s a good thing. Slower and more tedious, especially at first, but good.Zig has comptimePlenty of languages have metaprogramming, but none are exactly alike. C\u2019s preprocessor won\u2019t prepare you for Zig\u2019s compile time execution. Macros won\u2019t prepare you for it. The run-time introspection of various dynamic languages won\u2019t prepare you for it either.Zig\u2019s comptime is its own thing. And you\u2019ll need to learn about it or you\u2019ll run into errors early on that otherwise won\u2019t make sense because it\u2019s happening whether you ask for it or not.Within a specific set of rules (including the explicit use of the comptime keyword), \"regular\" Zig code will run at compile time, resulting in a runtime executable with values pre-calculated, unneeded code removed, loops \"unrolled\", and code generated inline to work with different data types.Why that\u2019s good: Only time will tell if comptime is the \"greatest thing since sliced bread\" or not. But so far, it seems to be a pretty solid concept. By executing portions of the program at compile time, a large number of tricky language problems have been solved without introducing too many additional concepts.What is \"hard\" versus \"easy\", anyway?The Zig Programming Language (ziglang.org) home page doesn\u2019t contain the word \"easy\", but it does contain the word \"simple\".As Rich Hickey teaches us in his brilliant Simple Made Easy (youtube.com), easy things seem easy primarily because they are familiar. Easy is subjective. But simple things are simple because they do not complicate; they have fewer concepts. Simple is objective.(Simple is often elegant as well, but then we\u2019re back to being subjective.)Zig may be easy for some and not for others (like me!), but it definitely strives to be simple, uniform, and correct. And for that reason, I think it\u2019s worth the investment.Back to my Zig pages.This page was last generated 2023-06-01 18:23:41 -0400All content \u00a9 Copyright Dave Gauer",

    "hn_content": "Zig is a new language that is easy to learn but hard to master. Some insiders underestimate the effort required for newcomers to build non-trivial things due to poor documentation and inconsistent stdlib. The lack of a polished package manager is hindering development efforts. Some readers argue that a package manager, LSP, and standard code formatter are essential to a new language. Without these things, most new languages won't be ready for large scale use. However, the lack of these features doesn't prevent Zig from being useful for enthusiasts and early adopters. Zig has a decent LSP and a package manager isn't essential, especially for low-level languages with relatively short dependency chains.Developers discuss the possibility of a generalized package manager that has hooks for a language-specific plugin to control how packages are extracted, dependencies are resolved, and additional build steps are executed. Different languages do imports differently, have different constructs for \"exports\" and modules, and require different directory structures, making it challenging to standardize package managers. While package managers are relatively easy to create for new languages, doing better than other languages' package managers takes significant effort, due to being both a computer and social engineering problem. Zig is a low-level programming language that enables choosing how allocation is done and uses comptime as a clean solution to problems that are ugly in most languages. Zig scripts can be used to unify a team on one language and double down on investment in Zig.The discussion centers around the benefits and limitations of the programming language Zig, in comparison to languages like Rust and C++. Key features of Zig, including its C interop and its own C compiler, are highlighted as attractive to developers working with C code. Concerns are raised about potential limitations, such as the lack of operator overloading and the potential for community/adoption issues. Overall, the discussion provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Zig and how it fits into the broader programming landscape.The post discusses the use of layouts in *nix and suggests using .XCompose as the most practical *nix approach. Zig, a programming language, is discussed in the later section, with some discussing the potential for operator overloading, while others argue against it. Bevy, a game engine built on Rust, is also mentioned. There is a debate on the usefulness of operator overloading in general, with some arguing it is preferred for math-heavy operations. Zig's comptime is discussed as being referentially transparent and prone to producing regular stack traces for errors.Zig's comptime is being praised as a powerful and complex-free tool for macro use cases by some developers, although others feel that well-designed macro engines could be just as effective. Referential transparency is not necessarily related to purely functional programming and should instead be thought of as a property of individual expressions. Most programming languages are referentially transparent without macros, but it is macros that demonstrate their full power and complexity. Other languages like Idris and Ruby also rely heavily on second-language-within-a-language constructs like macro and type-level languages, as do C++ templates and Brainfuck. Zig's standard library is currently lacking in documentation and bug-free, but browsing other languages' standard libraries can offer insight for newcomers.- The new version of Zulip allows chats to be accessible from outside.\n- Rust has a standard library documentation, but Zig's version is lacking, although a new one is coming.\n- Zig has a lot of advantages over C/C++, including an easy build system, cross compilation, single executable compiler, package manager, and debugability.\n- Zig's comptime feature is a killer feature, making it superior to C++'s complex constexpr, consteval, and constinit mechanisms.\n- Zig lacks good IDE and debugger support but can be used alongside C with first-class support for C calling conventions and struct layouts.\n- The lack of undefined behavior in Zig could make it easier in the long run but may lead to overzealous prejudice against UB.\n- Zig is similar to Clojure in the information processing space and delivers real advances in simplicity.\n- The Venn diagram of feature portability across the actively-maintained Fortran compilers is messy.Zig, a systems programming language, is compared to other languages in terms of simplicity and flexibility. Users discuss the use cases and advantages/disadvantages of using Zig, including its build system, file organization, and cross-compilation abilities. Some users prefer other languages such as Odin for game development due to their higher-level capabilities.

The aim is to ensure that ethical hackers can contact the right people to tackle vulnerabilities. However, users argue that the GPG key is unfriendly and time-consuming to use, while others doubt the effectiveness of encrypted messaging in reporting cybersecurity issues. Additionally, citizens or NGOs can sue entities for non-compliance with security standards. Multiple online tools are available to help organizations implement security.txt files.The Dutch government mandated that its websites must follow the security.txt standard. The announcement was made by the Digital Trust Center of the National Government. The security.txt is a file that should be placed in the .well-known directory of a website, indicating how vulnerability reports can be submitted. While a security.txt file would make reporting vulnerabilities easier, some argue that it could lead to unnecessary spam or increase the number of reports. Some interesting comments touched upon DNS records like SPF and DKIM, the use of HTTP and HTTPS for job positions and why security should be the default.An individual is developing an app that includes a security.txt alongside other essential functionalities for a website, as the file is useful and easy to implement. The security.txt file is a relatively new web feature that specifies how security researchers can report vulnerabilities. The Government of the Netherlands allows the use of the security.txt file, and other websites like Facebook have implemented it. Some developers wonder if they should include the security.txt file automatically in their website generator for users. While it is not a mandatory requirement, private companies might adopt the standard in the future if it becomes more widespread. Moreover, the file does not obtrusively affect the user interface and can help reduce potential exploitation or harmful behaviors on the website.",

Compared to its predecessor, the Quest 2, the Quest 3\u2019s design is lighter and more comfortable, with a \u201c40 percent slimmer optic profile\u201d (without taking its foam facial interface into account), while a new Snapdragon chip inside has twice the graphics performance.Meta\u2019s Quest 2 (left) and Quest 3 (right) VR headsets Image: MetaIt\u2019s also compatible with the Quest 2\u2019s games, which is good since the old headset is sticking around but at a very familiar lower price. Meta said that starting June 4th, the Quest 2 will drop its price by $100 to $299.99 for the 128GB version, while the 256GB version is getting an $80 price cut from $429.99 to $349.99. That undoes last year\u2019s price hike on the base model and makes the version with additional storage cheaper than it was before.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)If you\u2019re interested in the Quest 3 instead, you can sign up here for more information.In addition, an upcoming software update for the Quest 2 and Meta\u2019s more expensive Quest Pro will increase their CPU and GPU performance and enable Dynamic Resolution Scaling.This is coming just days before Apple is expected to announce its long-rumored mixed reality headset and hours ahead of a showcase for games on Meta\u2019s VR platform that begins later today at 1PM ET. Meta said it would have a AAA adventure title to show there and promised additional details to come during the annual Meta Connect event scheduled for September 27th.Quest 3 Touch Pro controllers Image: MetaWe already had a pretty good idea of how the Quest 3 would shake out after Mark Gurman of Bloomberg detailed his hands-on experience with the then-unannounced device earlier this week, reporting on the lighter and more comfortable design that adds new sensors and redesigned controllers.The video clearly shows off the three new sensor areas across the front of the device that do the most to differentiate it from earlier versions, as well as the head strap. Gurman described that the pill-shaped zones hold four cameras split evenly between the left and right sides \u2014 two of which are full-color cameras and two standard \u2014 and a single depth sensor in the middle that could improve the headset\u2019s AR performance.We also see the new Touch Plus controllers with TruTouch haptics \u201cfor experiences you can feel,\u201d without the old rings they used to have for positional tracking. This announcement didn\u2019t go into detail on the sensor setup, but the depth sensor should work with the controllers, and Meta confirmed hand tracking will be supported out of the box this time around.Quest 3 exploded view Image: MetaCorrection June 1st, 12:35PM ET: An earlier version of this post said the Quest 3 is 40 percent lighter than the Quest 2. In fact, it has a forty percent \u201cslimmer optic profile\u201d than its predecessor.

    "hn_content": "Meta (formerly Facebook) has announced its Quest 3 VR headset. However, many tech enthusiasts feel more should be done to sell these products, with demo units being particularly scarce. Despite this, the Quest 3 has sold 20 million units, although it still lags behind gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Switch. Users have noted issues with the Quest Pro, such as storage and battery problems, and overall retention remains a hurdle for the quality of VR games and experiences. Nonetheless, some users find games like Beat Saber immersive and effective for fitness, although successful virtual reality games are still hard to come by.Beat Saber promises custom level support for Quest, but it never materializes; Synth Riders, Audio Trip, Boombox, and Pistol Whip continue to allow custom songs out of the box. There are concerns about hygiene with VR headsets, and some people get motion sickness after 15 minutes of use. However, some games like Superhot, Thrill of the Fight, Blaston, the table tennis game, and Golf provide immersive experiences that cannot be replicated on a 2D screen. While VR lacks the volume of AAA content, there are a lot of less intense, fun, low-stress gaming experiences that can draw in casual players.- The Thrill of the Fight and In Death: Unchained are highly recommended VR games.\n- There are now VR games with sit-down modes for those who don't want to move around too much.\n- Demos for VR headsets are scarce, but could be a huge selling point for potential customers.\n- There's currently no VR \"killer app,\" but some users find the technology exciting and hope for more immersive experiences.\n- A controversial but necessary use case for VR is adult content, with some arguing it could drive innovation in the industry.\n- The release date for the Apple VR headset has been announced for September.\n- Meta (formerly Facebook) has faced criticism for their handling of VR demos and perceived lack of effort to make it a more widely available experience.\n- Some VR enthusiasts have started to grow bored with current games and are hoping for something more compelling to be released.- Meta has announced the upcoming release of their new VR headset\n- The Quest 3 is expected to have improved performance and slimmer design compared to its predecessor\n- Some users express concern over potential drawbacks to the new design, such as scratch-prone lenses\n- Users discuss their favorite games on the Meta Quest platform, including popular titles like Beat Saber and I Expect You to Die\n- Some users criticize the marketing approach taken in the Quest 3 promotional trailer, suggesting it focuses too much on surface-level excitement rather than true immersion\n- There are speculations on the potential for Meta to explore technologies like Neuralink in creating fully immersive VR experiences for users.Meta's pricing for the 128GB version of the Quest 2 has been lowered to $299.99; while this may seem like a deal, factoring in inflation, it is actually standard tech price reduction. The Quest 2 has been successful in the VR market due to its ease of setup and large library of games. While VR technology has improved, many still find the form factor of a headset to be cumbersome and there is no user experience that is shockingly compelling. However, some believe that advances in generative AI could help develop this experience. The future of VR remains to be seen, as it has not achieved mass-market appeal, but the installation of neural links to human minds is seen as concerning.Facebook's latest VR headset, the Oculus Quest 2, has received mixed reactions from users. Some argue that VR headsets do not have to be used for extended periods and can still sell to gamers who enjoy shorter playtimes. Others suggest that there are other compelling use cases such as Demo and Eleven Labs that are yet to be explored. The video advertisements for the headset mostly focus on gaming, which has left some potential buyers uninterested. Users debate the meaning of entertainment, with some believing that it is a distraction, and others believing it is the essence of life. There is some speculation that Apple could lean into the productivity angles of VR and improve the resolution to enable new VR applications. The ultimate goal of VR/AR is said to be replacing every monitor in every office and home; however, this is heavily debated, and opinions vary on whether this is possible or even necessary.- Users discuss the potential for a VR desktop environment with floating windows, 3D tactile widgets and mixed reality integration\n- Some users express interest in a VRChat-like social area on Steam, while others argue for the need for full support of adult content\n- The SimulaVR headset is marketed as a productivity VR headset with a pass-through camera, but review copies are just being made now\n- Users debate the use cases of VR in B2B industries and the potential strain on users to wear a VR headset for extended periods of time\n- Some users argue that VR video games are boring, while others suggest trying out VR sports titles or movies.",

    "content": "How Much Are GitHub Stars Worth to You?Wednesday, May 31st 2023Yassin EldeebAleksandra Sikoraopen-sourceAnnouncing GraphQL Hive, the complete GraphQL API managerThe best and most obvious way to judge an open-source project is to look at the code but this can be kind of tedious and sometimes you don't like what you see there, so an alternative that we have all naturally developed on our own or have been advised to, is to see how many people have starred a project, and then pick the one with the most stars.\"For example, React.js has 207K stars compared to Angular's measly 88K stars, so we can conclude that React.js is a better framework\" \u2014 Ben Awad(opens in a new tab)While the above is a joke (not that React isn't a better frontend framework), it is not a good idea to judge the quality of an open-source project by how many stars it has.How many times have you gazed upon an open source project, and wondered fabulously about the correlation between the number of stars garnered and the actual value of the project?If it's zero, then ok, you're a better person than me.But if not, then allow me to introduce you to my recent experiments and research. It's likely that this will be your first encounter with this bizarre market.Buying GitHub StarsYep! That's a thing. Just as purchasing Instagram likes is a known used marketing technique, buying GitHub stars is equally tangible.But I won't just tell you that buying GitHub stars is real. That would be so disappointing, right?So I did it! I have tried two platforms. I won't say any names or links, as I would never advocate for such a thing.I thought it would be a fascinating and very educational experiment (not for my wallet, though!). So let's dive into it!Premium StarsBear with me. I know that you're thinking: \"what the hell?! There are different star types??!\" Yes, there are!Premium Stars are the kind that is much more expensive, the most legit-looking, and most notably, those stars have a higher chance of staying over the long term.So I put on Incognito mode and started hunting using my second identity \"Boogeyman\".And so it costed me 20 Euros for 25 stars which is \u20ac0.8/star, it's expensive (not if you deduct it from your taxes), but I'm gonna show you how they look like in a minute.It took six hours for my order to complete, and the accounts look legit; each has a profile picture, different companies that they work for, a couple of repositories, and a contribution to one or more open-source projects, next to being a GitHub member for over a year.Cheap Stars\"Whenever you see premium goods, remember, the bargain bin isn't far behind!\" \u2014 Probably meThere are also cheaper options like this one:This package costed me 8.19 Euros for 100 stars which is \u20ac0.08/star.As you can see from the receipt, my order is number #57189, so it's definitely not something that's only used every once in a while \ud83d\ude42.Now, what is the difference?Well, the biggest one is that those are brand new accounts \u2014 they were created at the time of my order.

GitHub detected and banned them.What's crazy is that you can reach out to them , and they are going to redo your order for free \ud83d\ude42Detecting Fake StarsThen I wondered if any tools can expose those repositories \ud83e\udd14And I discovered Astronomer(opens in a new tab), a tool to detect illegitimate stars from bot accounts on GitHub projects.It works by fetching data from every GitHub user who starred a repository and computing how likely it is that those users are real humans. It works using their \"Trust algorithm\".The trust score is computed based on different factors:The average amount of lifetime contributions among stargazersThe average amount of private contributionsThe average amount of public-created issuesThe average amount of publicly authored commitsThe average amount of publicly opened pull requestsThe average amount of public code reviewsThe average weighted contribution score (weighted by making older contributions more trustworthy)Every 5th percentile, from 5 to 95, of the weighted contribution scoreThe average account age \u2014 older ones are more trustworthySo, I've tried Astronomer on three repositories to see the results.Premium Stars:Fetching contributions for 69 users up to year 2013Building trust report...okAverages               Score      Trust--------               -----      -----Weighted contributions:       18268       BPrivate contributions:        370        ACreated issues:           91        ACommits authored:          259        CRepositories:            41        APull requests:            36        ACode reviews:            6         CAccount age (days):         1619       B5th percentile:           12        A10th percentile:           16        C15th percentile:           20        D20th percentile:           20        E25th percentile:           24        E30th percentile:           24        E35th percentile:           24        E40th percentile:           28        E45th percentile:           332        D50th percentile:           1106       B55th percentile:           1692       B60th percentile:           2770       A65th percentile:           6422       A70th percentile:           10958       A75th percentile:           15598       A80th percentile:           26596       A85th percentile:           34116       A90th percentile:           69967       A95th percentile:           85147       A----------------------------------------------------------Overall trust:                     BCheap Stars:Fetching contributions for 24 users up to year 2013Building trust report...okAverages               Score      Trust--------               -----      -----Weighted contributions:       856       EPrivate contributions:        21       ECreated issues:           3        ECommits authored:          87       ERepositories:            4        EPull requests:            3        ECode reviews:            1        EAccount age (days):         36       E5th percentile:           3        D10th percentile:           3        E15th percentile:           3        E20th percentile:           3        E25th percentile:           3        E30th percentile:           3        E35th percentile:           3        E40th percentile:           3        E45th percentile:           3        E50th percentile:           3        E55th percentile:           3        E60th percentile:           3        E65th percentile:           3        E70th percentile:           3        E75th percentile:           3        E80th percentile:           4        E85th percentile:           4        E90th percentile:           4        E95th percentile:           4        E----------------------------------------------------------Overall trust:                    ELegit Stars (as a control check):Fetching contributions for 139 users up to year 2013Building trust report...okAverages               Score      Trust--------               -----      -----Weighted contributions:       118821      APrivate contributions:        2407       ACreated issues:           72        ACommits authored:          1300       ARepositories:            74        APull requests:            101        ACode reviews:            69        AAccount age (days):         2538       A5th percentile:           145        A10th percentile:           711        A15th percentile:           2726       A20th percentile:           4144       A25th percentile:           8535       A30th percentile:           13650       A35th percentile:           20728       A40th percentile:           23322       A45th percentile:           28244       A50th percentile:           37636       A55th percentile:           42536       A60th percentile:           55776       A65th percentile:           78956       A70th percentile:           93676       A75th percentile:           129164      A80th percentile:           194463      A85th percentile:           231380      A90th percentile:           286798      A95th percentile:           559934      A----------------------------------------------------------Overall trust:                     ASo, that's scary. The premium stars scored decently as B, but the cheap ones resulted in the lowest score \u2014 E. Who knows, maybe there's an ultra-premium stars service that's scoring an A?Lessons LearnedAs you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, you shouldn't judge an open-source project by the number of stargazers. As we saw in this article, this is an option that they are not legitimate. It's like any other social media platform where fake accounts and fake likes exist.Instead, ask your colleagues or your community on Twitter why you should pick this project over another. You can also start a new discussion or create an issue on GitHub asking for other people's experiences. And if that's not enough \u2014 you can review the project's code. Though, we all know, that's not something we have time and energy for on a daily basis.Choosing a high-quality open-source project can be a challenging task. However, there are key factors to consider when making such decisions. As The Guild(opens in a new tab)whole structure was created to ship long term open source projects(opens in a new tab), we've also have developed a sense on how to identify good open source projects, based on long-term sustainability and collaborative ideas from everyone involved.We recommend considering the following:Long-term sustainability: Look for projects that demonstrate a commitment to continuous development and maintenance. A good place to start is the contributors tab on GitHub, as it shows you the whole timeline span of a project. For example GraphQL Mesh(opens in a new tab)and GraphQL Codegen(opens in a new tab)are consistantly being worked on for years, Hive is increasing work gradually and consistanly(opens in a new tab), on GraphQL Yoga(opens in a new tab)you can see how it started, then abandoned, and later returned strongly after The Guild took over maintaince from previous maintainers(opens in a new tab)and the Nextra project(opens in a new tab)significantly increased work after we've joined as maintainers for v2(opens in a new tab).Community engagement: Assess the level of community involvement and collaboration within the project. Here you can check out the discussions tab on GitHub(opens in a new tab)or the GitHub community graph(opens in a new tab).Code quality: Evaluate the quality of the codebase, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.Responsiveness: Check how responsive the project maintainers are to issues, pull requests, and community feedback. The pulse tab on GitHub(opens in a new tab)can help with that.Popularity and reputation: Consider the project's reputation within the community, including the number of contributors, stars, and positive reviews.By following these guidelines, you can increase your chances of selecting a high-quality open-source project. At The Guild, we strive to embody these principles(opens in a new tab)in our own work, creating sustainable and impactful solutions for the long term.And, there you have it!Got some seed money for your next startup, and you wonder how to spend them? Throw it into building truly worthwhile projects.

    "hn_content": "Someone went down the path of buying GitHub stars and found that it takes six hours for orders to complete. The accounts that sell their stars look legit, but they use garbage AI-generated PRs and insubstantial docs changes to add surface-level legitimacy to the fake accounts. PR bots and low-effort PRs on GitHub are usually garbage and just spam while others\u00a0contribute to helping the community. Responders to the post debate the ethics, value, and legitimacy of accepting typos and trivial changes in PRs. The practice of purchasing GitHub stars with bots is a way to defeat abuse protection measures with legitimate-looking activity. It is an unfortunate side effect of online marketing, where people have to play the game properly to be successful.Using bots and Tor networks to boost rankings on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter is an old trick, according to comments on Hacker News. However, people still believe that buying likes and views can guarantee success. Reddit's initial user acquisition also involved using bots to inflate \"social proof\". Building a quality product is not enough; marketing and advertising are equally important. Engineers should not assume that a 10% efficiency gain will attract users. Community engagement is critical to a project's success, and developers should prioritize regular commit history, open PRs and discussions when evaluating new open-source packages. GitHub stars may not measure adoption accurately, but they do play a role in project discovery. VC funds are also using GitHub's trending and star lists to find potential investment targets.GitHub stars can be purchased in bulk, leading to inflated numbers and false perceptions of project popularity. Fake stars can be used by fraudsters attempting to gain funding, drive more traffic, or control the direction of a project. GitHub detects fake stars to some extent and may automatically remove them, but premium companies offer undetectable stars. Developers are encouraged to evaluate projects based on things like issue tracking, donation/sponsor information, code quality, and social proof from other trusted community members, rather than relying solely on star count. Companies should provide visibility and ways for their community to contribute and help out, which can include a gateway for donations.GitHub Stars are akin to \"likes\" on other platforms and represent thumbs-up or soft bookmarks used for finding a project later. They signal appreciation or interest in a repo/project and act as a metric for the social networking side of GitHub. Stars, Watches, and Follows combine into an internal SEO on GitHub search contributing to the likelihood of a project being discovered by strangers. Having many Stars has an intangible benefit of being perceived as being more trustworthy of a project, although this does not necessarily reflect the actual value or trustworthiness of the repo. Stars can also act as bookmarks to projects. The receipt ID cited in the post is not an accurate order number, however. The test the author conducted sought to test the validity of GitHub's star metric but ultimately fell short in practicality.",

A recording of the performance, once thought lost, was recently discovered in the New York Public Library.Herb Snitzer/Courtesy of Impulse! RecordsA little over 60 years ago, the editor-in-chief of DownBeat magazine asked John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy a deceptively simple question: What are you trying to do? He rephrased slightly: What are you doing? The two saxophonists sat for a long 30 seconds before Dolphy broke the silence. \"That's a good question,\" he said.The DownBeat editor, Don DeMicheal, printed this exchange in the April 1962 issue, as part of a fascinating article headlined \"John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy Answer the Jazz Critics.\" Regular readers of the magazine would have known precisely what provoked this gesture: a scathing review of Coltrane's quintet with Dolphy, decrying \"an anarchistic course in their music that can but be termed anti-jazz.\"1961 had been a prolific and pivotal year for Coltrane. That spring, his sleek, intriguing quartet version of \"My Favorite Things,\" from The Sound of Music, became a breakout hit. But later that year, as he signed to a new label, Impulse! Records, he wasn't putting a premium on commercial success. Instead, he was exploring new sounds and configurations, often testing ideas on the bandstand. One such idea was the addition of Dolphy, a wildly original voice on both reeds and flute, and a close personal friend.The intrepid depth of their musical rapport takes center stage on a stunning new archival release, Evenings at the Village Gate: John Coltrane with Eric Dolphy, which Impulse will release on July 14. Tomorrow the label will share a preview track, \"Impressions,\" featuring Coltrane on soprano saxophone and Dolphy on alto saxophone and bass clarinet \u2014 along with drummer Elvin Jones, pianist McCoy Tyner and bassist Reggie Workman, who together make the song feel something like a runaway train. (Until then, you can hear it \u2014 exclusively \u2014 here.)\"Any time that we worked with John,\" Workman, who is a few weeks shy of 86, tells NPR, \"you could always hear transition in his music.\" This was maybe never truer than it is here, in a recording made during a month-long residency in late-summer of 1961. Evenings at the Village Gate actually opens with a version of \"My Favorite Things,\" and closes with the droning, polyrhythmic churn of \"Africa.\" Coltrane was in the process of reinventing his language, and by extension the language of jazz.\"He was growing into a place where he did not want to be inhibited by the steps and the changes that were prescribed by certain structures,\" Workman says, adding: \"He wanted us to be about a chant.\"A photo of the marquee at the Village Gate in New York, advertising John Coltrane's performances in the summer of 1961.Herb Snitzer/Courtesy of Impulse! RecordsThe Village Gate was a large basement room with a growing reputation in 1961, home to folksingers and comedy acts as well as artists like Nina Simone. Coltrane worked there in August as part of a triple bill, alongside groups led by drummer Art Blakey and pianist Horace Silver. (A photograph of the club marquee by Herb Snitzer shows Coltrane billed with a quartet, underscoring how recently Dolphy had joined the fray.)The Gate had a state-of-the-art sound system, installed by an ambitious young engineer named Richard Alderson. One night during Coltrane's run, Alderson decided to test the system by capturing the band, using a single RCA ribbon microphone suspended above the stage, with a line running to a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The tapes were never intended for public consumption, and unauthorized in any case, so Alderson set them aside. They found their way to a collection at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, where they were recently rediscovered by a Bob Dylan archivist.Courtesy of Impulse! RecordsFor Coltrane admirers, jazz historians and anyone intrigued by the experimental end of improvisational music, Evenings at the Village Gate will represent not only a welcome new find but also a link in a chain. The Coltrane-and-Dolphy frontline was short-lived, in part because it faced such strong headwinds from the jazz establishment, but it did leave behind a major testament: Coltrane \"Live\" at the Village Vanguard, recorded at a different Greenwich Village club in November 1961, the same month that their unruly output jarred loose the indelible phrase \"anti-jazz.\"Those Village Vanguard tapes, which later yielded a monumental four-disc set, amount to one of the most mysterious and thrilling documents in jazz history. A couple of years ago, Ben Ratliff, author of Coltrane: The Story of a Sound, placed this music within a cultural context of \"ambivalent possibility,\" in a vivid essay for the Washington Post titled \"John Coltrane and the Essence of 1961.\" He observes: \"The music sounds post-heroic and pre-cynical; interestingly free from grandiosity; full of room for the listener to find a place within it and make up their own mind.\"Last week, after hearing the version of \"Impressions\" from Evenings at the Gate, Ratliff elaborated on this idea. \"It's very hard to label or encapsulate, but it's just so ferociously full of life force,\" he said of the performance. \"The musicians know how good this is, and they know how exciting it is \u2014 but beyond that, they don't really know much, and it hasn't been called anything yet. There's a lot of the unknown here.\"What came next for Coltrane was the most stable period of his career, as he solidified the personnel of his quartet \u2014 Tyner, Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison, who can be heard on parts of the Village Vanguard corpus \u2014 and made venerated albums like Crescent, Ballads and A Love Supreme. Parting ways, Dolphy refocused on his own visionary music, making strong statements until his tragically untimely death, of a diabetic coma, in 1964. (Coltrane died only three years later, of liver cancer.) The last several years have brought revelatory archival releases from both saxophonists, but Evenings at the Gate is a window onto the early bloom of their collaboration, when it must have felt like pure possibility to all involved.A photograph of Eric Dolphy (left) and John Coltrane taken by Herb Snitzer during a performance at the Village Gate in New York in 1961.Herb Snitzer/Courtesy of Impulse! RecordsThe 80-minute album \u2014 which will be released in physical formats with illuminating liner essays by Workman, Alderson, Grammy-winning jazz writer Ashley Kahn, and saxophonists Branford Marsalis and Lakecia Benjamin \u2014 seems guaranteed to reignite conversation about an incipient phase in Coltrane's restless evolution. And it's worth recalling part of the answer he finally gave DeMicheal, for the piece in DownBeat.\"I think the main thing a musician would like to do is to give a picture to the listener of the many wonderful things he knows of and senses in the universe,\" Coltrane said, sounding not the least bit defensive. \"That's what music is to me \u2014 it's just another way of saying this is a big, beautiful universe we live in, that's been given to us, and here's an example of just how magnificent and encompassing it is. That's what I would like to do. I think that's one of the greatest things you can do in life, and we all try to do it in some way. The musician's is through his music.\"Eric DolphyJohn Coltrane",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36155204",
    "content": "In the mid-twentieth century, modern art and design represented the liberalism, individualism, dynamic activity, and creative risk possible in a free society. Jackson Pollock\u2019s gestural style, for instance, drew an effective counterpoint to Nazi, and then Soviet, oppression. Modernism, in fact, became a weapon of the Cold War. Both the State Department and the CIA supported exhibitions of American art all over the world.The preeminent Cultural Cold Warrior, Thomas W. Braden, who served as MoMA\u2019s executive secretary from 1948-1949, later joined the CIA in 1950 to supervise its cultural activities. Braden noted, in a Saturday Evening Post article titled \u201cI\u2019m glad the CIA is \u2018immoral\u2019\u201d that American art \u201cwon more acclaim for the U.S. \u2026than John Foster Dulles or Dwight D. Eisenhower could have bought with a hundred speeches.\u201dThe relationship between Modern Art and American diplomacy began during WWII, when the Museum of Modern Art was mobilized for the war effort. MoMA was founded in 1929 by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. A decade later, her son Nelson Rockefeller became president of the Museum. In 1940, while he was still President of MoMA, Rockefeller was appointed the Roosevelt Administration\u2019s Coordinator of Inter-American affairs. He also served as Roosevelt\u2019s Assistant Secretary of State in Latin America.The Museum followed suit. MoMA fulfilled 38 government contracts for cultural materials during the Second World War, and mounted 19 exhibitions of contemporary American painting for the Coordinator\u2019s office, which were exhibited throughout Latin America. (This direct relationship between the avant-garde and the war effort was well suited: The term avant-garde actually began as a French military term to describe vanguard troops advancing into battle.)In the battle for \u201chearts and minds,\u201d modern art was particularly effective. John Hay Whitney, both a president of MoMA and a member of the Whitney Family, which founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, explained that art stood out as a line of national defense, because it could \u201ceducate, inspire, and strengthen the hearts and wills of free men.\u201dWhitney succeeded Rockefeller as President of the Museum of Modern Art in January 1941, so that Nelson could turn his entire attention to his Coordinator duties. Under Whitney, MoMA served as \u201cA Weapon of National Defense.\u201d According to a Museum press release dated February 28, 1941, MoMA would \u201cinaugurate a new program to speed the interchange of the art and culture of this hemisphere among all the twenty-one American republics.\u201d The goal was \u201cPan-Americanism.\u201d A \u201cTraveling Art Caravan\u201d through Latin America \u201cwould do more to bring us together as friends than ten years of commercial and political work.\u201dWhen the War ended, Nelson Rockefeller returned to the Museum, and his Inter-American-Affairs staffers assumed responsibilities for MoMA\u2019s international exhibition program: Ren\u00e9 d\u2019Harnoncourt, who had headed Inter-American\u2019s art division, became the Museum\u2019s vice president in charge of foreign activities. Fellow staffer Porter McCray became the Director of the Museum\u2019s International Program.Modern art was so well aligned with American Cold War foreign policy that McCray took a leave of absence from the Museum in 1951 to work on the Marshall Plan. In 1957, Whitney resigned his position as MoMA\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Trustees to become United States Ambassador to Great Britain. Whitney remained a trustee of the Museum while he was Ambassador, and his successor as Chairman was\u2026 Nelson Rockefeller, who had served as Special Assistant to President Eisenhower for Foreign Affairs until 1955.Georgia O\u2019Keefe colors the landscape around a model of CIA headquartersEven though Modern art and American diplomacy were of a piece, Soviet propaganda asserted that the United States was a \u201cculturally barren\u201d capitalist wasteland. To make the case for American cultural dynamism, the State Department in 1946 spent $49,000 to purchase seventy-nine paintings directly from American Modern artists, and mounted them in a traveling exhibition called \u201cAdvancing American Art.\u201d That exhibition, which made stops in Europe and Latin America, included work from artists such as Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Jacob Lawrence.Despite positive reviews from Paris to Port au Prince, the exhibition stopped short in Czechoslovakia in 1947, because Americans themselves were indignant. Look Magazine fired off an article entitled \u201cYour Money Bought These Paintings.\u201d The Look piece questioned why U.S. tax dollars were being spent on such confusing pieces of art\u2014and wondered if these were paintings even art. Harry Truman took one look at Yasuo Kuniyoshi\u2019s painting Circus Girl Resting, which was included in the exhibit, and said, \u201cIf this is art, I\u2019m a Hottentot.\u201dIn Congress, Republican Representatives John Taber of New York, and Fred Busbey of Illinois worried that some of the artists held Communist sympathies, or engaged in \u201cUn-American Activities.\u201dThe American public\u2019s fear of the Red Menace brought \u201cAdvancing American Art\u201d home early, but it was precisely because Modern art was not universally popular, and was created by artists who openly disdained orthodoxy, that it was such an effective tool in showcasing the fruits of American cultural freedom to anyone looking in from abroad. President Truman personally considered Modern art, \u201cmerely the vaporings of half-baked lazy people.\u201d But he did not declare it degenerate and expel its practitioners to gulags in Siberia. Not only that, abstract expressionism in particular was a direct repudiation of Soviet Socialist Realism. Nelson Rockefeller liked to call it \u201cFree Enterprise Painting.\u201dIn contrast to the Soviet Union\u2019s \u201cPopular Front,\u201d the New Yorker magazine wonderfully, and perfectly, referred to the political role of American Modernism as \u201cThe Unpopular Front.\u201d The very existence of American Modern Art proved to the world that its creators were free to create, whether you liked their work or not.If Advancing American Art proved the nation\u2019s artists were free because they could splatter as much paint as they wanted, it also proved that Congress could not always be induced to spend tax dollars supporting it. Braden later wrote, \u201cthe idea that Congress would have approved many of our projects was about as likely as the John Birch Society\u2019s approving Medicare.\u201d Clearly the State Department wasn\u2019t the right patron for Modern Art. Which brings us to the CIA.In 1947, at the very moment that the Advancing American Art show was being recalled, and the United States Government was selling its O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s for fifty bucks a-piece (all seventy-nine pieces in the show together brought in $5,544), the CIA was being created. The CIA grew out of \u201cWild\u201d Bill Donovan\u2019s Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was the U.S.\u2019s wartime intelligence apparatus. MoMA\u2019s John Hay Whitney and Thomas W. Braden had both been members of the OSS.Their fellow operatives included the poet and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish, the historian and public intellectual Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and the Hollywood director John Ford. By the time the CIA was codified in 1947, clandestine affairs had long been the arena of America\u2019s cultural elite. Now, as museum staffers like Braden joined, the cultural cognoscenti and the CIA fought the Cultural Cold War side by side, with the Whitney Trust acting as a funding conduit.Speaking of front organizations, in 1954, MoMA took over (from the State Department) the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, so that the U.S. could continue to exhibit Modern art abroad without appropriating public funds. (MoMA owned the U.S. pavilion at Venice from 1954 to 1962. It was the only national pavilion at the show that was privately owned.)Eisenhower made MoMA\u2019s role as a government proxy clear in 1954, speaking at the Museum\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary celebration. Eisenhower called Modern art a \u201cPillar of Liberty,\u201d saying:As long as our artists are free to create with sincerity and conviction, there will be healthy controversy and progress in art. How different it is in tyranny. When artists are made the slaves and tools of the state; when artists become the chief propagandists of a cause, progress is arrested and creation and genius are destroyed.It was MoMA\u2019s job, concurred United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, to demonstrate to the rest of the world \u201cboth that we have a cultural life and that we care about it.\u201dThe CIA not only helped finance MoMA\u2019s international exhibitions, it made cultural forays across Europe. In 1950, the Agency created the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), headquartered in Paris. Though it appeared to be an \u201cautonomous association of artists, musicians and writers,\u201d it was in fact a CIA funded project to \u201cpropagate the virtues of western democratic culture.\u201d The CCF operated for 17 years, and, at its peak, \u201chad offices in thirty-five countries, employed dozens of personnel, published over twenty prestige magazines, held art exhibitions, owned a news and features service, organized high-profile international conferences, and rewarded musicians and artists with prizes and public performances.\u201dThe CIA chose to headquarter the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Paris, because that city had long been the capital of European cultural life, and the CCF\u2019s main goal was to convince European intellectuals, who might otherwise be swayed by Soviet propaganda, which suggested that the U.S. was home only to capitalist philistines, that in fact the opposite was true: with Europe weakened by war, it was now the United States that would protect and nurture the western cultural tradition, in the face of Soviet dogma.Braden, writing about his role in the CCF as director of the CIA\u2019s cultural activities, explained in 1967, \u201cin much of Europe in the 1950\u2019s, socialists, people who called themselves \u2018left\u2019\u2014the very people whom many Americans thought no better than Communists\u2014were the only people who gave a damn about fighting Communism.\u201d When the CIA made its bid to the European intelligentsia, the Agency was waging what Braden called \u201cthe battle for Picasso\u2019s mind,\u201d via Jackson Pollock\u2019s art.Accordingly, the CIA bankrolled the Partisan Review, which was the center of the American non-Communist left, carrying enormous cultural prestige in both the U.S. and Europe because of its association with writers like T.S. Eliot and George Orwell. Unsurprisingly, the editor of the Partisan Review was the art critic Clement Greenberg, the most influential arbiter of taste, and the strongest proponent of abstract expressionism in post-war New York.The CCF worked with MoMA to mount 1952\u2019s \u201cMasterpieces of the Twentieth Century\u201d Festival in Paris. The works for the show came from MoMA\u2019s Collection, and \u201cestablished the CCF as a major presence in European cultural life,\u201d as the historian Hugh Wilford wrote in his book The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America.Curator James Johnson Sweeney made sure to note that the works included in the show \u201ccould not have been created . . . by such totalitarian regimes as Nazi Germany or present-day Soviet Russia.\u201d Distilling this message even further in 1954, MoMA\u2019s August Heckscher declared that the museum\u2019s work was \u201crelated to the central struggle of the age\u2014the struggle of freedom against tyranny.\u201dEditors\u2019 Note: An earlier version of this article misquoted President Truman. He considered Modern art \u201cmerely the vaporings of half-baked lazy people,\u201d not \u201cthe vaporizings.\u201d Support JSTOR Daily!

It is a comment section discussing conspiracy theories related to the Vietnam war and government manipulation of art and culture. The commenters reference sources and books for further reading on the subject, with some tangential discussion about sports and the Pinkerton agency.The post does not contain any meaningful content to summarize.The post discusses whether modern art, specifically abstract expressionism, was part of a CIA psyop to combat Soviet propaganda. Some commenters suggest that it was more a matter of funding talented artists who were experimenting with new forms rather than promoting a specific political agenda. Others argue that modern art provides a great tool for money laundering and suggest that it may have been part of the CIA's strategy. Comparisons are made to the popularity of reactive programming and how big companies and governments distort the market and favor whatever happens to be in the right place at the right time to grab that cash. There is also a discussion on the use of provocative headlines that are tendentious or over-sold.- A debated theory suggests that the CIA used funding and promotion to co-opt abstract expressionism in the 1950s and 1960s to promote American culture worldwide.\n- Opponents argue that modern art styles like abstract expressionism were already popular before the CIA's supposed involvement.\n- The web's over-reliance on JavaScript and Facebook's tracking practices are also discussed in the thread.\n- Patronage, fine art, and propaganda have always been intertwined.\n- Some commenters make sarcastic remarks or jokes about the topic, while others offer more nuanced perspectives on the relationships between art, power, and politics.",

    "content": "JUNE 1, 2023Editors' notesSecret industry documents reveal that makers of PFAS 'forever chemicals' covered up their health dangersby University of California, San FranciscoCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public DomainThe chemical industry took a page out of the tobacco playbook when they discovered and suppressed their knowledge of health harms caused by exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), according to an analysis of previously secret industry documents by UC San Francisco (UCSF) researchers.A new paper published May 31, 2023, in Annals of Global Health, examines documents from DuPont and 3M, the largest manufacturers of PFAS. The paper analyzes the tactics the industry used to delay public awareness of PFAS toxicity, and in turn, delay regulations governing their use. PFAS are widely used chemicals in clothing, household goods, and food products, and are highly resistant to breaking down, giving them the name \"forever chemicals.\" They are now ubiquitous in people and the environment.\"These documents reveal clear evidence that the chemical industry knew about the dangers of PFAS and failed to let the public, regulators, and even their own employees know the risks,\" said Tracey J. Woodruff, Ph.D., professor and director of the UCSF Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment (PRHE), a former senior scientist and policy advisor at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and senior author of the paper.This is the first time these PFAS industry documents have been analyzed by scientists using methods designed to expose tobacco industry tactics.Adverse effects had been known for decadesThe secret industry documents were discovered in a lawsuit filed by attorney Robert Bilott, who was the first to successfully sue DuPont for PFAS contamination and whose story was featured in the film, \"Dark Waters.\" Bilott gave the documents, which span 45 years from 1961 to 2006, to producers of the documentary, \"The Devil We Know,\" who donated them to the UCSF Chemical Industry Documents Library.\"Having access to these documents allows us to see what the manufacturers knew and when, but also how polluting industries keep critical public health information private,\" said first author Nadia Gaber, MD, Ph.D., who led the research as a PRHE fellow and is now an emergency medicine resident. \"This research is important to inform policy and move us towards a precautionary rather than reactionary principle of chemical regulation.\"Little was publicly known about the toxicity of PFAS for the first 50 years of their use, the authors stated in the paper, \"The Devil They Knew: Chemical Documents Analysis of Industry Influence on PFAS Science,\" despite the fact that \"industry had multiple studies showing adverse health effects at least 21 years before they were reported in public findings.\"The paper states, \"DuPont had evidence of PFAS toxicity from internal animal and occupational studies that they did not publish in the scientific literature and failed to report their findings to EPA as required under TSCA. These documents were all marked as 'confidential,' and in some cases, industry executives are explicit that they 'wanted this memo destroyed.'\"Suppressing information to protect a productThe paper documents a timeline of what industry knew versus public knowledge, and analyzes strategies the chemical industry used to suppress information or protect their harmful products. Examples include:As early as 1961, according to a company report, Teflon's Chief of Toxicology discovered that Teflon materials had \"the ability to increase the size of the liver of rats at low doses,\" and advised that the chemicals \"be handled 'with extreme care' and that 'contact with the skin should be strictly avoided.'\"According to a 1970 internal memo, DuPont-funded Haskell Laboratory found C8 (one of thousands of PFAS) to be \"highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested.\" And in a 1979 private report for DuPont, Haskell labs found that dogs who were exposed to a single dose of PFOA \"died two days after ingestion.\"In 1980, DuPont and 3M learned that two of eight pregnant employees who had worked in C8 manufacturing gave birth to children with birth defects. The company did not publish the discovery or tell employees about it, and the following year an internal memo stated, \"We know of no evidence of birth defects caused by C-8 at DuPont.\"Despite these and more examples, DuPont reassured its employees in 1980 that C8 \"has a lower toxicity, like table salt.\" Referring to reports of PFAS groundwater contamination near one of DuPont's manufacturing plants, a 1991 press release claimed, \"C-8 has no known toxic or ill health effects in humans at concentration levels detected.\"As media attention to PFAS contamination increased following lawsuits in 1998 and 2002, DuPont emailed the EPA asking, \"We need EPA to quickly (like first thing tomorrow) say the following: That consumer products sold under the Teflon brand are safe and to date there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA.\"In 2004, the EPA fined DuPont for not disclosing their findings on PFOA. The $16.45 million settlement was the largest civil penalty obtained under U.S. environmental statutes at the time. But it was still just a small fraction of DuPont's $1 billion annual revenues from PFOA and C8 in 2005.\"As many countries pursue legal and legislative action to curb PFAS production, we hope they are aided by the timeline of evidence presented in this paper,\" said Woodruff. \"This timeline reveals serious failures in the way the U.S. currently regulates harmful chemicals.\"More information: The Devil They Knew: Chemical Documents Analysis of Industry Influence on PFAS Science, Annals of Global Health(2023).

    "hn_content": "Industry documents reveal that manufacturers of \"forever chemicals\" covered up health risks. DuPont, which in 2015 merged with Dow Chemical to become DowDuPont, was identified as the company causing the health risks, and agreed to pay $16.5m in 2005 to settle claims. As Forever Chemicals are resistant to breaking down they can accumulate in the body, potentially\u00a0increasing the risk of\u00a0cancer and other health disorders.\u00a03M announced earlier this month that it would\u00a0cease production of the chemicals, which are used in items such as non-stick pans and water-resistant clothing and furniture. The decision followed a study that\u00a0revealed presence of PFAS in the water and blood supplies at high levels near military bases.\u00a03M has announced a $110m pre-tax, first-quarter charge relating to an underground chemical dump in Minnesota that contaminated drinking water. The charge will impact GAAP, but not adjusted earnings of at least $2.50 per share in 2019. The contamination resulted from perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used in making Scotchgard fabric and shoe protectant. 3M was among eight companies named in a lawsuit filed by the state in 2010. Several US studies have linked PFAS to kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, hypertension in pregnancy, and reduced fertility. 3M's decision to disband its PFAS business to protect itself from litigation and with the hope of leveraging a $2.3bn tax write-off has stirred controversy online and renewed calls for individual responsibility and personal liability for businesses profiting from harm.Burst Floss is not biodegradable, contains Polyester and Microcrystalline wax and was listed in an article suggesting it had PFAS in it. The floss is packaged in an eco-friendly sustainable case. A user praised the floss's effectiveness and flavor. Many discussion comments related to alternative cookware and greater corporate accountability to address toxicity in products.- Purdue and the Sackler family are responsible for the opioid epidemic by lying about Oxycontin and making billions from it, while only being granted immunity from a portion of their worth in civil lawsuits.\n- Civil asset forfeiture is often used against poor people in the US and should be constitutional.\n- All assets of the Sackler family should be considered as proceeds of an intentional crime and should be seized.\n- China's measures to reduce corruption through strong punishments for fraud and harm should be considered, but the death penalty or life sentences may not be necessary to deter wrongdoing.\n- Markets need strong governments to function, and political movements like \"starving the beast\" only seek to extract more profits from the populace.\n- Chemicals should undergo extensive third-party safety testing before being permitted for use.\n- People are not expected to have adverse health effects if their blood concentration levels of certain chemicals fall below 2 nanograms per milliliter.\n- The slow learning process from past mistakes in allowing harmful substances to be used continues, with the media not holding companies accountable enough.\n- The impact of chemicals on biology and chemistry interactions is hard to control and risky.",
