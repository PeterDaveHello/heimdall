I am getting 95% dict cache hit rate, and use threads with queue locks.Moving to pypy definitely speeded me up a bit. Not as much as I'd hoped, it's probably all about string index into dict and dict management. I may recode into a radix tree. Hard to work out in advance how different it would be: People optimised core datastructs pretty well.Uplift from normal python was trivial. Most dev time spent fixing pip3 for pypy in debian not knowing what apts to load, with a lot of \"stop using pip\" messaging.replydanpalmer 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] Debian is its own worst enemy with things like this. It’s why we eventually moved off it at a previous job, because deploying Python server applications on it was dreadful.I’m sure it’s better if you’re deploying an appliance that you hand off and never touch again, but for evolving modern Python servers it’s not well suited.replygjvc 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes 1000x What is it with them which makes them feel entitled to have special \"dist-packages\" vs \"site-packages\" as is the default? This drives me nuts, when I have a bunch of native packages I want to bundle in our in-house python deployment.

This drives me nuts, when I have a bunch of native packages I want to bundle in our in-house python deployment. CentOS and Ubuntu are vanilla, and only Debian (mind-boggingly) deviates from the well-trodden path.Hi, I'm one of the people that look after this bit of Debian (and it's exactly the same in Ubuntu, FWIW).It's like that to solve a problem (of course, everything has a reason). The idea is that Debian provides a Python that's deeply integrated into Debian packages. But if you want to build your own Python from source, you can. What you build will use site-packages, so it won't have any overlap with Debian's Python.Unfortunately, while this approach was designed to be something all package-managed distributions could do, nobody else has adopted it, and consequently the code to make it work has never been pushed upstream. So, it's left as a Debian/Ubuntu oddity that confuses people. Sorry about that.My recommendations are: 1. If you want more control over your Python than you get from Debian's package-managed python, build your own from source (or use a docker image that does that). 2. Deploy your apps with virtualenvs or system-level containers per app.replykevin_thibedeau 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Dist packages is the right way to handle Python libs. You'd prefer to have the distro package manager clashing with Pip? Never knowing who installed what. Breaking things when updates are made.replyeyegor 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I usually make a venv in ~/.venv and then activate it at the top of any python project. Makes it much easier to deal with dependencies when they're all in one place.replygjvc 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] i am a big fan of .venv/ -- except when it takes ~45 mins to compile the native extension code in question -- then I want it all pre-packaged.replyj0057 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a good idea to be caching sdists and wheels — for resilience against PyPI downtime, for left-pad scenarios, and even just good netiquette — and for packages that don't have a wheel for your environment, you can fairly easily build that wheel yourself and stick it into the cache.replydgroshev 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] At this stage [0], uncompiled native extensions are not yet a bug, but a definite oversight of the maintainer. They should come as precompiled wheels[0]: https://pythonwheels.comreplydoliveira 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Honestly I don't think I've ever used a precompiled package in Python. Every single C stuff seems to take ages and requires all that fun stuff of installing native system dependencies.Edit: skimming through this page, precompiling seems like an afterthought, and the linked packages don't even seem to mention how to integrate third-party libraries. So I guess I can see why it doesn't deliver on its promises.replytoyg 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Probably a function of the specific set of packages you use, or the pip options you specify. Pretty much all the major C packages come as wheels these days.replydoliveira 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They all come as wheels, they just aren't precompiled.replyorf 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can you link one that comes as a wheel but is really a source distribution?replytoyg 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I honestly can't remember the last time I had to compile anything, and I am on Windows.replymartsa1 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Try `--only-binary :all:` to force pip to ignore sdist packages, might help avoid those slow compilations.replydgroshev 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can try pip install pillow for a good example of how it works. I suspect there's a strong survivorship bias here, as you'd only notice the packages that don't ship with wheels.replydoliveira 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, perhaps. One I remember from last year is the cryptography and numpy package, for instance. Now they do seem to ship with binary wheels, at least for my current Python and Linux version.Kerberos and Hadoop stuff obviously still doesn't, though. I guess the joke's on me for being stuck in this stack...replymontecarl 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In order for a wheel to be used instead of a source distribution there needs to be one that matches your environment. For numpy you can take a look at the wheels for their latest release[1]. The filename of a wheel specifies where it can be used. Let's take an example:numpy-1.25.2-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whlThis specifies cpython 3.9, linux, glibc 2.17 or higher, and x86_64 cpu. Looking through the list you will see that the oldest cpython supported is 3.9. So if you are running with an older version of python you will have to build from source.I just learned a bit more about this recently because I could not figure out why PyQt6 would not install on my computer. It turned out my glibc was too old. Finally upgraded from Ubuntu 18.04.[1] https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.25.2/#filesreplysynergy20 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] second this and it's what I do on all Linux distros, just run it inside .venv as the site-installation.if you need extra dependencies that pip can not do well in the .venv case, Conda can help with its own and similar site-based installation.I don't know how it is different in the python installation case between ubuntu and debian, they seem the same to me.replyKingMachiavelli 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] IMO bespoke containers using whatever python package manager makes sense for each project. Or make the leap to Nix(OS) and then still have to force every python project into compliance which can be very easy if the PyPy packages you need are already in the main Nix repo (nixpkgs) or very difficult if depends on a lot of uncommon packages, uses poetry, etc.Since PEP 665 was rejected the Python ecosystem continues to lack a reasonable package manager and the lack of hashed based lock files prevents building on top of the current python project/package managers.replysilon42 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] dist packages are a must for software written in Python that is part of the distribution itself.replysmashed 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You're not really answering why they are important?Is it because .deb packages will install inside dist-packages and when you run pip install as root without a virtual env, it installs inside site-packages?I don't really see how this helps though? Sure you won't get paths to clash between the two but you still have duplicate packages which is probably not what you want..replyrlpb 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Debian ships packages with a coherent dependency structure that crosses language boundaries. You don't need to care what language something is written in to be able to \"apt install\" it. The expectation is that if it \"apt installed\" then it should Just Work because all the required dependencies were also pulled in from Debian at the same time.Debian also tries to ship just one version of everything in a single distribution release to reduce the burden on its maintainers.This is fundamentally at odds with pip. If you've pip installed something, then that'll likely be the latest version of that package, and in the general case won't be the version of the same thing that shipped in the Debian release. If there exist debs that depend on that package and they are shared between pip and debs, now the deb could be using a different version of the dependency than the deb metadata says is acceptable, leading to breakage.Another way of putting this: it shouldn't be possible for you to pip upgrade a dependency that a deb shipped by Debian itself relies upon. Because then you'd creating a Frankenstein system where Debian cannot rely on its own dependencies providing what it expects.This is fixed by having two places where things are installed. One for what the system package manager ships, and one for your own use with pip and whatever you want to do. In this sense, having duplicate packages is actually exactly what you want.replysanderjd 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yep, I screw things up all the time with packages in homebrew that are written in python, when I forget to switch into a virtual env before doing stuff with pip. Debian's solution seems very sensible. And it is the same solution as homebrew, I suppose, as long as you don't interact with any of the homebrew-installed packages via pip. But I find it quite easy to accidentally do that.replytech2 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–]export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=1has been quite helpful in the past as pip then refuses to just install things directly.replyrlpb 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There is https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/ which suggests that in the future this kind of behaviour will be default. I'm not sure of the specifics but I have seen lots of conversation about it in Debian circles.replysanderjd 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Nice!replygjvc 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] OK, but... I get the same problem when I compile python from source. I'm not talking about the distribution's base files. In fact, I am in the business of creating an /opt/gjvc-corp-tools/ prefix with all my packages under there. When I compile python from source on Debian, the resulting installation (from make install) does not have a site-packages directory in-place already. That is what is mind-boggling.replypmontra 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > This is fundamentally at odds with pipIt's at odds with everything. I leave the system versions of any language alone and use language manager tools or docker to be able to run the exact version that any project of my customers require. Asdf is my favorite because it handles nearly everything, even PostgreSQL.replydduong 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Imagine you installed python3-requests (version x.y.z). Some of your distribution's packages depend on that specific package/version.If you pip install requests globally, you just broke a few of your distrib's packages.replyprobably_a_gpt 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I still haven't figured out how to beat this dragon. All suggestions welcome!Dockerreplybashinator 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What distro did you move to? IME debian as a base image for python app containers is also kind of a pain.replybombolo 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It works completely fine in my experience.replysyllogism 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If you have very large dicts, you might find this hash table I wrote for spaCy helpful: https://github.com/explosion/preshed . You need to key the data with 64-bit keys. We use this wrapper around murmurhash for it: https://github.com/explosion/murmurhashThere's no docs so obviously this might not be for you. But the software does work, and is efficient. It's been executed many many millions of times now.replyggm 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm in strings, not 64 bit keys. But thanks, nice to share ideas.replymattip 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > it's probably all about string index into dict and dict managementCool. Is the performance here something you would like to pursue? If so could you open an issue [0] with some kind of reproducer?[0] https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issuesreplyggm 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm thinking about how to demonstrate the problem. I have a large pickle but pickle load/dump times across gc.disable()/gc.enable() really doesn't say much.I need to find out how to instrument the seek/add cost of threads against the shared dict under a lock.My gut feel is that probably if I inlined things instead of calling out to functions I'd shave a bit more too. So saying \"slower than expected\" may be unfair because there's limits to how much you can speed this kind of thing up. Thats why I wondered if alternate datastructures were a better fit.its variable length string indexes into lists/dicts of integer counts. The advantage of a radix trie would be finding the record in semi constant time to the length in bits of the strings, and they do form prefix sets.replysitkack 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] One should really consider using containers in this situation.replyrovr138 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can you describe what in this situation warrants it?I'm very curious about where the line is/should be.reply89vision 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In my experience leaving the system python interpreter the way it was shipped will save you enormous headaches down the road. Anytime I find myself needing additional python packages installed I will almost always at minimum create a virtual env, or ideally a container.replyCyberDildonics 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Uplift from normal python was trivial.By definition if you lift something it is going to go up, but what does this mean?replyggm 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] If you replace your python engine you have to replace your imports.Some engines can't build and deploy all imports.Some engines demand syntactic sugar to do their work. Pypy doesn'treplyreftel 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] I use it at work for a script that parses and analyzes some log files in an unusual format. Wrote a naive parser with a parsing combinator library. It was too slow to be usable with CPython. Tried PyPy and got a 50x speed increase (yes, 50 times faster). Very happy with the results, actually =)replymattip 20 hours ago | parent | next [–] Thanks for the feedback. It does seem like parsing logs and simulations is a sweet spot for PyPyreply_aavaa_ 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Simulations are, at least in my experience, numba’s [0] wheelhouse.[0]: https://numba.pydata.org/replyzzzeek 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] what cpython version and OS was that? I'd be very surprised if modern Python 3.11 has anything an order of magnitude slower like that. things have gotten much faster over the years in cpythonreplymacNchz 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] I put PyPy in production at a previous job, running a pretty high traffic Flask web app. It was quick and pretty straightforward to integrate, and sped up our request timings significantly. Wound up saving us money because server load went down to process the same volume of requests, so we were able to spin down some instances.Haven’t used it in a bit mostly because I’ve been working on projects that haven’t had the same bottleneck, or that rely on incompatible extensions.Thank you for your work on the project!replymattip 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] You're welcome.> that rely on incompatible extensions.Which ones? Is using conda an option, we have more luck getting binary packages into their build pipelines than getting projects to build wheels for PyPIreplymacNchz 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I can't actually remember off of the top of my head, I tried it out a year or two ago but didn't get too far because during profiling it became clear the biggest opportunities for performance improvement in this app were primarily algorithmic/query/io optimizations outside of Python itself, so business-wise it didn't make too much sense, though if it had I think using Conda would have been on the table. We make heavy use of Pandas/Numpy et al, though I know those are largely supported now so I'd guess it was not one of them but something adjacent.replyPaulHoule 22 hours ago | prev | next [–] I use CPython most of the time but PyPy was a real lifesaver when I was doing a project that bridged EMOF and RDF, particularly I was working with moderately sized RDF models (say 10 million triples) with rdflib.With CPython, I was frustrated with how slow it was, and complained about it to the people I was working with, PyPy was a simple upgrade that sped up my code to the point where it was comfortable to work with.replymark_l_watson 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] That is a great idea! I use rdflib frequently and never thought to try it with PyPy. Now I will.replymattip 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Is your group still using it?replyPaulHoule 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That particular code has been retired because after a quite a bit of trying things that weren’t quite right we understood the problem and found a better way to do it. I’m doing the next round of related work (logically modeling XSLT schemas and associated messages in OWL) in Java because there is already a library that almost does was I want.I am still using this library that I wrotehttps://paulhoule.github.io/gastrodon/to visualize RDF data so even if I make my RDF model in Java I am likely to load it up in Python to explore it. I don’t know if they are using PyPy but there is at least one big bank that has people using Gastrodon for the same purpose.replynickpsecurity 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What do you use RDF models for?replyPaulHoule 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So I wrote this libraryhttps://paulhoule.github.io/gastrodon/which makes it very easy to visualize RDF data with Jupyter by turning SPARQL results into data frames.Here are two essays I wrote using ithttps://ontology2.com/essays/LookingForMetadataInAllTheWrong...https://ontology2.com/essays/PropertiesColorsAndThumbnails.h...People often think RDF never caught on but actually there are many standards that are RDF-based such as RSS, XMP, ActivityPub and such that you can work on quite directly with RDF tools.Beyond that I’ve been on a standards committee for ISO 20022 where we’ve figured out, after quite a few years of looking at the problem, how to use RDF and OWL as a master standard for representing messages and schemas in financial messaging. In the project that needed PyPy we were converting a standard represented in EMOF into RDF. Towards the end of last year I figured out the right way to logically model the parts of those messages and the associated schema with OWL. That is on its way of becoming one of those ISO standard documents that unfortunately costs 133 swiss franc. I also figured out that it is possible to do the same for many messages defined with XSLT and I’m expecting to get some work applying this to a major financial standard and I think there will be some source code and a public report on that.Notably the techniques I use address quite a few problems with the way most people use RDF, most notably many RDF users don’t use the tools available to represented ordered collections, a notable example with this makes trouble is in Dublin Core for document (say book) metadata where you can’t represent the order of the authors of a paper which is something the authors usually care about a great deal. XMP adapts the Dublin Core standard enough to solve this problem, but with the techniques I use you can use RDF to do anything any document database can, though some SPARQL extensions would make it easier.replyeigenvalue 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] Thanks for reminding me to look at PyPy again. I usually start all my new Python projects with this block of commands that I keep handy:Create venv and activate it and install packages:python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip python3 -m pip install wheel pip install -r requirements.txt I wanted a similar one-liner that I could use on a fresh Ubuntu machine so I can try out PyPy easily in the same way. After a bit of fiddling, I came up with this monstrosity which should work with both bash and zsh (though I only tested it on zsh):Create venv and activate it and install packages using pyenv/pypy/pip:if [ -d \"$HOME/.pyenv\" ]; then rm -Rf $HOME/.pyenv; fi && \\ curl https://pyenv.run | bash && \\ DEFAULT_SHELL=$(basename \"$SHELL\") && \\ if [ \"$DEFAULT_SHELL\" = \"zsh\" ]; then RC_FILE=~/.zshrc; else RC_FILE=~/.bashrc; fi && \\ if ! grep -q 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"' $RC_FILE; then echo -e '\\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"' >> $RC_FILE; fi && \\ if ! grep -q 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' $RC_FILE; then echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> $RC_FILE; fi && \\ if ! grep -q 'eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"' $RC_FILE; then echo 'eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"' >> $RC_FILE; fi && \\ source $RC_FILE && \\ LATEST_PYPY=$(pyenv install --list | grep -P '^pypy[0-9\\.]*-\\d+\\.\\d+' | grep -v -- '-src' | tail -1) && \\ LATEST_PYPY=$(echo $LATEST_PYPY | tr -d '[:space:]') && \\ echo \"Installing PyPy version: $LATEST_PYPY\" && \\ pyenv install $LATEST_PYPY && \\ pyenv local $LATEST_PYPY && \\ pypy -m venv venv && \\ source venv/bin/activate && \\ pip install --upgrade pip && \\ pip install wheel && \\ pip install -r requirements.txtMaybe others will find it useful.replynicce 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] Just a note; these scrips are not comparable in monstrosity as the first is about to initiate the project when as the second one is to initiate whole PyPy installation.So if you have PyPy already on your machines;pypy -m venv venv && \\ source venv/bin/activate && \\ pip install --upgrade pip && \\ pip install wheel && \\ pip install -r requirements.txtWas not that bad after all, when my initial thought was that do I need all the above to just initiate the project :Dreplyeigenvalue 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's true, but you can run the first block of commands on a brand new Ubuntu installation because regular CPython is installed by default. Whereas you would need to do the whole second block when starting on a fresh machine.replydeizel 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Given you'll want to activate a virtual environment for most Python projects, and projects live in directories.. I find myself constantly reaching for direnv. https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Pythonecho \"layout python\\npip install --upgrade pip pip-tools setuptools wheel\\npip-sync\" > .envrcWhen you CD into a given project, it'll activate the venv, upgrade to non-ancient versions of Pip/etc with support for latest PEPs (ie. `pyproject.toml` support on new Python 3.9 env), verify the latest pinned packages are present.. it's just too useful not to have.direnv stdlibThis command (or this link https://direnv.net/man/direnv-stdlib.1.html) will print many useful functions that can be used in the `.envrc` shell script that is loaded when entering directories, ranging from many languages, to `dotenv` support, to `on_git_branch` for e.g. syncing deps when switching feature branches.Check it out if you haven't.. I've been using it for more years than I can count and being able to CD from a PHP project to a Ruby project to a Python project with ease really helps with context switching.replysaila 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] For a more apples to apples comparison, you would install pypy using your package manager, e.g. apt install pypy3 or brew install pypy3. On Linux, you might have to add a package repo first.replyeigenvalue 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I find that much scarier to do personally since it seems a lot more likely to screw up other stuff on your machine, whereas with pyenv it's all self-contained in the venv. Also using apt packages tends to install a pretty old version.replysmarnach 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, installing a package with apt is not more likely to screw up your machine than installing it manually. Moreover, you seem to be completely fine using the apt-installed CPython, while you think PyPy needs to be installed manually.replystefanor 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If you have a system-level installed pypy, the pypy equivalent is:python3 -m venv -p pypy3 venv source venv/bin/activate python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip python3 -m pip install wheel pip install -r requirements.txtNot very different...replypdw 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] We don't. To be honest, I didn't realize PyPy supported Python 3. I thought it was eternally stuck on Python 2.7.So the good: It apparently now supports Python 3.9? Might want to update your front page, it only mentions Python 3.7.The bad: It only supports Python 3.9, we use newer features throughout our code, so it'd be painful to even try it out.replyeyegor 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] Their docs seem perpetually out of date, but they recently released support for 3.10. I haven't been able to try it recently because our projects use 3.10 features but in the past it was easily a 10-100x speedup as long as all the project's libraries worked.https://downloads.python.org/pypy/replymattip 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It supports Python3.10 now too.

This is also the context for when I bring up PyPy to others.The biggest blocker for me for 'defaulting' to PyPy is a) issues when dealing with CPython extensions and how quite often it ends up being a significant effort to 'port' more complex applications to PyPy b) the muscle memory for typing 'python3' instead of 'pypy3'.replynicce 22 hours ago | parent | next [–] For the b) part, you should consider creating alias for that command, if it really might lead for you to not use it otherwise.replymark_l_watson 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I had the same thought. For years I have aliased ‘p’ for ‘python’ and after reading this thread I will alias ‘pp’ for ‘pypy’.replycpburns2009 19 hours ago | prev | next [–] We use PyPy extensively at my employer, a small online retailer, for the website, internal web apps, ETL processes, and REST API integrations.We use the PyPy provided downloads (Linux x86 64 bit) because it's easier to maintain multiple versions simultaneously on Ubuntu servers. The PyPy PPA does not allow this. I try to keep the various projects using the latest stable version of PyPy as they receive maintenance, and we're currently transitioning from 3.9/v7.3.10 to 3.10/v7.3.12.Thank you for all of the hard work providing a JITed Python!replymattip 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] Cool. Would love to hear more about the successes and problems, or even get a guest blog post on https://www.pypy.org/blog/replyADcorpo 22 hours ago | prev | next [–] This post is a funny coincidence as I tried today to speed-up a CI pipeline running ~10k tests with pytest by switching to pypy.I am still working on it but the main issue is psycopg support for now, as I had to install psycopg2cffi in my test environment, but it will probably prevent me from using pypy for running our test suite, because psycopg2cffi does not have the same features and versions as psycopg2. This means either we switch our prod to pypy, which won't be possible because I am very new in this team and that would be seen as a big, risky change by the others, or we keep in mind the tests do not run using the exact same runtime as production servers (which might cause bugs to go unnoticed and reach production, or failing tests that would otherwise work on a live environment).I think if I ever started a python project right now, I'd probably try and use pypy from the start, since (at least for web development) there does not seem to be any downsides to using it.Anyways, thank you very much for your hard work !replycpburns2009 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] If you use recent versions of PostgreSQL (10+ I believe) you can use psycopg3 [1] which has a pure Python implementation which should be compatible with PyPy.[1]: https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/install.htmlreplyjsmeaton 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Second this - no psycopg2 support and to a lesser extent lxml is a nonstarter and makes it pretty difficult to experiment with on production code bases.

PyPy available through the distro (7.3.9) was making a reasonable speed up, but not phenomenally. Out of curiousity I grabbed the latest version through pyenv (7.3.12) and it looks like some changes between them suddenly had the code sit in a sweet spot with it, I saw a couple of orders of magnitude better performance out of it. Good work.I'm rarely using python in places at work where it would suit it (lots of python usage, but they're more on the order of short run tools), but I'm always looking for chances and always using it for random little personal things.replytwp 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] Yes. We have a legacy Python-based geospatial data processing pipeline. Switching from CPython to PyPy sped it up by a factor of 30x or so, which was extremely helpful.Thank you for your amazing work!replyeigenvalue 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] I do think it would be very useful to have an online tool that lets you paste in your requirements.txt and then tells you which of the libraries have been recently verified to work properly with PyPy without a lot of additional fuss.Also, you might want to flag the libraries that technically \"work\" but still require an extremely long and involved build process. For example, I recently started the process of installing Pandas with pip in a PyPy venv and it was stuck on `Getting requirements to build wheel ...` for a very long time, like 20+ minutes.replyeslaught 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] We use PyPy for performing verification of our software stack [1], and also for profiling tools [2]. The verification tool is basically a complete reimplementation of our main product, and therefore encodes a massive amount of business logic (and therefore difficult to impossible to rewrite in another language). As with other users, we found the switch to PyPy was seamless and provides us with something like a 2.5x speedup out of the box, with (I think) higher speedups in some specific cases.We eventually rewrote the profiler tool in Rust for additional speedups, but as mentioned for the verification engine, it's probably too complicated to ever do that so we really appreciate drop-in tools like PyPy that can speed up our code.[1]: https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/blob/master/tools/l...[2]: https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/blob/master/tools/l...replytgbugs 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] We use pypy3 on musl via gentoo in production to run dataset validation pipelines.

Do you have any numbers about speed vs. an alternative?replytgbugs 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't have anything rigorous, but I can say that I see the usual ~4x speedup when using rdflib to parse large files so that a 20 minute workload in cpython drops to 4 or 5 minutes when run on pypy3.I just reran one of my usual benchmarks and I see 2mins for pypy3 (pypy 7.3.12 python 3.10.12) peak memory usage about 8gigs, 4.8mins for python3.11 (3.11.4) peak memory usage about 3.6gigs (2.4x speedup). On another computer running the exact same workload I see 6.3mins and 19mins (3x speedup) with the same peak memory usage.I don't have any numbers on the dataset pipelines because I never ran them in production on cpython and went straight to pypy3. It is easy for me to switch between the two implementations in this context so I could run a side by side comparison (with the usual caveat that it would be completely non-rigorous).I also have some internal notes related to a project that I didn't list because it isn't public, isn't in production, and the benchmarks were collected quite a while ago, but I see a 4x increase in throughput when pulling large amounts of data from a postgresql database from 20mbps on cpython 3.6 to 80mbps on pypy3.replyghj 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] Copying from an older comment of mine shilling Pypy https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25595590PyPy is pretty well stress-tested by the competitive programming community.https://codeforces.com/contests has around 20-30k participants per contest, with contests happening roughly twice a week. I would say around 10% of them use python, with the vast majority choosing pypy over cpython.I would guesstimate at least 100k lines of pypy is written per week just from these contests. This covers virtually every textbook algorithm you can think of and were automatically graded for correctness/speed/memory. Note that there's no special time multiplier for choosing a slower language, so if you're not within 2x the speed of the equivalent C++, your solution won't pass! (hence the popularity of pypy over cpython)The sheer volume of advanced algorithms executed in pypy gives me huge amount of confidence in it. There was only one instance where I remember a contestant running into a bug with the jit, but it was fixed within a few days after being reported: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/82329?#comment-693711 https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3297.New edit from that previous comment: there's now a Legendary Grandmaster (ELO rating > 3000, ranking 33 out of hundreds of thousands) who almost exclusively use pypy: https://codeforces.com/submissions/conqueror_of_touristreplycool-RR 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] Hi Matti. I'm happy to see that you're doing community outreach. I haven't tried PyPy in a while. The general impression I have about PyPy is that as soon as you try to do anything a little bit complicated, things break in unexpected ways and there's little support. Also, I love using Wing IDE for debugging, and if I'm not mistaken it can't debug PyPy code.I'm currently doing multi-agent reinforcement learning research using RLlib, which is part of Ray. I tried to install a PyPy environment for it. It failed because Ray doesn't provide a wheel for it:Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ray (from versions: none)My hunch is that even Ray did provide that, there would have been some other roadblock that would have prevented me from using PyPy.replywaysa 22 hours ago | prev | next [–] I used PyPy with SymPy when I was helping out a mathematician-friend. SymPy is not exactly fast, a free performance boost was very welcome.replymattip 20 hours ago | parent | next [–] Interesting. I was under the impression PyPy did not do so well with SymPy because the dynamic code paths are difficult to JIT. What kind tasks waw a speed up?replyt90fan 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] I can't remember exactly what the use case was but we used at my old work (Start up providing a Web CDN/WAF type service, think the kind of stuff CloudFlare does nowadays) in ~2013 for some sort of batch processing analytics/billing type job, using MRJob and AWS Elastic Map Reduce over a seriously large data set.The performance of PyPy over CPython saved us loads and loads time and thus $$$s, from what I can recall.replymattip 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] Thanks, that is hopeful, although quite a while ago.replyoxmane 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] At Alooma (https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/company/alooma) we've been running all our integrations with data sources using PyPy. Main motivation was indeed performance gains.FWIW, since I've seen it mentioned, we've also been using psycopg2cffi to access Postgres sources.The product now lives (at least partially) as Datastream on GCP (https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/overview). I'm not sure though if it's still running on PyPy.I could try and connect with the folks still working on it, if you're interested.replymattip 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] Cool. Yes, I am interested in hearing more.replywiz21c 22 hours ago | prev | next [–] I don't use PyPy because when I'm stuck with performance issues, I go to numpy and if it really doesn't work I go to cython/numba (because it means that 99% of my python code continue to work the same, only the 1% that gets optimized is different; if I'd go PyPy, I'd have to check my whole code again). I do mostly computational fluid dynamics.(nevertheless, PyPy is impressive :-) )replyApreche 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] I don’t actually use PyPY, but I’m very aware of it. My understanding is that the only reason to use PyPy instead of the default Python is for performance gains. For the vast majority of projects I work on, the performance of our code on the CPU is almost never the bottleneck. The slowness is always in IO, databases, networks, etc.That said, if I do ever run into a situation where I need my code to perform better, PyPy is high on my list of things to try. It’s nice to know it’s an option.replylsferreira42 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm building a bot detector api to use with our CDN and using pypy was decided on day one, without pypy the performance is just not there.Also in my day job we use pypy in all our python deployments, to be fair until now I thought that everybody would develop in python, test in pypy for an easy speed boost and only got back to python if pypy was slower than cpythonreplyoebs 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm maintaining an internal change-data-capture application that uses a python library to decode mysql binlog and store the change records as json in the data lake (like Debezium). For our most busiest databases a single Cpython process couldn't process the amount of incoming changes in real time (thousands of events per second). It's not something that can be easily parallelized, as the bulk of the work is happening in the binlog decoding library (https://github.com/julien-duponchelle/python-mysql-replicati...).So we've made it configurable to run some instances with Pypy - which was able to work through the data in realtime, i.e. without generating a lag in the data stream. The downside of using pypy was increased memory usage (4-8x) - which isn't really a problem. An actually problem that I didn't really track down was that the test suite (running pytest) was taking 2-3 times longer with Pypy than with CPython.A few months ago I upgraded the system to run with CPython 3.11 and the performance improvements of 10-20% that come with that version now actually allowed us to drop Pypy and only run CPython. Which is more convenient and makes the deployment and configuration less complex.replywg0 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] While the community is here, anyone has embedded pypy as scriptable language for some larger program? Like Inkscape or scripting as part of a rule engine. Or for that, CPython is more suitable?replymattip 20 hours ago | parent | next [–] It is much easier to embed CPython, PyPy can only be embedded via CFFI [0].[0] https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.htmlreplygarashovb 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] David Beazley - PyCon 2012 Keynote Talk (Tinkering with PyPy)https://youtu.be/6_-5XZzJyt0replybtown 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] A sub-question for the folks here: is anyone using the combination of gevent and PyPy for a production application? Or, more generally, other libraries that do deep monkey-patching across the Python standard library?Things like https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/676 and the fix at https://github.com/gevent/gevent/commit/f466ec51ea74755c5bee... indicate to me that there are subtleties on how PyPy's memory management interacts with low-level tweaks like gevent that have relied on often-implicit historical assumptions about memory management timing.Not sure if this is limited to gevent, either - other libraries like Sentry, NewRelic, and OpenTelemetry also have low-level monkey-patched hooks, and it's unclear whether they're low-level enough that they might run into similar issues.For a stack without any monkey-patching I'd be overjoyed to use PyPy - but between gevent and these monitoring tools, practically every project needs at least some monkey-patching, and I think that there's a lack of clarity on how battle-tested PyPy is with tools like these.replybofaGuy 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] My biggest issue is that DataDog doesn’t support PyPy. Out of curiosity, I made a new branch of our app and took out DataDog and observed a significant improvement in performance when using PyPy vs CPython on the same branch (but can’t remember how much).replyofek 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] Do you mean the Python tracing library does not work out-of-the-box?disclaimer: I work there but not on the APM teamreplybofaGuy 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Correct.

Right now we are on 3.11, and unfortunately Pypy is lagging behind.reply_han 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] I didn't hear about PyPy before, but I think you're doing great work.I would be interested in seeing benchmarks where PyPy is compared with more recent versions of CPython. https://www.pypy.org/ currently shows a comparison with CPython 3.7, but recent releases of CPython (3.11+) put a lot of effort into performance which is important to take into account.replyahallan 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] I've used it at work to speed up some standard Python code (without any c-bound library usage). It sped up the code by 5 times.I've deployed used the pypy:3.9 image on docker.One thing I did notice is that it was significantly faster on my local machine vs when I tried to deploy it using an AWS lambda/fargate. I know this is because of virtualization/virtual-cpu, but there was not much I could do to improve it.replywenc 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] I actually donated to the Pypy project in the past but I don’t use it.Two reasons for my hesitation:1) Cpython is fast enough for most things I need to do. The speed improvement from Pypy is either not enough or not necessary.2) Lingering doubts about subtle incompatibility (in terms of library support) that I might have to spend hours getting to the bottom of.I already work long hours and don’t have bandwidth to tinker. With Cpython, although slow, I can be assured is the standard surface that everyone targets, and I can google solutions for.It’s the subtle things that i waste a lot of time on. It’s analogous to an Ubuntu user trying to use Red Hat. They’re both Linuxes but the way things are done are different enough that they trip you up.The only way to get out of this quandary is for Pypy to be a first class citizen. Guido will never endorse this so this means a bunch of us will always have hesitation putting it into production systems.replycomboy 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] A bit meta. It seems like it would be nice to have no-action tickets for open source projects.Quite often you would want to just thank somebody, or say that you would prefer it that way and don't understand why is it this way or it would be cool to have this or that, but of course opening ticket on github feels like wasting time of the maintainer and especially when you have some feedback like e.g. what would you like to see or what you do and don't like it feels entitled because well you can do it yourself, you can fork etc.It would need to be low friction for both sides. Preferably with no way to respond so that there's zero pressure and little time waste for maintainers.Mail feels like you want something, it works for thank you but still feels bad on receiving end when you just ignore them.replymattip 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] You can comment on our blog, or open an issue. Frankly, we get so little feedback that dealing with new issues is not a hassle.replylandtuna 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] I used it in a situation where replacing Python code with a C-implemented module was not efficient because there were too many small objects being marshaled in and out of PyObjects. PyPy let everything stay in Python-land and still run quickly.replyhnfong 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] I use pypy as a drop-in replacement for CPython for some small data crunching scripts of my hobby projects. Might not count as \"real work\", but getting \"free\" speed ups is very nice and I'm very grateful for the PyPy project for providing a performant alternative to CPython.I was close to trying pypy on a production django deployment (which gets ~100k views a month), but given that the tiny AWS EC2 instance we're running it on is memory bound, the increased pypy memory usage made it impractical to do so.replyalfalfasprout 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Years ago, yes I used it.Nowadays, to be honest, everything that I need to be fast in Python is largely around numerical code which either calls out to C/C++ (via numpy or some ML library) or I use numba for. And these are either slower w/ PyPi or won't work.HTTP web servers are notoriously slow in Python (even the fastest ones like falcon) but I found they either didn't play nicely with Pypi or weren't any faster. In large part because if the API does any kind of \"heavy lifting\" they can't be truly concurrent.replyQem 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] I can't really use it at work, due to restrictive corporative policy in place. I don't control my workstation setup, and I'm only allowed vanilla CPython there. Regarding this, I wished PyPy were pip installable from inside CPython, like Hylang and Pyston do.But while programming as a hobby at home, mostly small-scale simulations, PyPy is my default interpreter for Python. It seems PyPy has a sweet spot on code written relying heavily on OOP style, with a lot of method calls and self invocation. I consistently get 8-10x speed improvements.replyjustinc-md 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I used PyPy extensively at a previous employer. The use case was to accelerate an application that was CPU-bound because of serde, which could not be offloaded using multiprocessing. PyPy resulted in a 10x increase in message throughput, and made the project viable in python. Without PyPy, we would have rebuilt the application in Java.replyAqueous 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Can you tell us the obstacles for incorporating learnings from or even backporting the work from PyPi back into CPython?replymattip 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] There is significant cooperation between the two. When porting PyPy to a new Python version, we examine what changes CPython made. And CPython core developers are aware of PyPy. The main obstacle is developer time. CPython has to be very careful about backward compatibility, which includes not making the interpreter slower for a few while faster for many.replyclaytonjy 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] Can someone ELI5 why pypy doesn't or can't work with C-based packages like numpy or psycopg? I know nothing of how pypy does its magic.If we could use pypy, while still using those packages, I think it'd be the go-to interpreter. Why can't pypy optimize everything else, and leave the C stuff as-is?How does pypy handle packages written in other languages, like rust? can I use pypy if I depend on Pydantic?replylapinot 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] Basically afaik the default C API (`Python.h`) is matched to CPython's internal representations, hence it's a pain to support it for alternative implementations and incurs cost penalties. The preferred way to interact with C code in pypy is through cffi (https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and ctypes (which afaik is implemented in pure python on top of cffi in pypy).Numpy being itself written in C and C++ it is strongly tied to the C API and has a complicated build process. Some stuff works and some don't (didn't try recently). If you're invested in numerical python you should most likely not use pypy but go for stuff like cython (like scipy does).For psycopg apparently you can use psycopg2cffi (never tried).> How does pypy handle packages written in other languages, like rust? can I use pypy if I depend on Pydantic?PyO3 supports pypy so everything should be fine.replymattip 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Lots of questions :)For c-extensions see https://www.pypy.org/posts/2018/09/inside-cpyext-why-emulati...We would like to be able to \"just JIT\" better. But for that we need feedback about what is still unreasonably slow, and resources to work on improving it. Right now PyPy is on a shoe-string budget of volunteers.For rust, like CPython, use PyO3, which works with PyPy.I am not sure about Pydantic. Sounds like a topic for someone to investigate on their codebase and tell us how PyPy does.replyideasman42 21 hours ago | prev | next [–] If it was relatively up to date with Python3 I'd use it, but as it lags behind considerably I avoid it, even for personal work.replymattip 20 hours ago | parent | next [–] Python 3.10 is too old for your work?replyideasman42 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In fact no, Python 3.10 is OK new enough.There is still the lag though, Python 3.10 was out for quite a while before PyPy supported 3.10.replyCurriedHautious 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] What is the compatibility of PyPy with a typical web server deployment? I am currently looking at testing compatibility with Tornado -> SQL Alchemy -> psycopg2. It seems like the C-extensions are a common tripping point. I see the recommendation to use psycopg2cffi, but it seems that package's last release was 2019 :(SQL Alchemy actually points to PyPy in its recommendations of things to try in ORM performance. https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/faq/performance.html#resul...replycpburns2009 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] The only compatibility issue for web development I've run into is database drivers.For PostgreSQL, psycopg2 is not supported. psycopg2cffi is largely unmaintained, and the 2.9.0 version in PyPI lacks some newer features of psycopg2: the `psycopg2.sql` module and empty result sets raise a RuntimeError in Python 3.7+. The latest commit in on Github does have these changes [1]. Psycopg 3 [2] and pg8000 [3] (as user tlocke mentioned elsewhere) are viable alternates provided you aren't stuck with older versions of PostgreSQL. I have to continue use psycopg2cffi until I can upgrade an old PostgreSQL 9.4 database.For Microsoft SQL Server, pymssql does not support PyPy [4]. It's under new maintainership so it might gain support in the future. pypyodbc hasn't had any activity since 2022, and no new PyPI release since 2021 [5]. The datatypes returned can differ between libodbc1 versions. On Ubuntu 18.04 in particular: empty string columns are returned as a single space, integer columns are returned as a Decimal. Also, if you encounter a mysterious HY010 error (\"Function sequence error\"), you may need to upgrade libodbc1 to v2.3.7+ from v2.3.4 using the Microsoft repos.[1]: https://github.com/chtd/psycopg2cffi [2]: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg/ [3]: https://pypi.org/project/pg8000/ [4]: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/517 [5]: https://pypi.org/project/pypyodbc/replyCurriedHautious 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Through some back & forth in conda and pip (fighting dependencies), I have been able to get PyPy 3.9 running with my ARM64 Debian system. So far I am seeing a performance decrease up to 2x. I have a series of REST API calls that encapsulate a single DB transaction - a mix of reads and writes. Most of it is leaning on SQL Alchemy, but we have been reaching for psycopg2 for some of the larger insert statements.I was hoping to see some improvement in ORM performance (SQLAlchemy 1.3) - mainly in the bookkeeping side. Currently the app is about 60% Python app wait time and 40% DB wait time. We have a handful noisy areas which emit a lot of statements (Update 1 row at a time, 10000 times via ORM for example).I also tried cProfiler to drill down, but as I've seen in Stack Overflow notes that profiler has a larger impact in PyPy over CPython.replyqeternity 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] We have evaluated PyPy but actually found Pyston to be more performant in most of our use cases (even with extensive JIT warming). That project unfortunately seems unmaintained now, but I am hoping that the improvements will be upstreamed into CPython.replygaryrob 22 hours ago | prev | next [–] I've never ended up using PyPy other than to play with it.

Since the Ops people complained about how long it took to compress the transit feeds (I think London took 10h each time something changed), I migrated everything to Pypy. Back then that was a bit annoying cuz it meant I had to remove numpy as a requirement, but other than that there were few issues. Also it meant we were stuck on 2.7 for quite a while, so long that I hadnt prepared a possible migration to 3.x. The migration happened after I left.

It marks the first time that this has been achieved in an ice stream, where vast amounts of ice slide coastwards. The breakthrough could be critical for understanding and projecting rising sea levels.For seven years, ice core researchers have drilled into the ice sheet in Northeast Greenland from trenches established under the snow-covered surface of the ice sheet. Photo: EGRIPWith a sudden reward of mud at their feet, researchers at the EGRIP research station had successfully made it through the 2670-meter ice sheet last week after seven years of drilling. In doing so, the research group met their ultimate goal of drilling all the way through the ice and to the bedrock below.\"This is the first time that a deep ice core has been drilled through an ice stream, so it will be extremely exciting to analyse the material, which has much to tell us about how our planet’s climate has changed over the past 120,000 years. But we need to wrap up our work here first,\" says Professor Dorthe Dahl-Jensen of the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, who leads research at EGRIP.The mud, which had not seen the light of day for roughly a million years, was only briefly exposed to sunlight, as white light can damage ice core material. Instead, the core was retrieved in red light and immediately packed away, like a Christmas present that will need to remain unopened until some special day down the road.The researchers literally got mud from under the ice cap  on their feet. Photo: Trever Popp, EGRIP\"Though it was tempting to take a closer look, we quickly sealed the ice core, kept it frozen and sent it to Kangerlussuaq Airport, where it is now waiting for a flight to Denmark,\" says Dorthe Dahl-Jensen.Results could change climate modelsDespite the quick packaging and send off, the drilling has already delivered the scientists research \"gold\".Facts about ice coresIce cores contain a wealth of information about past environments, which can be extracted from the ice itself, from impurities in the ice and from bubbles trapped in the ice which contain samples of ancient atmospheres, along with their greenhouse gas contents.With regards to ice core contents, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen has previously stated:\"For example, we can see all of the major volcanic eruptions by measuring the sulphate content in ice cores. We can also see how mercury and metals made it into the air as a result of industrial development. As far back as Roman times, we can clearly see that the content of heavy metals in the atmosphere has increased.\"The first ice cores were drilled exactly seven years ago, on July 21, 2016. The 2020 and 2021 fieldwork seasons were canceled due to COVID.This is the first time that a deep ice core has been drilled through an ice stream. Greenland’s ice streams supply the sea’s surrounding it with nutrients that are important for fishing. Thus, the future of ice streams is also of direct importance to Greenland.\"The results are exceptional. The ice stream flows like a river of ice that tears itself free of the surrounding slow-flowing ice sheet. We can see that the entire 2670-meter-thick mass of ice flows like a block at a speed of 58 meters per year. This will change climate models because it redefines our basic understanding of how ice moves,\" explains Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, who continues:\"The block of ice floats on a layer of wet mud. It seems to act as a kind of layer of quicksand that allows the ice block to flow undisturbed across the bedrock. Near the bottom of the ice sheet, we find rocks and sand embedded in the ice. The measurements also show that the ice is melting at the bottom,\" she says.Towards the base, the ice is more than 120,000 years old and dates back to the last interglacial period, a time when the atmospheric temperature above Greenland was 5°C warmer than today.Last drill got stuckThe last ice core was drilled on July 21, 2023. These final 4 meters of ice were drilled using a rock coring system due to the presence of pebbles in the ice.Chief ice core driller Steffen Bo Hansen of the Niels Bohr Institute was on hand when the breakthrough took place:\"The rock drill became stuck at the bottom and we feared that we would lose both the last core and drill itself. Loosening the drill was tough because it got stuck in the wet mud at the bottom. Fortunately, we succeeded. We have now successfully drilled through the ice stream, and it was amazing to find mud beneath the ice,\" he says.A 2670-meter-long account of Earth's climateAll in all, the ice core is a 2670-meter-long record that tells of how our planet’s climate has changed over the past 120,000 years. It will be analyzed in dozens of laboratories around the world.Due to the ice core’s outstanding quality, the scientists expect to be able to document the climate surrounding the ice during both the warmer and colder periods of the 11,700 years since the last ice age, as well as the anthropogenic changes caused by human development.The last ice core contained rock and mud from the bottom 2670 meters below the ice. Photo Sepp Kipfstuhl, EGRIPAnalyses of the last ice cores will begin in fall, when the research group returns to Copenhagen. The EGRIP ice core is stored in the Danish ice core repository in the Copenhagen suburb Brøndby together with most of the deep Greenland ice cores. Samples from the ice cores drilled the previous years have been analyzed in more than 30 laboratories and the first 53 papers have been published.Facts about the EGRIP camp, new technology and innovation.The EGRIP camp is mobile. The main building, “The Dome”, is on skis, while the rest of the equipment and infrastructure is on sledges. This allows the entire camp to be removed and towed by tracked vehicles to new drilling sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet.Photo: EGRIPA drill trench and science trench were constructed beneath the snow surface by inflating balloons with a diameter of five meters and a length of 45 meters in seven-meter-deep trenches dug into the snow. Snow was then blown over the tops of the balloons. After a few days, the balloons were deflated and removed, after which the trenches were ready for drill operations and ice core analyses.Photo: Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, EGRIPA new electronic navigation package in the Danish made drill made it possible for drillers to control the inclination of the ice core drill and make future replicate coring in the same bore hole possible.Photo: EGRIP TOGGLE TEXT A key to understanding rising sea levelsThe loss of ice from Greenland’s ice sheet is a major contributor to rising sea levels and is expected to increase as temperatures over Greenland edge ever upwards. Half of this ice loss comes from Greenland’s ice streams, whose behavior is still not well understood.Thus, knowledge of how Greenland’s ice streams move is a key to understanding how sea levels will rise in the future and will serve to improve the accuracy of projections.\"I'm thrilled about the success. I’ve followed the flow of ice by measuring the borehole’s shape over the years using a borehole logger. The fact that the ice is not dislodged, but slides as a block over mud, will improve future sea level projections using recalibrated models,\" says Dorthe Dahl-Jensen.About the StudyEGRIP is an international project and includes participants from 12 nations. The contributing nations are Denmark, the United States, Germany, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, China, Canada, France, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Sweden.Logistics are carried out by the University of Copenhagen and the US National Science Foundation. All of the nations have participated in fieldwork and ice core drilling. 40% of the more than 600 field participants have been young scientists trained in EGRIP’s international research environment.Thus far, samples from EGRIP ice cores have been analysed in more than 30 laboratories and an initial 53 articles have been published (https://eastgrip.org/Publications.html).Denmark is EGRIP’s largest partner, accounting for 55% of the project’s budget. The project is supported by the AP Møller Foundation, the Villum Foundation and the University of Copenhagen.Information on the project and field work can be found on the EGRIP homepage and the publications here.ContactDorthe Dahl-Jensen Professor Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen ddj@nbi.ku.dk Telephone (EGRIP): +45 77 34 44 Whatsapp: +45 22 89 45 37Jørgen Peder Steffensen Professor Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen jps@nbi.ku.dk Mobile +45 2035 1558 Phone in Greenland: +299 52 41 25Steffen Bo Hansen Chief driller Niels Bohr Institute University of Copenhagen sbh@nbi.ku.dk Mobile +45 2875 0614Kristian Bjørn-Hansen Journalist and press contact The Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences University of Copenhagen kbh@science.ku.dk + 45 93 51 60 02Topics GEOPHYSICS GREENLAND CLIMATE More stories OCEAN CURRENTS Gloomy climate calculation: Scientists predict a collapse of the Atlantic ocean current to happen mid-century CLIMATE International research team: World's climate plans make for a worrying read VOLCANOES Ancient ice reveals scores of gigantic volcanic eruptions Communication University of Copenhagen Nørregade 10 1165 Copenhagen KContact: Media team medieteam@adm.ku.dkUNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN Management Administration Faculties Departments Research centres Animal hospitals School of Dentistry Libraries Museums CONTACT Map Find an employee Contact UCPH SERVICES Press and media service Merchandise UCPH apps IT-support For suppliers FOR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES KUnetJOB AND CAREER Job portal Alumni EMERGENCIES Emergency response WEB Cookies and privacy policy Accessibility statement Information security CONNECT WITH UCPH",

There is a joke in here about \"why not wait 2 years for the ice to melt off if you wanted to look at the mud underneath?\" But as the article states, \"'This will change climate models because it redefines our basic understanding of how ice moves,' explains Dorthe Dahl-Jensen.\" Much, if not the majority, of climate science is the creation of models (differential equations mostly) that describe the \"response to influence\" of the big chunks of things that cause the climate on the planet. The better the model, the better able we are to guess what will happen next (which is sorely needed in a system where you cannot control the input variables by declaration).One of the big unknowns in the model is \"where will the clouds show up?\" That unknown stems from our understanding of the water capacity of air by temperature, the increase in air temperature leads to the air holding more water, and water is the basis for cloud formation. If the clouds form \"low\" they increase albedo and create colder temperatures, if they form \"high\" they act as a semi-mirrored surface and reflect light that has been reflected from the surface back down for another shot at generating heat.Much of the IPCC's work has been done in MATLAB[1,2] so if you have a reasonably powerful workstation you can play around with various initial conditions and settings yourself to see what might happen in the future.No matter what the far future holds, the near future holds more violent storms as storms are powered by the temperature differentials of the air, land, and sea.It is of note (for me, probably not for many others) that we don't have good models for how an ice age starts. There are a few papers that talk about ice ages being a response to warming (hit a tipping point, generate clouds, and get a \"nuclear winter\" scenario without the nuclear part). But much of the nuclear winter work has been refined and that scenario is generally considered unlikely AFAICT from what people seem to be publishing these days. Turco's work[3] and things that cite it are a good jumping off point if you want to read up on that. It isn't perfect because smoke/soot are not clouds (different albedo numbers, different cooling attributes) but the accumulation and dispersion of atmospheric obstructions is solid stuff.[1] Some code and information used to generate plots in the IPCC reports -- https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Chapter-9[2] Mathworks trying to get you to buy their climate data toolbox -- https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/climate-stress-testing.h...[3] Climate and Smoke: an Appraisal of Nuclear Winter -- https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.11538069replyaeroman 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] As a \"cloud person\", I just want to add a few things to the description of how clouds affect the climate (and why high clouds have a wamring effect).All clouds are white, so they all reflect sunlight back into space (during the day), cooling the Earth.All clouds are (almost) black in the infra-red, meaning the amount of energy they emit in the infra-red is determined by their temperature. Colder clouds emit less energy.Almost all clouds are colder than the surface beneath them, which means they emit less infra-red energy to space than a clear day would. This reduces the amount of energy the Earth emits to space, so warming the climate.High clouds are colder than low clouds, so have a stronger warming effect.In summary:Low clouds - Reflect sunlight (cooling), don't trap much infra-red (little warming)- Net: Cooling effectHigh clouds - Reflect sunlight (cooling), trap lots of infra-red (stronger warming) - Net: Warming effectreplyIlnsk 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I wish I were a cloud person.replyseattle_spring 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This thread likely reads very interestingly for those with the \"Cloud to Butt\" [1] chrome plugin[1] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus...replyInsanity 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] When I read that first sentence, I thought “what has cloud (software) to do with this”replyNevermark 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not series, maybe a bit serious:Cloud computing energy use appears to be on an exponential trend driven by general trends (all things automated), with new forms of automation compounding competitive pressures (deep learning models quickly getting larger, more powerful, more useful, and more versatile in a way erasing many lines holding back past competition.)At some point, it seems inevitable that computing usage will be a first level climate driver, regardless of how green the energy is.Harnessing orbital solar, fission and fusion power, may solve the CO2 energy problem, without requiring us to steal the biosphere's energy needs, but will eventually create a massive waste heat energy problem.Unless we find someway to efficiently transfer mass amounts of heat energy off of Earth.Or we eventually limit computing on Earth, and export that to the Moon and beyond.replybudgi4 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How significant a climate change factor is waste heat energy across all sources currently?replyDiggyJohnson 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I’m so ready to deploy to the EARTH-LUNAR-1 region and backup to JUP-EUROPA-1.replyalmostnormal 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not all water vapor is clouds.

How relevant is energy transport in comparison to the optical effects?Eg: my understanding is that hurricanes are net cooling because they transport heat from the ocean surface to the upper atmosphere.

Any literature on the topic from which I can improve my understand?replyummonk 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What part of it do you doubt? It’s obvious that clouds are white, and it’s obvious that they are cooler than the earth and even colder higher up (clouds form because the adiabatic expansion of rising air cools it down and causes water to condense, and the higher up you go the colder the atmosphere due to greater expansion - anybody who has hiked the mountains has experienced this).The only assertion here that one has to take on faith is that clouds are approximate black bodies at infrared wavelengths (which isn’t surprising - most things tend to be), and the relative magnitude of the cooling vs warming effects. Oh and there is an unstated dependency that the Earth is also an approximate black body at infrared wavelengths.replyaledalgrande 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think the concept of the albedo of the poles is another simple idea that explains why melting poles would be bad and accelerate global warming further, because by being white they reflect back sunlight for a huge area. Kinda intuitive if you have ever touched the black (opposite color) coolers on a desktop computer and felt your hand fryreplysixo 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Granting that the two effects counteract each other, it is surprising that the crossover point would happen within the range of variation of actual clouds on Earth. My uninformed guess would have been that nearly all clouds' effects are dominated by only one of the two effects—probably, by the cooling effect.replyanigbrowl 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] A lot of modeling is moving toward Julia, so if you don't want to give money to Mathworks here are some alternatives: https://juliaclimate.github.io/Notebooks/replyChuckMcM 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have moved all my \"matlab like\" work (mostly signal processing) into Octave for that same reason.replytetris11 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] GNU Octave is surprisingly good.

But the price is just high enough to trigger all sorts of weird management wastes. Especially if you envision wanting more than one installation, or are in an austerity-culture organization.While you're dealing with the time and aggravation of budget approval and recurring license management, I've got my Python and Arduino toolchains installed on literally every computer that I touch: At home, my office, the labs, etc.replyearthscienceman 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You're adding important context but I would like to clarify something to highlight just how complex climate change really is. I also am going to make a few related comments, as I do most of my research on melt in Greenland. Full disclosure: I do know some of the people in this article but I have never been to eGRIP specifically. I will be in Greenland in a week nearby though. No matter what the far future holds, the near future holds more violent storms as storms are powered by the temperature differentials of the air, land, and sea.This is true, sort of. There's a lot nuance needed for this broad statement. In particular, \"Arctic amplification\" means that the pole-to-equator temperature gradient is actually weakening. If you were inclined to believe the covid lab leak theory you would also be inclined to jump on this and say \"then the extreme storms are nonsense\". However, what's really happening is that the waves in the upper atmosphere (\"Rossby waves\") are getting more wave-y. Which is really saying that additional energy from CO2 warming is resulting in stronger transport and more significant variability. It's not resulting in larger gradients. Although sometimes the gradients are also extreme.Climate is a question of two things, time scales and spatial scales. Dumping a bunch of CO2 in the atmosphere messes with both.I also want to point out that this isn't the first time a core has been dug to the bed of the Greenland ice sheet. It's also not the second. Some comments seem to be implying this. I have a bad taste for science reporting/announcements like this that fail to provide context. Of course this is important work but it's following up and improving on several previous deep core drilling experiments. We still have many samples from these previous cores. This is still a very good thing to research and will hopefully provide important new insight. But there is significant previous work it builds on [1]. And the title kind is vague enough that outsiders/the public might not understand that.Also also, to be a little vitriolic, the IPCC Matlab code is a crime against humanity and fuck Mathworks.[1]https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210315165639.h...replysleet_spotter 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Also work on ice, though not with cores. Just 2nd'ing this as being a great point. Arctic amplification is fascinating and IMO understudied relative to its importance.The distinction I believe the article is trying to make around the \"first-core-to-ground\" sentiment, is that this is the first time a core has been drilled through the full thickness of an ice *stream*.

Not sure I'm following the methodology you're suggesting. Most (perhaps all?) of the climate models I've read about or played with are based on energy balance. (energy in vs energy out)Start with Solar insolation (energy in) then subtract all the ways that energy leaves the planet (reflection and radiatively from the atmosphere.) Then add that the planet is its own heat source (molten core and all that) and that energy contribution. Then add variable convection to the atmosphere based on latitude. The list goes on and on (which is kind of like harmonics in a Fourier series).Then random things pop out like how reducing the weight of ice (by melting) increases volcanic activity kinds of things.replysgirard 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Interesting: \"Towards the base, the ice is more than 120,000 years old and dates back to the last interglacial period, a time when the atmospheric temperature above Greenland was 5°C warmer than today.\"replythomasahle 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] See also this timeline of the last four inter-glacial periods: https://co2coalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/104-4000...It also shows how crazy it would be if we get the projected 2-3 degrees average temperature increase.

These dynamic realities cannot be flattened in to any standard two dimensional representations even today, yet often emanate from or are disturbed by the often-tiny landmasses they would specify as origin, destination or reference points within the navigation problem. In the same way modern navigation uses multi-layered systems like bathymetric maps, local depth sensors, RADAR, GPS and navigation lights to provide orientation and safe passage amongst static and dynamic obstacles, so too the traditional navigators combined layers of sensory input considered too subtle for modern systems yet potentially equally effective in their place and season.replydetourdog 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Probably the migratory patterns were as import at as any other reason to travel.What I seem to be noticing is that the ancients used calculus all the time but it was the geometric tools that they used.This gave technology a form.Arabic numerals made tabular data more useful leading to the more number based tools.This seems to have removed the form from technology.replyrenegade-otter 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Maybe humans become more developed because it got colder?

They were physically there to do the drilling (as opposed to giant automated core drillers such as DISC[1], which don't require \"boots on the ground\" so much as they just require one or more operators to oversee operation)The ancient mud's from hauling up the ice cores, not from standing 3 kilometers deep in a giant hole.[1] https://icedrill.org/equipment/deep-ice-sheet-coring-drillreplytokai 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That mud came up with the last core.replyGiorgi 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why is is black and white though? also - how do they transfer energy to drill down 2.7km? or how the hell does it work?replytgamma 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As mentioned in the article, the core was handled under red light to prevent any potential damage.

(More complications arise as and how you get deeper into the ice).replydtgriscom 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can't have a continuous line of ice coming up, unless you're digging for slush. Each intact X-meter core must be hauled up on its own, and then the drill has to go back down. The deeper you are, the longer it takes to haul up one core and send the drill back down. So, retrieving the cores is clearly O(N^2).Drilling the core itself is O(N), but as you go deeper the core retrieval dominates. Not to mention everything getting more complex the deeper you go.replymywittyname 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Like fetching the n-th element from a linked list by starting at the first node.replyaltacc 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's not a continuous 24/7/365 process.

Despite constant interaction between people and all other species of viral host all over the globe, and millions of brand new new virus exposures daily, jumps are still so rare that they are decade-defining when they happen.1. https://virology.ws/2013/09/06/how-many-viruses-on-earth/2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427559/replyArchelaos 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Here is an article from 2021 that covers that topic:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42398-021-00184-8From the conclusions: \"... as shown by recent outbreaks of diseases caused by supposed to be extinct microbial pathogens immured in glacial ice for centuries, there is a serious risk for future epidemics (or even pandemics) to happen more often.\"replyClamchop 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I read a book, How to Clone a Mammoth, by ancient DNA researcher Beth Shapiro.If what she wrote holds true deep in these glaciers (which take a long time to form so they presumably weren't always buried so deep), then the answer to what the risk may be is \"very remote\".

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP SCIENCE NASA mistakenly severs communication to Voyager 2 110Thankfully the probe regularly phones home to fix this sort of mess Laura Dobberstein Mon 31 Jul 2023 // 05:59 UTCNASA revealed on Friday that its venerable Voyager 2 probe is currently incommunicado, because the space agency pointed its antenna in the wrong direction.By the time the news was released, the antenna on the spacecraft had been pointing two degrees away from the Earth for over a week.This left it without the ability to receive commands or transmit data to antennae operated by the Deep Space Network (DSN).NASA reckons the situation is temporary and will not end the probe's nearly 46-year stint in space as it is programmed to recalibrate its position a few times a year. October 15 is the next scheduled reset.The space org added that Voyager 2's trajectory is expected to remain unchanged. The probe is currently around 32 billion kilometers from Earth, and gets 15km further away every second. The glitch does not impact Voyager 1, which is currently almost 24 billion clicks away from Earth and hurtling along at 17km/sec while staying in touch with home.Voyager 2's electrical systems were tweaked earlier this year, in the hope of extending its working life.NASA tweaks Voyager 2's power supply to avoid another sensor shutdown Square Kilometre Array Observatory construction commences Voyager 1 data corrupted by onboard computer that 'stopped working years ago' How did ESA's gamma ray-spotting 'scope make it to 20? They totally overdid itIf that procedure produces good results, a similar adjustment to Voyager 1 is on the cards.In 2022, Voyager 1 also experienced telemetry woes. Scientist found it sent back garbled information to Mission Control. It transpired that data was being routed incorrectly by a computer that had not worked for years.Engineers at that time performed \"telesurgery\" to correct the issue, which essentially meant commanding the attitude articulation and control system (AACS) to resume sending the data to the right computer. And so the probe carried on.In the past, engineers have compared keeping the probes operational to keeping an old car running. The tech is severely outdated, yet it keeps ticking over – a trend often seen in the spacecraft of past decades.But while old cars can be lovingly worked on by hand in real time, the Voyagers are over 20 light hours from Earth, and communication crawls along at a tedious 160 bits per second. ®Sponsored: Curbing the cost of cloud analytics and data warehousing More about NASA Space Voyager More like these 110COMMENTS TIP US OFFSend us newsOther stories you might like NASA awards $150 million to prototype tech for humans on the Moon, and above it Inflatable heat shields, robot cable layers, and a furnace to burn lunar dust for minerals and oxygen SCIENCE 6 days | 19 NASA, DARPA enlist Lockheed to build nuclear-powered spacecraft Hey, at least this one isn't an actual bomb SCIENCE 5 days | 14 To infinity and beyond, with a swarm of tiny computers costing under $1K each BLISS this: Berkeley Low-cost Interplanetary Solar Sail project wants to head into space on the cheap OSES 6 days | 10 Innovation unlocks new value of data Huawei solutions transform mission-critical FSI scenarios SPONSORED FEATURE NASA to store pair of probes it's built but can’t send to target asteroids Janus asteroid sats headed for That Box Full Of Old Tech You Should Probably Have Thrown Out But Kept Just In Case SCIENCE 19 days | 26 Farewell, Aeolus: Doomed ESA weather sat reenters atmosphere over Antarctica VIDEO Not quite a controlled deorbit but not an uncontrolled one, either SCIENCE 6 hrs | 3 Satnav for the Moon could benefit from Fibonacci’s expertise Middle Ages maths to the rescue SCIENCE 1 day | 16 Amazon sets up shop at Kennedy Space Center to prep Kuiper broadband satellites Web super-biz dreams of lobbing 3,000-plus internet-relay birds into orbit NETWORKS 10 days | 25 NASA's DART kicked up swarm of 37 boulders after Dimorphos asteroid crash Hubble Space Telescope managed to capture 'some of the faintest things ever imaged inside our solar system' SCIENCE 11 days | 9 James Webb spots water vapor in rocky planet-forming disk Turns out proto-Earths may bring their own drinks SCIENCE 7 days | 6 Rocket Lab wants to dry off and reuse Electron booster recovered from the ocean Appears to have given up the idea of catching the component midair with a helicopter SCIENCE 13 days | 16 NASA humanoid robot to be tested as remote oil rig attendant Doing the dirty work for Australia's Woodside Energy will help prepare bot for work in space SCIENCE 22 days | 9The RegisterBiting the hand that feeds ITAbout Us Contact us Advertise with us Who we are Our Websites The Next Platform DevClass Blocks and Files Your Privacy Cookies Policy Privacy Policy T's & C's Do not sell my personal informationCopyright.

I think a sextant was useful.Second order calculations use careful analysis of the signal pattern in telemetry data- IIRC you can see a slow stretch of the phase which can be used to estimate distance and velocity with high accuracy.Voyager, along with Apollo, stand as the finest examples of human engineering done yet- we got a bunch of people to the moon and back, and built a probe that still operates 50 years later... farther than anything else humans have launched...

The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the probe from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.replymcguire 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ok, what is this quote from?replywizofaus 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] https://web.archive.org/web/20031218192524/http://w3.uwyo.ed...replywholinator2 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Wait, i don't understand.

Actually, this failure is inert if the cruise control is OFF when it happens. Contrived example but you get the idea ...I have seen a lot of FMEDA (and other tool) use lately to combat concerns with cascading failure, but not sure what's currently standard at NASA or how they deal with this.

The dish is the usual mechanism for comms but in an emergency such as this they would send commands to the other antenna. To do this they would turn the main tracking station dish up to max, and send a \"TURN AROUND!\" signal out.But prior to that they had to alert the local electricity grid, and the local air traffic control to not have any planes flying over at the time!I guess the Voyagers are too far away for this manoeuvre now.replybehnamoh 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sometimes we don’t give enough credit to previous generations.replydetourdog 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I only give credit to previous generations.

It’s because — in that specific scenario — losing my phone would cost me so much and the chance of it happening is much more likely.Space companies spend a little extra because the cost is years of development and billions of dollar evaporating in a few seconds.And there are software teams in certain industries that dot their I’s and cross their T’s as well.Even on some dumb CRUD app, if it’s a critical piece of code that the rest of the software hinges upon, you spend a little extra time because the cost of fuck up is so major.Or you’re launching a product and you have a sign up that will seed your user base, you damn well make sure it works.replybilalq 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't understand why this dig is constantly taken at software.

I worked for a company that mainly did electrical engineering, and there was plenty of happy-path work that just assumed the error cases would happen rarely or be handled somewhere else. It was also quite difficult to get good change control working, and automated testing was painful and irregular. (In fairness, automated testing was also a lot harder, but we could have worked harder on it and caught a lot more issues early on.)My impression from friends working in other engineering disciplines is that software engineering works similarly to other fields: the more risk to human lives is involved, the more testing, redundancy, etc is involved.replyfnord77 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] OceanGatereplydfex 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think it comes down to to a couple of things that software doesn't have that most other disciplines do:Standardisation - in the big 'E' Engineering world, there would be a recognised international standard for Web Apps that ensured/enforced that all Web Apps supported this functionality, or they would not be approved for use.Another factor is Accountability. A senior Software 'Engineer' would have to take personal responsibility (liability, accountability) that the software product they are producing and/or overseeing met all these requirements and personally sign off that these standards have been met. If the product were to fail at any point and it was determined that the cause was negligence in following the standard, any damages sought (not common, but not unheard of) would ultimately find their way to the accountable individual and their insurance.In cases where budgets/importance don't allow for this level of scrutiny, there would still be paperwork signed by the producer of the software and the client acknowledging deviation from the standard and waiving any recourse for doing so.replyEnginerrrd 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree with this 100%.replyfnord77 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Standardisationthere is totally standardization.

Wow - I'm not sure which country you live in, but there are probably as many safety standards for road vehicles as there are for planes!To continue the analogy from earlier - standards wouldn't mean all web applications would have to be designed, programmed and work exactly the same way, but it would mean that they would need to be formally tested (to an approved test plan), and to use your example, would need to demonstrate that each of those layers of fallbacks (as dictated by the standard and covered in the test plan) operate correctly in order to be certified.If anything, I think software has a huge advantage over physical world engineering in that testing can be replicated at virtually no cost whenever a change is made to the design.

In the physical world, software is part of an overall system that needs to be considered holistically. Most major safety-critical mishaps are the result of several failures, often across different domains.In the case of the 737MAX, the software was a design around a physical constraint; that doesn't mean the software doesn't matter.

It would however likely be a less stressful way to work (building fire-proof code rather than putting fires out all the time), and rather more satisfying. As an engineer of any sort I think it's perfectly reasonable and justifiable to want to produce something of quality even if it takes longer and the consequences probably won't be that terrible if you just release the first thing you can slap together.

So the sun will be 160.7^2 = 25824.5 times fainter for Voyager 2 than it is from Earth. (Since Earth is at 1AU)The apparent magnitude of the sun from Earth is -26.72. Each step in magnitude is multiplying by 2.512. (2.512^5 = 100, so 5 steps of magnitude is a factor of 100).log2.512(25824.5) = 11.0295.11.0295 + -26.72 = -15.6905.The apparent magnitude of the full moon is only −12.74 (lower is brighter).

So really it just needs to point at the Sun anymore.The carrier signal from Earth is also powerful on a particular frequency and polarization. While there's definitely noise at the receiver it's looking for a very specific signal so can filter out everything it's not expecting.

(Which the sources I can find give at ~100km/s.)replyohthehugemanate 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] honestly I was just shooting for easy round numbers. \"More than 43x the speed of sound\" doesn't have the same ring to it. And besides, as we all know \"technically correct is the best kind of correct!\" :)replyonetimeuse92304 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So what was wrong about \"40 times the speed of sound\"?Also, I don't particularly like the speed of sound for this comparison. Most people think of speed of sound as speed of sound at about sea level pressure, in gas composed of around 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen and at roughly 25C temperatures. But the speed of sound is highly dependant on the medium and its temperature and pressure. There actually can be sound waves in space (pressure waves in interstellar gas resulting from various astronomic phenomena) and they propagate at very wide range of speeds, typically somewhere between 10 and 100km/s.The main reason to use \"speed of sound\" is because important things change when objects travel at little below or above speed of sound in the medium they are in. But this is only useful in relation to the actual medium the object travels through.One place where it trips people up is when they are talking high altitude airplanes or rocketry. They are talking about something traveling at \"X Mach\", or \"X times the speed of sound\" and then I try to figure out if they mean X in relation to the speed of sound up there or the speed of sound at sea level. Just a nightmare trying to use it to convey speeds even within confines of our atmosphere.replybluejekyll 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] A nice feature of using the speed-of-sound as a measurement unit is that people know how difficult it is for aircraft to achieve it. So it makes it clear how much faster these things are going. We don’t have anything comparable between the speed-of-sound and the speed-of-light, do we? I suppose you could use escape-velocity, that isn’t something as many people know, but does I guess get you closer to the speeds in question.replyilyt 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > A nice feature of using the speed-of-sound as a measurement unit is that people know how difficult it is for aircraft to achieve it.But it's not aircraft ?

Initially spelled assoccer, it was later reduced to the modern spelling.“Football” almost always means soccer (association football) in the UK, but there are also things like rugby football and Gaelic football.Edit to add: you need to disambiguate when other forms of football are popular (eg at Oxford university) but these days soccer is the most popular sport by a huge margin.replyvinay427 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you ignore much of the majority English-speaking world, then yes, that would be accurate.https://brilliantmaps.com/football-vs-soccer/replyeddieroger 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Kind of tangential, but I've been watching a lot of original Star Trek recently, so I was curious about how far this was in lightyears, probably because of the Enterprise's proclivity to run in to Voyager.If it's 15 billion miles away (sorry for my Freedom Units), it is 22 light-hours away, or 0.0026 light years away (unless my Google-fu is way off). If we could move at the speed of light, which we can't, it would still take nearly a day to get there. So if we were on the Enterprise moving at Warp 1, it would take a day to get there and reorient it back towards Earth. If we could move at Warp 10, we'd have already been there and fixed it.replykridsdale3 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] 22 hours is assuming you only wanted to reach that location (and not stop to visit the craft) and you had instant acceleration up to c for your velocity, which would be infinite G forces and turn your cells in to quantum foam.More realistically, even if say we did have a light speed capable craft, we'd be limited by the forces for accel and decel to have a starting speed of 0 relative to Earth, and ending speed of 0 relative to Voyager. The limits would be determined by the withstanding capability of the bodies of the pilots, or the mechanical strength if it were another drone.I don't feel like doing the math properly, so I asked GPT4 this question:> let's say we wanted to move a human astronought in a spacecraft to the current position of Voyager 2 which is 22 light-hours away. We want to get there as fast as possible, and arrive at a co-moving frame with Voyager, which has a relative velocity of 32000 miles per hour moving away from the Earth. Assuming the astronaut can withstand a g-force maximum on their body of 6G, and using that to inform the maximum accelleration and deceleration for the voyage, how long does it take to reach the Voyager 2 co-moving frame?Response:Firstly, let's convert everything to consistent units. Here we'll use hours for time, miles for distance, and miles per hour^2 for acceleration.1 G is approximately equal to 22 miles/hour^2. Therefore, 6G is approximately 132 miles/hour^2. The distance to Voyager 2 in miles is 22 light-hours * 670616629 miles/light-hour = approximately 14753561838 miles.Assuming we accelerate at 6G until halfway, then decelerate at 6G for the second half, we can use the kinematic equation:d = 0.5 * a * t^2Solving for t when d equals half the total distance gives:t = sqrt((2 * d) / a)Substituting in the values:t = sqrt((2 * (14753561838 miles / 2)) / 132 miles/hour^2) = 84331.5 hoursSo, the total time to reach Voyager 2 while maintaining a maximum acceleration/deceleration of 6G is approximately 84331.5 hours * 2 = 168663 hours, or about 19.25 years.This is a rough estimation and doesn't take into account the relative velocity of Voyager 2 or relativistic effects at high speeds.It also assumes constant acceleration and deceleration, which wouldn't be feasible with today's technology due to fuel constraints.-------------So our 22 hour lightspeed trip would still take 19 years if it had a human onboard.The biggest limitation with sci-fi travel isn't breaking relativity, it's finding a way to accelerate squishy meat-bags. This person will be living at an effective weight of nearly 1000lbs for 20 years, which will really mess them up.For the sake of the longevity of our pilot, I asked to re-run the calculation limiting the on-board gravity to 1G. It now takes 114 years to reach Voyager's current position, which by then will be much farther. It turns out we will never catch up, and reaching it is impossible if we limit our craft to earth like conditions necessary for human health.replyDylan16807 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Stop making the chatbot do math.And come on, you can sanity check those numbers.\"1 G is approximately equal to 22 miles/hour^2.\"Think about this. That means it would take you an hour to reach 22mph.The real speed you'll be going is 22 miles per second.And sqrt(14753561838 / 132) is 10572, not 84331. That's not even close.Also it used the Voyager 1 distance which is significantly different.Once we fix all the numbers, each half of the trip is sqrt(20 billion km / 60m/s^2) which is a week. So two weeks total.At 1G, each half is 16.4 days, so it takes a month total.replyfennecfoxy 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Apparently 32 billion km is about 29.65 light hours, so to catch up we'd need a magical massless spacecraft to travel at the speed of light for a bit over a day to reach it. Hopefully that demonstrates how utterly infeasible it would be to reach it.It's also near the end of its usable life so it wouldn't be worth it anyway.And actually, according to https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/ it's actually 19,936,472,690 km from Earth so I think like 20ish light hours or so.replykridsdale3 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Wolfram Alpha just told me that it's 800,000 laps around Earth's equator away.

Little or cheap, definitely not. Both Voyager probes relied on a unique alignment of the planets in the outer solar system that allowed them to get a series of speed boosts using gravity assists from the gas giants. If we wanted to launch a rocket anytime in the near future that would be able to catch up with Voyager 2 we'd probably have to rely on good old fashioned brute force (rocket power). But then if you want the rocket to catch up in the next thousand years it's going to need REALLY big ass rockets to catch up with Voyager... and if you want it to rendezvous with Voyager instead of just zipping past, it will need to haul more rockets all the way out to Voyager so it can slow down and match speeds (which means even bigger rockets to launch from earth, etc.).tl;dr - space is big and the rocket equation is brutal.replythrowaway2990 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] About 30,000 AR15 lengths per second.reply__alexs 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Since the muzzle velocity (1km/s) of an AR15 is about 1/15th the speed of Voyager (15km/s), if you had a matryoshka doll of AR15s that could fire other AR15s you would only need 15 nested AR15s to shoot a bullet as fast Voyager is travelling.replyjjk166 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Note that this is actually how multi-stage rockets work.replyRebelgecko 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In Russian, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky famously described the \"tyranny of the Kalashnikov equation\"reply__alexs 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Are multi stage bullets a thing?replyhans_castorp 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I gets 2 poronkusema further away every secondreplyzichy 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Not sure if you are trolling.replyqingcharles 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm think GP means we could launch a rocket to the place where Voyager thinks Earth is supposed to be (where its antenna is pointing towards) and fire off a signal to tell it to move.replykamaal 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] >>and gets 15km further away every second>>I beg anybody to rephrase it understandingly with using some units similar to football fields.More like it can go from Earth to Moon in like 8 hours(or so).reply 156 more comments...",

One part of our work is to establish a BBC presence in the distributed collection of social networks known as the Fediverse, a collection of social media applications all linked together by common protocols. The most common software used in this area is Mastodon, a Twitter-like social networking service with around 2 million active monthly users. We are now running an experimental BBC Mastodon server at https://social.bbc where you can follow some of the BBC’s social media accounts, including BBC R&D, Radio 4 and 5 Live. We hope to be able to add more accounts from other areas of the BBC at some point.BBC social media accounts on Mastodon:@BBCRD@social.bbc@BBC5Live@social.bbc@BBCRadio4@social.bbc@BBCTaster@social.bbc@Connected_Studio@social.bbc@BBC_News_Labs@social.bbcMastodon and the FediverseMastodon is a “federated” social network. Federated social networks aren’t controlled by one organisation, federation means that anyone can run a server and host users and each server can offer its own moderation and membership rules, but all the servers can connect to each other. This model is more like email where you can email anyone, but as an individual, you choose which email provider you want to use.Federated social networks, or the Fediverse, offer a model for future development that aligns with our own work to support a public service internet and our previous work on decentralised data. The principles of the Fediverse, with an emphasis on local control, quality content, and social value, are far more aligned with our public purposes than those of avowedly commercial networks like Threads or Twitter. Other public service and non-profit organisations already have a presence there, from the Dutch government to Wikimedia to the EU.We've set up a Mastodon server for the BBC to publish content in the Fediverse. Initially, our server hosts this selection of BBC social media accounts, where we’ll be publishing content just like we do on other social platforms:@BBCRD@social.bbc@BBC5Live@social.bbc@BBCRadio4@social.bbc@BBCTaster@social.bbc@Connected_Studio@social.bbc@BBC_News_Labs@social.bbcUnlike most Mastodon servers where you can sign up for a personal account, we're only using this instance to host BBC accounts; it’s a place for us to publish in the Fediverse. If you have a Mastodon (or other ActivityPub) account from another server, then you can easily follow our accounts.We're using social.bbc as the domain, so you can be sure these accounts are genuinely from the BBC. And by linking to and from the BBC’s website, we have verified our identity on Mastodon.ChallengesAs a large, high profile, public service organisation, we've had to work through a fair number of issues to get this far and we’ve had advice and support from several teams across the BBC.Explaining the federated model can be a challenge as people are much more familiar with the centralised model of ownership. We’ve had to answer questions like “Are we running our own social network?” (well, we’re kind of hosting a small section of a social network) and “Are we hosting a user’s content?” (well, we don’t allow users to create accounts or post from our server, but they can reply to our posts from their own servers, and then their posts will appear next to ours and then they might be stored on our server and it all gets quite complicated).The latter question leads on to moderation. Although we will only host BBC accounts, there will be replies from other people to our posts. What is our responsibility for moderation here? When the BBC hosts comments on our own website, as on some of our news and sports stories, we moderate these according to our guidelines. Where we post on third-party social media platforms we will keep an eye on any replies and take appropriate action where necessary (such as reporting a comment to the third-party) but we also expect the third-party to have some centralised moderation in place. Because it is a decentralised service, there is no central Mastodon moderation team that we can point to, instead all Mastodon servers are responsible for their own moderation. Mastodon allows the administrators to add a content warning, remove posts, or even block all posts from another server, and many instances are effective in moderating troublesome content from their users. We think this is an acceptable risk and will apply the BBC’s social media moderation rules to any replies to our posts where we can.You might be able to see from the above why we chose to make this a BBC-only server and not host user accounts.An experimentThis is an experiment - we will run it for 6 months and then decide whether and how to continue.We aim to learn how much value it has provided and how much work and cost is involved. Does it reach enough people for the effort we need to put in? Are there risks or benefits from the federated model, with no centralised rules or moderation and no filtering or sorting algorithms? We're learning as we go, and we'll write about what we discover in the hope that it might be useful for others. The BBC will continue its other social media activity in the usual places.Looking ahead, could we move beyond Mastodon to other ActivityPub applications for publishing content? And would this provide us with some insulation from the risks that might be created as other social media platforms continue to change and evolve? And will large, planet-scale social media platforms persist or are they gradually disappearing? What are the alternatives and what will we have in 10 years time?If you have a Mastodon account already, then please follow us - https://social.bbc/@BBCRD - and let us know what you think. If you don’t, then you can learn more about joining Mastodon.Topics Content Formats Search BBC R&DExplore our projects, publications and blog postsSearch BBC R&D Search Related posts IRFS Weeknotes #213Regular sprint notes from the IRFS team4 FEB 2016Helping you remember programmesHelping you remember programmes15 JUN 2011Prototyping Weeknotes #25 (30/07/10)30 JUL 2010BBC R&D on Twitter BBC R&D on Facebook BBC R&D on YouTube Related BBC content BBC Internet BlogStaff from the BBC's online and technology teams talk about BBC Online, BBC iPlayer and our digital and mobile servicesBBC Technology NewsThe latest technology stories from BBC News OnlineAbout the BBC BlogWho we are, what we do and how we work, plus some of the output that defines usExplore the BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds Bitesize CBeebies CBBC Food Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Parental Guidance Contact the BBC Make an editorial complaint BBC emails for you Copyright © 2023 BBC.

The obsession with control has soured my feelings towards BBC radio.replyzerkten 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't follow the BBC's approaches to revenue generation that closely, but is part of this due to larger overseas audiences? I'm now living outside the UK, so I expect that I'm viewed differently as a user by the Beeb, as well as by TV licence payers. If access to content isn't controlled then it's harder to maximise the revenue.BBC Sounds feels like it's part of that efforts, but I'd be interested to know more given how much family members complain about the costs of licencing and services relative to the quality.replyta1243 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The BBC has to prove it's serving the entire UK.

So everything has to be behind a registration wall.They have been under 13 years of pressure from Tory governments, run by friends of Murdoch, who don't believe in free knowledge and public broadcasting; the BBC had to be seen to go in the general direction of preparing for de-facto privatisation.

We now see the result of those non-open platforms (amazon taking 30% of income as a platform provider etc), but with government interference as it is (remember it was Labour that stopped the BBC building an international streaming service back in 2009) I can see why.replyalexsereno 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] “Inevitable” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in this commentreplyta1243 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Inevitable in that people in charge of the BBC want to prove that people (specifically an appropriate cross-section of the British public) use the BBC to keep the funding securereplyrobertlagrant 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They could do that by entering the 21st century and having an IP-locked subscription system.replytoyg 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Because every house has a single, unchangeable IP...?You clearly never worked in an ISP.replyrobertlagrant 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I definitely did not work at an ISP.

For one, there's \"ActivityPub\" and there's \"ActivityPub that Mastodon (and therefore most of the Fediverse) can interoperate with reliably\".For example, Mastodon has some artifical requirements that add signature requirements to public APIs to reduce bot and spam load. This isn't in the spec as a mandatory requirement, but if you don't do it then parts of the Fediverse won't be able to follow you. There are also expectations attached to certain activities that aren't in the spec but will confuse people on most other servers.The easiest solution I came up with was to run a server that already does all of the hard work (gotosocial, Mastodon, etc) and call its API to add new posts.replynightpool 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] \"that add signature requirements to public APIs to reduce bot and spam load\" Hmm? Are you talking about AUTHORIZED_FETCH? That's specifically an opt-in (and discouraged) feature that's meant to reduce the possibility of blocked instances retrieving your posts and displaying/replying to them on their own servers, it has nothing to do with bot or spam load.\"This isn't in the spec as a mandatory requirement, but if you don't do it then parts of the Fediverse won't be able to follow you.\"I don't think this is true even when using AUTHORIZED_FETCH, Mastodon still displays the minimum set of Actor information necessary to complete a follow request (public key, username, etc), so I don't really know what this part of the post might be referring to.replyjeroenhd 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Authorized fetch is just one lever to pull in the massive moderation machine that Mastodon offers. On its own it's not very useful, but together with decent configuration it can help against scammers impersonating accounts on your server from a similar domain. Twitter is full of people who replicate other accounts and add random racist shit for some obscure reason (a deep grudge? Mental illness?) and without authorized fetch you'll have no way to effectively block such scrapers.Enabling authorised fetch breaks federation with several other servers and some apps as well. Previously valid post IDs may suddenly become unavailable or break, which some services trying to backfill posts absolutely cannot deal with.I believe actors are available as barebones actor information not to break federation completely, but I don't believe this type of compatibility is available for individual statuses.Personally, I don't see why I shouldn't enable the setting on my own servers because the extra control it provides is probably worth it for the few exotic broken servers out there, but it's a gotcha if you expect the protocol to work as described in the spec alone.replytehbeard 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Just implement a smaller Activity Pub server, no need for this Twitter clone stuffBAHHAHAHAHAHASorry, I forget that some haven't been quite as close to the blast radius of govermental/enterprise IT projects as others to know that \"just implement\" is a hilarious statement to make.However much \"cleaner/better\" a direct integration with the beeb's CMS would be, it is not going to happen on the timescale needed for what is by their own statement, an R&D project.Spinning up an instance for a few months, is not perfect, it's good enough.replyrsynnott 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you want an off-the-shelf ActivityPub thing, a Mastodon instance is arguably one of the paths of less resistance.replymattmoose21 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I imagine they use it to give employees accounts that they can manage. If I was a journalist at the bbc I could get an account on their instance and the bbc could manage verification and account management.replyKnee_Pain 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But Mastodon is not the only way to manage accounts and publish stuff. It has so much overhead because it has to look and behave like a Twitter clone, whereas you could simply have a barebones password protected web admin panel to allow each journalist to publish with their BBC-approved credentials.replyegypturnash 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] With an entire Mastodon installation, then each journalist can also keep up with and talk to sources via a Twitter-like interface. Though they will quickly want to move any serious conversations with information sources elsewhere what with the big undismissable \"hey this is NOT REALLY PRIVATE\" sign at the top of the \"private\" messages column.Also I suspect that \"what if we just set up a Masto and see how it goes\" might be a much smaller investment then \"add AP to our CMS\". They're only committing to six months of this right now.replyj_maffe 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm unsure how much overhead there is since the service discussed above is functionally a micro-blogging service.

Before the big spike at the end of 2022, critiquing Mastodon's usability was tantamount to heresy in the FOSS crowd. Oddly, that didn't change much after many (most?) of those new users dropped Mastodon in the subsequent months. There is clearly a disconnect between what Mastodon offers, and what general, non-technical audiences want it to offer.ActivityPub and Mastodon are both fucking awesome, and I'm confident the Fediverse can support a social media tool painless enough for grandpa to confidently migrate his fly-fishing discussion group to from his Facebook group. I'm also sure all of the good work folks are doing on the existing tool set will still be valuable in that world; but it's probably not going to be the thing that makes decentralized social media the standard rather than a distant fringe alternative to most non-technical folks. I've got my eye on Bluesky but I'd really love to see someone figure out a way to tighten things up non-commercially. I've tried digging into the problem a few times, but the conceptual simplicity of centralized social media is a huge selling point for regular folks.replyversteck 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] The answer to that is https://elk.zone atm, a fun and chef's kiss interface (built with nuxt). You can insert elk.zone/ before any Mastodon url. https://phanpy.social is also great, with multi columns even for lists.A browser plugin like https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/mastodon-simplif... to follow, favorite, etc. directly on any server has also improved my experience a lot.replychefandy 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Elk.zone looks cool and is definitely a nice face for Mastodon-- glad to know about it!However, the disconnect between non-technical users and what Mastodon offers is far deeper than the timeline layout and interactions. If users must practically understand how to negotiate federation to satisfy their most basic requirement-- nearly effortlessly finding and interacting with their friends, family and other sources within the interface-- then it's a non-starter for that crowd.Most developers seem not to realize a) how much more resistance dealing with the practical complexity of federation adds for non-technical users trying to do what they want to do, and b) how little resistance those users will tolerate to achieve their goals when they have free options. As it stands, the cost/benefit ratio to switching to Mastodon is not even in the ballpark of what it needs to be for nearly any social media user. Mastodon's huge active user base fluctuation 5-10 mos ago comprises about half a percent of Twitter's active monthly user base, which entirely leaves out Facebook, Instagram, Etc... and most of Mastodon's new ex-twitter users left.replystefandesu 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Honest question about Elk (and I guess all other web clients): How do people use it when it doesn't remember your timeline position? When I open my Mastodon client, I want it to be where I left it, not at the top of the timeline. Maybe it's becoming unusual to be a timeline completionist, but I can only use clients that reliably remember my timeline position.replyjrmg 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] As I follow these new accounts, I’m reminded of just how _hard_ it is to follow people on other servers on Mastodon.Click follow -> dialog full of text, which gives the most common instructions (to copy and paste into the search field on your server) in smaller text at the end -> go to my server -> there’s no search field, or anything that says ‘search’ -> [I know that this is because my window is too narrow] -> expand the window -> paste into the revealed search field -> click ‘follow’ on the result -> Phew!Now I have to do this again for the other accounts…I’m absolutely sure people become lost and give up at every step here.replypakyr 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] They have very recently uploaded this flow a bit. Most servers don't seem to have it yet, but mastodon.social does. Now, the first time you try to follow or do something when your account is somewhere else, it asks you to type in your home server, then takes you there to log in. From then on, it will remember your home server and allow you to see the relevant post/profile on your server with one click. So the process is now click follow -> click 'Take me home' -> click follow again. Still not great, but a lot better than it was.Example: https://i.imgur.com/MG1d5kV.jpgreplykstrauser 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That seems typical of the mastodon.social instance: roll out something that works for them, then likely call it a day and mark it solved.There are about 23,000 fediverse servers online today. The mastodon.social instance is the largest, with about 1/5th of the monthly active users. The other 23,000 servers with the remaining 80% of users won't benefit nearly so much from that hacky feature.replygargron 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] mastodon.social runs nightly releases off of our GitHub. Anyone can run nightlies to get these features. Or wait for the stable. What's hacky about this feature?replykstrauser 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Mainly that it only benefits giant instances. That's a convenient feature for people on a tiny instance following users on mastodon.social, but adds friction for users on mastodon.social who want to follow users on a tiny instance.I haven't looked at the implementation, but I'll assume it's flawless. The issue is that it doesn't address the broader problem. Like the \"official\" iPhone app that has a giant, colorful \"Join mastodon.social\" button above a transparent \"Pick another server\" option, it serves to push people toward m.s and away from a good federated experience.replyafavour 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m not sure I grasp the argument here. No feature should be switched on until all 23,000 servers have updated to the necessary version?replykstrauser 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I’m not sure I grasp the argument here. No feature should be switched on until all 23,000 servers have updated to the necessary version?It's not about having the necessary version. The feature has to be cookie driven, right? Otherwise, mastodon.social wouldn't be able to remember that an unauthenticated visitor has an account elsewhere. Such a cookie almost certainly won't be available across servers (thanks, ad trackers for ruining it for everyone). That means a user would have to fill in that form for every single remote instance they visit.Think of it this way: suppose a user visits a tiny Mastodon server at social.example.com. They click a user's follow button. How will social.example.com know to redirect the user to the home instance they configured when they visited mastodon.social?> If I’ve downloaded the Mastodon app without having a server in mind what is the app supposed to do, just list them all?If someone clicks the \"pick another server\" option, they're taken to a perfectly serviceable chooser. That should have been the default. It works for all the other apps that don't default to mastodon.social.replypakyr 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > That means a user would have to fill in that form for every single remote instance they visitIt looks like you're correct; I went looking and found that https://universeodon.com had the new feature as well, and I had to type in my home server URL again. I actually thought this was a great solution before I realized you'd have to do it for every server; hopefully they find a better solution for this.replykstrauser 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If it worked that way, I'd support it completely! I think the idea is great. I just don't think it can be implemented in a cross-instance way, short of having some sort of central server.With the feature the way it is today, it makes it a little easier to follow users on mastodon.social, and a little harder to follow users anywhere else. Suppose that hypothetical social.example.com instance has 1 user. If that feature's enabled on the server, anyone wanting to follow that 1 person has to complete that extra step with zero benefit. It's only useful for larger instances, benefitting the few centralized servers without helping the federation as a whole.replytreyd 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] On Mastodon's interface if you see a foreign post locally on your timeline can see the poster's profile from there and follow it there.

It leads me to believe there is a good chance the whole thing will be scrapped in a few months, which makes me less inclined to engage with it (which in turn increases the likelihood that it will be considered a failure, etc).I suppose it's better than silently subjecting it to a six-month probation period, but I can't imagine it is so expensive to maintain (and use as a mirror for their Twitter etc) that they need the probation period at all. And if in six months the BBC publicly pronounce that they don't see the value in Mastodon it will probably be a net negative for the Fediverse.replyJdeBP 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is the first major \"name\" to have set itself up in the FediVerse, after smaller outfits like (for examples) the Texas Observer and Bylines have been established there for some time.

I'm sure that BBC can manage to run Mastodon by throwing resources at it, but still...not needing to do that at all is appealing.- You don't have any liability regarding the moderation of replies, in fact, there's barely anything to moderate. When a nutjob replies to your tweet, you're not responsible for it. Nor are you responsible for the handling of personal data of people replying. All of this is not your problem, which is nice.- For the time being, centralized social media has superior reach potential, not just because of the bigger audience potential, your account is also vastly easier to discover through search and algorithms. As an example, BBC world news has 40M followers on Twitter, whilst on Mastodon an account having 100K+ followers is exceptionally rare.- Federation/defederation wars may reduce your reach even further. I think the risk for BBC is fairly small as it's typically not that controversial, but inter-instance wars is a big thing on Mastodon.Bottom line is that you're adding operational and legal headaches with very little to show for it in comparison to the big networks.replyzokier 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] > You own your account, but not the infra. I'm sure that BBC can manage to run Mastodon by throwing resources at it, but still...not needing to do that at all is appealing.Mastodon imho desperately needs proper multi-tenancy, i.e. bring your own domain, separate handles, some settings customization, without needing to run whole another instance of the server. We already found out in the 90s that vhosting is useful for stuff like web and email. This would open the door for people to better offer Mastodon-as-a-service.replywiml 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The BBC isn't hosting anyone else on their instance (nor can I think of a reason they would want to). As I understand it it's just a way for their activity to be visible on the fediverse. That should make their infra costs minimal; they don't have moderation of comments/replies; and federation/defederation wars will only affect the specific other instances which choose to defederate from the BBC. Your third point is valid but that's why this is an experiment.replydahwolf 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You may want to read the actual article which explains how replies very much end up on their instance and therefore require moderation.

I moved onto other things, the process broke my flow.The TLDR is that Mastodon creates too much friction to be actually work as a decentralised social network.

You follow people. But a forum is topic-centric. You follow a discussion group with a specific purpose, and it's an implementation detail if it's hosted on a dedicated website, or a mailing list, or a newsgroup, or a subreddit.HN could be alt.news.ycombinator, or /r/hackernews. It isn't @hackernews, or... whatever facebook does. I definitely lean towards thinking of HN as a forum, rather than a brand of social media.Do you think that's a meaningful distinction?replyNoboruWataya 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Personally I don't think it's a meaningful distinction. You can engage primarily with topics on Twitter and Facebook (hashtags, pages, etc), and you can engage primarily with people on HN and Reddit (by mostly hanging out in the comments). Reddit in particular falls squarely in the social media camp to me, and while HN is maybe more topic-focused again (self-posts are less common), it is a matter of degree.I think any site that people use primarily to interact with others (in public, I guess) is arguably social media. (Looking forward to being savaged by HN pedants looking to reduce that definition to absurdity.)replyKarellen 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I think any site that people use primarily to interact with others (in public, I guess) is arguably social media.Isn't that just \"the internet\"? If mailing lists and newsgroups and BBSs and blogs with comment sections and instant messaging/chat rooms and forums and wikis are all \"social media\", why did anyone invent the term \"social media\" 20 years after it had existed instead of just continuing to say \"the internet\". Or, shudder, \"information superhighway\" if they really needed a hip slang moniker to use instead?replyNoboruWataya 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > If mailing lists and newsgroups and BBSs and blogs with comment sections and instant messaging/chat rooms and forums and wikis are all \"social media\"Yes, I would consider basically all of those things to be social media, with the possible exception of wikis and blogs where most people don't go to the blog specifically to comment and read others' comments. They are all media for social interaction.On the other hand, news websites like bbc.co.uk or company websites like microsoft.com are not, generally speaking, social media.I realise we can argue forever about the corners of this loose definition I haphazardly threw out. But what is the rationale for distinguishing between Reddit and HN (on the one side) and Twitter and Facebook (on the other)? The root comment of this thread complained about social media being full of marketing, PR, virtue signalling and self-promotion. You can argue that is an unduly harsh assessment, but BBS, IRC, Reddit and HN have all had their fair share of all that stuff.> why did anyone invent the term \"social media\" 20 years after it had existedBecause back in the 90s the mainstream media had nothing to say about BBS and IRC so they didn't need a term for it.replytrealira 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm not who you asked, but I agree, and I do think that's a meaningful distinction.I'm curious: how would you characterize Tumblr?

There is some positive news. Most books could be said to be \"trash\", but book publishing is still important. The same was said with blogs: \"Oh, most blogs are about people having breakfast.\" But, I remember Joel on Software, Scripting.com, LRC, and Mises Blog that all had such a positive effect on me. So it is with social media: - people are meeting and getting married via Instagram. - I have chatted with Ph.Ds on Twitter and Youtube, even though I have no college degree. - I helped a UI/UX designer have lunch with Alan Kay. All of it via Twitter. That is something that will never happen to me because I am not in the same \"league\". He later casually mentioned he had lunch with Ted Nelson. (Sigh! That will never happen to me.) - And lots of people here probably have an anecdote how one-thing-led-to-another that made life a little bit happier. Jeff Tucker would probably say, \"It doesn't matter if 98% are narcissistic hunters/gathers. That 2% can change The World and Your Life.\" (Of course, you would say it more eloquently.)At least this is what I say to myself when I get depressed we are living in the 21st Century World and people care more about letting men inside women's bathrooms than the fact the US and its \"allies\" just bombed the Nordstream pipeline that will have a negative effect on millions of Europeans... and how I will be downvoted (2718 currently) for posting this.

Alas, the \"about\" page doesn't say, as it normally would, what servers are moderated. But I can understand why the BBC would not want to get into the silly game that would (and does) result if it did publish its moderation list.It's not well publicized, and resources for new sysops being poor is one of the problems with Mastodon et al., but I hope that the BBC people are on the ball in this respect.* https://writer.oliphant.social/oliphant/the-oliphant-social-...replybrucethemoose2 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > There's a whole long standing organization of sysops dedicated to silencing and blocking the (few, I've never even heard of one myself) places on the WWW that the sort of stuff that you are talking about would come from.I was thinking more along the lines of subreddit trolls, who will come in and spam shock/csam images trying to bait the mods, not actual CSAM distributors with known IPs or whatever.The BBC will certainly attract that kind of internet denizen. They would have to have employees (or automated system) staring at their post replies constantly, watching for this kind of stuff.replyJdeBP 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The FediVerse doesn't work that way. There is no \"the\" mods.The people posting this stuff won't be posting to the BBC. They will be posting to far away places each with their own moderators. They'll either get suppressed at the source, by those moderators, as complaints come in (which they will probably do quite rapidly); or it will get around that those far away places don't moderate, and the far away places will get silenced and blocked and make it onto the aforementioned lists, meaning that the (civilized) world won't pull any posts from them.The reporting system, bear in mind, reports to the origin server, which won't be the BBC. If I, for example, see an unacceptable post in reply to something posted by the BBC, my report doesn't get seen by anyone at the BBC. It gets seen by my local sysop and the sysop of the origin node.replybrucethemoose2 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hm.

Niche instances failing to police CSAM are defederated by mainstream instances, which means they're unreachable to anyone on the mainstream instances.

To verify this exciting claim, we have successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9 this http URL and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of ~5.22x10^-4 this http URL. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity of ~1.94x10^4 this http URL although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition, when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.

What works in one lab will often need to be adjusted to work in another, with different equipment, altitude, humidity, all sorts of stuff. Making it even worse, apparently the original team can't even get production correct in more than 10% of runs! Combined with the slipshod methodology, doesn't this make you feel like it was silly to release the arXiv paper when they did? Well, the LK-99 team agree, according to them it was a rogue industrial scientist that they'd apparently fired four months ago who published it to arXiv with himself listed as third author. They wanted more time to nail down sample production and otherwise make a paper to their standards before release, but it effectively leaked and to avoid having credit taken from them for potentially months (or like, forever - science can be brutal) some of them decided to publish what they had on hand within a few hours. This sucks for them, a lot. I don't believe that their intention was to put out work with errors in it or incomplete methodology.Secondly, this all happened two days ago! If the methodology was perfect, I still wouldn't expect good replication results back within two (part non-business!) days.I don't know if this material is legit. I really hope it is. But the process of figuring that out could potentially take months (or more), and a two-day-later failed to replicate is not a death sentence.As much as it sucks, this is really just going to take time to prove it's not a superconductor. If it is a superconductor, we may not know for a while either, unless one of the influencers/\"makers\" attempting to reproduce the material succeeds and posts some good convincing video of flux pinning or other Meissner effect stuff (that person is going to go insanely viral, if it happens).replydmvdoug 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Not just materials science though. I’m a longtime reader of Derek Lowe’s In the Pipeline blog, and he often emphasizes the trickiness of lab work and lab techniques. But the model we have of science from elementary and high school doesn’t give us room for the random, ephemeral things that come into play in actual experimental work. Our model is methods equal result, every time, even though jiggling your foot a little bit to get the feeling back may have somehow made your small molecule production have less binding affinity or something. And yes, eventually you figure that out and stop jiggling your foot but two years have passed.replytetha 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] NileRed and other Maker Channels are great to demonstrate that. In every video, there's 1 - 2 of these situations - Nile has been following some documented, established procedure which should result in a specific reaction and it looks decent to the layman - and then it just doesn't work at all. And then he re-does pretty much the same thing and it works.I can't imagine how frustrating that can be. And then you have to do it with something you don't even know works. Kind of like dealing with obscure retro computers. Does it still work? No one knows. What does it do if it works? No one knows. Can it even function or are parts missing? That's right - no one knows.replyteaearlgraycold 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Link to NileRed video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5ncreplydjtango 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] We also don't have a culture of replication. Basically all of the post docs I worked with in the lab lamented how hard it can be to replicate reported syntheses in chemistry wet labs.Everything from humidity and altitude to undocumented \"magic tricks\" (eg baking something in an oven under vaccuum for a week to get.rid.of.all.the.water.)I heard anecdotes that experiments were sometimes literally only reproducible in one exact lab because reasons.Turns out there's just as much art as there is science in experimentation...replytechdragon 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The simple truth is we don’t have a culture of replication because no one is paying and no one is paying because no one is demanding it as part of the incentive system that the money is part of…If a prerequisite of publication in a top tier journal was someone having replicated the work… anyone at all… then the quality of write up would improve dramatically because all the stuff that never gets written up would be written up so that the second lab costs them less money to do the replication work, so the second lab doesn’t spent a month failing because they didn’t bake the powder in a vacuum for a week before performing the entire synthesis under dry nitrogen purge when the methodology just said the powder had been dried and the synthesis was performed at ambient pressure in a zero humidity atmosphere…replymschuster91 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The problem IMHO is funding related. Often enough the original lab's grant is barely enough to account for the research and a shoddily put together paper, the rest is filled with a crapload of un(der)paid/\"voluntold\" labour.It's rare for researchers to get the budget to replicate someone else's work - this case might be one of the few exceptions given that everyone and their dog want to be the first one to show the world a successful replication. Hell, there are Youtube and Tiktok streamers on the task as well, that way you know just how nuts everyone is going.replyVespasian 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In that light, industrial processes seem even more impressive.The super power of modern technology is the ability to perform precise steps on a massive scale and basically forever.Obviously it takes a lot of effort to keep the machinery running but still, the mere fact that it's running in the first place blows your mind if you think about it.Modern Machinery multiplies the impact on the world of any human who operates it.replydjtango 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Research experimentation is like doing a gymnastics performance, you're trying to prove the limits of what can be done.Industry is all about doing it cheap, consistently and at scale. So by comparison you don't want any flourish or special conditions that take lots of practice and super skilled operators.The magic of industrial engineering is figuring out how to go from research to scale. But the flipside is all the crazy stuff that is achievable at the frontier that never gets productionisedreplylucubratory 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Absolutely, ultimate failures to replicate are generally multiple labs across dozens and dozens of attempts and continuous communication with the authors. And yeah, it's a thing in science in general, materials science is just particularly susceptible because of the nature of the work.replyLoic 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] For computer science people, I always use the yield on wafers as analogy to explain how hard it can be to nail an experiment right.Usually they understand directly because this is something they can easily relate to.replyeric-hu 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For those of us unfamiliar with the numbers, what do typical yields look like on silicon wafers?replycrote 3 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It really varies.Samsung 3nm had a yield rate well below 20% back in early 2022, and that's not unheard of while still in the development phase. To be economically viable the yield rates have to be around 80%, so mature nodes can be expected to be in that ballpark.replypeyton 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 50–97% with 90% considered “good.”replyvasco 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If research moves more to arxiv + discussion forums rather than paid journals, sharing research results earlier seems like a good thing, not bad. If they didn't publish early, when they published maybe things would be clearer for other researchers. But by publishing earlier other people have the choice to engage with it or wait for later. Seems like many people decided to not wait, so it seems like it was a good choice?replyryukoposting 14 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] This is a great philosophy in software, where meaningful contributions can be made by any given person with a laptop. It's not as compelling when the only people who can meaningfully advance the research need to spend millions in grant money and/or allocate time to use expensive equipment that's shared across other research groups.replybrutusborn 24 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this is the best direction for science generally: publish everything open and early.It might be naive, but I would love an environment where everyone self published or arxiv papers/reviews/datasets/models. Then journals could publish the best papers/review preprints.I imagine a world where journals beg researchers for the rights to publish their paper after seeing an excellent preprint. Or a journal finds an interesting comment on PubPeer and pays for the author to expand it into a more detailed review.replywas_a_dev 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this would vary greatly on the field. This example of results is one of the better examples imoreplybruce511 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's not dissimilar to the way food recipe books work.Creating a dish, replicating the dish, writing a recipe, getting competent cooks to follow the recipe, getting non-competant cooks to follow it, and so on. [1]It all leads to multiple revisions and takes a lot of time.And this is for -food-. Imagine doing it for something a lot less tolerant of variation.[1] old recipes start with \"pluck 2 chickens\" because, you know, someone followed the recipe and didn't pluck the chickens...replyjoefigura 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This comment intrigued me, so I pulled together some information.The first paper submitted is titled \"The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor.\" It lists three authors: Sukbae Lee, Ji-Hoon Kim, and Young-Wan Kwon. Its timestamp is Saturday, July 22, 2023 at 07:51:19 UTC. [1]The second paper submitted is titled \"Superconductor Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and mechanism.\" This paper lists six authors: Sukbae Lee, Jihoon Kim, Hyun-Tak Kim, Sungyeon Im, SooMin An, Keun Ho Auh [2]. Its timestamp is Saturday, July 22nd, 2023 at 10:11:28 UTC, or two hours and twenty minutes after the first paper.In both papers the first author is Sukbae Lee and the second author is Jihoon Kim, and in both their affiliation is given as \"Quantum Energy Research center, Inc.\" in Seoul. The first paper posted has Young-Wan Kwon as third author. The second paper does not have Young-Wan Kwon as an author, and has four additional authors with various affiliations.The second paper appears to have been was prepared in LaTeX, and the first paper appears to have been prepared in Word. The title and abstract of the first paper explicitly claim the creation of the world's first room temperature and pressure superconductor. The title and abstract of the second paper don't explicitly claim demonstration of the first superconductor, though they use some terminology that sounds like superconducting properties.The accusation is that Young-Wan Kwon published the first paper without the consent of the rest of the LK-99 team, listed himself as third author, and left off the other four. Two hours later, the rest of the LK-99 team stuffed as much as they had into the second paper, and released it as soon as possible.To me that totally seems like what happened. It explains why there are two different papers from the same group submitted on the same subject on the same day, and it explains why the author lists are different between the two. I haven't yet looked in detail, but I'm betting it also explains a lot of the oddities that people have noted in the first two papers.This also makes me way more excited about the possibility these claims are legit. The information so far is consistent with a research group that was forced to publish early, and who produced a superconductor through a fabrication process that is a bit tricky. There's nowhere near enough evidence to conclude LK-99 is a room temperature superconductor. But one failed replication doesn't prove LK-99 isn't a superconductor - if the fabrication process is finicky we'd expect to see a few dozen failed reproductions and a few successful reproductions[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037replymellosouls 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, this in-fighting thing has been proposed before as credibility-supporting. Here's an earlier tweet with some background on the palaver, account worth following on it all:https://twitter.com/8teAPi/status/1684385895565365248reply_0ffh 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rushing out the second paper was a mistake and not a good look for the group. It would have been enough to force the retraction of Kwon's paper, and even without a retraction it's very unlikely it would have counted for anything with such weak data.replyjoefigura 50 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] idk if it turns out this material is a room temperature superconductor, the rushed second paper will have been the right thing to do. Science happening in real time is gonna be messyreply_0ffh 8 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] If it's about the Nobel, no it doesn't make sense. There's been more than one Nobel where the author(s) of an earlier paper were passed over in favour of a later paper because it was insufficient to conclusively prove the claim. One example would be Randy Hulet.replychrisjj 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The second paper's \"semiconductor\" claim is no less than the first.replyjoefigura 42 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] In general I'd agree with you, but in this case I think the second group very likely didn't reproduce the first group's material. The measured electrical properties of the two groups aren't even close to each other. I think that strongly suggests the two groups were measuring different materials, and that the structure of the second group's material differed in some way. A more convincing failed replication would find mostly similar electrical properties and reproduce the levitation that the first group found, but explain it with a phenomenon other than superconductorsreplycomboy 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is a good summary: https://youtu.be/RjzL9cS3VW8?t=32TLDW it seems very unlikely that they have what they claimreplyschappim 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] For the non-chemists/physicists:Recently[1], there was an exciting claim that a new type of material could conduct electricity perfectly at room temperature (this is what is meant by \"superconductivity\")[4]. This material was a version of lead-apatite [2], a type of mineral, that was altered with certain additions and made by combining two other materials, lanarkite and copper phosphide.The researchers writing this report wanted to check if this claim was true. So, they made the same types of materials (lanarkite, copper phosphide, and the altered lead-apatite) and tested how they conducted electricity and reacted to magnets.What they found was that lanarkite (Pb2SO5) didn't conduct electricity well at all, and copper phosphide Cu3P) conducted electricity similar to a semiconductor [3]. The altered lead-apatite, which was supposed to be the superconductor, behaved more like a semiconductor (a type of material that can sometimes conduct electricity, depending on conditions).Also, a key property of superconductors is that they repel magnets. But when the researchers put a magnet near their lead-apatite, there was no repulsion.Because of these tests, they're suggesting that the original claim about this room-temperature superconductor should be re-examined more carefully. It doesn't seem to behave like a superconductor in their tests.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36864624[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivityreplyp-e-w 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] > In addition, when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic levitation was observed either.So what about the video[1] that shows magnetic levitation occurring?Since the linked article was unable to reproduce this effect, it seems there are two possibilities:1. The video is fake (which is really, really hard to imagine since that would predictably end the authors' careers).2. The sample synthesized for the linked article doesn't match the original one for whatever reason.[1] https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50nreplyAzrael3000 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Apparently a new paper is supposed to come out from the original authors about the production method [0]. So it really is unclear whether everybody generates the same material.It's a shame that these papers were published before they were polished by the authors.[0] https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/claims-of-room-tempe...replyharry8 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >It's a shame that these papers were published before they were polished by the authors.Saying nothing about these specific papers, in general I disagree strongly.I find the peer review process to be extremely flawed. If you get a bunch of interest from experts in the field on the internet who comment and do work to understand, replicate and analyse (and without hiding behind fake-anonymity) that is a million times better in every dimension than anonymous \"peer review.\" That is, it works better as a BS detector, it works better identifying issues in the data analysis, methodology and so on.Anonymous peer review has been great compared to alternatives for hundreds of years, just now, our alternatives are frequently better than that.replyjcranmer 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For these papers in particular, it seems like peer review was badly needed before publication. Sure, it's a meme that Reviewer 2 is always going to complain that could you please run like, 50 more experiments, and for something as potentially groundbreaking as room-temp superconductor, even more so.But one of the main issues with the papers right now is their chemistry is deficient. The key chemical reactions don't balance, and there's also an unexpected and unexplained oxidation state change in the copper. This is the kind of issue that would be flagged quickly in peer review, and it's the sort of catastrophic paper issue that makes replication problematic--how can you be sure that you're comparing against what the original sample was?replyharry8 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure and all of that is coming out in public with people's names and reputations attached to it. So we're certainly not behind on any of those issues. I say there are very real benefits too.replysimplicio 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Seems the fastest way to clear this up would just be for the original team to send a sample to some other scientists for testing. That would solve any issues regarding other teams reproducing the material incorrectly, and at a first pass, what everyone cares about is whether its a superconductor at room temp, not how to make it.replypeyton 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Once the findings are published in a peer-reviewed journal, which Kim says is in the works, he will support anyone who wants to create and test LK-99 for themselves.

It's then on other scientists to publish work refuting it or proving it's not correct. It's an issue that the refutations tend to go in lower impact journals, but it's the way it's works.replyszundi 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Actually this is the scientific method.

They’ve got a floating rock. What would materially affect conclusions?replyWillAdams 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Most likely the peer review process will include replication.replytnecniv 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Normally (at least in my field), that’s beyond the scope of peer review in the traditional sense. Peer review typically just involves review of just the material submitted to the journal (manuscript, data, maybe code depending on its size and complexity). Depending on the experiment, reproducing a result may require resources, equipment, or skills unavailable to the reviewer or that cannot be acquired in a reasonable amount of time needed for the review.Peer review serves basically as a smell test where capable experts certify that the paper is novel, interesting, properly justifies its claims, and contains enough detail to reproduce the results. It is not uncommon for only a few labs to contain all of the expensive, specialized equipment to reproduce an experiment, and getting that experiment working (if it is reproducible) can take a significant time commitment from multiple individuals in a lab. Also keep in mind that reviewers are normally not paid for their services, journals typically want at least two independent reviewers (who they pick, sometimes with input from the author to narrow down who has the background to perform the review), and going from submission to publication is typically a many-month process without the high standard of reproduction.Reproduction happens in the manner that is going on right now. If your publication makes waves, people will want to build on your result and either reproduce it as a first step or conduct a related experiment that adds evidence to support the hypothesis. This way is far more practical, but the devious thing is that, if you lie and manipulate your data, some poor grad student might waste two years of their PhD trying to get your thing to work.Having journals or some independent body fund reproduction themselves runs into both capital challenges and the problem of attracting a large enough number of capable scientists to cover every discipline who would only want to work on reproduction full time. As nice as that would be, I’m not sure such a venture would work in the real world.replyjacquesm 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's true but if a reputable journal publishes this before that verification is in and it ends up being mistaken or even a hoax or fraud then their reputation will be dinged so with the stakes this high given the material and the visibility there is a fair chance that they will indeed wait for independent replication before committing to publishing it. But I don't see it happening during the peer review process itself, it will happen simply because another lab tries the same and gets lucky (or not, in which case the whole thing will blow over).replyphanimahesh 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The journals reputation will be dinged if it comes to light that they have not adequately performed their due diligence. Which, as has been explained above, does not include replication.If you require replication for publication practically nothing will get published ever. Once published, others will attempt to replicate, and it is the authors' reputation on the line if nobody manages to replicate it following the paper and consulting with the authors.replyjacquesm 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They are not going to replicate this themselves, obviously. But extraordinary claims etc, and this one is about as extraordinary as they come. Papers that are non-controversial even if they might turn out to be wrong get published all the time. But papers where 95% of the scientists out there are going to be super skeptical will find it much harder to get published. Both the authors and the publishers have a reputation to protect. Keep in mind that the peer-reviewers will have to sign off on the publication as well.replyRF_Savage 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How can you replicate it before the paper with the stuff to replicate is published?replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It would be a variation on what's already out there right now.

Peer review rarely, if ever, involves any sort of replication.replylovich 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m asking on a legitimate basis. I am not involved in the science world and only know about Nature as a publication from high school and college. The way Nature was described to gave me the sense that you weren’t going to have a paper published unless you had some surprising results, and that didn’t include the null hypothesis.If that’s not the case for this publication then I would appreciate if someone showed me how they changed in the past decadereplyregular_trash 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This assumes the chemical structure is stable, which may not be the case. If the material is truly not superconductive at room temperature, it will take a long time to gather enough diverse experimental evidence to build a scientific consensus.

Non-superconducting diamagnetic can’t freely levitate due to a fundamental instability; they will always fall out of levitation (unless they’re spinning in a specific way).

[0] The broken part floating and the \"pressed\" part resting on the plate. To me, this suggests that a significant amount of the material is not the target material.Further, if the target material was evenly distributed, I'd expect that levitation properties would correlate with the thickness of the piece and the piece would float, evenly. Right, if a 1mm piece has 1unit of levitation, a 5mm piece should have 5 units of levitation. If the 1mm piece levitates, then the 5mm portion should as well.Since it's not levitating evenly, I suspect the target material is unevenly distributed. Further, I'd argue that the target material is actually consolidated to a single piece of that sample. Perhaps (conjecture) that little silver spec near the tip of the crack.From what I've been reading, it seems like it's very, very hard to trick the copper into the right place. It seems possible that the process does work, but a lot of luck is needed to create a large enough piece to support the levitation effect.It's almost like someone stuck a \"super strong\" helium balloon in the center of a half-eaten cake.

This proves that we have successfully synthesized the modified lead-apatite as Lee et al.[3.4] \"(First off, you need to pay to the spectrum swear jar. an XRD pattern is a pattern, not a spectrum, it resolves space, not energy.)But looking at figure 9 shows that the material is not the same. They are missing a peak at ~17.5 degrees, and have an extra one around 25 degrees.Further, all the peaks seem to be shifted about the same amount from the LK-99 structure, as the LK-99 is from pure lead-apatite. This indicates that they have an even smaller unit cell. So if the .5% compression in the original LK-99 paper is correct, there could easily be an overcompression present in this article.All the XRD pattern tells you is that they produced something wrong, an that it did not superconduct.It makes it impressive how pure the phase was in the original LK-99 paper.I will however say that there are some problems with the XRD pattern in the original paper too: They did not write which energy the XRD was measured at, one would then guess that it is Cu-Ka, but who knows.

I think our best chance for any meaningful near-term clarity rest with the team of scientists reportedly visiting the original authors in their lab to test the author's own samples.

Those struggling often face skepticism. By David Ovalle and Fenit Nirappil July 31, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EDT Courtney, a 37-year-old mother who lives in Missouri, says marijuana has proved addictive. (Arin Yoon for The Washington Post) Listen 13 min Comment 2747 Gift Article ShareCourtney took her first marijuana puffs at 17. Two decades later, she was raising a toddler son and hiding her dependence from most family members. She would light her pipe more than a dozen times a day, sneaking to the garage of her Missouri home while her son napped.She still loves the earthy smell. But weed long ago stopped making her giggly. It was not unusual for the 37-year-old to lose her train of thought mid-conversation or zone out while playing with her son. Many times, Courtney said, she tried to quit, flushing her stash and dumping her pipe to no avail, except for the nine months she was pregnant. Courtney felt she was addicted.Advertisement“It’s been frustrating because you’re not taken seriously,” Courtney said. “People say it’s not as severe as meth, or alcohol, that it’s not that bad. They think it’s not an addiction.”At a time when marijuana has been legalized for recreational and medicinal use in more than 20 states — and the potency of the drug has been increased — many experts believe that most people can use it without significant negative consequences, not unlike enjoying occasional alcoholic drinks. But for users like Courtney, the struggles to quit are real and complicated by the powerful cultural perception that marijuana is natural and therapeutic, not a substance that can be addicting.Courtney’s story reflects broader tensions about marijuana’s health consequences.For decades, weed’s deleterious health effects were exaggerated, experts said, leading to excessive criminalization. But as legal recreational sales have expanded — Maryland in July became the latest state to permit sale of marijuana products for recreational use — the suggestion that marijuana is addictive has often met with derision, especially because science isn’t always clear on the benefits and harms. There can be reluctance to seek treatment. And other substances stir deeper fears and greater attention: Opioids are driving an overdose crisis killing more than 100,000 people each year in the United States.“Because there are so many mixed messages in our society about cannabis, I think it’s very easy for people to minimize and rationalize problematic use of cannabis,” said Aaron Norton, a Florida mental health counselor who supports legalization of recreational and medical marijuana but believes it should be more tightly regulated.Am I using too much cannabis? Ask yourself these questionsCourtney and other marijuana users interviewed by The Washington Post spoke on the condition that only their first name or initials be used because they fear being stigmatized or because relatives or employers are not aware of their use.Twenty-three states and D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana, and all of those states except for Virginia and Minnesota have recreational sales up and running. Medical use is lawful in 38 states.The number of regular users has increased. According to a 2019 federal government survey, an estimated 31.6 million people age 12 or older used marijuana within the past month, up from 22.2 million five years earlier. The estimate rose to 36.4 million in 2021, although the numbers are not directly comparable because researchers changed how they collect data.AdvertisementMedical experts and even many proponents of legalized marijuana acknowledge it can be addictive — akin to alcohol or some prescription drugs. Estimates vary on the prevalence of what is known as cannabis use disorder. One study from researchers at Columbia University and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that nearly 3 in 10 users in 2012-2013 experienced cannabis use disorder.“The majority of people who use cannabis products in general can handle it,” said Adrianne Trogden, a Louisiana addiction counselor. “But there are still people who cannot — and they need help.”Darren Weiss, president of Verano, a cannabis company operating in 13 states, agreed that public health and industry officials should not dismiss the potential for cannabis to be abused, but maintained that concerns are often overwrought.“Addiction is a fact of life,” Weiss said. “There are folks who are addicted to caffeine, to sex, to all sorts of different things.”The rise in marijuana use among teens has been highly publicized, along with concerns about the effects of more potent products on the developing adolescent brain. In May, the National Institute on Drug Abuse published a study asserting that young men with cannabis-use disorder have an increased risk of developing schizophrenia, although critics have pointed to other studies that cast doubt on the extent of the role marijuana plays in psychotic episodes.AdvertisementParents are not ready for the new reality of teen cannabis useFurther fueling concerns among some experts: In the 1990s, THC, the psychoactive compound responsible for inducing a high, constituted about 5 percent of a typical joint or smoke from a bong or pipe, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Today, the THC content in smokable marijuana in recreational products can range between 15 and 21 percent, while products popular with young people such as edibles and oils can contain well over 50 percent.Higher THC levels could increase the risk the brain will get conditioned to want more of the high-potency marijuana, said Nora Volkow, NIDA’s director. Last year, a study published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry found that higher potency THC was associated with an increased risk of cannabis use disorder.Weiss questioned claims that higher potency marijuana is more likely to cause addiction. Still, he acknowledged that companies market to cannabis enthusiasts who will pay more for higher-potency products — because of the economics of the industry.If marijuana could be sold by pharmacy chains or liquor stores, Weiss said there would be more incentive to sell lower-potency products marketed at casual consumers. More sales of lower-octane marijuana to a broader customer base would equal higher revenue, he said.“There are a lot of people who demonize industry and think we are pushing high potency, similar to what the tobacco industry did, as a way of hooking consumers … and it couldn’t be further from the truth,” Weiss said.The weed you buy may not be as potent as promisedThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates at least 16.3 million people in the United States had a cannabis-use disorder in 2021, putting it behind only alcohol. The agency’s yearly estimates rose in 2020 after it incorporated broadened American Psychiatric Association criteria on diagnosing substance use disorders.AdvertisementMost cannabis-use disorder cases were characterized as mild, which means patients experience just two or three of 11 benchmark symptoms, such as increased tolerance, intense cravings or repeated attempts to stop marijuana use. An estimated 26 percent of cases are considered moderate, while 16 percent are severe, according to SAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health.“It’s the second-most common addiction Americans are struggling with, but nobody hears about it,” said James H. Berry, a psychiatrist and addiction expert at West Virginia University.Still, experts caution that mild cases of cannabis-use disorder may not fit under what the public generally considers “addiction.” The effect on users’ lives may be less severe — perhaps marijuana smoking has merely caused friction with a spouse. For those patients, interventions are typically geared toward minimizing the drug’s harm, said Trogden, the Louisiana counselor: “Maybe some counseling sessions, [introducing] some coping strategies, or education on how to use responsibly,” she said.Sorry, weed probably isn't making you more creativeFor people who consume medical marijuana, the risk of being misdiagnosed with a use disorder is a real threat, said Tammy Chung, an addiction researcher at Rutgers University. They can meet criteria for a use disorder, such as developing withdrawal symptoms and a higher tolerance for THC, despite being under the supervision of a medical provider.“The threshold for cannabis-use disorder is relatively low,” said Chung, who has recommended revamping how the disorder is diagnosed.E.H., a 44-year-old San Francisco-area schoolteacher, was never formally diagnosed with cannabis use disorder but had a medical marijuana card for years. He believes his decades of smoking marijuana day and night affected his life in profound ways. His habit was costing up to $300 a week, and he obsessed about needing to stay high. E.H. stopped using marijuana for a few years — until California legalized recreational marijuana in 2016. He waited in line at a dispensary for hours to buy a celebratory joint, then quickly spiraled back into daily use.AdvertisementToday, he said he has been sober for nearly a year after joining Marijuana Anonymous. But he’s sheepish about telling people about his struggle lest they chide him for betraying the California counterculture cool of his youth.“It feels like if you don’t smoke marijuana, you’re one of the sellouts,” E.H. said.It’s not unusual for people to turn to recreational marijuana products, believing they treat assorted ailments — and doing so without a doctor’s guidance. Smita Das, an addiction psychiatrist at Stanford University, said she encounters patients who use marijuana to treat anxiety.“But what we know is that actually [the marijuana] is probably worsening their anxiety over time,” Das said.Does weed cause anxiety or treat it? Here's what experts sayPeople with more serious addiction issues confront challenges in seeking care, including a lack of affordable treatment and few beds in rehabilitation centers, said Eric A. Voth, a retired addiction specialist and member of the International Academy on the Science and Impact of Cannabis, an organization of doctors that educates about the potential harms of marijuana.Voth said that while criminal courts often mandate treatment, for others living on the streets, “there’s really no one pressing you to get into treatment.”He recalled a 24-year-old man in Colorado living under a bridge and dealing with psychiatric problems exacerbated by marijuana. He was finally accepted into a rehabilitation program that specializes in the intersection of addiction and mental health disorders and improved, but later relapsed on cannabis and then fentanyl.The man’s mother said early recovery was complicated by doctors dismissive of THC playing a role in her son’s mental health crises.“He gets mixed messages in the recovery world and in society, he sure does, too,” said the mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her son’s privacy. “Young people are being told it’s totally safe.”Ben Cort, who leads the Colorado center where the man was treated, acknowledged that activists sounding alarms about the health consequences of cannabis have a credibility problem following a history of racially disparate enforcement of drug laws and exaggerated claims about marijuana’s harmful effects.Advertisement“‘Reefer Madness’ comes out, then the stiff penalties and everybody’s like, ‘It’s weed. What’s the big deal?’” Cort said. “You went from this huge overstatement of risk to this dramatic understatement of risk.”Bothered by weed smell, she sued her neighbor and wonUnlike with opioids, alcohol and even tobacco use disorders, no medication exists to treat marijuana addiction — although that could soon change. On June 8, French biopharmaceutical company Aelis Farma announced promising research on a drug that blocks harmful signals sent by THC to key receptors in the brain, without disrupting those receptors enough to cause harmful psychiatric effects.Volunteers taking the drug reported marijuana had less of an effect, without experiencing withdrawal, said Meg Haney, director of the Cannabis Research Laboratory at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who ran the NIDA-funded study. She said the drug could one day help compulsive users. “There’s evidence to show if you can go from being a daily smoker down to two, three, even four days a week, you already show important changes in your quality of life,” Haney said.For now, treatment revolves around behavioral therapy. The Veterans Health Administration offers patients gift cards for canteen services if they forgo marijuana, a treatment known as contingency management. Health records show the rate of veterans under age 35 diagnosed with the disorder more than doubled between 2005 and 2019.M.B., a 24-year-old from Southern California, credits her recovery to Marijuana Anonymous, modeled after 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Even within those groups, M.B. said, people with marijuana addictions aren’t always taken seriously.“The problems that come up with cannabis-use disorder are very real. This was not always something that was talked about,” she said. “We were sort of laughed out of 12-step spaces.”She smoked daily throughout her teen years before she was diagnosed with cannabis-use disorder when she was about 20. At rock bottom, M.B. said, she smoked or used a vape pen roughly every hour, often waking up at night to take hits. M.B. said she believes her habit led to at least one psychotic episode and to the draining of her finances, even as she lived at home with her parents. She spent so much buying weed that she stole money from family to pay bills.A guide to marijuana terminologyM.B. joined the program online in 2020 during the height of the pandemic, although the withdrawals weren’t easy. For about a week, she couldn’t keep down food, suffered intense headaches and felt so uncomfortable that she showered constantly.“I was really angry, crying all the time,” M.B. said. “I had really intense dreams that I was smoking.”For Courtney, the young mother from Missouri, quitting wasn’t made easier after the state in fall 2022 became the 21st to legalize recreational marijuana. Missouri’s nascent weed industry has boomed — combined sales of recreational and medical marijuana could top $1 billion this year.“You smell it in the air when you’re sitting at a stoplight,” Courtney said.She tried Marijuana Anonymous meetings online, but it wasn’t the right fit. She considered an outpatient treatment center, but the nearest was 45 minutes away — too far to drive while raising a toddler.Instead, her group therapy came in the form of a Reddit forum dedicated to supporting people who want to stop consuming marijuana products. The forum is dotted with stories on the effects of withdrawal, including panic attacks, insomnia and bouts of crying, but also triumphs: long anxiety-relieving walks, regular yoga, improved family time.A few days after detailing her struggles to a reporter, Courtney reflected on the future. Did she want her son growing up to see her smoking marijuana so often? So she smashed her glass pipe and flushed her remaining weed.The cravings weren’t as bad as she feared. But she has suffered irritability, headaches, a loss of appetite, night sweats and vivid dreams. “I still feel like the worst is ahead of me,” Courtney said after five days without using.She and her husband earlier bought tickets to attend a three-day music festival, where the smell of marijuana wafting in the air would be a certainty. They decided to forge ahead with a plan: If she felt uncomfortable, they would leave.The last night of the festival, Courtney relapsed with a smoke. But since then, Courtney says, she has been clean for two months.“I’m doing really well,” she said. “I feel clearheaded and more present.”2747 Comments Gift this article Gift Article WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MARIJUANA HAND CURATED How are marijuana, cannabis and hemp different?

    "commentBody": "Marijuana addiction: those struggling often face skepticism (washingtonpost.com)354 points by andrewl 16  660 commentsneonate 13 hours ago | next [–] https://archive.ph/WePGhextr 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] When I was in my early 20s I would probably say I had a dependence on cannabis. Key for me in transitioning away from that was lower THC % products. It's was as if I wanted to enjoy a single beer after work but the only thing available was everclear. Most vape pens are billed as 85%+ THC. Now, I still enjoy cannabis, but I have a single puff of a vape pen that is around 3% THC (the rest is usually CBD) before bed. Or I take an edible that is 1.5mg THC (very low, edibles are usually sold at 5-10mg doses). It's a much different relationship. I don't feel like my mind is racing out of control, I don't build up a massive tolerance. I sleep fine without it. It's startling to think that a single puff of a 90% pen is literally 30x as much THC.However, these products are disappointingly few and far between. When I walk into a CA dispensary, I actually have to hunt around for them, if they're even available. When I ask, staff members wonder if I'm buying it for my grandmother! It would be great to see the industry refocus on products that are designed to be consumed in moderation.replyjdhn 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] >It would be great to see the industry refocus on products that are designed to be consumed in moderation.I feel that the legal weed industry is speedrunning the past decade of craft brewing. Craft beer focused on growing the scene while focusing on higher and higher ABV beers, but now is transitioning back towards beers that are a bit more sessionable and don’t get you blasted after 2 beers. Wouldn’t be surprised to see the weed industry start focusing on sessionable items sooner rather than later.replyFloatArtifact 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Underlying assumption is that moderation is the issue, however it's addiction for those that can't quit. In layman's terms, the brain's chemistry has been altered permanently. This can happen for some even after the first use THC, opioids, alcohol and you name it.Obviously the progression doesn't happen as fast for some. However, the key being they can't quit in moderation or in excess. Some can abstain for 3 months, some for six, thinking they don't have a problem but then find themselves using even a little. There's a self-rationalization as well as self-centeredness that's part of the disease process of addiction. I would say it's not only a disease process but it is a huge factor. Cross addiction substituting one substance for another is also part of that self-rationalization.replyj16sdiz 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > ... it's addiction for those that can't quit....can't quit without side-effects.Most addicts can stop using immediately with the side-effect that becoming less productive/energetic.For THC, it is relatively easy to mitigate most side effects by adjusting the dose.Modulation is not the key, but helps a lotreplymtreis86 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Cannabis has an inverse relationship between potency and health as alcohol. Drinking a dozen beers is (marginally) less dangerous than a dozen shots, because it takes longer to process and alcohol is a toxin. THC isn't a toxin. The smaller amount you inhale, of smoke or vapor, the better. I'll take a puff of some 90+% vapor any day over having to smoke an entire joint for the same effect.What we need is more accurate vapor delivery devices that can meter better.replyTylerE 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Disagree. Those 12 beers contain a vast amount of carbs that will not be in the liquor.Now, sure, if you slam 12 shots of Cuervo back to back you're going to have a bad time - 12 shots is an entire bottle if you're actually getting full pours.But if you consumed one shot or one beer every hour... no difference in the effects.replybhelkey 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > But if you consumed one shot or one beer every hour... no difference in the effects.Their point is that it is much easier socially to sip a beer slowly over an hour than it is to sip a shot over that same hour.replysublinear 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hah I've known a few people to sip shots at the bar. They don't get shunned for it. It just means people don't buy them a shot.Also most people who take shots aren't trying to get wasted. Drinking a shot the normal way every half hour to an hour alongside always having a beer to sip until done for the night is fairly standard. e.g. about 6 beers and 3 shots over the course of 2 to 4 hours.replyTylerE 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] And of course there are plenty of zero-cal mixers (like seltzer water) that you can add to the liquor and make it as sippable as you want.That's the real play... decent gin, soda water, maybe a splash of lime juice, served on ice in a pint glass (usually ordered as a double or else it's too watery).You up with something as sippable as beer, with fewer calories and zero added sugar. (except a little from the lime, but lime doesn't have that much by fruit standards).PS: Shot glasses are for college students. A glencairn (good luck...) or a rocks glass are far better. Much of the taste comes from smell so you really wanna get those vapors up your nose... at least if you're drinking something worth drinking, and not just trying to get plastered on the cheap.reply_AzMoo 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] All experiences differ of course, but I am going to be wasted if I drink 6 beers and 3 shots over 4 hours. The same volume over 2 hours would probably end up sending me to bed.replybrmgb 55 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > 6 beers and 3 shots over the course of 2 to 4 hoursWhere and in which circle? Because from where I stand it seems very unusual.replyrrrrrrrrrrrryan 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Are these UK shots or US shots? A shot in the US is almost twice as much as a shot in England (1.5oz or 44 mL vs the 25mL shots in England).In California, 6 beers (typical beers averaging 6% abv) + 3 shots (5.5oz of hard alcohol) over 2-4 hours would be straight up alcoholic levels of consumption.replyNursie 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > 6 beers and 3 shots over the course of 2 to 4 hours.Over the course of two hours, that's pretty wasted. Depending on the beer, that might be your entire weekly recommended alcohol intake in two hours.replyTylerE 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I see zero in the GP about social effects. Their comment is addressing (alleged) health concerns and form of consumption.replyarthurbrown 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not sure why edibles are routinely disregarded in many of these discussions. They seem like such an obvious answerreplyvoltaireodactyl 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Inconsistency of dosing has, at least in the past, been a significant concern — especially with regard to medicinal use. Doctors for a long time preferred herb vaporizers (and may still) because it’s frankly just the best way to accurately gauge and dose.replylumost 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Regulation has vastly improved the situation for edibles. You can generally get accurate dosages with precise mixtures in any form factor you desire. However different states have diferring regulation.replyleptons 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Except vaporizing/smoking gives wildly different results depending on the type of plant and its potency. One puff can either do not much or send you spinning, and your supposed tolerance may not even matter. The flower you smoke looks the same no matter if it has 5% THC or 35% THC, so gauging the potency of inhaled THC is practically impossible.Edibles are very consistent, at least today they are. The problem with them is that people are stupid and don't know how to find the right dose responsibly. They take a gummy, it tastes pretty good, and then after 15 or 20 minutes they don't feel anything so they take another, because yum, it tastes like candy so why not. Then it starts to kick in after 30 or 40 minutes and it's double the dose so they feel nauseated and sick.The best way to gauge the effects of an edible dose is to take the edible on an empty stomach, wait about 20 minutes, then eat a meal, and do not take a second dose. After eating your metabolism will get that dose into your blood stream right quick and before you're done with the meal you will definitely be feeling the full effect if you took enough. And if you don't feel much, then the dose is too low. Try again tomorrow. Don't double up the dose in the same sitting, because then you're really not getting an accurate result. Take maybe 1/3 more the next day, try again. If it's still not enough then the next day try a little more. When you find the right dose, then stick to it.replyhuntertwo 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > The flower you smoke looks the same no matter if it has 5% THC or 35% THCI get what you’re saying - but this is not practically true. Weed that contains 35% THC has a lot to do with the conditions it’s grown in which affects a lot of the other physical qualities of the weed. Smell, color, size of nug, density, humidity all are very correlated with potency.replyrightbyte 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How can humidity at sale be correlated with anything but how thick the leaves are and when they were picked?Density is just a measure of humidity in practice and thus pick date.replyleptons 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] And none of that matters to 90% of people going into a dispensary these days. A lot of people who weren't \"stoners\" are going to legal dispensaries and buying whatever the girl at the counter is pushing. They can't tell the smell, color, size, density or anything from one strain to another. Then they smoke too much and get \"the spins\".replyvoltaireodactyl 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Excellent and well-outlined info correcting my outdated understanding — which is also why I noted “in the past” several times in my comment :). Sounds like regulation has allowed for greater edible consistency indeed. AND that people taking too much too quick is still a thing, regardless.That being said, the other side of this (in a pre-legalized world) was that the plants you grew on your own tended to be within a certain potency range, which meant 1 puff roughly equaled another — as opposed to baked goods, where butter could end up spread throughout inconsistently. There’s also the swifter intake-to-feedback loop when smoking/vaping, which made “taking too much” easier to see coming and avoid. Thus my old fashioned POV.replyleptons 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Baked goods usually means pot brownies, but it doesn't matter what type. I fell victim to the delicious brown squares a few times. Then I learned that if I'm going to make a batch of pot brownies, that I need to make 3 batches of brownies with only 1 being \"magic\", or just 1 batch of pot brownies and 3 batches of chocolate chip cookies - because what do you do when you eat some pot brownies? You want to eat more pot brownies, because they're delicious and you have the munchies now.But you're right, it's way easier to not \"overdose\" with inhaled THC than it is with edibles. People just need to approach the two methods differently. Inhaling is instant gratification, where as eating is delayed gratification. Not everyone is capable of delaying gratification because so many people are impatient and impulsive. Edibles are still vastly superior in terms of healthiness so long as they aren't just 95% sugar and 5% THC.Personally, these days I use \"Protabs\" which contain 0 sugar, just THC and a binder (probably corn starch) and the high is extremely clean and clear and completely guilt-free. And the dosage is very reliable and repeatable. There's no guessing involved now that I know my tolerance.replyketzo 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even with licensed products I buy from dispensaries, I just find that the experience is much more inconsistent.I don’t know if that comes down to dosing, or if the body just reacts differently, but either way, it’s just rarely the experience I’m looking for.replylotsoweiners 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Another problem is that they take so long kick in which makes the dosing even more difficult.replytnel77 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What you recently ate can have a big impact. I only bought from reputable brands that had consistent dosages, but my diet could make two doses of the same gummy feel quite different night to night.replyTylerE 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Out of curiosity... what did you find produced a very noticeable difference from baseline in either direction?replyblueprint 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] mark my words.. vapor cartridges are probably way more dangerous to lungs than smokereplytmpz22 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've had a severe lung infection for 3+ months due to vaping and am still recovering.I know its just an anecdote but people YOU ONLY GET ONE PAIR OF LUNGS and they heal differently then other parts of your body (or they don't heal at all - COPD is TERMINAL).replyDiggyJohnson 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed. Quitting smoking (THC) and vaping have been the two healthiest decisions I’ve ever made. I was also having breathing issues, though thankfully never as acute an issue as you did.replysenttoschool 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Did you ever use a bong for smoking or vaping?replyjack_pp 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Idk about cannabis but I hear this all the time with cigarettes vs vaping and I just know it's a bunch of FUD.I can not smoke cigarettes, never liked them, always got headaches from them.

Most US craft beer fans' palates, and the commensurate offerings from craft breweries, are so jacked up that they don't even realize how distant they are from something I'm interested in drinking. The styles of the same name offered by US craft breweries are so extra compared to their namesake styles that they're totally different animals.I'm not going to lie-- I'm also put off by some vibes in the craft beer scene has taken on in the past 10 or 15 years. When many craft beer fans see me order a classic European pilsner, with shocking frequency they a) attempt to shame me for ordering such a 'boring' beer, b) assume they need to educate me about this amazing thing called craft beer that I've clearly never encountered before, or c) assume my palate is unsophisticated. Like... listen bro... I'm a classically trained chef-- I've spent more time actively developing my palate than you've spent even thinking about it. I can tell you things you didn't know about the beer you're drinking based solely on your breath. Some very big names in craft beer were my multiple-times-per-week drinking buddies for years. I'm glad you've cultivated a passion for a locally-made food/bev product... now go be smug about your foamy bug spray juice elsewhere. lolreplyArrath 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] An old strip from the newsprint comic Zits has always stuck in my mind.

Before I talked to my doctor I was increasing my dosages and it felt like an endless uphill battle to get to the point I could sleep comfortably.I'm not sure if you're looking for recreational or medicinal, but if it's medicinal the key is to have a regiment.

It’s easier to find low-but-not-0 THC flower than oil cartridges IME, and if you can’t find them, you can just pack less.

AK Futures LLC v. Boyd Street Distro, LLC, 9th Cir. No. 2-56113 (May 19, 2022):Importantly, the only statutory metric for distinguishing controlled marijuana from legal hemp is the delta-9 THC concentration level. In addition, the definition extends beyond just the plant to “all derivatives, extracts, [and] cannabinoids.” 7 U.S.C. § 1639o(1). The use of “all” indicates a sweeping statutory reach. See Lambright v. Ryan, 698 F.3d 808, 817 (9th Cir. 2012) (“The common meaning of the word ‘all’ is ‘the whole amount, quantity, or extent of; as much as possible’ . . . .” (quoting All, Merriam-Webster (online ed., visited Oct. 4, 2012))). This seemingly extends to downstream products and substances, so long as their delta-9 THC concentration does not exceed the statutory threshold.Of course, as this was on an appeal of a denial of a preliminary injunction, the ruling is framed in likelihood of success rather than absolute terms, but its a pretty strong negative indicator for your argument that this is a clearly incorrect interpretation that no court would take seriously, since both the District Court and the Circuit Court very much took it seriously.replymarssaxman 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Who would waste their time litigating such a case when the legalization trend is so clear?

I live in a state that very, very much still calls all use of marijuana illegal except for some very specific and tightly controlled medical uses (i.e. it's not like \"hey doc, can you just write me a 'script\" like other states), yet I can still walk into a very nice, clean, well-maintained store in a plain strip mall and:1. Buy D9 gummies and other edibles that contain up to 50mg D9 THC. Basically, since the law defines hemp as containingit's weird to me how people don't know that weed is legal nationwide in the US.Yes, this. I bought some D9 gummies on a whim after seeing a prominent NASCAR driver racing in a full body wrap ad for an online distributor (3Chi). I didn’t really think much of it but figured I’d try it out. And, uh, wow. It’s literally identical to eating a gummy that you might buy in a shop in Cali, Colorado, etc.I’ve been trying to tell people this, and that weed is effectively federally legal as long as you stick to this set of rules.

I live in a country where it is legalized, so our gummies are usually 10mg. You can also buy 5mg and 2mg mainly for medical or lightweight use, and usually have an extra dose of CBD.Having said that eating 2 20mg gummies to get high, or a handful of weaker ones that still add up to 20mg to get high, results in the same thing (as you've mentioned). Most people can easily, and happily, eat a handful of gummies.I guess that law is why our packaging also includes the concentrations for the whole package as well as the per-unit concentrations - to make some of it saleable in the parts of the US with the type of laws your describing.Federally legal weed is a cash cow for the government and provinces here alike. Sadly it's hard to profit for the producers, so the stock market value is terrible.Imagine a government that can make it hard to profit off of weed! Pretty shocking on its own. So full legalization is a \"damned if you do; damned if you don't\" situation for producers.replyhn_throwaway_99 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, to clarify, the D9 gummies I see here are always 10mg. 50mg is only sold in things like brownies or rice krispies treats that are intended to be shared or eaten in multiple servings.Of course, the problem with a pot brownie is that I may start intending to only eat a quarter of it but then somehow it all ends up getting eaten pretty quickly...replydi456 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 40mg is a huge dose, no?replydrekk 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It depends on a lot of factors, such as your body weight and tolerance. In university a 10mg edible would put me on a nice high for hours. Nowadays I'd need to consume at least 40mg to even feel it. To answer your question though 40mg is a large dose, especially for someone who hasn't used cannabis with frequency. I recommend most people start out with 5-10mg.What I find really fascinating is that the route of administration can affect your tolerance even if the potency theoretically should be the same. If you consume edibles often (eg for health reasons) you'll find you increasingly need larger and larger doses until it plateaus somewhere. If you \"switch it up\" and consume the same quantity via, say, a concentrate you vaporize, it'll hit you a lot harder. Even if you don't change the route of administration but the circumstances (like a new location) there's a similar effect.replyfreedomben 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's what I thought too when I read that.

Even the DEA accepts this, though the DEA seems to have adopted a view unsupported by the text of the law that things that don’t naturally occur in cannabis but meet the inclusive description in the law’s text aren’t legalized as hemp, which leads to controversy around some synthetic cannabinoids, where the DEA view and the text of the law (and some emerging case law) seem at odds.replyhn_throwaway_99 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I guess the thing that surprised.me is that I thought the majority of THC in \"normal\" marijuana was in the form of THCA anyway.I remember reading an article years ago (well before 2018) that basically said \"to make the THC in marijuana available in a way that gives pleasurable effects, it must first be decarboxylated, which is why it needs to be heated before being consumed.\" So from that I thought that most of the stuff that was sold as weed (again, pre 2018) was in the form of THCA anyway.replytonyarkles 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, having a look at a random bag of legal Canadian weed here, it shows:- THC 3.1mg/g- THC Total 229.6 mg/g- CBD 0 mg/g- CBD Total: 0.8mg/gSo yeah, I guess if you were to eat the whole bag raw you might get a bit of a buzz from it (1/8oz / 3.5g bag ~= 10mg before decarb)replytime0ut 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I’ll preface this by saying I don’t think there is anything wrong with using cannabinoids in general. I don’t personally, but find the industry fascinating.The farm bill opened the doors to a lot of other stuff besides legal D9 gummies and high THCA flower. Companies are selling an ever increasing number of cannabinoids. Some are found in tiny trace amounts in nature, others are completely novel. What they all have in common is they are unstudied, unregulated, and created via various chemical synthesis processes from base cannabinoids. It seems like a ticking time bomb.replyyesiamyourdad 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Thank you for this point this is really interesting. I had a friend who is a recovering alcoholic living in TX. He would talk about going to get CBD gummies, and sometimes he'd say something about \"wow, I took too many, I got messed up!\". I was thinking \"what a crackpot, you don't get high off CBD\", I live in a legal state and I've taken CBD-only products. He came to live with me for a while and one day came home saying he'd bought some CBD. I asked him to show it to me, it was just regular 10mg THC gummies. Now this guy had a shaky relationship with the truth, but I thought THC was totally illegal in TX. This explains what was happening, I'm sure he actually was buying THC products.Also, we smoked a joint together, and it was kind of scary. I've smoked my share of pot with lots of people, and I've never seen it affect someone like this. Not long after he moved away I read something else on here tying THC to schizophrenia. This guy was already bipolar but his affect under THC was different and really bothered me - I wouldn't smoke with him anymore after that one time. I'm no psychologist, but schizophrenic is how I'd describe his reaction to it.I'll add that skepticism follows most addictions. I do have a problem with alcohol and this is part of the AA literature: only alcoholics understand an aloholic's relationship with alcohol. I've sat through enough meetings to know it. Lots of people in my life have asked \"why can't you just stop at one or two?\", the answer is that my brain handles it differently from theirs.replycrtified 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] \"[some peoples] brains handle it differently from [others]\" seems to also be describe the weed-schizophrenia relationship.Like you I've been in my share of situations, and been with a few people who've had that schizophrenic reaction. However, and not to defend cannabis, but all such situations (people) were complex and with many contributing factors, e.g. concurrent alcohol abuse, home and social issues, traumatic events.I expect that a weight of scientific study can eventually discover the nuance, but legal and moral prohibitions dictate that usage far outstrips research.replytriyambakam 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] He may have misunderstood or lied but I can tell you I clearly know the difference between cannabinoids and I have purposefully gotten very high off of CBD alone many many times.

So the new \"high TCHA flower\" is not higher TCHA than normal, simply lower pure THC than normal.Craziest part is you can buy the high TCHA flower and the D9 Edibles online, shipped through USPS, and you just pay standard sales tax (not a sin tax like you would in a legal state).replynewtwilly 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I've also heard that THCA breaks down into THC over time, so maybe there's a chance that when it's shipped it's compliant with the Hemp bill, but some time later if the cops seize and test it, then you actually now have illegal cannabis in your possession. Not sure to what extent that is true, but seems reasonable.replydocandrew 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It’s still illegal for federal/military employees or anyone with a security clearance - at some point the government will have to reconcile this discontinuity.

Skepticism is exactly how I would describe it. It's not strictly stigma, like is the case for most people who talk about drug addiction. It's most often a reaction of surprise, disbelief, and then resentment, like I'm a sleeper agent for reefer madness propaganda that they've just uncovered. Normally when you admit to a previous drug addiction that's had lasting impacts on you, the \"bad result\" is \"Wow, I can't believe you're a druggie\". With cannabis it's more like \"Wow, I don't believe that that happened actually, weed is safe girl, it cures cancer\".

It won't kill you like alcohol withdrawals will or make you agitated like nicotine will. So then it must be okay right? These same potheads will quote studies and news articles talking about the benefits or just how risk free it is.Its very similar to the way a functional alcoholic will justify their drinking. They even use avoidance language. 20 years ago we called it weed, now we call it \"cannabis\". Oh, you're not addicted to weed you're just using cannabis every hour of every day. I think legalization didn't help, nor hurt, but the re-branding of weed as \"cannabis\" while biologically correct gave these type of people a get out of jail free card. If you don't believe me, say to yourself \"I smoke weed 8 times a day\" versus \"I use cannabis 8 times a day\". One of them makes you sound like a degenerate, one of them makes you sound like you take a medication. That difference is very important in justifying addiction in the mind of an addict.replytwelve40 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] > Of course, when confronted, they say it's not addictive and they dont have a problem.

He said they spend \"the majority of their day high\". That's a \"very serious\" addiction, because their dependence of the drug is erecting defenses in the conscious mind to the denial of the reality that they probably can't stop. On the contrary, if for example I need to take an SSRI to keep depression at bay, I would be perfectly content to tell you that I had a major depressive disorder, and that the drug helps me stay functional - I'm diagnosed, treated, and aware of the fact. Also contrarily, if I smoke a joint every Friday night with my wife after the kids go to bed because we want to relax, but if we can get a baby sitter we'll jump at the chance to go out for a night on the town without weed, then I'm not addicted - I just use the drug situationally because it's my preferred option.replysdwr 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, everyone has addictions.For example, smiling can be addictive.

Denying that you have a cannabis addiction says nothing at all about any other addictions you may or may not have.They were talking specifically about cannabis addiction, and suggesting that denial that you have a cannabis addiction is a sign of having a cannabis addiction. (However, this doesn't really make sense because people who are not addicted to cannabis will equally claim to not be addicted to cannabis.)replyCthulhu_ 39 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Maybe not an addiction in the sense that they get shakes and sweats when they quit cold turkey (or risk death), but definitely a dependence that I see in a lot of people; a dependence on weed just to be able to relax.But the side effect of being high all the time is indifference. Things can wait.I don't think the wording makes much of a difference, that's like saying \"I drink\" vs \"I imbibe alcohol\". Or as South Park said it, \"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six, it's called a tasting and it's classy\".But it does become dangerous when people think of it as medicinal, as a kind of self-medication. Some people need it, for sure, but for a lot of people it's self-medicating without dealing with the root issues.But then there's plenty of examples of self-medicating, ranging from sugar, energy drinks, video games, alcohol, sex, work, etc.replymesse 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > As we know this is the first sign of a very serious addiction.Isn't denying an addiction when told one has an addiction also the first sign of not having an addiction? \"Methinks the lady doth protest too much\" works well and good for a play, but doesn't really meet the traditional standards for evidence.replyTerr_ 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, this sounds like a Catch-22 of substance use: If you deny you have a problem, that proves the problem exists. If you affirm you have a problem, that's also proof the problem exists.> There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind.

Given that someone has an addiction problem, they're far more likely to overcome it if they acknowledge it is a problem. If they don't currently acknowledge, then things will probably get worse before they can get better.

As we know this is the first sign of a very serious addiction.The first sign of an addiction (at least, the first which is visible to an outside observer) is that it interferes with your life and you won't stop. Until about a week ago, I was a heavy daily cannabis user for a very long time (more than ten years). If you had asked me if I had an addiction, I would have said no.Recently I came to believe I had Cannaboid Hyperemesis Syndrome, a disease for which the only cure is to quit cannabis. So I quit - immediately. I have a gigantic pile of weed in the house (I had just bought more when I started having symptoms), and I pass by it everyday. I just shake my head and go, \"darn, wish I could smoke that,\" and go about my day.That's not a story you're going to hear from an addict.That's not to minimize the experience of people who do experience a cannabis addiction.

I am not a doctor or qualified to give medical advice.]I appreciate the advice.I'm honestly a terrible person to ask, I preferred THC strains and never tried CBD products, and I mostly bought the most potent stuff which was on sale. It's also hard for me to judge dosage because I have developed a really high tolerance.When I first started smoking it had a completely different effect on me, including visual hallucinations. Over time & with heavy use (which I don't necessarily recommend) the effects mellowed out a lot. So take things with a grain of salt, my experience may not be indicative of what your experience with CBD products would be.I would say to make sure you're purchasing from a reputable dispensary, start with the smallest dosage (I've noticed people sometimes even cut up their gummies to get a smaller dose than is commercially available, for example.), and experiment. I know that's very generic advice, but the older I get and the more I learn, the less confident I am that I can understand how cannabis will effect other people. If I had to recommend a starting dose to someone, knowing very little about them, I'd probably say 5mg. But again I have low confidence in my ability to recommend a dose.For me it had two primary benefits:1.) As a \"rescue inhaler,\" it could terminate panic attacks and sometimes shorten depressive episodes by helping me escape repetitive cycles of thought. I cannot promise it will work this way for everyone, for some people it could make them paranoid and ruminative.2.) Reducing the incidence of repetitive anxious thoughts like, \"I should have worded that email differently, they're going to think X of me, this is just like that time you did something embarrassing in high school.\" Again, cannot promise anything.replyqup 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How is your anxiety now, if I may ask?

The euphoria is a pleasing side effect, but not something I think about when I'm not experiencing it. It's common for me to go weeks at a time without having any, just because I didn't think to.I think there could be a genetic factor here.

As we know this is the first sign of a very serious addiction.No, saying you don’t have an addiction may be a common thing addicts (and non-addicts!) do, but its not even close to the first sign of addiction. Or even a recognized symptom. Or even a recognized danger sign that would call for more intense screening. Its not a useful indicator of addiction at all.> 20 years ago we called it weed, now we call it \"cannabis\".“Weed”/“pot\"/“ganja”/etc. are sonewhat vague slang. “Marijuana” and “hemp” are legal categories. “Cannabis” is a correct, precise term that encompasses both hemp and marijuana.replyhaswell 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I agree with most of what you're saying here about this being a comparison problem.The one area of major disagreement is regarding the \"cannabis\" designation. For me, this term is associated with the opposite connotation. When I started taking its effects more seriously, I started using the cannabis word because I feel it lends more respect to the plant. This wasn't originally my idea, and so I'm not alone in this.This respect was part of my own mindset shift on usage away from habitual use. A way to remind myself to take it seriously, and to partake intentionally if/when I do.Most people I know are pretty aware of their \"problem\" but have no intention of changing it. Calling it one thing over another might be a form of self deception for a few, but self deception will always find some answer.> It won't kill you like alcohol withdrawals will or make you agitated like nicotine will. So then it must be okay right? These same potheads will quote studies and news articles talking about the benefits or just how risk free it is.I do think we have major issues with how we paint these different groups. When someone is an alcoholic, they gain sympathy and support from society proportional to their maladaptive behaviors and/or willingness to address the issue.\"Potheads\" is almost always derogatory, and I don't think people who struggle with this are seen in the same light as people who struggle with other drugs of abuse, and it's not surprising considering the pretty clear misconceptions the public has about cannabis as a whole.And I think this is important to note, because one of the #1 emotional factors that leads to continued maladaptive substance use is shame. Society has progressed quite a bit towards supporting and celebrating people who struggle with drugs/alcohol. I don't think society has done the same with cannabis. Attitudes are closer to \"they're just lazy and it's not even addictive so what's their problem?\".replypstuart 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is how \"drug education\" has failed us.The status quo is \"drugs are bad, m'kay?\" and \"drinking is fine, everybody does it, just don't drive when drunk\".The way forward should be understanding the following:* Let's use the word \"drug\" for any compound that alters your state of mind for recreational purposes. * Some of these drugs have medical value, but in this context it is about recreational use. * Everybody is different in how they respond to a drug * Most drugs are dangerous when consumed to excess * Most drugs can impair your thinking and should not be used in unsafe conditions * Some drugs can be dangerous due to adulterants (e.g., fentanyl) * One should be mindful in how they consume drugs (not under peer pressure, not appropriate time/place, etc) * If you are going to use a drug, treat it as dessert rather than a meal* Addiction is possible/likely when one consumes a drug frequently in a short amount of time, or by consistent use of it * Addiction can be overcome but it requires serious effort and can be *very* discomforting * The first high is often the \"best\", and trying to capture that again can lead to addiction * If you think you have a problem with drugs, you probably do, and should seek help in addressing your problem * If you are an addict and you break your addiction you cannot return even once to using againI'm sure there's room for improvement there, but it's a start.Edit: tweaked a tad based on inputreplyhaswell 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The cultural roots of drinking are deep, and while I agree that alcohol enjoys a seemingly protected status, I don't know that blanket labeling everything \"drugs\" is a step forward.I think this kind of abstraction is what gets people into risky situations. I'd rather we raised awareness across the board about the benefits and repercussions of the popular substances of choice. Some general rules of thumb are good, but less compelling than direct information about the ways things can go wrong, and ultimately not useful in the moment of choosing \"do I partake?\".I think most people understand that some drugs are dangerous and some are not. But the drug conversation has been so dishonest for so long, that people struggle to assess what is real/true, or what to take seriously. I don't think people will take seriously anything that collapses mind altering substances under that single umbrella.I think there are strong arguments to be made that psychedelics - especially psilocybin - deserve to remain in a category of their own. To associate them with \"drugs\" broadly seems counterproductive at a time when we're finally seeing research dollars pour into the field, and the effects of these compounds doesn't seem comparable with other recreational drugs. And no one gets addicted to psilocybin, but there are some very real risks that users need to know about.replyAnimats 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > alcohol enjoys a seemingly protected statusWell, the US tried Prohibition. Drunkenness went down and crime went up.replypstuart 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I could have done better on the initial definition -- the key context is \"recreational\" use.It's incredibly important that we collectively recognize that alcohol is a drug. More so, recent research shows that it has zero health benefits. We need to understand the extensive damage it does to society -- not to demonize or prohibit it, but to give context to when pearl clutching happens about other drugs.Likewise, people should understand the history of the War on Drugs and be aware of the real reason they came about (spoiler: to oppress their users).It is true that psychedelics can have incredible therapeutic value, but they can also be a lot of fun (I certainly consumed them in that context when I was much younger). Cannabis can be added to that list, as well as others.So yes, let's be entirely honest about the subject (which I'm trying to do). We can't wish them away, so let's deal with it like rational adults and minimize the risks of harm.replymaxbond 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this is a great list.

The rational side almost never wins and I'll be in a daily usage cycle for months.That being said I think it's an easier drug to break the cycle of with planning, since it only takes a few days of no use to dramatically improve my chances of resisting and honestly, if I didn't suffer from poor memory performance, I'd be okay as a daily smoker.

It doesn't interfere with my work performance, and I tell myself it's better than if I were drinking or whatever, but it has definitely become a compulsion and I basically can't regulate my usage if I have it available in the house. Lately I've gotten a little timed lock box to force myself to take breaks which I'm kind of ashamed to have to resort to, but it's helping me keep a better balance.I will also say - and maybe this is more self-justification - but while I definitely cannot really do focused productive software work while stoned, I really do think that it puts me in a more creative mind-space and helps me see alternatives I wouldn't otherwise. I often go for a long hike after work and get stoned and stumble upon an approach to a work or life problem that's bouncing around in my head that I would not have otherwise.replyjjulius 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >... but it has definitely become a compulsion and I basically can't regulate my usage if I have it available in the house.I just replied to the OP myself, but I can definitely agree with this. When I first quit earlier in the year, I noticed that I'd be sitting on the couch watching TV or chatting with my wife in the evening, and I'd have this innate urge to get up, go to the garage and go smoke. It didn't even feel like I was consciously thinking I needed to get high, it had just become such a habit to do that in those moments. I had to re-train myself to ask, \"Okay, why?\" before actually doing it, and more often than not I couldn't justify the actual act of getting stoned in that moment beyond, \"Well... to just be stoned,\" and that didn't seem like a good enough excuse to me, making it quite easy to fight the urge.But YMMV, of course.replyNursie 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I noticed that I'd be sitting on the couch watching TV or chatting with my wife in the evening, and I'd have this innate urge to get up, go to the garage and go smokeOne of the longer lasting effects of quitting tobacco was the urge at random times to get up and go outside.

Depends a lot on your overall usage pattern.Right now I only really smoke once a month at most, when the opportunity presents itself. In these cases, I'm obviously completely non-functional under the influence. But I also smoke a lot less because I have no tolerance, I feel pretty much completely fine the next day, possibly even better than usual, because the resulting night of REM suppressed sleep gives me a jolt of antidepressant effect without the downsides of sleep deprivation.If I'm in a binging mode, it means I have a huge tolerance, smoke a ton more, and honestly it takes at 2-3 weeks of abstinence before I'm back to baseline for working memory, possibly longer.But paradoxically, if I'm in such a binge, I'm probably more functional if I've had my morning smoke compared to skipping it for the day, because abstaining would then cause me to be highly irritable and unable to focus on anything in addition to the state of temporary dementia I'd be in. And since there's a massive tolerance, one dose won't have acute deleterious effects to the same degree.replyboredemployee 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Things go over my head.

At the beginning of the year I went cold turkey after consuming cannabis on a daily basis for about three years straight. At the time, I was plowing through at least ~4000mg of tincture (~150mg/dose) and ~2oz of flower in a single month - my frequent use meant that even one bong rip would do nothing, I'd need at least 5 or so to even reach the point where I'd go, \"Oh, I think I'm stoned now, maybe?\". Went cold turkey for a month and when I ate 20mg it rocked my world, and a single rip would kick my ass for an entire evening.>That being said I think it's an easier drug to break the cycle of with planning...Yep, this is what's worked best for me. I ended up using daily for a week earlier this summer and it was wild to me that I could watch my use go from one bong rip on a Monday rocking my world, to needing 3 or 4 rips the following Friday to get to the same level. Now, what works for me, is buying only a tiny amount at a time and saying, \"Okay, this is gonna be used at X event, Y event and Z event over the next two months\". If I'm an idiot and use it up before the end of that time, oh well, no more until then.replyInvertedRhodium 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I'm 20 years deep in at least every-other-day usage (since I was 16), with breaks whenever I have to travel for work.

It's well presented in the ad but:- that removable veggie holder in the door looks crazy heavy and super awkward to put back in place (lining up at a sharp angle while gripping likely slick sides)- you have to open the refrigerator door to get at the freezer- the door compartments are narrow and probably can't handle odd sized containers- the shelves have holes in them so anything that drips off that uncovered plate of food gets all over everything below it- the ice ejector is completely unnecessary in our current world of ice makers. I doubt that fridge has a water line coming into it- the shelves don't look like they have adjustable height so you're stuck with 3 shelves that can't fit a gallon of milkreplyUncleMeat 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] Yeah the only two features that this fridge has that my fridge doesn't have are the pull out shelves and the removable bin for vegetables.I've got no idea why you'd really want the removable bin for vegetables. Carry all my veggies over to the sink first and then pick out the ones I want? And look at how small that thing is.Pull out shelves seem nice I guess, but they'd only be useful on lower shelves. My fridge seems to be about a foot taller than the one in the video. This person wouldn't be tall enough to see all the stuff on the top shelf if it were pulled out.replymasklinn 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Does your fridge not have crisper bins for veggies? I've had that in pretty much all my fridges, and the bins are always easily removable.Pull-out shelves not so much (all the fridges I've had, had adjustable but \"locked\" glass shelving, I would assume for hygiene as a glass shelf is much easier to clean regularly or after a spill, plus they don't block light so much), but they are available on expensive or professional fridges.replyVectorLock 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The pull out fridge doesn't even seem that great, I just think of shit sliding off the back or you push them in and then you push everything off the front.replyciex 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My fridge has pull-out shelves.

It gives that \"nifty!\" impression, but I don't think it would be so useful in practise. Especially, I don't think the vegetables would keep well in that box. When I replaced my older (90s) fridge, vegetables kept much better in the new one, which had ciculation of air that the older fridge missed, and thus better humidity control. I suspect that tight box would not be good for durability of freshness.replyBroken_Hippo 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] - you have to open the refrigerator door to get at the freezerNot to mention that this freezer is likely: 1. Not self-defrosting, and likely to build up ice since you open the door each time you open the fridge. 2. Definitely less convenient. I have a fairly cheap, small refrigerator - one that fits in my attic apartment - and the freezer has pull-out drawers. Since it sits under the fridge, this is usually nice.replyozim 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Imagine how much hassle it is to wash that veggie container in sink.How much gunk can get into shelves rails.I clean fridge twice a year and would like not to do it more often.Modern fridges are optimized for easy cleaning.replysnotrockets 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Not to mention that it has an on/off compressor, much less efficient than modern, inverter ones.replyjoshuamorton 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I was able to find a print ad for this thing[0], and it has 9.5 cubic feet of storage.

The 'teaching' part mostly means it has a more accurate and detailed temperature gauge.This gas oven is so heavy that light in the kitchen gravitationally lenses around it, but it's still going strong and the best oven I ever used.replyethbr0 19 hours ago | parent | next [–] I have a Sunbeam Radiant Control toaster that still works flawlessly.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1OfxlSG6q5YThey used a shielded bimetalic thermostat to measure the radiant heat coming from the toast surface, instead of a timer, to establish doneness (consistently toasting despite heating element variance) and implemented the mechanical lowering & raising of toast without a single motor (which is why 60+ year old examples still work).replystickfigure 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've lived with two of these (at home growing up, and later via a roommate) and I hated both of them.The toast slot is too narrow. You can't heat a bagel - well, technically you can force it in there, but it won't come back out with some help from a utensil.They get flakey and you end up bouncing the toast a dozen times to get it to lower. Yes, I know there's an adjustment, but it's finicky and annoying. It's a toaster for crying out loud.Yes, the design is ingenious, but there's a good reason they aren't made anymore.replyMostlyStable 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm pretty sure that the reason they stopped getting made was influx of dramatically cheaper toasters, at a time when the idea of paying top dollar for premium kitchen tools was not very common. I'm also pretty sure that fixing all of your issues would not be hard with a modern re-design. It would just result in a ~$100+ toaster. The crazy thing is is that _there are more expensive toasters than that_, that are basically identical to cheap toasters except they look better. I'd _gladly_ pay $100 for a new toaster that had the features of the Sunbeam and was well made enough to not have the finicky features bits you mention. And paying for premium kitchen tools is _common_ now, to the point where even people who don't really care about cooking will still have a KitchenAid Stand Mixer and a Vitamix Blender.replyJohnFen 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Toasters are one of the more obvious appliances to show how bad things have become. Outside of getting one of those conveyor-belt continuous restaurant toasters, I simply cannot find a new toaster at any price point that does a good job of making toast.Even low-end toasters from the '60s outperform high-end toasters these days.replyXajniN 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I bought this thing [1] a few years ago, still works very well with consistent results.

You could probably make the slot wider, but it's still a 100% analog device that operates via heat expansion of metals. The adjustment is going to be finicky. People expect toasters to \"just work\" without maintenance.As soon as you add digital electronics to automate the analog adjustment... why bother with the complicated analog part?The only major advantage this toaster has over a spring/timer device is that the toast (usually, but not always) goes down by itself. Pushing down on a toaster spring just doesn't seem like that much of an inconvenience.Have you ever owned one of these things? Did you genuinely like it?replyMostlyStable 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That is not even close to the biggest advantage. The biggest advantage is the sensor instead of a timer for how long to toast. If I had to pick one advantage, it would be that one. The fact that it also means that the raising/lowering is automatic is gravy in my opinion.replystickfigure 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Have you actually owned one of these machines? They do not, in my experience (two different units over many years) toast more reliably than other toasters. The primitive analog \"sensor\" just isn't that accurate and a simple timer actually turns out to be pretty effective.replyethbr0 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've yet to get a bad piece of toast out of mine, in comparison to other toasters I've owned.The lack of bagel-width is annoying, but widening the slot on a redesign shouldn't impact any other components.replyDANmode 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] ...is it because people are trying to jam shit in them other than toast? ;]Ovens and toaster ovens are where bagels \"belong\" - otherwise, you just end up with a sloppy toast-hole that may or may be great at cooking toast!replybern4444 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What if you only want 1 piece of toast and not two?

I don't know what the impact parameter is either, but given these two expressions, it sounds like b is dimensionless.I don't know how fast the radius of curvature drops off as a function of the Schwarzschild radius, but I'd imagine it's at least R^-1. So assuming a spherical cow^H^H^H oven with gravitational lensing dying out at ~100x the event horizon, we need a Schwarzschild radius the size of a tennis ball in order to still see the curvature a few metres out. The oven needs to weigh ~4x the Earth's mass for that.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radiusreplytreeman79 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There is also Superman’s key.

Depending on your distance from the object, just plug in some numbers.Say at the earth-moon distance 384400 km the object must be about 24x the mass of the sun to bend the incoming light at one arcminute (~0,0002909rad).The sun actually bends light at about 2 arcseconds as seen from Earth; the focal point would be about 542x the distance Sun-Earth. [1]Alternatively the object of say 1m^3 volume at a distance of 10 meters will bend light by 1 arcminute if it weighs 3.27x10^16 kg, the density of about 1/10th of a neutron star.To conclude: one will be instantly overwhelmed by the gravitational forces before being able to see an object bend light with one own eyes. That's why this kind of extreme bending/lending is reserved for galaxy clusters.[0]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens#Explanation...[1]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_gravitational_lensreplyadolph 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > On a serious note, how heavy does an object have to be for lensing or bending to be noticeable with a naked eye?22 grams.

If you regularly need industrial quantities of ice cubes, getting a quarter-size (100L) chest freezer seems like a better idea.

Also, the quality improvements that emissions controls had on cars didn’t happen for white goods. Cars were hit with emissions AND safety standards, which raised prices.For appliances instead they incentivize things like all electronic controls (more prone to failure with rough service or high heat), and undersizing components.

Some of it becomes unreliable or unsuited for daily use. Fine, keep your linens in that old dresser, but using it daily will hasten its end - that one drawer is barely together, after all.Not to mention that some of these things are just not usable in modern society. An old desk might be pretty, but it wasn't designed with a computer in mind. Good luck fitting your great-grandmother's dining room table in your small dining room. It was made for 8, and you have a family of three. Beds with a metal boxspring built into the frame aren't as comfortable to sleep on as you might imagine and can be quite squeaky. Some old furniture just won't fit in your abode either - and boy, oh boy is some of it absolutely filthy.Sometimes you can fix this stuff, if you have the time and space and equipment to do so. Many folks don't.And of course lots of folks replace cars. In most places in the US, you can't survive without a vehicle. A vehicle that breaks down is a vehicle that can get you fired. It is much easier to keep up with an older car if you don't have to rely on it. And again, you still have issues with having to be able to have the time, space, and tools to work on it - and you might need to have enough strength.And so on.replymholm 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > You only buy new when the old one breaks down right?

The ones on the door would easily break and the other ones could be easily pulled (sending every other thing on that shelf on the floor) if something got stuck.The door shelves also having all of those compartments lead to much poorer local cooling and are arguably worse for hygiene.In other words: there's reason why we moved from these designs, they had pros and cons and the focus was price and power efficiency.replyhoosieree 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] These are valid points, yet anecdotally it seems like modern fridges are less reliable and require more frequent replacement. Old fridges were \"inefficient\" because they didn't have an integrated variable speed motor and control board. But modern fridges seem to suffer a critical failure of some mysterious component 2 months after their warranty expires. This component can only be fixed by replacing the entire control board, and that's half the cost of a new one. Wouldn't you rather just buy a new one?But if you zoom out, is it globally more efficient to trash the whole fridge every 5 years, or use an \"inefficient\" fridge with replaceable parts for 40 years?Modern appliances are all slowly heading in the same direction.It starts with DRM on replaceable items like water filters. Then un-mutable advertisements playing on the screen. Then subscription fees for \"options\". Then subscription fees for things like being able to open the doors. Then fridge-as-a-service where you rent the entire fridge and the fridge vendor resells your personal information to anyone and everyone.There will be a \"vintage replica\" premium market for rich hipsters to enjoy the luxury of a fridge without any of these features. But this market will be short-lived. The vintage fridges are just modern fridges dressed up in vintage sheet metal. They buy their critical components from the same wholesalers as the DRM vendors, so eventually they'll be compelled to put in the same features. Maybe they'll be permitted to use an old-timey font on a round touchscreen with a chrome bezel, to maintain the vintage vibe.I picture the execs of these companies studying Black Mirror episodes in darkened boardrooms... \"Are you writing this down, Dave?

Wouldn't it be possible to create way more energy efficient model that has an outside body? Or even better connects to the AC body you already have outside? Like in the summer it would \"help\" the AC by being another AC itself, and in the winter it would effectively be \"free\" as it got its cold from the outside.I'm sure there's a reason nobody has attempted this (complexity / price) but was just wondering what the data point on something like this would be? Presumably with modern buildings this could be reduced accommodated, especially with geothermal AC being on the rise right now, would be cool to have all your heat pump systems connected to a single loop, sharing efficiency.replyLorenPechtel 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] While I really like the idea of a split system approach you run into some big installation issues. Namely, the refrigerant is a restricted product that can only be handled by licensed professionals.Thus, what I would like to see is a system where the refrigerator has two air pipes to the outside and a concept of heating/cooling load. It would have an ambient temperature thermostat that would say to reject heat indoors if it's below X degrees in the room, otherwise reject it to the outdoors. It would also have the concept of using outdoor air in lieu of it's compressor if it was cold enough.(And I would like to see an integrated HVAC temperature control, also--you set the minimum, ideal and maximum temperatures. If ambient air can be used in lieu of power it does so--and stops at the ideal temperature rather than the limit temperature. Instead of heat/cool/off settings you have on/vacation/off, in vacation mode it only enforces the minimum and maximum and ignores the ideal and it has different settings for minimum and maximum. And, yes, I want a maximum when on vacation--I don't want to bake the insides at the 110F that could easily happen in the summer here.)replyhoosieree 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I wonder if it would be worthwhile to water-cool the refrigerator's condenser coils, and use the heated water as input for a dishwasher or kitchen sink.replyajot 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > Wouldn't it be possible to create way more energy efficient model that has an outside body?Lots of shops (think mostly of butchers, charcuterie or take-away restaurants) here in Argentina do this, I think mostly to avoid all that heat and noise being trapped in the premises.replytzs 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Or if not outside, I wonder if you could dump the heat someplace inside that is better than just dumping it into the inside air?

Designers shouldn't be doing iterative development when the supply chain works best with up-front design. They might be forced to because of how the business operates though. Iterative design and quicker product releases are a quicker feedback loop for the business.Most companies don't do grand designs or long-standing flagship products meant to be advertised for years, but that may actually be on the consumer by constantly choosing the new thing.

I feel like it's not much of a secret that the warranty is intended to last the minimum lifetime of the product and not more. If they were confident in their product lasting longer, they'd sell you a longer warranty.I think there's also an unmentioned detail here, which is that many people probably won't own the same fridge for 20 or 30 years anyway - when you move, you commonly leave your fridge behind.

It is not a conspiracy. It is not lazy manufacturers. It is pressure from consumers and government that made things this way.Take HVAC, which is a great example. Regulations have required far greater efficiency. So what happens? You get things like variable-frequency drives. These can slow down the fans in low-load scenarios. However, they also add another failure point. And speaking of fans, many evaporators now use plastic fans instead of metal ones. And guess what? They crack a lot more than the metal ones ever did. But they're lighter and thus more efficient.It's like that with everything. Just take a look at modern clothes washer agitators compared to the old ones.The other problem is really with consumers. All (the vast majority of) consumers care about is convenience, cost, and looks. They want a fridge that has the ice maker and the water dispenser, stainless steel, french double door, etc. They don't care about the reputation of the brand - they just buy the cheapest one that fits those checkboxes.

You can't buy anything made that well today at any price!\" So I spent $80 on a new tub (plus $75 for labor, since installing it is a pain). That's one of only two major repairs it's ever needed (I swapped out the synchronous clock driven cycle controller myself 15 years ago) - it still runs just like it did when new.It's certainly possible that all my appliances could outlive me...replydragontamer 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I had an old chest freezer from the 80s.You had to manually defrost it for it to keep working. Modern ones have automatic defrosters and other such features.Yes, the old one \"kept working\", but at worse-and-worse reliability as the frost built up, until you manually removed everything from the freezer and ran a proper defrost cycle (aka: turn it off, wait for everything to melt, sponge out the water).I think I'll stick with my \"less reliable\" heater-inside-a-freezer with an escape hole to automatically siphon + pump the water out. More moving parts means less reliability, but these features are absolutely worth the loss in reliability.replyvel0city 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My family had a bunch of 80's appliances. They were terrible feature-wise like the washer would eat my clothes, the dryer was practically either stupid hot or practically no heat, and the fridge didn't have any defrost functionality nor water features. They broke down or were otherwise replaced in the 90s. They were replaced with units with far more features and were good until the 2020s, surviving a few moves. A few even got sold in the end as needs changed.My current kitchen has a microwave that's from the early 2000s, it works fine and has exceptional even heating and top notch auto sensor modes. The 1980s one we had was a total hunk of junk that constantly had failures, wasn't as powerful, didn't have any sensor cooking modes, and performed very poorly at cooking evenly. The other microwave from the 90s ate fuses for breakfast and had massively unreliable sensor cooking modes.So for me, practically all my newer appliances are way better than the old ones and have still often lasted >10yrs. Anecdotes are anecdotes.replybluGill 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] While old appliances have good features, LG and Samsung have earned a reputation of being bad. Whirlpool and GE still make some good stuff and they still sell parts. The reason you keep the old washer is the new versions legally cannot use as much water, and so they don't clean as well.replydragontamer 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Oh you can buy the old wasteful washers if you still want them. They just don't got any EnergyStar ratings (in fact, people have been shopping around for \"lack of EnergyStar\" to find those old wasteful washers).But \"they don't clean as well\" is a bit of a myth. More water requires more soap, and as it turns out, shuffling clothes around with *proportionally more soap* and *less water* leads to better cleanliness for the vast majority of stains.------------Think about it: if my washer only uses 1 gallon of water, but yours uses 5 gallons of water, your soap is 5x less effective than my same soap.Its not the \"water\" that cleans, its the soap after all. With one exception: caked on mud prefers water over all other solvents.But with regards to blood, sweat, grapes, tomatoes, and \"typical\" stains, its not the \"water\" that does anything. Its the soap. See ConsumerReports.org testing (ketchup tests and whatnot), as well as efficiency numbers that they've tested.replybluGill 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Water is called the \"universal solvent\" for a reason. We use soap for the exceptions, but water still does the bulk of the removal of things you don't want (dirt, salt), while soap handles the rest (generally oil based stains)replydragontamer 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except the #1 thing you are washing off is the natural oils from human skin and sweat.And #2 and #3 are the oils in food (chocolate, grease, wine, and other food products) and then the oils from grass / outdoors.Literally the only thing that water helps with is soil / dirt. Outside of that, the washing machine should be designed to use the minimum amount of water needed to activate the soap, the actual cleaner.replyNaijoko 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] its the mix of water and soap.

And most of that money is going toward smart features that add complexity, which adds to the risk of having to pay for repairs. And it's not like those companies stop using cheapo plastic and styrofoam in their more expensive fridges.Still, I'd like to know how much it would cost per year in electricity to run one of the old models like in the ad.replydublin 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not as much as you think - the people selling them want you to think the old ones were awful and need replacing, but they were designed for both reasonable efficiency and decades-long life. (You really need to factor in a literal 6-10x lifespan difference into efficiency and environmental impact figures, too...)I have a large 60s/70s vintage chest freezer I bought on Craigslist a few years ago. I worried that it was power-hungry, so I got a Kill-A-Watt and monitored it. I don't remember the exact figures I came up with, but it was pretty negligible: Even in my non air conditioned (but attached) garage in Austin (with the highest electric rates in the state, by far), it costs me only about a dollar a month to run. So we're saving a ton of money by being able to buy and store as much frozen food as we want, at a cost of $45 up front to buy the freezer, plus a buck a month to run it - that's a deal to me.All appliances, back when they were made here in the USA, lasted for decades. I have a cousin who had a (admitttedly expensive at the time) KitchenAid dishwasher from circa 1960! (In very cool copper color!) It still ran perfectly when she sold her ranch house several years ago.replyjancsika 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > it costs me only about a dollar a month to runThe low end Frigidaires are estimated at $56 a year, perhaps $8 less per year for an Energy Star one.I don't know anything about chest freezers, but there's no way a general purpose 1960s/70s fridge that one opens multiple times a day gets anything close to that.replyBenjiWiebe 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Chest freezers are automatically a lot more efficient. The cold air tends to stay in them when opened, unlike upright models.replysecabeen 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Chest freezers are a little special, as they don't need much actual cooling power if the insulation is functional and they aren't opened. Vertical freezers and fridges lose all their cold air when opened, chests don't.replymagicalist 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I mean, it's a cooler packed with a bunch of frozen stuff. Of course it's cheap to maintain its cool, that's why it's designed the way it was.> in Austin (with the highest electric rates in the state, by far)This is tangential to your point, but this isn't remotely truereplyhobo_in_library 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > You really need to factor in a literal 6-10x lifespan difference into efficiency and environmental impact figures, too...I would love to see energy efficiency regulations take the item's expected lifespan into consideration instead of being a mere \"energy per hour\" measurement.One simple/naive way to do it would be to divide (energy per hour) by the number of years on the warranty. Your warranty is for twice as long as the other guy? Then your device can use 2x the energy.Obv, this would require the warranty to be a \"full\" warranty, and not something manufacturers can too easily weasel out of.replyxbkingx 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I would love that, too, but it's not possible today. Everyone would offer 25 year warranties, close up shop in 5 years, and reopen as a new subsidy or company.The only way I see it working is to hold some large portion of the revenue in a trust and relinquish it to the company over the warrantied lifespan. The company would have to operate at a loss for a while to books those reserves, so there would have top be something like a zero interest government loan to cover the cost, which can't be escaped through bankruptcy.Or maybe a contract like the shitty cell phone plans in the US. Buyer agrees to pay for the full price of the appliance over the warrantied lifetime in installments. If you want to sell it or trade it in early, you either have to finish off the payment or transfer the contract. The company would have to service the product (within reason), or the contract is voided, releasing the buyer from payment obligations. Again, this system can be easily gamed, too, in today's market, but I just can't imagine a scenario that doesn't require a major paradigm shift.I do a decent amount of 3d printing and I cannot count the number of random letter Amazon brands for filament that have popped up over the last year. Most are simply rebranded waste from larger manufacturers. Once the product gets below 3.5 stars, the brand disappears and a suspiciously similar new brand pops up with the same spool design and 20 5-star reviews overnight.replySoftTalker 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] A basic, white, 18-20 cu ft refrigerator/freezer can still be purchased new for under $400 in 2023 dollars. In the 1950s, a TV or refrigerator was a major purchase for most families. Therefore there was more concern over quality of materials, repairability, and longevity.Today, a TV is basically a throwaway item. Nobody really repairs them, if you have a problem under warranty you exchange it, or if it's out of warranty you replace it. Refrigerators, laundry machines, are not far behind.If you wanted a repairable appliance built solidly enough to last a couple of decades, you'd be paying the inflation-adjusted 1950s price. Instead you're paying much less, for something that you will probably want to replace anyway due to changing standards, changing styles, better efficency, more features, etc. (Who would still be interested in using their 19\" CRT television in a heavy wood console cabinet in 2023?)replyjustsomehnguy 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It doesn't helps what there is only the panel itself, circuit board and power cord, basically.replySoftTalker 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There's still some repairable stuff in most refrigerators.I have a GE side-by-side refrigerator that's probably 10 years old. It still works, at least as a refrigerator/freezer. The icemaker and water dispenser never worked well and don't work at all now, and at one point started leaking which ruined the laminate floor in the hallway behind the kitchen before it was noticed.I have replaced the control circuit board, and the freezer defrost heating element. These parts are available and pretty easy to install if you are even slightly skilled as a home handyman, and in the time I've owned it, the need for these repairs doesn't seem unreasonable. The board likely got fried due to a power surge in a thunderstorm, a reminder that most modern appliances should get power through a surge supressor. The defrost heater failure is typical of any frost-free freezer.I think putting water and icemaker in the freezer is a mistake and won't buy another one like that. If you need more ice than you can make with ice trays, get a standalone ice maker.replypicadores 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] With the service per lifetime measurment stick, its still increddibly cheap.

Mid range does.replyrsynnott 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Possibly we're thinking of different degrees of high-end. I'm thinking Miele and similar; definitely very expensive, but relatively high volume. There's certainly a tier above who make stoves that cost more than a car, and your concern would certainly apply there.replyapi 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] They're only more affordable if you don't amortize the cost over a long period of time. You either buy high quality once or buy low quality multiple times.I've found that you usually have to go to high-end brands and/or \"commercial grade\" to get quality anything in the appliance space. A decent heuristic is also where it's made. For high-end brands some have certain models made in places like the USA and Germany and others made in China. The ones not made in China are usually the good models that will last.Things like Wifi and especially anything with a 'cloud' component are massive anti-features that should be avoided.

If its going to be used all the time, especially with multiple units, distributing release over time doesn’t change much but the delay between first turning it on and full effect to the surroundings, and the impact on temperature control is still there.Insulation is only effective with intermittent use.replyLorenPechtel 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No. If it was only effective with intermittent use then we wouldn't insulate water heaters as they're 24/7.Insulation slows heat flow and thus means the hot side rises to closer to the temperature of the heat source and thus there is less energy transfer.replymasklinn 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > If it was only effective with intermittent use then we wouldn't insulate water heaters as they're 24/7.Water heaters are not running 24/7.The entire point of water heater insulation is that you run them to heat up the water in the tank, then the water sits there at temperature, and when needed it has a fast response time (and also actually provides hot water as the heating loops generally don't have the heating capacity to bring the water up from ambient or sometimes just above freezing to sanitary at the flow rates users ask for).replyQwertious 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >No. If it was only effective with intermittent use then we wouldn't insulate water heaters as they're 24/7.Hey, if your taps are emitting a stream of hot water 24/7 then you should call a plumber.

Assuming the kitchen is not perfectly isolated itself, and probably even has at least some ventilation, if not airco, it will help keep the oven warm and the rest of the kitchen cool, even if it's being used 24x7.replyPaulDavisThe1st 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The insulation in non-commercial units is mostly to do with fire-safety.

Insulation probably doesn't matter if the door is open 20% of the time.replymasklinn 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Possibly because you want very responsive temperature control, if the oven has a lot of insulation it's more efficient but it responds much more slowly to temperature decreases.replyamluto 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This should be straightforwardly solvable with an improved control algorithm.A well insulated oven cools much more slowly with the door closed, so a control algorithm can’t recover as quickly if it overshoots the set temperature.replymasklinn 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not just a question of control algorithm, if have one dish you need high, and the next you need lower, you have not overshot anything but you need the oven to come down.

Everyone interacting with a commercial oven is a trained professional getting paid to be there and the space is designed to a certified standard. This means you can focus more on pure performance and less on liability stuff.And commercial equipment, because it needs to last long, is optimized for maintenance. I imagine insulation makes it harder to access and clean (or fix) the internals of an oven. Not to mention how often you’d have to change the insulation to keep your kitchen up to health standards.replybombcar 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Insulation on a home oven is to protect the kids (by trying to keep the outside from being finger burning hot) and to let the heat slowly dissipate into the kitchen.A commercial oven runs all day when it is being used, so it will eventually get hot no matter how much insulation you have unless it's somehow cooled or can send waste heat elsewhere.replyamluto 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The outside of an oven running for a long time will tend toward a steady state temperature at which heat is lost from the surface to the room (by radiation, conduction, convection, etc) is the same as the rate at which heat is added to the surface (from loss through the walls). Increasing insulation will decrease steady state temperature, and keeping a safe exterior temperature matters even in a commercial kitchen for safety and for comfort (even if no one cares about the comfort of the cooks).One can also actively cool the exterior surface by forcing air through a gap in a double wall oven. Many residential ovens do this.As far as I know, the actual material difference with residential ovens is that most of them are mean to be installed in cabinets, which severely restricts the amount of heat that can be safely dissipated through the walls.replyveave 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Surely high quality stuff is cheaper than it was 50 years ago when adjusted for inflation.replyLorenPechtel 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except in many cases it's simply not available.replykjkjadksj 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I can’t imagine even worse insulation than a normal oven.

Which products are which each year, from my consumer perspective, seems to be based on some sort of random number generator or other whims of weather in the executive suite that isn't visible from outside.

Let’s consider an oven:Good temperature control: accurate, precise and reliable temperature sensors (e.g. thermocouples) have been around for a long time, as have switching devices that are plenty high speed to make an excellent oven. PID control would be easy with 1980 technology or current technology. Ovens with good temperature control are nonetheless rare.Forced convection (aka a fan): no new technology required. And they’ve been around for years.Direct outdoor exhaust: this was available in the 80s and 90s. Not sure where it went.Good insulation: nothing fancy here. Mineral wool and fiberglass have been around for a long time. Even silicone rubber gaskets that tolerate oven temperature are not particularly new.Touch screens: most of them are still worse than the old analogue controls.Steam with good controls: this is pretty new and very rare.I suspect most of what’s going on is that fancy appliance makers try to keep BOM cost very low and that helps and whistles sell appliances. (Compare a $1500 induction cooktop to a $7k fancy brand gas cooktop. I suspect the BOM cost on the induction unit is rather higher. The gas unit has some cheap brass or bronze castings (I think I read somewhere that those burners cost under $20), a potentially shiny piece of stainless steel sheet, and really cheap controls. The obvious safety mechanism to turn off the gas if the burner isn’t lit? Nonexistent. The only thing $7k buys you is a nice brand name and maybe slightly more solid construction than a much cheaper unit.)replyrsynnott 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, ovens last more or less forever, and haven't had significant efficiency gains in a long time. They're probably the thing you're least likely to want to replace. There's often far more of an incentive with, say, fridges; if you have a 20 year old one, the replacement will likely pay for itself in a few years in power savings.> The obvious safety mechanism to turn off the gas if the burner isn’t lit? Nonexistent.... Wait, surely these are mandatory ~everywhere by now?EDIT: Huh. Apparently they are _not_ required in the US (except maybe in apartment buildings) and are not common there. Weird; they're not very expensive.Maybe it's an American Rugged Individualism thing. While I find the flame failure devices in my gas stove extremely irritating (they're particularly conservative, and won't reliably acknowledge that there's a flame until about 5 seconds after it's lit) I recognise that they are for my own good; this is probably very European thinking, though :)replyamluto 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Wow. I have literally never seen a flame failure device on a residential stove in the US.I’ve seen them on gas fired ovens with pilot lights. (Don’t get a gas fired oven with a pilot light. As far as I can tell, they have no redeeming features unless you like the broiler hidden under some of them. They make for pretty bad ovens, and they suck for indoor air quality.)replyrsynnott 43 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] For whatever reason, while gas stoves are fairly common in Ireland (I think they are in decline now, as induction offers most of the same advantages, along with its own), gas oven are practically non-existent; haven't seen one in years.Didn't realise they were still a thing in the US, though it makes _sense_, I suppose; on a 110V system an electric oven is going to be a more expensive wiring job than on a 230V one.replysokoloff 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm trying to think how I would reliably prove flame in a way that would resistant to annoying false negatives in the face of a very low simmer. (Somewhat ironically, this is probably the most important setting for which you'd need it. I'm not in any real danger of having a full-bore gas burner go out. I am in danger of having the lowest possible simmer blow out undetected.)Over a long enough period of time, a sufficiently sensitive raw temperature sensor is probably good enough, but that's not likely to be cheap nor reliable/long-lasting.replyPaulDavisThe1st 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > The only thing $7k buys you is a nice brand name and maybe slightly more solid construction than a much cheaper unit.)Typically you also get: more BTUs, better simmer control, easier repairability (due to construction design).I'm not arguing it's worth the money (which is why I got my $15k stove from craigslist for $2k :)replyamluto 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] more BTU: BTU on a gas stove is ridiculous — they are so lossy that the flame pattern is a bigger deal.better simmer control: even a lot of expensive gas stoves have fairly bad simmerrepairability: I regrettably own a fancy Thermador stove that is hard to repair — extracting the crappy ignition units requires a special tool that has been discontinued.If you want excellent temperature control, get a Breville Control Freak. It outperforms everything else (generally by far), it’s offensively expensive at $1500, and it’s also cheap at $1500 if you think of it as the best stove that just happens to have only one burner.You’ll also discover that 1800W (~6100 BTU/hr) is about right for most purposes with pans up to 12-14\" at near 100% efficiency. You do not want 15000 BTU/hr delivered to your pan for any purpose other than boiling water or maybe reducing a big stock if you are stirring actively.replyPaulDavisThe1st 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > You do not want 15000 BTU/hr delivered to your pan for any purpose other than boiling waterWok afficionados may differ with you here.

My new home has a range from about 15 years ago that cost 3x that, takes 20 minutes to preheat, has massive cool spots in the oven, and is noisier than my dishwasher.For TV's, 20 years ago we were using CRT's to drive 480 vertical lines for the most part.

We just haven't made that much progress in refrigerants, compressors, nor insulation.It looks like very efficient fridges today use about 400kWh per year. Those are the best (not the average).In the late 90s, the overall average (not best) figure was ~850 kWh/yr and from the early 2000s (20 years ago), it was ~550kWh/yr.A 15-20 year old average fridge is about 35% less energy efficient (550/400 - 1) than the best modern fridges.replymaccard 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > 15-20 year old fridges are about 35% less energy efficient than the best modern fridges, not 100xI apologise that you took orders of magnitude literally.

I found another that claims 61 kWh, but it's $1800 so I left it. 20 years ago is a very specific timeframe, if you go back 25 years you're also likely talking about removing a bunch of horriffic CFC's which were widespread at the time. I'm finding it hard to find numbers for that time frame though, the only ones I can find are early 90's claims of 1700+kWh/year.But yes, I concede, we have not had a 100x improvement in energy efficiency in 20 years. The entire rest of my post stands, and I think we've seen a 10x improvement in efficiency. At today's electricity price in the UK, the savings from a 550 kWh fridge to the one I linked above would pay for the fridge in a little over a year.

Freon refrigerator is pretty much identically efficient to a modern one.

Griffin A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99') has invigorated interest in the understanding of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite Subjects: Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el) Cite as: arXiv:2307.16892 [cond-mat.supr-con]   (or arXiv:2307.16892v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] for this version)  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.16892 Focus to learn more Submission history From: Sinéad Griffin Dr. [view email] [v1] Mon, 31 Jul 2023 17:58:17 UTC (7,923 KB)Download: PDF Other formats Current browse context: cond-mat.supr-con new | recent | 2307 Change to browse by: cond-mat cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.str-elReferences & Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar Export BibTeX Citation Bookmark Bibliographic Tools Bibliographic and Citation Tools Bibliographic Explorer Toggle Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)

This paper is theoretical and she finds that particular Cu substitutions onto specific Pb atomic sites are key to enabling a band structure that is usually linked to high Tc superconductors.What this means for the more practical minded is that the synthesis of superconducting LK-99 is not trivial and you need to make the appropriate substitutional alloy for this to work.This is a DFT paper, and a band structure that is usually seen in high Tc superconductors just naturally came out. She also talks about the strong electron-phonon coupling that naturally arose from the structure, which is always necessary for superconductivity.I am, by far, the most excited I've ever been about this being a RT, ambient pressure superconductor.replybibabaloo 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] If this could be simulated, can you help me understand why we couldn't have used simulation to find promising SC materials to investigate further earlier? Are there just too many permutations to investigate?It seems to my own naive self that if LK99 is the real deal, we mostly just got lucky finding it.replyakasakahakada 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not an expert but it just happen that my lab is full of DFT folks so I heard a lot about those everyweek. As people above already answered the questions, I gonna talk some extras.1. Computation cost is large. 1 compute task for a small scale ~100 atoms last about 3 days to 1 week on supercomputer.2. Search space is hugh. For each composition you can have different atomic (or crystal) structure. And here we are talking doping which means introduce impurities into the molecule. Chemical characteristics differs depending on which atom you swap for the impurity. Sometimes you may want to try all places.3. Depends on initial values. Sometimes the initial value is just bad that the result is totally unusable, then you have tweak a little bit and throw back to supercomputer. This cycle might happen few times for 1 specific formula and structure.4. Not 100% accurate. Often the resulting numbers are off by a few % or more which is hugh, compare to experimental results. Reason is that the simulation is not full scale, approximation is here and there to reduce computational cost.replyssijak 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Based on your descriptions, if LK99 is real, it sounds like there are closer to infinite than 0 of these materials. If there are so many combinations and somebody randomly stumbled on one, it makes sense that if the number of combinations is asymptotically infinite, that number of superconducting materials is very large.replyfpordeig 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This looks similar to the protein folding problem. Maybe an AlphaFold-like approach could work?replyakasakahakada 35 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] We exactly considering this since this year. But there are some major problems that cannot be solved in short term.Inorganic crystal structure database (and there is one database literally is this name) is way smaller than what we have for proteins. Also by nature, Transformer is hardly useful for crystals because the crystal is repetitive. You don't throw the same sequence over and over to transformer and hope it will work like magic.My current understanding is that Graph Neural Network is perfect for this job because graph can exactly describe this kind of repetitive nature of crystal.replyfock 48 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] not soo similar really, but yes, alphafold-style generative models could help find realistic structures for a specific composition. However a) data is much worse (I would say so at least...), b) the clever tricks of alphafold centered around strings of aminoacid don't really apply to particles in a box... and c) search space might be even larger if you go to interestingly sized systems.Also there's been some people arguing about the particles in a box situation for a loooong time and the most promising approach currently is diffusion.replytired_and_awake 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] DFT scales horribly so it's phenomenally expensive to run.

It's something else that needs to be specified more precisely.replyjacquesm 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm not following you. The compound is specified, the process is what is poorly specified and the researchers more or less admit that they do not exactly know what the right method is. This makes it a lot harder to replicate and may well cause a lot of attempts to misfire before someone finds something that works or we give up on the search. What TFA here suggests is that there are some potential complications in manufacturing this that would explain why the original researchers had problems trying to make the compound, the number that I recall is that '1 in 10' tries resulted in a working sample.That would also be a fantastic way to pull a hoax, because it will result in 10x more effort spent on your hoax. If it turns out that it was a hoax I think the original researchers will find immense gratitude from Pons and Fleischmann for taking over the top spot for the textbook example of bad science. But for now, as far as I can see the jury is still out, and if anything the paper linked here actually improves the chances of it being real a bit more than it is offset in the other direction by a failed replication attempt.replydcow 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Then why do we have separate names for Graphite and Diamond? Same element, different molecular (crystalline) structures.

I see you're saying allotropes refers to diamond vs carbon (allotrope referring a single element vs isomer referring to compound).That raises a question, what's the name for different crystalline structures of the same compound? Is that still an isomer or something different? I'm out of my element here.replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] An isomer can have different valences but still have the same overall chemical formula.So just for an example (I have no idea how to put a tetrahedron in a comment :) ) a chain of C-C-C-C and C-C=C-C (which you likely can not synthesize) would be an isomer but C-C-C-C in one crystal lattice versus C-C-C-C in another crystal lattice would be allotropes.The carbon in graphite sits in sheets (hence the possibility to form graphene), whereas the carbon in a diamond always forms three dimensional lattices.edit nah: bad example, sorry, I can't find a good way to visualize this in text the 2nd C-C-C-C chain should have the last C dangling from the 2nd down.edit2: examples are wrong, I should have used a more complex molecule for the isomer and the carbon can have either three or four other carbons hanging of it for the allotrope. tricky...replydcow 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Just double checking, the definitions I'm finding for allotrope are specific to a single element.allotrope /'ælə,troʊp/ noun a structurally different form of an elementI'm having trouble finding allotrope used to refer to different forms of a compound.https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-allotro...replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, you're right, I should have used a more complex example for an isomer.replycyberax 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Isomers are structurally different.

I'd be interesting in hearing any counterarguments (or better still, actual studies) concerning distribution efficiencies.replyalmostnormal 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The price for electricity is mainly driven by cost of distribution not production. Reducing losses on distribution would further increase the cost of the expensive part (upgrade to SC net) and decrease the cost of the cheap part.Storage would help, the cheapest production cannot run continuously.replynine_k 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Transmission losses are a concern because they require building huge, very high-voltage structures.Superconductors could make transmission lines much more compact, sturdy, weatherproof, and less vulnerable to sabotage. You could run a thick armored cable instead of a set of open-air wires on tall towers.replyleni536 48 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Superconductors have a limit on the current they can carry before the superconducting phase breaks down. This might put similar limits on the voltages.I agree that the nature of this is entirely different to transmission losses, but I don't expect 230V lines carrying tens of thousands of amps. This would probably require excessive amount of SC material.replyjacquesm 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You would no longer need high voltages at all. We only use those to cut down on those very transmission losses because we're trying to reduce the amount of current. So you can drop all of the step-up-step-down stuff.

The cost of infra is dominated by the transmission network and that transmission network is very expensive to build and maintain, a superconducting network would have some massive advantages. Besides, the losses are in the 5 to 7% range for a typical grid which may sound great in theory but is still a function of the distance between the generators and the consumers. So you can't really put those where you want them, you put them where you have to in order to minimize the transmission losses or you'll have to live with larger losses. Superconductors for the grid would give far more freedom in siting and would allow all kinds of neat tricks such as transporting solar power across the planet based on the day/night and seasonal cycle and likewise for wind power depending on where it is currently blowing the most.Generating costs are a small fraction of the final price of electricity, taxes and transportation are the big ones.If you just look at superconductors as a replacement for any old piece of wire you're going to miss out on a whole bunch of advantages, it is a clear qualitative difference which enables solutions that are entirely undoable today. Yes, there is HVDC, but the lines are expensive and due to the high voltages involved are not easy to interface to or from. They do have some unique advantages, being DC they allow non-synchronized grids to be connected.replyjakeinspace 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sorry, but how does one create a transistor from a superconductor?

What is important is that if it is true that this is the first member of a new class of superconductors, a whole new family if you will and that once the principles are better understood materials scientists can go about their search in a smaller parameter space of which they have proof that at least one set yields results.Compared to the steps that have been happening in the last decades this one would be absolutely incredible in terms of temperature range, if I understood it correctly they aren't even sure about the upper limit due to a restriction in their measuring gear.replyporphyra 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] On one hand, yes, a new family will be discovered. On the other hand, high temperature superconductors like YBCO are very brittle and it does limit the applications. Traditional liquid helium-cooled superconductors still have to be used in many places.replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] One of the reasons it is so brittle is because it is still very cold even though it is high temp for a superconductor. Many materials will become brittle when cooled down that far. This is one of things people hope for with higher temp superconductors: that they will be less brittle. But less brittle usually also implies that a material changes shape easier and that in turn may affect the superconductivity. For instance when a large current runs through a superconductor that leads to strong magnetic fields and those strong magnetic fields will actively push against each other trying to destroy the conductor. A non-rigid superconductor would behave in ways that are not really helpful for instance by pushing it out of its superconducting domain (which would result in some pretty spectacular fireworks because suddenly all that power is available to heat up a small segment of the no-long-superconductor). So there is some chance that all materials that exhibit (useful) superconductivity will end up being somewhat brittle, and will need to be mechanically re-inforced.replydtx1 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even if it is, we can coat it in epoxy and deal with it.

We still have to reach that transistor stage (which would mean we an expensive way to manufacture a small stretch of usable conductor, say a few cm). Then you can start thinking about high volume production in any desired length and commercialization. So from a strict materials science point of view there is still a ton of work to be done even if everything so far turns out to be true. There is a good chance that even if the material isn't superconducting in bulk small regions of it are (the chances of that are actually higher than that it is all superconducting) and there is still a good chance that they are simply mistaken.But even if it is just superconducting grains smaller than a millimeter that would already be a massive discovery.replybibabaloo 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] \"plain English\" explanation: https://nitter.net/Andercot/status/1686215574177841152#mreplythepasswordis 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Direct link: https://twitter.com/Andercot/status/1686215574177841152#mreplymontenegrohugo 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] Manifold markets jumped to ~40% likelihood (briefly around 60%) after this paper was published.replywiz21c 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Dumb question: why all the fuss ?

Could someone explain what could be done with that material ?For example, if we can transport electricity with a super conductor over long dsitances (1000 of kms), then what happens ? Is it just an incremental progress or is it a huge breakthrough ?(I am not much trained in physics)reply0xB31B1B 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Huge breakthrough.Energy efficiency is just one gain. This also potentially unlocks major gains in quantum computing, fusion energy, tradition computer chip design allowing another 30 years of moore’s law, batteries with zero energy loss leading to ultra dense batteries and electric aviationreplythreeseed 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] One high-level, back of napkin example that gets thrown around is that the world would magically get 40% more power due to reduction in transmission losses.

I also really like that the Arxiv, open access publishing, open peer review, live science and similar new models represent a refreshing return to less gatekeeping, politics and institutional gamesmanship.Based on the early successes shown by applying social media platforms like Twitter, Twitch, Discord, etc, to accelerating science, I hope we can evolve better tools and platforms which are equally open but even more suited to the exchange of scientific ideas, results, review and feedback.replywilg 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've always felt I love the idea of arXiv as a non-scientist who is interested in following science, but it's so esoteric and hard to follow (the density and format of scientific papers does not help).

Really speaks to a need for a new medium specific to science's unique characteristics.One caveat tho is that hype can also distort and there's a limited resource of 'the public's excitement with science' that depletes if it never delivers, so I wouldn't necessarily couple science education/comms with science process so tightly. Most science is lots and lots of boring toil, and I'd hope the $$s flow to the best scientists rather than the ones who tell the most twitter-friendly stories.replythreeseed 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Strongly disagree.I don't want scientists to be turned into influencers or D-grade celebrities having to debase themselves on shows like Joe Rogan in order to get funding or justify their work. Or what happened this week on Twitter where the scientist was obsessed with trying to get above 15m views so he could get monetised.It is great to learn more about the scientific process in this ad-hoc manner but I would prefer to let scientists figure out themselves what works best for them rather than it being driven from the unwashed masses.replyWhereIsTheTruth 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I disagree, what you are asking would just be a way to siphon information, and encourage that kind of rush behaviorKorea should protect its students and their work a little more if they want their own TSMC, Texas Instruments of Korea doesn't sound rightreplyseewhydee 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] Don't get too excited --- theorists have predicted nine of the last five physics breakthroughs (pace Paul Samuelson).replymontecarl 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Theory confirming experiment is quite different from theory predicting new physics.

It appears to be taking on water. There are a thousand passengers, from whom they select a captain before each eight hour shift. Any one captain may only serve two shifts. The captain has some leeway to decide what to do, but unlike a normal ship, the policy is actually set by the crew, who are elected to represent various portions of the ship. There are also a group of nine passengers who decide whether the captain and crew are correctly following the crew's policy. They can be replaced if they get tired of the job and quit or die in office.Activities on the ship include partying, bailing water, inspecting the hull for leaks, and repairing holes.The passengers are divided into factions who believe the ship is not taking on water, those who believe it is taking on water but it's happening slowly and won't be a problem for a long time, and those who believe that only immediate action from most of the passengers can prevent the ship from sinking.Good luck.replythih9 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I’d suggest another activity as an option for the people onboard: fishing.It increases the score of the person doing that, but also increases the mass of the ship and speeds up sinking. The crew gets a fishing bonus.replythrowawaycities 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I was hoping fishing would be suggested, that’s where I come in…You see in order to fish, you need:1) to learn to fish with the proper fishing education. I’ll set that up and teach you but it will cost you. You will pay with 33% of the fish you catch for the remainder of your life.2) a rod And bait following your education. I’ll also supply that, but again it will cost you. Since you can’t pay up front, I’ll extend you credit, and you will also pay as a percent of future fish. This time with a Variable Interest Rate up to 25% as permitted by the crews’ usury laws (after all we wouldn’t want you being exploited).3. permit applications, and lucky for you I’ll help you with that also, but there is the matter of my fee as well as the fee for the permit which must be paid annually. As a courtesy I’ll waive my fee so long as you give me the first 100 fish you catch as a second in line creditor to the permit office which gets the first 50 fish you catch.4. Taxes for the luxury of being on the ship and fishing from the ship. These are progressive taxes to make this fair for you and so taxes are determined by the total number of fish you catch. It’ll be somewhere between 10%-40% of your fish. Technically you could pay 0%, but the bad news is you’ll starve to death if you pay 0%. Note if you mess up the calculations there are extra penalties and fees, and potential jail time if you are found intentionally cheating on your fish taxes. Once again you’ll probably want my services to figure out your fish taxes, because let’s face it, I specialize in counting/managing your fish & you’ll need every minute to dedicate to fishing if you ever plan to have something to eat for yourself.Roughly you will owe about 98% of every fish you catch to creditors and taxes, this is after the first 150 fish which come right off the top.replyproudeu 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] But if you own 90% of all fish then those taxes do not apply to youreplygolergka 4 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] You are on an internet forum.

Until fairly recently, banks were only allowed a single office in a single city. If that city was hit by hard times, the bank was also badly affected.Compare that with eg Canada's nationwide chains, and their superior financial stability.See https://www.alt-m.org/2015/07/29/there-was-no-place-like-can... for more.replypbourke 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That stability comes from having a handful of banks declared too big to fail, and holding oligopoly power.

It's the account holders who are bailed out.replyeru 0 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] That still misprices risks.Shares in a bank essentially behave like call options on the assets of the bank, where the strike price is the sum of debt and other liabilities of the bank.When you are pricing an option ahead of time, you can still misprice them; even if it turns out that at the end of the day, the option turned out to expire out-of-the-money (ie the bank's shareholders get wiped out).https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36953459 probably gave a cleaner description.AnthonyMouse 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's mispricing risk. Now the depositors have no reason to care whether their bank is creditworthy or well-managed, so the bank has the incentive to gamble with their deposits as much as possible.

It's non-exclusive rights, of course, but why would I pay you for it when I can get it from the LOC for free?The game is required to be in the browser. It's pretty obvious that they plan to put this on their website, or perhaps even create a portal for these types of games to point teachers to.I also found it interesting that they require a cheat code to allow judges to play all levels.And, they don't like copyleft licenses, either.

I would not expect it from a government agency.Usually, a government agency is more interested in getting people to create things. The motivation is that by offering a prize, they encourage people to create things. Acquiring the thing is not the point. Of course, they need the right to depict the product, but they do not usually want to use it for anything and everything that they want, in perpetuity, including the right to make derivative works (without your permission, I might add).The way that this is designed, I would not want to encourage anybody that I know to participate in it. You may disagree, but we probably have different thresholds for what we deem to be acceptable risk.Let me put it another way. If I were to pour my heart and soul into this project, the absolute maximum value that I could extract is $20k, which is ~$13.7k after taxes. That is the ceiling. That is it. Why would I do something that would take so much time for so little potential? I would rather risk my time on something that has no ceiling. I would give the same advice to anyone. Never settle for anything when there is an artificially-imposed cap on the earning potential.replyjamescostian 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This isn't designed for anyone to pour their heart and soul into it. Contestants are to make a \"lightweight\" (their word) game. They added a ceiling (to varying degrees) not just to the payout, but also to the submissionsreplycoreyp_1 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The rules are designed so that there will be absolutely no encumberance to them using your submission in any way that they want (if you win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place). From limiting datasets to stipulating the license to a requirement of patent unencumberance and broad IP permissions.The section 508 requirment is also very telling. Whatever wins, they plan to copy-and-paste it into their own website at the very least.If I were to do this, then I would pour everything I had into it, because that's the way that I do things. And so, I read all the rules, and decided that I didn't like the terms.The only reason that I commented here in the first place is because the terms were so eggregious (in my opinion) that I felt that others should be warned about the danger and the extent to which they must sacrifice their IP in order to win the contest.This contest could have been so much better. Sadly, it sounds like the terms were written by some greedy corporation looking to find a cheap way to mass-producde games.

That's the stated goal of the project.replygalaxyLogic 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree the rules seem a bit too much.But, if you win I assume you would still keep the right to produce \"derivative works\" yourself which Government has no rights to. So you could start maintaining and improving the game and sell the improved version.I'm not a lawyer so do your own investigation into whether that is possible or not.replycoreyp_1 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You are correct, and that was actually my first thought. If you win (1st, 2nd, or 3rd place), they have rights to your game and the right to make their own derivative works. And you have rights to make derivative works. But then I thought of how this could play out.So you make \"UltraCiv\" for the competition and win. You decide that it was a good idea and decide to expand on it. You make \"UltraCiv: Election Paradox\". Now you have something successful. They make \"UltraCiv: City Manager\". You can't stop them, because you already gave them permanent rights. They claim that they only use it for \"educational use\", which is 100% true, since it is an educational game. So was Oregon Trail. In this case, however, your franchise is tainted.It's just poisioning your own well and IP.Again, someone will win $20k, but that someone won't be me.

The culture has largely abandoned them, and in many cases has demonized those that know them. Consider the concerted and successful attacks on state-level organizations that administer voting in the US. Those people, from the Sec State on down are probably the top 1% of those who understand civics, and they are under fire. Why? Because cultural norms tell people to not care about civics, and institutions are so weak that even the \"elitist cabal\" doesn't seem to care about it, either.At least, this is the appearance. Perhaps there is a firm bedrock of dedicated, knowledgeable citizens making American democracy work, and the recent attacks are less hard body blows and more jabs that are easily ignored.

Tapping the example landed me in an editor that then took far too long to figure out how to get out of.- It remembers that the editor is up. Once up, getting out and back to the homepage is next to impossible until you figure out the UI (clearing cookies probably would have worked, but that’s not exactly convenient). Reloading just takes you back to the editor.- The timeline and one other view (can’t remember which one offhand) just showed a black screen.- One of the biggest draws for markdown for me is the fact that it, in general, reads like a formatted text file. The formatting “instructions” are almost transparent in that sense. Not completely, but almost. My initial view of the example timeline’s source did not feel that way.For example, sections: Section welcome #welcomeBlah blah blahEndSection Section foo #fooBlah blah blahEndSection(Ignore my extra caps; iOS is annoying like that.)“Sections” in markdown would be written more naturally, and the end intuited based on the following content:# Welcome Blah blah blah# foo Blah blah blahThe extra wordy markup means little, and detracts from readability. Similar with groups. Date formats appear to get somewhat complicated as well. If that was resolved, I think it would be much better.This is just a surface reaction to what I see; I didn’t do a horribly deep dive. I love the idea. It just needs some work if it’s going to be as smooth as markdown.JMHO, and good luck in any event. =)replykitd 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] I agree with your point 3.

I use obsidian for almost all my notes and documentation because I like keeping everything as close to plaintext as possible.I also currently use Omniplan for timelines and Gantt charts, so that is what I would be comparing Markwhen to, in terms of functionality. Omniplan is a very mature app and I recommend giving it a try if you haven't yet. There's a lot of ideas in there that you could import to Markwhen.Thoughts: - The travel itinerary planning aspect is interesting. I've never found an itinerary planner I liked, and many of them cost a substantial amount. I'd like to see more about this from markwhen. - The syntax is somewhat confusing on first reading. I am used to using `###` to mark out headings and paragraphs and this conflicts with standard markdown in that sense. though I havent used Markwhen enough yet to climb over the learning curve.Two biggest feature requests from me:- release an Obsidian plugin for Markwhen so I can have Markwhen timelines inside my exisiting Obsidian notes. I'd be happy to pay a one off licence for this even though it would be locally run.- Find a way to do automatic dependency levelling so that when one task is dependent on another, and I increase the time taken for the first task, then the dependent one is automatically moved forward appropriately.replyFeuilles_Mortes 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Seconding the request for an Obsidian plugin.

Might be worth a look as well!I’m on mobile otherwise I’d link to the Gantt directlyYou can find it in the docs here I believe:https://mermaid.js.org/replyMulticomp 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I vouched for this because while it does not relate to using markdown to create gantt & timeline charts, it does relate to using code to create said charts and is therefore IMHO a relevant comparable tool.See https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gantt.html and https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/timeline.htmlHaving said that, it's late tonight but I plan to give this markwhen a good look tomorrow when I'm fresh, because even being aware of the above options, I've not found an offline friendly code-to-timeline tool I can settle on and this may be it.replyzmmmmm 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] PlantUML does Gantt charts too completely off line if you want. Kinda ugly but surprisingly powerful. I have managed whole giant projects this way.replyharlanji 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] Really great work. I see great value in an ical translator, to and from if possible.I'm working in Python land lately and a big fan of these plain text/markup like formats. I might've stumbled on this format before, definitely at least something similar and was excited. Can't promise I'll tackle the job but I do have great interest in looking closer at the format and seeing if I can load it into Python, and if I did then an ical import/export would probably be the first thing I hook up. Sorry if it's poor form to say I'll do it for dirt cheap if anyone wants to fund it, like $15/hour, might take under a week to get something working.Thanks for the great work and demo that so powerfully illustrates it.reply16 hours ago | prev [–] [deleted]",
