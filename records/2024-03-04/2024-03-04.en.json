    "originBody": "Back to writing CSS for printing to paper Table of contents Introduction Sample files @page @media print Width, height, margin, and padding Element positioning Multi-page documents with repeating elements Portrait / Landscape mode Data source Essentials cheatsheet Introduction At work, one of the things I do pretty often is write print generators in HTML to recreate and replace forms that the company has traditionally done handwritten on paper or in Excel. This allows the company to move into new web-based tools where the form is autofilled by URL parameters from our database, while getting the same physical output everyone's familiar with. This article explains some of the CSS basics that control how your webpages look when printed, and a couple of tips and tricks I've learned that might help you out. Sample files Here are some sample page generators to establish some context, and perhaps a shred of credibility. I'll be the first to admit these pages are a little bit ugly and could use more polish. But they get the job done and I'm still employed. Invoice generator Coversheet with sidebar inputs Coversheet with contenteditable QR code generator @page CSS has a rule called @page that informs the browser of your website's printing preferences. Normally, I use @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 0; } I will explain why I choose margin: 0 in the later section about margins. You should use Letter or A4 as appropriate for your relationship with the metric system. Setting the size and margin of @page is not the same as setting the width, height, and margin of yourorelement. @page is beyond the DOM — it contains the DOM. On the web, yourelement is bounded by the edges of your screen, but when printing it is bounded by @page. The settings controlled by @page more or less correspond to the settings you get in your browser's print dialog when you press Ctrl+P. Here's a sample file I used to do some experiments:@page { /* see below for each experiment */ } html { width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: lightblue; /* grid by shunryu111 https://stackoverflow.com/a/32861765/5430534 */ background-size: 0.25in 0.25in; background-image: linear-gradient(to right, gray 1px, transparent 1px), linear-gradient(to bottom, gray 1px, transparent 1px); } Sample text sample text Here's how that looks in the browser: And here are the results of some different @page values: @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 1in; }: @page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 1in; }: @page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 0; }: Setting the @page size won't actually put that size of paper into your printer's feed tray. You'll have to do that part yourself. Notice how when I set size to A5, my printer stays on Letter, and the A5 size fits entirely within the Letter size which gives the appearance of a margin even though it's not coming from the margin setting. @page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }: But if I tell the printer that I have actual A5 paper loaded, then it looks as expected. From what I gather by experimentation, Chrome only follows the @page rule if you have Margin set to Default. As soon as you change Margin in the print dialog, your output is instead the product of your physical paper size and the chosen margin. @page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }: Even when you choose a @page size that fits fully within your physical paper, the margin still matters. Here, I make a 5x5 square with no margin, and a 5x5 square with margin. The size of theelement is bounded by the @page size and margin combined. @page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 0; }: @page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 1in; }: I did all these tests not because I expect to print on A5 or 5x5 paper, but because it took me a while to figure out what exactly @page is. Now I am pretty confident in always using Letter with margin 0. @media print There is a media query called print where you can write styles that only apply during printing. My generator pages often contain a header, some options, and some help text for the user that obviously shouldn't come out on the print, so this is where you add display:none on those elements. /* Normal styles that appear while you are preparing the document */ header { display: block; } @media print { /* Disappear when you are printing the document */ header { display: none; } } Width, height, margin, and padding You'll need to know a bit about the box model to get the margins you want without wrestling the computer too much. The reason I always set @page margin: 0 is that I'd rather handle the margins on the DOM elements instead. When I tried to use @page margin: 0.5in, I would often accidentally wind up with double-margins that squash the content smaller than I expected, and my one-page design spilled onto a second page. If I wanted to use @page margin, then the actual page content would need to be laid out all the way up against the edges of the DOM, which is harder for me to think about and harder to preview before printing. It is mentally easier for me to remember thatoccupies the entire physical paper and my margins are within the DOM instead of beyond it. @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 0; } html, body { width: 8.5in; height: 11in; } When it comes to multi-page print generators, you're going to want a separate DOM element representing each page. Since you can't have multipleor , you're going to need another element. I like . Even for single-page generators, you may as well always use an article. Since eachrepresents one page, I don't want any margins or padding onor . We're pushing the logic one step further — it is easier for me to let the article occupy the entire physical page and put my margins within it. @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 0; } html, body { margin: 0; } article { width: 8.5in; height: 11in; } When I talk about adding margin within my article, I'm not using the margin property, I'm using padding. That's because margin goes outside and around your element in the box model. If you use a margin of 0.5in, you'll have to set the article to 7.5×10 so that the article plus 2×margin equals 8.5×11. And if you want to adjust that margin you'll have to adjust the other dimensions. Instead, padding goes on the inside of the element, so I can define the article to be 8.5×11 with 0.5in padding, and all the elements inside the article will stay on the page. A lot of intuition about element dimensions is easier when you set box-sizing: border-box. It makes it so that the outer dimensions of the article are locked in while you adjust the inner padding. This is my snippet: html { box-sizing: border-box; } *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; } Let's put this all together: @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 0; } html { box-sizing: border-box; } *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; } html, body { margin: 0; } article { width: 8.5in; height: 11in; padding: 0.5in; } Element positioning Once you've got your articles and margins set up, the space inside the article is yours to do with as you please. Design your document using whatever HTML/CSS you feel is appropriate for the project. Sometimes this means laying out elements with flex or grid because you've been given some leeway with the output. Sometimes it means creating squares of a specific size to fit on a certain brand of sticker paper. Sometimes it means absolutely positioning absolutely everything to the millimeter because the user needs to feed a special piece of pre-labeled paper through the printer to get your data on top of it, and you're not in control of that special paper. I'm not here to give a tutorial on how to write HTML in general, so you'll need to be able to do that. All I can say is be mindful of that fact that you're dealing with the limited real estate of a piece of paper, unlike a browser window which can scroll and zoom to any length or scale. If your document will contain an arbitrary number of items, be ready to paginate by creating more . Multi-page documents with repeating elements A lot of the print generators I write contain tabular data, like an invoice full of line items. If youris large enough to go onto a second page, the browser will automatically duplicate theat the top of each page.Sample text Sample text00 11 24 ... That's great if you're just printing awith no frills, but in a lot of real scenarios it's not that simple. The document I'm recreating often has a letterhead on the top of each page, a footer on the bottom, and other custom elements that need to be explicitly repeated on each page. If you just print a single long table across pages, you don't have much ability to place other elements above, below, and around it on intermediate pages. So, I generate the pages using javascript, splitting the table into several smaller ones. The general approach here is this: Treat theelements as disposable and be ready to regenerate them at any time from objects in memory. All user input and configuration should take place in a separate header / options box, outside of the articles. Write a function called new_page that creates a new article element with the necessary repeating header/footer/etc. Write a function called render_pages that creates the articles from the base data, calling new_page every time it fills up the previous one. I usually use offsetTop to see when the content is getting far along the page, though you could definitely use smarter techniques to get the perfect fit on each page. Call render_pages whenever the base data changes. function delete_articles() { for (const article of Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName(\"article\"))) { document.body.removeChild(article); } } function new_page() { const article = document.createElement(\"article\"); article.innerHTML = ` ... ... ... `; document.body.append(article); return article; } function render_pages() { delete_articles(); let page = new_page(); let tbody = page.query(\"table tbody\"); for (const line_item of line_items) { // I usually pick this threshold by experimentation but you can probably // do something more rigorously correct. if (tbody.offsetTop + tbody.offsetParent.offsetTop > 900) { page = new_page(); tbody = page.query(\"table tbody\"); } const tr = document.createElement(\"tr\"); tbody.append(tr); // ... } } It is usually good to include a \"page X of Y\" counter on your pages. Since the number of pages is not known until all pages are generated, I can't do this during the for loop. I call a function like this at the end: function renumber_pages() { let pagenumber = 1; const pages = document.getElementsByTagName(\"article\"); for (const page of pages) { page.querySelector(\".pagenumber\").innerText = pagenumber; page.querySelector(\".totalpages\").innerText = pages.length; pagenumber += 1; } } Portrait / Landscape mode I've shown that the @page rule helps inform the browser's default print settings, but the user can override it if they want to. If you set @page to portrait mode and the user overrides it to landscape mode, your layout and pagination might look wrong, especially if you are hardcoding any page thresholds. You can accommodate them by creating separateelements for portrait and landscape, and using javascript to switch between them. There might be a better way to do this, but at-rules like @page behave differently than normal CSS properties so I'm not sure. You should also save some variable that can help your render_pages function do the right thing. You could also stop hardcoding thresholds, but then I'd have to follow my own advice.Portrait Landscape @page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 0; } article { width: 8.5in; height: 11in; } @page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 0; } article { width: 11in; height: 8.5in; }let print_orientation = \"portrait\"; function page_orientation_onchange(event) { print_orientation = event.target.value.toLocaleLowerCase(); if (print_orientation == \"portrait\") { document.getElementById(\"style_portrait\").setAttribute(\"media\", \"all\"); document.getElementById(\"style_landscape\").setAttribute(\"media\", \"not all\"); } if (print_orientation == \"landscape\") { document.getElementById(\"style_landscape\").setAttribute(\"media\", \"all\"); document.getElementById(\"style_portrait\").setAttribute(\"media\", \"not all\"); } render_printpages(); } function render_printpages() { if (print_orientation == \"portrait\") { // ... } else { // ... } } Data source There are a couple of ways to get your data onto the page. Sometimes, I pack all of the data into the URL parameters, so the javascript just does const url_params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search); and then a bunch of url_params.get(\"title\"). This has some advantages: The page loads very fast. It's easy to debug and experiment by changing the URL. The generator works offline. This also has some disadvantages: The URLs become very long and unweildy, people cannot comfortably email them to each other. See sample links at the top of this article. If the URL does get sent in an email, that data is \"locked in\", even if the source record in your database changes later. Browsers do have limits on URL length. The limits are pretty high but not infinite and might vary per client. Sometimes I instead use javascript to fetch our database records over the API, so the URL parameters just contain the record's primary key and maybe a mode setting. This has some advantages: The URLs are much shorter. The data is always fresh. and disadvantages: The user has to wait a second while the data is being fetched. You have to write more code. Sometimes I set contenteditable on the articles so the user can make small changes before printing. I also like to use real, live checkbox inputs they can click before printing. These features add some convenience, but in most cases it would be wiser to make the user change the source record in the database first. Also, they limit your ability to treat the article elements as disposable.

Although there were a few bugs in the preview experience, the final output was perfect, and probably took me a quarter the time it would have in InDesign (which I’m fairly competent in). The real power is in being able to hook up all the templating, CMS APIs, and whatever else you want into your content pipeline. It’s Just HyperText™. I’d go so far to say that if you’re equally comfortable in HTML/CSS and InDesign, Pagedjs is a superior choice for long form layout. reply MilStdJunkie 9 hours agoparentI've been test-driving the web pdf build tool for Asciidoc, asciidoctor-web-pdf[1], for a few years, which uses Paged.js as the template engine before CSS PMM has its go. I like it - I like it a LOT[2] - but Puppeteer-Chrome bugs breaks the build on the regular, or requires a rework of templates. So the web-pdf team started just releasing docker images that include a tested Chromium version (among other things), so as to keep that from being such a PITA. Which is fine. Howaaaayyyyyyyver . . that shines a spotlight on a problem with this workflow[3]: the dependency on browser rendering kit. [1] https://github.com/ggrossetie/asciidoctor-web-pdf [2] Asciidoc has four major PDF pipelines in some form of maintenance. The vanilla, asciidoctor-pdf, is a Ruby-based Prawn PDF generator, and it's good but limited in terms of layout - you end up having to extend the core Asciidoctor processor for a lot of tricks like LoT/LoF. Asciidoctor-pdf, and I really want to emphasize this, is the official PDF pipeline for adoc files. The older pipeline, FOPUB, is based on DocBook, which Asciidoc has equivalency with. But DocBook means XSL, and XSL means cheating on Russian roulette because just one out of six chance of ENDING THE PAIN is not enough. The odd man out is DBLATEX, which goes Asciidoc->DocBook->LaTeX-> PDF, and . . whew, ok man, you're jumping three markup languages, dude. Other than that, LaTeX is pretty much the gold standard for layout markup. Finally, we got this thing, asciidoctor-web-pdf, which honestly is more or less dead in terms of activity, which sucks. Web-pdf gives me the flexibility of DocBook-XSL (and then some!) but with CSS and, if I need it, JS. Unfortunately, LoT/LoF still needs Asciidoctor extensions . . but you get a lot of toys that aren't possible with asciidoctor-pdf/prawn.

CSS is very compelling, but then based on my personal experience as print media designer the likes of InDesign are full of various special tricks (and language-specific, too) for alleviating white space corridors, handling hanging punctuation, hyphenation, etc. that the enterprise-level software tends to accumulate (due to the business model if nothing else). reply sings 7 hours agorootparentIt is limited and depends on the browser used to print the document. The most glaring missing feature is CMYK colour. I’ve just set up our publications to use PagedJS, and with a fair amount of hacking I was able to set up a baseline grid. Hyphenation depends on the browser implementation, which is OK for English in recent Chromium. The new text-wrap property has also been helpful. Hanging punctuation is only supported in Safari if I remember correctly. But being able to produce nice looking PDFs from a markdown document, with automated endnotes and table of contents, is a much nicer process than going through InDesign, and I also say this as someone equally comfortable with both. And the result is good enough for our purposes. Here is an example: https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/LA... reply strogonoff 6 hours agorootparentI agree that InDesign generally is clunky (the same reason it has a lot of typesetting black magic: business model where you make money by satisfying requests of perfectionist designers and their managers). However, in the past, while I was still doing relevant work, I had mild success abstracting some of it out by defining a template and populating it with data imported from JSON. Now I’m not using ID much, and struggling with generating PDFs from HTML, so I really appreciated the example you gave. Great work! reply delhanty 6 hours agorootparentprev> but then based on my personal experience as print media designer the likes of InDesign are full of various special tricks (and language-specific, too) That seems to concur with an informative article by AtaDistance from 2019 that I read the other day [0]: > ... > The result was InDesign 1.0 J which shipped in early 2001.

The western baseline typography model and font metrics is how PostScript and OpenType fonts, and all layout engines evolved.

I don’t even speak Japanese all that well, the guy basically looked for someone with IDJ (which I had coincidentally) and basic skill to operate it. The software handles most of the magic. As a designer, I won’t pretend I didn’t feel a little used. reply dylan604 6 hours agorootparentprevThe lack of manual kerning to avoid rivers of white space is something that I wouldn't even begin to know how to tackle in CSS.

The wysiwyg of DTP apps is like pure training wheels or a warm fuzzy blanket in getting work done reply strogonoff 6 hours agorootparentA large amount of and spans with letter-spacing or font-kerning can help, but no one’s going to do that (unless you go for an extremely fixed layout or engage JavaScript, which I would consider in poor taste for these purposes). I concur on the warm fuzzy blanket of DTP software, personally. reply dylan604 6 hours agorootparentexactly. that sounds like a pretty good description of hell to me. i much prefer highlighting the text, alt/option-left/right to adjust the kerning in real time. this type of description of using CSS for DTP reminds me of using tables for layout before CSS. it was a bullshit solution waiting for something better. only, in this case, DTP software is already there and better. so why would someone do this to themselves? reply strogonoff 5 hours agorootparentI imagine to avoid paying expensive license fees, to stick with OSS out of principle, and/or to implement various fun integrations. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparentoh to be young and a dreamer. now, i just want to get work done with the most efficient tool for the job. that kind of hell is for the young reply strogonoff 51 minutes agorootparentI just worry that the growing generations don’t degrade typesetting quality too much… Not that it’s particularly stellar in the mainstream, but I sure hope it wouldn’t get even worse! reply yboris 7 hours agoparentprevCool!

The experience was terrible. While all was perfect on my 1-page proof print, both large browsers messed up the final document (with a few hundred labels on several pages). Firefox forgot to render images after a few pages. So on some labels the barcodes were not printed. Chrome looked good at the fist glance. But it turned out that the plot/cut lines (which I created via CSS borders) had been shifted by 1-2mm on _some_ pages. Result was garbage. I finally switched to https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer which is a high quality HTML/CSS to PDF library. Only drawback is that it only supports CSS 2.1, so some fancy features are not supported like rotating text. reply capitainenemo 5 hours agorootparentHuh. I just did that a few months ago without issues in Chrome and Firefox after a little tweaking. Perhaps it was related to how you centred it?

I originally was going to generate PDFs, but my backend is in python, and all the PDF generators have some issues with SVG images, especially with gradients. The site is a wiki, so SVG seemed like the best way to map courses while allowing them to easily be edited down the road. Since CSS and SVG work hand in hand, I decided to start working on that, and it's actually turned out okay. If you want to see it in action, you can pop over and look at any of the courses marked with a blue or red flag on the homepage, but a very good example is Pasatiempo, here: https://golfcourse.wiki/print_options/course/pasatiempo_golf... reply bepero 1 hour agoprevHere is also: https://github.com/vladocar/Hartija---CSS-Print-Framework reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agoprevI recently setup a label printer where the labels get printed from a full page app to a Brother label printer that takes rolls of 62mm wide and 30 meters long. The printer cuts after each page break. It's a regular usb printer but with a funny page size. Also, Brother's website for finding the mac drivers is a bit of a maze of misdirection that tries to get you to install their extremely shitty application. In the end I found a 3rd party website with a working printer driver for this thing. After a bit of tinkering, I was able to print 6.2x12.4cm labels with a QR code. Really fun to watch it spit out these stickers. Each sticker has a unique QR code with the printed code in text form below it. Some gotchas: - you have to use margin 0 to hide the ugly browser headers that get added in the margin otherwise. - Firefox has no print preview. This makes testing a bit hard. I used Chrome for testing this in the end. - To print, you replace the dom tree with your print page, invoke print, and then copy back the app's root node from javascript. This is ugly as it shows the print page below your print dialog while that is open. I've not found a better way to do this. I guess I can do some non page layout that shows while that happens. Hacky but it works. - I've yet to make this work in landscape mode where the page is vertical 62x31 layout to print small stickers. @page { margin: 0mm; size: 124mm 62mm; size: portrait; .sticker { padding: 4mm; page-break-after: always; } } The rest is just usual html layout. I used a simple flex row with two elements. Print quality is surprisingly good. Cost per sticker is around 0.3 cents per sticker. Amazing value. reply euroderf 1 hour agoparent> Brother's website for finding the mac drivers is a bit of a maze of misdirection that tries to get you to install their extremely shitty application.

Many of these features have been there since the inception. Just that browser support has been lagging. How do you break a table inside a float? Etc. reply bradgessler 11 hours agoprevBrowser support for printing is so bad that I'm going to have to create a native app for https://www.thingybase.com to have a streamlined workflow of printing labels to a thermal label printer. It works now, but first you have to download a PDF and print that. Google Docs does this too when you hit \"Print\". I've tried hacks like load the PDF in an iframe and use some JavaScript to print that, but then I get footers with the URL of the webpage, which doesn't work for my purposes. If you work on Chrome/Blink, Safari/Webkit, or Firefox/Mozilla please please please at least get the hacks working! A CSS standard would be great, but really I'd be happy if I could call a function like `windows.print(\"/document.pdf\")` and have it print the PDF without all the footer/headers stuff. reply thekingshorses 11 hours agoparentWell, you can use .pdfp to print it on Windows. You will need adobe acrobat (free). This is a very old trick but still works on Windows 10. We use it with the latest edge.

When you drop an image file (PNG, BMP) into it, it prints it out. A config file would tell the printer what paper stock you have loaded. This way the computer does not need any special drivers, and it would be so stupidly easy to write programs that generate image files to be printed.

Not if you need to support a bunch of different printers. For me PDF is the way to go, but browsers can't print a PDF via a \"Print\" button within the HTML, so instead I have to build apps that download the PDF and print it directly through operating system APIs. reply blorenz 9 hours agorootparentI have this in my SaaS, as well. I built an Electron app that ushers the jobs from the cloud to the thermal printer. It all works until there is a failed job and the queue backs up.

An approach I have used (more or less): - have a print.html template page - use iframe to render and load the page - either on the print page, or from top frame, call window.print You can use the aforementioned js libraries to generate footers and such, and use any print css. You can test the print layout in your dev tools, no need to wait for browser preview. Note that browsers will try to render thead and tfooter elements on every page their parent table spans, that can be very useful. At work we have a playwright container with express js waiting for incoming requests to load the print.html page and save it as pdf. We're also using volumes so that all data exchange happens in disk and not being passed around in http requests.

    "originBody": "French Court Issues Damages Award for Violation of GPL On February 14, 2024, the Court of Appeal of Paris issued an order stating that Orange, a major French telecom provider, had infringed the copyight of Entr’Ouvert’s Lasso software and violated the GPL, ordering Orange to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages. This case has been ongoing for many years. Entr’ouvert is the publisher of Lasso, a reference library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO). The Lasso product is dual licensed by Entr’Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses. In 2005, Orange won a contract with the French Agency for the Development of Electronic Administration to develop parts of the service-public.fr portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code to its modifications available. Entr’Ouvert sued Orange in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other things, issues of proof of Entr’Ouvert ‘s copyright interest in the software, and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement. On March 19, 2021, the Appeals Court first rejected Entr’Ouvert’s claims for copyright infringement, saying that the case was a breach of contract claim. The Court of Cassation, which is the supreme court of France, reviewed the case and issued an order on October 5, 2022 overturning the decision of the Court of Appeal. The case was then remanded to the Court of Appeal, which issued its order this week. The compensatory damages were based on both lost profits of the plaintiff and disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury. Note: I patched this information together from various articles, mostly read in translation. The dates in the lawsuit process were inconsistent in those sources. If I find any errors, I will update this post. Update 2/22/24: Here is the decision in French.

I am personally not a fan of GPL family licenses BUT I am sick of fellow OSS developers who keep telling me not to worry about the minutiae of the license. (Usually some form of “Oh don’t worry because we aren’t litigious right now, as long as you stick with our incorrect interpretation of the license”) My team is responsible for a lot of corporate contributions to open source (some GPL) and I have to pay extra attention to the license terms as a result. There’s a lot of GPL software that operates in the grey (and many OSS devs who don’t understand their license choices), and I very much like my licenses to be as black and white as possible so I can avoid any risk. Having legal precedence to point to will help make concerns concrete. reply jillesvangurp 14 minutes agoparentIt's a good thing to point out that judges are notoriously indifferent about \"he said that she said\" type arguments. In the presence of anything that looks like a license text or contract that's usually what they take as the starting point for a decision. In so far that is enforcable of course. Most longer licenses usually have some language stating what happens when certain things aren't enforcable. With GPL, the version matters. I'm not aware of any GPL v1 licensed stuff, it probably was a bit short lived. But there's quite a few things licensed under GPLv2 and GPLv3. v3 tried to close a few loopholes v2 had that some companies working with e.g. Linux or Java see as a feature rather than a bug. Many corporate lawyers don't like GPL style licenses and particularly AGPL because these licenses have a lot of things to say about things like intellectual property, patents, servers, and uses that are/aren't allowed that probably isn't OK with most corporate lawyers worth their money. With GPLv2, this stuff has been through the courts a few times so the industry seems comfortable with it at this point. Whether those lawyers are right or not is not something engineers should be overruling based on vague notions of fairness, gut feelings, loose interpretations, etc. The whole \"it's fine because we're all nice people\" doesn't have much value in a court room. Licenses are for when people stop being nice to each other. I prefer the MIT license for my own projects. It's simple and clear and completely uncontroversial with corporate lawyers. It has decades of use, is well understood, and has very little ambiguity. Lots of OSS is licensed with it. It's fair for developers and users. Users being able to do what they want with the software is fully intentional on my part. That's a freedom I give them with that license and not something I actively want to restrict. Fully understood and intentional. reply Semaphor 2 hours agoparentprev> There’s a lot of GPL software that operates in the grey (and many OSS devs who don’t understand their license choices), Do you have examples? What kinds of misunderstanding are there? And what gets clarified by this case that wasn’t clear before? reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentI can’t give specific examples without calling out some projects. But usually it’s a misunderstanding of what derivative works are. E.g building an extension to a GPL app. Many don’t believe that simply importing a GPL Python module is enough to make your extension have to comply to GPL. Or things like what constitutes distribution. E.g employees vs contractors vs third party collaborators etc… But when I have to deal with said project owners, they bring up that the GPL is about the spirit of the license, not the exact words. They often say not to worry about litigation. This case doesn’t specifically clarify those terms but it does highlight that GPL violation is a serious issue that can’t just be treated as a suggestion. That any lawsuit has taken place and won means that 1. I can point to cases where the license choice is impactful when working with existing projects or when setting up new OSS projects in my industry 2. It also means that the license proponents may feel more empowered (as they should) to take action against infringement. Basically, very few people take software licenses as seriously as they should. Cases like these help make them a more serious matter. The more seriously people take it, the easier my job gets for multiple reasons. And since someone might ask, the license I advocate for the most is Apache 2.0. It covers the most ground, with the most clarity and the most protections for all parties involved. reply alentred 51 minutes agorootparent> Many don’t believe that simply importing a GPL Python module is enough to make your extension have to comply to GPL. I can almost hear the chairs squeaking under the many SaaS devs reading this. IANAL, but as far I know the debate is not settled on whether this clause applies to SaaS, that is when you do not distribute the software per se, and the general consensus so far is that it does not. This is the \"raison d'etre\" for the AGPL license, which covers the SaaS use case. reply peppermint_gum 13 minutes agorootparentprev>But usually it’s a misunderstanding of what derivative works are. E.g building an extension to a GPL app. Many don’t believe that simply importing a GPL Python module is enough to make your extension have to comply to GPL. The GPL doesn't explicitly define the concept of derivative work. The FSF's interpretation is that linking creates a derivative work, but there's no universal consensus among lawyers on this issue. LWN has an article that presents a few different views on this topic: https://lwn.net/Articles/548216/ reply Semaphor 2 hours agorootparentprevInteresting examples. Also, a weird take for them to think that’s not triggering the virality, if not that, what then? Directly using the source code only? > the GPL is about the spirit of the license, not the exact words. They often say not to worry about litigation. Even weirder. Especially since then, why pick the GPL at all? The only reasons I can see is that you care about free software, and want virality for that reason, and/or you want companies to pick a commercial license. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentI believe this is coming from the developers of a piece of GPL software who want to allow proprietary extensions. However, extensions to their software must import a python module that they created to register with their software or something. They don't want to invest time in separating that module and its dependencies into a different project with a different license (some variant of the LGPL), so they choose to believe that importing a python module is somehow different from linking a C library. From the point of view of the owner of the software, I can see how you can think that your intention matters more than the word of the license. It's wrong in a legal sense, of course, but it makes some kind of sense of you say \"nah, we'd never sue for that\". reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentIf the writer is the only copyright holder, if they just put the exception in writing, it's still OK. Like the exception for the Linux kernel to load proprietary binaries. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentprevUsually, the developers (and this is over multiple different GPL projects with different leads) have the following thought: 1. If you’re not touching the core code, it’s not under the GPL. I try and get them to LGPL license the extension points but they don’t see the benefit in trying to relicense it with all their contributors. 2. For your second point, the issue is that the GPL is intentionally vague as a deterrent for corporate abuse. The issue becomes that, as a corporate user: I have to take the most pessimistic view to protect myself. If I switch my hat to someone non corporate, then I take the most optimistic view. In those cases, they often say to not take the pessimistic view because that’s not the spirit as they understand it. reply growse 1 hour agorootparentI think I'm with you on this in general > 1. If you’re not touching the core code, it’s not under the GPL. I try and get them to LGPL license the extension points but they don’t see the benefit in trying to relicense it with all their contributors. I sense this comes down to a really poor definition of \"linking\" (is that the word in the text? Can't remember and don't have it to hand). It's not at all obvious for each software/language ecosystem which specific act constitutes \"linking\". > 2.

Including code in your code would always be a copyright violation. The Oracle vs Google case is very different. The OP is talking about copying implementations while Oracle vs Google is about copying APIs. The equivalent of Oracle vs Google here would be if you rewrote the exact same python module with exact same API names, but all your implementation was clean-room implementation. Here the question is, if the APIs themselves are copyrightable. reply toyg 56 minutes agorootparent> Including code in your code would always be a copyright violation. Well, not quite - shipping code with your code would be, because that is direct distributing. But if I ship a script to download your GPL library from PYPI and just use it as it comes, the argument on whether my application is a \"derivative\" of yours, is not an easy one. reply regularfry 19 minutes agorootparentIt's potentially not an easy one in law, but it is one that the GPL is explicitly intended to capture.

Or was that LGPL? Asking to show clarification for everyone. edit: the question was stated as ignorant to get a few decent explanations. Thank you for the effort! reply bnprks 1 hour agorootparentLooking closer at the GPL, it seems like most requirements only kick in once you \"convey\" GPL-covered code. If you make your users get the GPL component themselves from a 3rd party (e.g. PyPI or other package repository), then you might be okay. I'd be curious for input from others, but it seems like the following flow avoids GPL virality by avoiding \"conveying\" the GPL-covered code to the end-user: 1. You give your user a non-GPL python package with requirements.txt file (no bundled dependencies) 2. Your user pip-installs the dependencies (including some GPL-licensed ones) 3. Your user runs the application As long as your country doesn't consider use of an API prohibited under the copyright of the implementing code, I think steps 1-3 would be fine (though not very practical for a product). I'd be curious for others input, though, as this has bugged be for a while in the R community where several core libraries (like the Matrix package) are GPL licensed but many packages that depend on GPL packages claim to be licensed under MIT or some other license. reply account42 46 minutes agorootparentYeah for interpreted languages this may be OK. For compiled languages it becomes harder to not \"convey\" anything derived from GPL code you linked against. The GPL even explicitly exempts system components for this reason. reply LadyCailin 12 minutes agorootparentEven for compiled languages, you can get around this with a properly architected plugin architecture. Your core project (non-GPL) exposes a runtime plugin interface. It has no clue what plugins will be used, but provides all the operations needed for the plugin to do what it needs. Create a plugin which links to the GPL code. GPL the plugin itself. The user can then be directed to install the GPL plugin. I can’t see how this would be a violation (by the core developer) of the GPL, as the core doesn’t have the first clue what license its plugins are using, and indeed, multiple plugins could be used that have contradictory licenses. reply missjellyfish 49 minutes agorootparentprevThe end result will most probably violate the GPL. However, this is only realized by each user; you could probably argue that you never test your software and only look at API documentation. And then it becomes a problem of proving your users violating the GPL. So you'd have to go after each one of them, which will be incredibly difficult, and proving damages would be even more difficult. It's an asshole way of exploiting \"Wo kein Kläger, da kein Richter\" (where's no plaintiff, there's no judge) since actually proving that the developers violated the GPL will be difficult, unless they have a CI system that readily documents this. reply account42 45 minutes agorootparentAs a pure copyright license the GPL concerns itself with distribution only. You cannot violate the GPL as an end user without distributing something. reply missjellyfish 40 minutes agorootparentYes, all of the above is on the condition that some distribution happened (and you can prove that). However, distribution also happens in places you might not expect. As a business, I'd stray far away from such constructs even if I only use this construct internally. However, this is purely based on the wording of the GPL. For example, the EUPL explicitly covers the creation of derivative works - and I'd argue that the proposed circumvention would create a derivative work. reply bnprks 14 minutes agorootparentYeah, the crux of the issue would definitely be whether use of an API is prohibited by default under copyright law for a country (i.e. does using a library make something a derivative work of the library). In the US, at least, the Google v Oracle case makes me think this is worst case fair use (for many contexts) and best case too functional to be covered by copyright in the first place. Though I can certainly imagine that a multinational company might not be confident of the copyright status of API usage in all countries they operate in. juliusdavies 2 hours agorootparentprevPipe/exec into GPL generally considered okay (not a derivative work) What you described only okay with LGPL reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentAnd pipe/exec not because it's a magic boundary, but because that kind of interface is often so generic and simple it's not constituting a derivate work to use that boundary.

GPL requires any linkage to open source your parts, but allows for process boundary to not be viral. AGPL is the nuclear don’t touch because it is vital to all possible usage types. Again, that’s trivializing because there’s many subtle details that in many cases are intentionally not clarified in the licenses themselves reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentThere is no difference whatsoever between the GPL and the AGPL for software you distribute. The only difference between the AGPL and the GPL relates to software you don't distribute, but that you make available over a network, such as hosting an AGPL web server. The AGPL says that as long as public users interact with this web server, they have the right to get the code and deployment instructions and AGPL rights to be able to run the exact same service themselves, just as if they had downloaded the software. The FSF's (very reasonable) position is that linking to a piece of software makes your software a derivative work, but that launching it as a separate process or accessing it over a network generally doesn't. However, if you exchange very complex internal data structures with this GPL software running in a separate process, whether you do it over a network or through pipes or command line arguments or whatever, then your program is still a derivative work, in their opinion. That is, if you run gcc in a separate process but then mmap() it's memory and search for its entry points and jump to the memory locations of GCC functions in order to generate optimized code for a piece of GCC AST you provide, then your program is a derivative of GCC (according to the FSF, at least) even though GCC is running in a separate process. reply account42 52 minutes agorootparentprev> LGPL allows dynamic linkage without open sourcing your components. Also static linkage provided you provide users with the object files so that they can re-link with a modified library. > GPL requires any linkage to open source your parts With the exception of system components. Maybe that is what is causing the confusion because it's not intuitive why you can ship proprietary software that uses glibc but can't ship proprietary plugins for a GPL program. > AGPL is the nuclear don’t touch because it is vital to all possible usage types. That is an absurd viewpoint bordering on FUD. Affero licenses are only a problem if you are trying to work around the license terms. The license does fix loopholes for networked use that allowes SAAS providers to skirt the GPL but it is NOT any more viral than the GPL. Commercial use of AGPL software is absolutely possible - see e.g. cloud providers.

Can the rights holder of proprietary software contribute to or distribute a GPL or LGPL plugin for that software? reply GuB-42 22 minutes agorootparentThe important part with LGPL is not really about static vs dynamic linking. The important part is that you should be able to modify the LGPL library that the application uses. In the case of a python module or plugins, it is possible, so that's ok for LGPL. You can even statically link LGPL libraries with your proprietary application as long as you provide a way to relink your application with a modified version of these libraries. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentprevYou don’t have to distribute the plugin as xGPL but you do need to make it compliant. The L/GPL would widely consider Python imports as dynamic linking. Many companies will instead do shim/bridges that aren’t GPL themselves but something like MIT.

This too is somewhat of a grey area though that the GPL is vague on. reply flanked-evergl 1 hour agorootparent> You don’t have to distribute the plugin as xGPL but you do need to make it compliant. My reading of the GPL is that if you are the rights holder of some software, and there is a xGPL licensed plugin to said software, you can only distribute changes to the plugin if you also distribute your software as xGPL.

It works whether the other party is a legal or a moral person, they're also allowed to get inside their home or office and seize physical things, or even put a place for sale. See [1]. You need a \"titre executoire\", which a judgment in court is. If on the other hand you have a simple normal everyday contract and the customer isn't paying for it, you can ask the court for a titre executoire, where the other party can argue and the judge can check whether it was a real contract / you delivered / ... and if yes will give an order to pay -- it takes between 2 weeks and 3 months in my experience, if you get the titre and the other party still doesn't pay then you can use the commissaire de justice de seize from their account. If your contract is for a sum below 5000 you don't need to involve the court, only to have tried amical resolution before, and then the unpaid contractual debt act as a titre executoire by itself, that the commissaire can act on (though as that point the other party is allowed to involve a judge to protect themselves if needed or wanted). They usually send a notice to banks and banks have to return what accounts they own for said person, to allow the proportional seizure. Now this has limits of course, most importantly if the other party is insolvent, or if the commissaire cannot find their assets or they don't have any, etc ...

More precisely, the law does not govern the monetary gains possible from copying but rather the author's artistical expression in the work. Which is kind of moot regarding source code, but, it makes for an important decision: author's rights are created automatically and you cannot transfer them under any circumstances whatsoever. Per default, the law states that the author retains all rights. They can license it, e.g. to their employer, exclusively; The employer can then sublicense that. However what licenses are possible is exhaustively defined in the law; on an abstract basis at least (e.g. using, creating derivative works, ...). It has been not exactly clear if conditions evoked on a license still have their roots in these licensable acts, or if they are based on contract law - where literally anything goes as long as it's not against the law or immoral. Both can be enforced. However, I'd argue that it is good that it was decided that this is a copyright law matter, because this gives authors _much_ more protection than contract law, where all circumstances need to be evaluated for each single case and rulings might as well contradict each other. Not a lawyer yet, though. reply gwd 1 hour agorootparent> However, I'd argue that it is good that it was decided that this is a copyright law matter, because this gives authors _much_ more protection than contract law Copyright law may give the authors more power; but unfortunately, experience teaches us that there's usually not much incentive for the authors to enforce their rights. (The case in TFA is an exception, since the author profits directly from dual-licensing.). For this reason, the SFC has been trying to get the courts to also see it as a contract; and specifically, one in which all other possible users of the software are beneficiaries. This gives random third-parties standing to sue for damages.

Be that as it may, at least from my perspective what really prohibits me from actually enforcing GPL on my software is funding. I rarely go beyond sending a stern letter, because anything more would be financial suicide in most cases; I might win but it is incredibly hard to prove damages. Punitive damages don't really exist in the EU (or, to be more precise, in the roman-german law system), at least not to the exterme seen in common law systems. At least in my case, I'd fight tooth and nail for my software, if I don't have to bear the financial risk. reply graemep 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe some European countries, but copyright law varies across Europe. You can definitely transfer copyright in the UK, rather than an exclusive license. You might be confusing copyright with moral rights which are not transferable but I believe that is the same in the US. reply missjellyfish 1 hour agorootparentI was simplyfying. What I described is unified in the European Union; however, the outlined distinction is common across the roman-germanic law system whereas the US copyright interpretation is rooted in common law. In Europe, the only countries using common law are UK and Ireland. And while Ireland has mostly unified their copyright law with the rest of the european union, you still see some roots in common law. For example, it is possible that an irish company (a legal person) can become an author of a work, which is impossible under e.g. german law. And yes: in a common law system, copyright governs literally \"the right to copy\", which is transferable. In other law systems (which is the distinction I made) the law governs the property rights of the author's expression, which is non-transferrable, you can only license the rights you have. reply iLoveOncall 1 hour agoprev [–] Licenses is really a cancer that the open source world never needed.

    "originBody": "Please, enough with the dead butterflies! May 31, 2017 - Illustration news - 28 Comments We all have pet peeves, even though there’s a lot going on in the world that makes them pretty insignificant. While acknowledging that there are many more important things in life, I write this post about my own personal illustration pet peeve in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’ll make a little teeny difference. Here goes: I love butterflies. They’re one of my favorite subjects to illustrate and one of my favorite sights in nature. To me, they’re a symbol of hope, an embodiment of beauty, and a sign of what’s right in the world. I think that’s why it bothers me when depictions of butterflies often fail to do them justice, whether they are in a work of art, a website, a product, an animation, or in print. My explanation needs to begin with a description of a dead butterfly. When a butterfly is placed in an insect collection, the person who prepares it positions its wings according to a convention that facilitates identification. In the photo of a dead, pinned butterfly below, note that the trailing edge of the forewings (blue line) is perpendicular to the body’s axis (red line). When the insect has just been killed, it remains flexible for awhile, allowing the collector time to insert a pin and manipulate its wings into this position, where they are held in place until they become dry and stiff. This is an unnatural position for the wings; it’s a pose that may be possible for the insect to assume in life, but not a position that most species typically assume. Photo of pinned Viceroy © Emily S. Damstra In field guides and other butterfly reference materials, one frequently sees images of such pinned butterflies because, I presume, it is easy to photograph a dead butterfly. Also, numerous photos of dead butterflies against the same background is aesthetically consistent, and the pinned position allows the viewer to see as much of the hind wings as possible, aiding identification. It is a useful convention and it makes sense in field guides. By contrast, butterflies that are alive and going about their business of flying and nectaring do not typically hold their forewings too far forward of their head. In life, the way a butterfly holds its wings is variable, but it is uncommon for most species that I’ve encountered to hold their forewings in the manner of pinned specimen. Here are some photographs I’ve taken over the years that demonstrate this: Viceroy, alive! © Emily S. Damstra butterfly photos © Emily S. Damstra As you can see, in most cases, it is the leading edge of the forewings that is nearly perpendicular to the body. One will notice quite a bit of variability in wing positions in living butterflies, but it’s atypical for the trailing edge of the forewings to be perpendicular to the body. This is true not only of butterflies that are perched, but also of butterflies aloft. As an example, view this photo of monarchs in flight. There are exceptions, of course. It seems that some of the smaller butterflies may exhibit wing positions fairly close to that of a dead, pinned specimen: Pearl crescent photo © Emily S. Damstra Eastern Tailed blue © D. Gordon E. Robertson CC BY-SA 3.0 I suspect that the field guide photos of dead, pinned butterflies are the ultimate (though unwitting) source of my pet peeve: The pervasive phenomenon of butterflies in popular culture being shown as dead, with the trailing edge of their forewings perpendicular to their body. Here are some examples: You can see at this link that the practice of illustrating dead butterflies goes back a long way, in a painting by a 19th century artist. A particularly ironic example is this movie poster for a documentary about the flight of monarchs. Some of the flying monarch illustrations are accurate, but the largest and many of the others are clearly dead, even though they’re depicted as if in flight. Stock photography sites include misleading photos of dead butterflies purporting to be in flight. Here’s one. Here’s another. It’s understandable that customers would accept the description as accurate, even though it isn’t. This website shows numerous butterfly tattoos. Only a few look alive, despite the tattoo artists’ clever technique of inking cast shadows to give the impression that the butterflies are actually perched on the skin. Had the recipients of dead butterfly tattoos known the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I have to believe they would have more carefully considered their options. I think a depiction of a living butterfly is the most effective way to convey its positive symbolism. Dead butterflies are frequently spotted in gift shops. You can rest your head against them, adorn your ears with them, hang them on your wall, enoy them while you sip a beverage, wrap your gifts with them, or wear them: Dead butterfly on a pillow Dead butterfly earrings Dead butterfly wall hanging Dead butterfly thermos and bottle Dead butterfly ribbon Dead butterflies on a t-shirt. At least the largest one and some of the others look alive… I have blurred a couple company names in the photos above because I’m not trying to shame anyone. Most people have seen and are influenced by thousands (millions?) of depictions of unintentionally dead butterflies and have never considered the difference between a living and a dead butterfly. That’s why I decided to write this post. I’m not innocent of committing my own pet peeve. In 2001, I illustrated the endangered Karner Blue butterfly using pinned specimens as a reference: Karner blue butterfly illustration © Emily S. Damstra Had I realized then what I know now, I would have changed the wing and leg positions to be more lifelike. It would have made for a better representation, even though I was not attempting to show the insects in flight or perched on a flower. Nowadays, if you ask me to illustrate a butterfly, I will position its wings as if it is alive: Monarch butterfly illustration © Emily S. Damstra Red admiral illustration © Emily S. Damstra I realize there are some instances where it isn’t clear that the artist/designer intended to show a living butterfly, and where it may be perfectly acceptable to represent a dead butterfly. Nonetheless, there’s no good reason to depict a dead butterfly in the vast majority of situations. It doesn’t take much effort to be accurate about wing position. My hope is that the multitudes of butterfly images in our culture will gradually shift toward alive, which is how I prefer to think of them, and how I think these beautiful insects should be seen. If you hadn’t previously noted the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I’m afraid you will now begin to see dead butterflies EVERYWHERE, as I do.

Dante June 1st, 2017 Don’t professionals pin a bit to the side, instead of the vertical middle? edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Dante, I believe that is true when pinning several other groups of insects, but not Lepidoptera. However, I’m not an authority on that, so don’t quote me! Please, enough with the dead butterflies!ExtendTree June 1st, 2017 […] Read Full Story […] Sharon R. June 1st, 2017 Maybe it helps to think of illustrated butterflies as a kind of iconography? If you work with little kids (especially girls) one of the first things they learn to draw is “a butterfly” (meaning, a dead butterfly). It will not have anything like natural coloring, and might have big friendly eyes, but will definitely have two curling antennae and spread, uplifted wings. It’s a heraldic image, like a lion rampant. Lions don’t look like that, but the symbol says what it needs to. Just a thought. edamstra June 2nd, 2017 I appreciate your comment, Sharon. In my view, the reason kids would draw a butterfly in the pinned position is solely because it is (unfortunately, I argue), ubiquitous in popular culture. I have no problem with stylization, but one can represent a butterfly in a stylized way with the wings in life position just as easily as with the wings in pinned position. I think a heraldic lion, while perhaps not true to life, is still regal and an appropriate symbol. By contrast, I think a butterflies in life position make for more meaningful iconography than ones in pinned position. Nick June 1st, 2017 You photographs of “lifelike” butterflies (wings back) show the bufferflies perched. Is it possible however that, during flight, the wings do actually flap to a more forwards position? I’ve tried to check a few slo-mo videos, it does seem to depend on the species a little but while hovering and descending, butterflies’ wings do seem to come forwards more than when they are perched at rest (the wings tend to trail the head when taking off and climbing). edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Nick. Please see my reply to Arthur’s comment on this post. Sorry, very sorry June 1st, 2017 Interesting article, but is this issue a pet peeve? I fear it is a bug a boo. mc funk June 1st, 2017 I feel totally ruined because soon after reading this I saw a post on FB with a picture of a beautiful dead butterfly held in someone’s fingers, with the caption: “The butterfly is a living symbol of Christ. It begins it’s life among us, then “dies” and is wrapped in a cocoon until it is raised, glorified! The butterfly is also a beautiful reminder of those who are no longer with us, but with god.” I mean, a lovely sentiment of course, totally ruined (or made totally hilarious) by my new awareness of dead butterflies. edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Indeed! foo June 1st, 2017 It looks like you want to make a point that dead butterflies always have their wings stretched like that. I’m pretty sure some of those other butterflies in the pics were also dead, just had their wings at a more natural position. edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Thanks, foo. Perhaps I should have better emphasized the point that the dead butterfly position I’m referring to is the conventional one used for insect collections. Of course, when butterflies die naturally and there is no one to collect them, their wings do not end up like those in my photo of the pinned Viceroy. Aside from that photo, all of actual butterflies in my photos were alive. fl0ridian June 1st, 2017 I got a good chuckle and an education out of this. I kept seeing it on hackernews and finally clicked on it. Glad I did, and despite the title, not what I expected. I used to photograph butterflies at every opportunity and I never noticed the wing positions. edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Thanks. I noticed that there is quite a variety of comments on the subject at Hacker News. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14460013 Arthur M. Shapiro June 1st, 2017 Of course you’re correct that the rigid spread posture is not “lifelike.” And you are correct that it goes back to the early 19th Century. It was adopted as the standard mounting posture for museum specimens for the specific reason that it maximizes the exposed wing surface, giving visual access to all or nearly all elements of the pattern. Since the point of field guides is to facilitate visual identification, it’s not surprising that many older ones use the museum-spread posture in their illustrations. However, the trend is strongly away from that. Digital photography has made it much easier to photograph live butterflies in the wild, and most field guides in print today use either photographs or art drawn from photographs of live butterflies. My own “Field Guide to Butterflies of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento Valley Regions” (UC press, 2007) has magnificent paintings (by Tim Manolis) of everything in lifelike poses (except a handful of skippers that are exceedingly difficult to sight-ID). By the way, the biggest Monarch in the movie poster is not in a dead pose. It’s actually in mid-wingbeat. Before digital photography there was quite a bit of fakery of butterfly pictures, even in respectable magazines. It was usually very easy to spot the fakes. Not only were the wings in unlifelike positions, but the compound eyes had turned brown or black (they would usually be greenish or bluish in many species in life)–and sometimes one could see the hole in mid-thorax where the pin had been artfully removed! Did you know Vladimir Nabokov was both a sophisticated Lepidopterist and a skilled artist? He drew them in flight or in museum spread depending on the use/purpose of the drawing. An antiquarian bookseller once showed me one of VN’s novels in which he had drawn a butterfly on the flyleaf. He asked me if I could identify the butterfly. I told him it was an anatomically-correct swallowtail, but one that God had not gotten around to creating yet. edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Thank you for sharing your comments and experiences, Arthur. I haven’t had the privilege of seeing your book, but it pleases me to know that you worked with an artist and that his paintings show the butterflies in life positions. I too have noticed that more recent field guides show butterflies in life positions, and I’m very happy about that. I did know that Nabokov was a Lepidopterist, but I wasn’t aware that he was also an artist. How interesting! I respectfully disagree the movie poster’s largest monarch is in mid wing-beat. As others have pointed out in the comments (Nick and Rick), at least some butterflies do actually move their forewings significantly forward of their head while in flight. See the link Rick posted, with his excellent in-flight photo at the bottom of that page, and see also this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odvYot6Rldw At 9 seconds in, the maximum extent of the insect’s downstroke, one can see that the forewings are quite a bit forward of the head. However, in Rick’s photo as well as in the video, we are seeing the insect from the side. Seen from the top, the wings would look quite different from that of a pinned specimen and from the movie poster example due to their downward-pointing angle. (Also, the large butterfly in movie poster has a very narrow abdomen, an additional clue that the reference used for it was likely a dried specimen). Rick Cavasin June 2nd, 2017 While I agree with the overall sentiment of the article, I feel I should point out what I feel is an error in fact. Nick and Arthur have already mentioned that a butterfly’s wings will move forward in flight. I normally photograph butterflies at rest, but I have photographed a few in flight, and the wings can be in all sorts of positions, including the “wing forward” position the author decries. I dug up one such photo, and placed it on one of my web pages for anyone who is interested in viewing it. Scroll down on this page: http://www.ontariobutterflies.ca/families/pieridae/large-marble edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Thanks for your comments and link to photos, Rick. I recognized your name as the author of the Pocket Guide to Butterflies of Southern & Eastern Ontario; kudos to you for that resource, as well as for creating your excellent Ontario Butterflies website. I stand by my assertion that the pinned position “is an unnatural position for the wings.” For an explanation, please see the reply I just made to Arthur’s comment. Tfoz June 2nd, 2017 Very enlightening! Thank you! I also enjoyed reading the commenters’ various positions on butterflies’ wings in flight. Jim Dodd June 2nd, 2017 Very interesting article. We need to see nature as it really is. Next you can write an article about how lemmings don’t really commit mass suicide. What would ever possess the Walt Disney company to even come up with that idea in the first place? edamstra June 2nd, 2017 Good question! Art Shapiro June 2nd, 2017 I agree that the abdomen in the movie poster is ridiculously narrow. The wing position could be “frozen’ in flight and is not intrinsically false. By the way–Rick may be interested to know that the Large Marble has gone regionally extinct in my part of California, where it was formerly common to abundant. We do not know the cause. The timing coincides with the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides–in fact, as we have published, a general regional butterfly decline coincides with that–but correlation does not prove causation. The Large Marble had been a great success story in adapting to the Anthropocene, breeding on the superabundant naturalized wild mustards after its native valley-grassland host, California Mustard (Guillenia lasiophylla) became very rare. So its loss is especially striking. Busy Bee – random($foo) June 3rd, 2017 […] Please, enough with the dead butterflies! (hn) […] Thistle June 3rd, 2017 I noticed this on a bag I have. I used to volunteer at a butterfly exhibit and know one of the butterflies well and the drawing has it spread too far, exposing a hindwing edge that is in a different color. You would never see it in real life. Louise June 5th, 2017 I totally understand you this is your pet peeve, and the dead butterflies perching in tattoos do look a bit off. I don’t really share your distaste for dead butterflies in art however. I work in a museum and have spent hundreds of hours pinning moths and butterflies. Entomological collections held in museums have their own kind of beauty in my eyes. I love classifying and collecting and when I take photographs of my collections, perfectly preserved, symmetrical specimens are particularly appealing. The idea that dead butterflies do not equal art doesn’t sit right with me, because art is subjective and the meaning you assign to living vs dead butterflies is personal. For field guides, I agree that it can be more useful to have pictures of butterflies in their natural poses. This butterfly book: https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/natural-history/The-Butterflies-of-Australia-Albert-Orr-and-Roger-Kitching-9781741751086 is great for that. The artist Albert Orr painted the entire life cycles of each of the butterflies of Australia, all in their natural conditions, which is really useful for identification. ps. your art is really beautiful 🙂 edamstra June 5th, 2017 Thanks for taking the time to write, Louise. I appreciate everyone’s perspective on this. You’re right that art is subjective, and as I said in my post, there are times when it is appropriate to depict a butterfly in the dead, pinned position. I agree with you that butterflies in that pose can indeed be beautiful, since I tend to think that all butterflies are inherently beautiful. The point I was trying to make is that so many of the images we see of butterflies are of dead butterflies, and I don’t believe that the people creating those images realize that they’re depicting dead butterflies. In many instances, it is obvious that the artist/illustrator/sculptor/etc. was attempting to depict a butterfly in a lifelike way – such as perched on a flower or flying – but didn’t understand that the ubiquitous spread-winged pose is actually that of a dead, pinned butterfly. I think if more people understand the difference between how a live butterfly holds its wings compared to how a collector positions them, we’ll see more lifelike depictions of butterflies. Thanks for the link to the Butterflies of Australia book; it’s good to hear that it includes of images of butterflies in natural poses.

Even when the truth is the exact opposite--unless the player-avatar is supposed to have inferior mechanical eyes. For example, Depth of field, lens flares, chromatic aberration without wearing glasses, etc. reply strogonoff 9 hours agoparentUnless the fidelity of the material (be it visual or audial) exactly matches that of the real world[0], there is no truly accurate depiction of reality you can convey to the observer—and with any lossy representation you have to make choices as to how to represent it. You will have adopted a “look” whether you want it or not; it is very much part of your creative effort (the less of it, the more work and creative choices are left up to the observer to filter). Basing your look on the preexisting and familiar is good because your work does not exist in vacuum; your observers carry common cultural baggage in context of which it is perceived. The look furthers your creative goals—conveys a mood or a feeling, focuses observer’s attention on what you consider important, etc. Here, fidelity works against you. All the figurative flare—be it compressing dynamic range, selecting your color palette, artificially lowering the frame rate, adding motion blur, film grain, lens artifacts and literal flares, etc.—lowers it selectively. That particular kind of flare can absolutely be misplaced, sure. For example, cartoon animation styles is an example of another extreme but quite well-established look, and arguably incompatible (the fidelity is already very selective from the get-go). Less extreme is 3D animation, where lens flare and the like can sometimes look uncanny. The case of dead butterflies, similarly, exists in cultural context. In some (most?) cultures, the symbol of the butterfly would represent something very far from death. However, once the awareness of the difference between a dead and alive butterfly is widespread enough, then one simply must adapt and adopt that new context because you are risking the dead butterfly to be interpreted as an intentional statement.

Some of the text contains ink that is blotted or runny, which makes their relationship extra-realistic.\" reply strogonoff 5 hours agorootparentI get what you mean, and I would have probably agreed a few years back, but I believe the matter is slightly more complex than that. First, even with your book example, which I do agree is cheesy, still—this is part of the message. I’d not be surprised if such an ebook existed, though it definitely wouldn’t be for me (even if I liked the genre). Second, part of my point was that simulating technological limitations has its uses. If you want to convey a mood, obscure unnecessary detail, etc., you have such tools at your disposal that will not look weird to the audience[0] and that resonate with the larger cultural context—which none of us exist outside of. [0] Unless someone else like yourself is in said audience, I suppose :) reply thfuran 9 hours agoparentprevDepth of field is a human eyes thing too. Though I'm with you on lens flare and film grain added just as stylistic flourishes rather than to convey \"this scene is camera footage\". It's like deliberately adding simulated compression artifacts. reply strogonoff 9 hours agorootparentImagine you record audio with perfect fidelity and extreme dynamic range. Now, you have the tiniest and the loudest sounds captured; how do you go about conveying this work? The answer is compression, equalization, all those tricks. And yes, that lowers fidelity, and yes, you will have to make choices as to what’s more important to focus perceptive attention. Similarly with video: many fidelity-lowering tricks serve a purpose. Film grain, aside from conveying a mood, can mask excess detail in shadows and highlights, the detail that would detract from the story you’re telling. A headlight flare can bring attention to the coming car; if your hero or villain is in that car, that’s useful. Panning over a fleeting sun flare, you momentarily focus on the environment and can use it to bridge attention between subjects or scenes. It’s all a complicated dance, and it all exists in time, inseparably from both the immediately preceding material and the larger current cultural context. reply ryandrake 6 hours agorootparent> Imagine you record audio with perfect fidelity and extreme dynamic range.

I think (to take it perhaps too seriously) the butterfly used in designs of cushions, earrings, etc. is more a cultural icon than it is an attempt at accurate biological description — it's something analogous to ♡ vs. a realistic depiction of an actual heart. For whatever reason, we've come to think of butterflies as looking the way they do in insect collections, and I don't think even knowledge of what the dead and alive specimens look like would make me want to draw it any other way. A 'dead' one just looks more butterflyish! I also have a feeling that it has something to do with the (more cultural than biological) distinction between moths and butterflies. For some reason, the latter are considered examples of exquisite beauty and the former usually an ugly (even fear-inducing) nuisance. Drawing butterflies in the classic 'butterfly' shape is a way to make this difference clearer — even if it's entirely inaccurate. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agoparentThat should be the right take, if it had no other connotations. For instance heart becoming ♡ is fine I think because we otherwise don't deal with raw hearts and they're only part of whole. It would be another issue if used the equivalent of the zombie emoji for \"human\" or a steak image for \"cow\" I guess it comes down to how much we care about butterflies, how often we see them, and how much we don't want them dead. I can see why people looking more at butterflies in their daily lives could be bothered, and also how that's probably a lost cause as 10x more people massively never leave cities. reply lisper 9 hours agorootparent> zombie emoji for \"human\" or a steak image for \"cow\" I think a better analogy is Vetruvian Man [1]. In fact, I think it's a pretty good analogy because it shows a human splayed out in almost exactly the same unnatural way that canonical dead butterflies are. Personally, I don't find either one particularly disturbing. Each serves a purpose IMHO. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man reply lukan 6 hours agorootparentprev\"I guess it comes down to how much we care about butterflies, how often we see them, and how much we don't want them dead.\" For me it comes down to how much we care about reality, vs. catering to our fantasy conception of what reality is. Fantasy in general is awesome - if you are aware that is is fantasy. But too many people mixed both concepts and this is bothering me, not particular butterflies. I think nobody thinks, a real heart looks like ♡. But people do think, butterflies look in real life, like when they are dead. It is a quite trivial thing here, but the same happens with much more important things as well. reply makeitdouble 3 hours agorootparentI agree with your point, and think it's also a complicated approach. The best way to put it could be that people having more knowledge of the world is better. For context, some people probably don't really have an image of how a heart is shaped. There was half of a joke about city kids who thought cows were purple because of the chocolate brand [0], and they probably never saw a cow in actual life nor really registered the colors in the books. And IMHO the best solution would be for them to see cows, and the pigs, and so many more animals everywhere. I kinda see the butterfly in the same way. The common icon being dead isn't great, but if we look at it as a symptom of a greater issue (I think we agree on this point) getting people to care more about butterflies in general would also solve the icon problem -- I'd actually want to see butterflies in the middle of cities. There would need so many things to change, but it would be for the better. Otherwise it becomes an endless battle as new icons are created everyday. [0] https://chocolatemarketaudit.wordpress.com/2018/10/26/the-st... PS; this also reminds me of the wheelchair icon and the fight to have it rolling instead of static. And I was moved by the pitch for this idea, while also thinking \"there's so few people in contact with wheelchair people in everyday life, will that message ever get a wide enough audience ?\" reply chefandy 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not fantasy, it’s an abstract idea represented by that visual symbol. The ♡ symbol, for example, pictorially represents a naive understanding of a heart, but the connotation of love— itself not accurate— is the real message. We don’t say someone had a “♡ attack” merely because we’re don’t think the symbol is accurate enough, it doesn’t jibe with the real meaning of that symbol. We also don’t assume MacBook Pros are fruit storage containers. Those symbols are *everywhere * in our lives. Check out triadic semiotics. reply lukan 2 hours agorootparentBut the ♡ and the apple in Apple are clearly abstracted. Those butterflies in the article look real.

The popular \"heart\" is rather abstract and does not directly depict anything biological. The popular \"butterfly\" is very concrete and precisely depicts something biological, namely a dead butterfly.

Look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUZmkw6YY0o#t=33s to see a butterfly in flight that does approximately manage the t-pose (the camera isn't at quite the right angle, but it's clear to see that the forewings are very forward and basically in t-pose). So butterflies in flight _do_ get this pose, from certain angles. reply cowsup 11 hours agoprevGreat post.

Although you can see the hindwings on most (but not all) butterfly species when they're resting, this isn't the case with most moths. So, in collections of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), entomologists adopted the practice of spreading the wings so that you can see both pairs clearly. It might not be natural but it's more helpful for identification purposes. reply Jensson 8 hours agoparentIt is like having a collection of human photos were they all T-pose. Makes identification easy, but not very beautiful or natural. reply DonaldFisk 7 hours agorootparentYes, it's a bit like those paintings of galloping horses made before the invention of short exposure photography showed how horses really look when they gallop. I suppose it's down to laziness - people could go out and take photographs of butterflies feeding at flowers, but no, they just copy a picture from a field guide and hope most people don't notice. reply jojobas 5 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it's conditioning or whatever, but I find butterflies more beautiful when dead. Maybe it's about more symmetry and balance so not just conditioning. reply Jensson 3 hours agorootparentIt doesn't look like a living animal that way. It is a nice icon or image, but not a nice picture of an animal. Although maybe that is the point, insects are gross so humans maybe prefer the non animal like picture of it. Many don't like the actual body of a butterfly, they just want the colorful wings so drawing it in a way that makes you not see it as an animal could be better for that reason. reply jojobas 1 hour agorootparent>It doesn't look like a living animal that way.

In the butterfly lifecycle, the caterpillar lives its own life, but then at its end shrouds and digests itself, to the point where only the rudiments of the nervous system persist. Then the butterfly itself grows out of this reduction of self to an egg. In the face of this astonishing life-death-life-cycle, we're complaining that butterfly wings should be depicted in their natural orientation? Butterflies are awe-inspiring, frightening and amazing. But not mainly for their pretty wings. Every living thing dies - yes, even us. But perhaps these words will persist in the internet archive, as dead wings sit in dusty drawers, to one day inspire :) reply notRobot 8 hours agoprevI remember reading this through HN a long time ago, and finding that it made solid points, and sharing it with several people over the years. However, I have wisened over the years and feel that I better understand what is worthwhile being pedantic about. Visual cultural representations of things don't have to look like the thing they are showing (the heart symbol doesn't look like a real heart, emoji don't look like real people or things). That only dead butterflies have their wings in the orientation most commonly represented is a fun piece of trivia, but IMO not worth caring about beyond that. reply Kaijo 7 hours agoparentIt isn't just a question of their visual representation in culture. Many major taxonomic works on Lepidoptera only provide illustrations of species in the pinned-out format. This is even more of an issue with moths than butterflies as moths show such a huge diversity of distinctive postures and wing configurations -- tucked up and folded away and overlapped in all kinds of unlikely and bizarre morphologies. I can think of so many weird examples, but to take one, check out this lasiocampid moth I found in Borneo some years back: https://i.imgur.com/auo2t9l.jpeg If you manage to find that species in the standard work to consult, the eighteen-volume Moths of Borneo[1], you'll only see images of a pinned-out specimen, which makes it look like all the others. The motivation for this was to provide a standardized format for the formal visual depiction moth and butterfly anatomy, principally for taxonomists who will be working with dead specimens, and where the actual delimitation and description of taxa is done mostly using microscopic characters. But how moths hold their wings gives very valuable diagnostic information for both field ID and broader questions of classification, that would be very useful to see in a standard reference. This is increasingly recognized and I know of several recent large monographs and ongoing surveys that emphasize including photographs or illustrations of the in situ appearance. [1] https://www.mothsofborneo.com/ reply Jensson 8 hours agoparentprevNatural usually looks better than obviously fake, so it is worth pointing it out if you want quality. It is like how fake round drawn breasts doesn't look as good as more realistically drawn ones, but it is much easier to draw round balls than the more nicer real shapes. So for these butterfly images they would look a ton better just by not having perfectly angled T-pose wings. Just varying that a bit and never having perfect angles would get you almost the same pictures but looking much more natural. reply bawolff 8 hours agoparentprevI feel like the objectionable part is not that its unrealistic, its that its dead, which is kind of morbid. > the heart symbol doesn't look like a real heart, As a fun trivia fact, it might not look like the organ but it does look like an acient form of contraception (Silphium) which seems more symbolically correct anyways. reply Izkata 8 hours agoprevButterflies are 3D, this depiction is 2D. Whether it's an accurate depiction depends on the viewing angle in addition to what the butterfly is doing - here's some photography of monarch butterflies, including a few side shots that would have the wings swept forward if it was viewed from behind: https://www.neurotraveler.com/home/2022/9/20/bif-butterflies...

The butterfly T-pose you see in human created images has that black line holding up the wings be perfectly perpendicular to the body. See this for example, they drew the butterfly as a bunch of T-posing sequences, it doesn't look like that when flying at all, it T-posing in one image would make sense but they do it for every image usually which is really off: https://media.istockphoto.com/id/185302115/photo/monarch-but... reply geor9e 11 hours agoprevSaved You A Click: Butterflies are often drawn by illustrators like dead specimens, with their wings pinned far above their head, when living butterflies do not hold their forewings very far forward of their head. reply pizzafeelsright 10 hours agoprev [–] I wish I had time to care about trivial things. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "commentBody": "Bug in reader/writer locks in Windows API (reddit.com)274 points by Georgelemental 18 hours agohidepastfavorite122 comments davekilian 15 hours agoI was wondering how something so basic could go unnoticed for so long. Halfway down the page on OP's link, a user u/rbmm provides a compelling answer: that there are (possibly expected?) cases where a thread trying to acquire the lock in shared mode can accidentally get it in exclusive mode instead. This is due to interleaving of atomic bit test-and-[re]set operations between the (shared mode acquire) thread and the (exclusive mode release) thread running simultaneously. The repro code holds the shared lock while waiting for all other threads to acquire the shared lock, and thus deadlocks if any of the worker threads accidentally gets an exclusive lock. In \"normal\" use cases where the lock is used to protect some shared resource, threads holding the lock don't wait for each other, so there is no deadlock. Interesting stuff! reply zozbot234 14 hours agoparentWhy does it have to use bit test and set and interleave with other threads, though. AIUI you can use a CAS loop to implement any RMW atomically over word-sized (or double word sized, on many platforms) data. That seems like a no-brainer. For comparison, the Rust implementation for lightweight RWLocks on futex-capable *nix platforms is here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/src/std/sys/unix/locks/fute... It sets the \"reader counter\" in the underlying atomic to a special value to signal that the lock is set for exclusive access. So a reader thread acquiring the lock as shared can never result in this kind of bug. Bits are used to signal whether readers or writers are currently waiting on a lock, but this just cannot turn a lock that's acquired for shared access into exclusive, or vice versa. reply NeillC 10 hours agorootparentWe use bit test and set as it causes us to get the cache line exclusive. This avoids using the prefetch write before fetching if we were to use CompareExchange. somebody was trying to talk to me about this stuff this morning but I didn't understand him. You can't expect a reader to always be compatible with other readers otherwise you livelock with a constant stream of readers. So we become incompatible. I am unsure if there is something beyond this. reply rbmm 8 hours agoparentprevhttps://github.com/rbmm/SRW-2 - possible better repro code . where i guarantee repro this without hundreds loops. i be say that \"question\" in RtlReleaseSRWLockExclusive implementation. it first remove Lock bit from SRW (and after this any thread can enter to lock) and then call RtlpWakeSRWLock. but this 2 operations not atomic. if in the middle (after Lock Bit removed and before RtlpWakeSRWLock executed) another thread acquire shared access - it got exclusive. and RtlpWakeSRWLock also \"fail\" after this - not wake any waiters. but when shared/exlusive owner then release lock..RtlpWakeSRWLock will be called again and self job. i be of course use bit another implementation, link to which i paste in another comment here reply NeillC 7 hours agorootparentThe lock in unfair. We are unfair because you get better performance by not allowing the lock hold time to be extended by context swap. As a result, we always unconditionally release a lock when an exclusive acquire is release or the last shared guy releases. Then we go find people to wake. In this gap the lock can be stollen. The threads that steal all look like exclusive guys. My overall rule of thumb is that in the presence of any exclusive acquires you can never assume a shared acquire is compatible with any other shared acquire. A second shared acquire might wait for the first acquire to exit. We do this for example, so a stream of readers don't starve a writer. This is another case like that but somewhat less obvious. I have no idea if the owners will attempt to fix or take the view that you're trying to assume something we don't guarantee. I'll admit that this is a kind of strange case. You could obviously queue a wait block and the in progress waker will sort this out. Could well get a performance impact from that. I tried to explain this general rule of thumb to you this morning when you contacted me. I could not understand much of what you said. reply quotemstr 6 hours agorootparent> My overall rule of thumb is that in the presence of any exclusive acquires you can never assume a shared acquire is compatible with any other shared acquire. Contract #1: In reader writer locks in general, after I share-acquire a lock, I know that there are no active exclusive owners of that lock and won't be until I release my shared lock. I can also expect that as long as I hold this shared lock, other threads can share-acquire the same lock without waiting. ony share-exclusive threads would have to wait. This general contract seems useful to me. The contract you're describing, contract #2, is one in which shared-acquire is an optional optimization over exclusive-acquire (not a contractual guarantee) and that the system is free to promote shared to exclusive lock acquisitions. This other contract seems finnicky and error-prone. Can't we have SRWLOCK implement contract #1? reply NeillC 6 hours agorootparentIt's typical not to allow a second share acquire to proceed if we have an exclusive waiter: t1: share t2: exclusive so waits t3: share also waits Thats how we arrive at the rule that shared acquires in anything, but a trivial system (no exclusive acquires) may not be compatible. So, contract #1 is typically not satisfied. Of course, this particular case is slightly different and so you might decide to support it. reply Tringi 3 hours agorootparentBlocking new readers when a writer arrives is perfectly good and desirable. Blocking readers when the writer finishes, and there isn't any new queued, is definitely not. reply userbinator 11 hours agoparentprevIf that \"rbmm\" is the same person as I've seen on other sites, and the characteristic non-native English is a clue that it is, he certainly knows his stuff. threads holding the lock don't wait for each other Unless you're doing nested locking. reply magicalhippo 9 hours agorootparent> Unless you're doing nested locking. In my experience, needing to do nested locking is a sign you're up the wrong creek. I've rewritten some interfaces and implementations from using nested locking to non-nested, and they became easier to use and much faster. Not saying there's never a place for them, but I avoid nested locking like the plague. reply rbmm 8 hours agorootparentprevyes, this is i (that \"rbmm\"), #opentowork reply AndrewStephens 16 hours agoprevSubtle bugs in Reader/Writer locks do not surprise me. I worked on an in-house implementation based on Win32 (before C++11 and std::shared_mutex) and my recollection is that although the implementation sounds simple it is exceedingly easy to make subtle mistakes. The experience left me with such a bad feeling for shared locks that I tend to avoid them unless absolutely required. When I last tested std::shared_mutex, performance was so poor compared to std::mutex that double-buffering the data protected by a simple mutex was much faster. This was a great post by the original Redditor. reply saclark11 7 hours agoparentAgreed. I avoid reader-writer locks unless absolutely required and benchmarks prove it worthwhile. Their usage often fails to outperform a regular lock due to additional overhead. They seem to make sense only in specific high-contention scenarios where arrival rate is high and/or the critical section has a long duration [1]. [1]: https://petsta.net/blog/2022-09-30-rwmutex/ - Go specific, but I suspect these results hold true for most implementations of reader-writer locks. reply tialaramex 14 hours agoparentprevSRWLock seems like a situation where it's small enough for you to construct proofs that what you did is correct, and important enough that the enormous expense of such proof is justified. The C++ std::mutex provided in Microsoft's STL is ludicrously big, whereas SRWLocks are the same size as a pointer. In one sense being ludicrously big is great - less risk the std::mutex will mistakenly share a cache line with your unrelated data, but for most people this makes std::mutex annoyingly expensive. reply NeillC 10 hours agorootparentMaybe my memory is faulty but I believe it was analyzed by Leslie Lamports stuff. Ofcourse your building a model of how it should work and you might have faults in that. reply Const-me 8 hours agorootparentprevC++ std::mutex provided in Microsoft's STL uses SRWLocks underneath, same size as a pointer. Sadly, SRWLocks have yet another bug, they are very unfair. Write a loop which locks std::mutex inside the body, and no other thread will be able to grab the mutex despite the loop repeatedly releases then re-acquires the mutex. Critical sections are way more fair. reply NeillC 6 hours agorootparentCritical sections are unfair also. Could be differences in spin count you are seeing. reply Tringi 3 hours agorootparentSome time ago I did some test, 256 threads competing on a small number of cache lines, and found out that all, CreateMutex, CRITICAL_SECTION and SRWLOCK, were quite fair.

Other approaches include: * breaking up the lock so different threads can access different parts of your data structure concurrently. * double-buffering (also called ping-pong buffers) where you effectively keep two copies of your data structure. The readers can access one without blocking, a single writer can modify the other and then swap. * just accepting that reads will block each other with a std::mutex and work on minimizing the amount of time spent in the lock. This can actually work out quicker depending on your access patterns. As always, careful profiling with real data is required to figure out what is better. reply secondcoming 10 hours agorootparentThe problem with double-buffering is that you still need to know when all the readers are no longer using one of the copies. T1: writer populates copy1 T2: readers access copy1 T3: writer populates copy2, and swaps T4: writer populates copy1, and swaps At T4 a reader from T2 could still be accessing the old data structure. Unless I'm overthinking it. reply AndrewStephens 9 hours agorootparentNo, you are right. One solution is that the readers access the buffer through a shared_ptr and can hold onto the old version for as long as they need it while the writer makes changes and creates a wholly new data structure. It is also possible for the writer to block new readers while doing the swap. Tradeoffs everywhere, depending on if you need readers to see changes that occurred after they started accessing the data. reply to11mtm 9 hours agorootparentprevNope, Ironically ran into this category of issue today with some buffer-reuse in a multi-threaded system. reply bingo3131 17 hours agoprevMisleading title?

I am kind of shocked no one has noticed this bug in that time. I guess under typical rwlock usage you just get random instances of shared lockers unable to acquire the lock and no deadlock, but still. reply Diggsey 15 hours agoparentI think part of the reason is that there's a very similar code pattern which is user error, and avoiding that pattern tends to avoid this pattern as well. The similar case occurs when you have: - 1+ threads holding a shared lock (Readers) - 1+ threads waiting to acquire an exclusive lock (Pending Writers) - 1+ threads trying to acquire the shared lock (Pending Readers) - 1+ Reader is waiting on a Pending Reader In this case the Pending Readers will be unable to acquire the shared lock even though it is still in \"read mode\" because in a fair RW lock Pending Writers are prioritised above Pending Readers so as not to starve the writer side of the lock. reply TillE 11 hours agoparentprevVista is when that API was first implemented. It's doing a pretty weird thing with the locks, I wonder what the actual use case was. Readers should almost never care about other readers. Typically you just grab the lock, read the thing, and release it. You always have to be super careful about deadlocks if you're holding a lock and also waiting around for something else to happen. reply ww520 12 hours agoprevThe program has a bug. It's mixing atomic and non-atomic variables in the yield() checking loop. Non-atomic variables have no guarantee on cache consistency for different threads. This can cause the loop to run forever. struct ThreadTestData { int32_t numThreads = 0; std::shared_mutex sharedMutex = {}; std::atomic readCounter = 0; }; // child thread DoStuff() { data->readCounter.fetch_add(1); while (data->readCounter.load() != data->numThreads) { std::this_thread::yield(); } } The numThreads field is not an atomic variable. It's initialized to 0 and set to 5 in the main thread. Its memory address is then passed to the child threads to be checked in the yielding loop. Since it's non-atomic, there's no memory barrier instruction to force its new value (5) to propagate to all CPU's running the threads. A child thread might get the old value 0. The logic of the yield checking loop using it would never exit. Since the main thread runs the code in an endless loop, the same numThreads memory allocated on the stack is being set to 0 and 5 repeatedly. Some of the child threads can get the old value in one pass of the loop. Thus the hanging. reply nemothekid 12 hours agoparent>Its memory address is then passed to the child threads to be checked in the yielding loop.

Their local caches of that memory see only a 5, since at the moment they read that cache line, the value in memory is 5; the operating system ensures that the write of the 5 value by the main thread is flushed to memory[*] before the main thread starts the child thread, and also that the cache of the child thread does not have stale data from before that moment. That memory location is only set back to 0 after all the child threads have exited, so there's no instant where the child thread could read a 0 on that location from main memory into its cache. > When a new thread lands on a CPU with the old 0 cache value, it will hang. When a new thread lands on a CPU core with an old 0 cache value for that memory location (which could happen if that CPU core had been running the main thread, and the main thread was migrated to another CPU core before it could set it back to 5), it will still see a 5 at that memory location, because the operating system invalidates the cache of a CPU core when necessary before starting a new thread on it. [*] Actually, it only has to be flushed as far as the last level cache, or the \"point of unification\" in ARM terminology; I simplified a lot in this explanation. reply zozbot234 11 hours agorootparentprevThe code runs in what's effectively a single-threaded context.

The equivalent of the memory barrier instructions is there, but it's hidden within the operating system code which creates and initializes a new thread. That is, the operating system ensures that the value in the current CPU (in this case, 5) is propagated to the CPU running the newly started thread, before the thread start routine (in this case, DoStuff) is called. The value is not modified while the child threads are running (it waits for the child threads to exit before clearing the value), so there's no chance of the child threads seeing the value being set back to zero. reply ww520 11 hours agorootparentBased on the Windows CreateThread API [1], it doesn't say anything about memory synchronization guarantee.

The result of attempting to indirectly access an object with automatic storage duration from a thread other than the one with which the object is associated is implementation-defined (I bet in practice almost all implementations behave as an equivalent C++ would, as per your notes, so only the ordering is relevant.

Cache coherence is actually guaranteed on almost all systems, you don't need to worry about it on anything big enough to be running Windows (in the embedded world we get to fight it though).

Outlook debuted Cached Exchange Mode in the early 00s, popularizing \"offline first\" before it was known as that. Now: The \"new\" Outlook can't even show folder unread counts correctly, even when fully online. It seems to only load a small subset of messages locally, only populating folders when you scroll past the point it loaded. (In classic Outlook, this was a setting—I understand loading all mail was not enabled by default—but it could be enabled. No longer.) It sometimes gets stuck where it won't show new mail until restarted. (Gmail has this bug too.) It forgets open mail windows when restarted. It forgets expanded folders in the folder pane when restarted (but only sometimes). Microsoft removed the ability to show the mail/contacts/calendar navigation bar below the folder pane, and forced it to be shown on its own huge vertical bar, almost all of which is wasted space. For good measure, they did this in classic Outlook as well as \"new\" Outlook. There was massive backlash to this, and Microsoft plowed forward anyway. On Windows there is/was a registry setting to revert this (but intentionally, no user-facing setting). I have not checked on Mac. To the sibling comment: Outlook for iOS is indeed great, probably only because it was an acquisition. It is not in Microsoft's DNA to build an app like this themselves anymore. As an admin: Microsoft seems to redo the Office 365 admin interface every 2-3 years. It is an incomprehensible mess. I am also a Google Workspace admin for the past several years, and theirs is far better, and it's more or less stable over the long term. Office 365 has been hacked by state actors recently. I still like the Outlook UI and feature set better than Gmail (despite the \"new\" Outlook being a major regression), so I begrudgingly stay with Outlook/Exchange because I dislike it less than Google Workspace. Fastmail does not give signs that they are a relevant company—they created JMAP and basically did nothing with it.

    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe Interesting ideas in Observable Framework 3rd March 2024 Mike Bostock, Announcing: Observable Framework: Today we’re launching Observable 2.0 with a bold new vision: an open-source static site generator for building fast, beautiful data apps, dashboards, and reports. Our mission is to help teams communicate more effectively with data. Effective presentation of data is critical for deep insight, nuanced understanding, and informed decisions. Observable notebooks are great for ephemeral, ad hoc data exploration. But notebooks aren’t well-suited for polished dashboards and apps. Enter Observable Framework. There are a lot of really interesting ideas in Observable Framework. A static site generator for data projects and dashboards JavaScript in Markdown Everything is still reactive Only include the code that you use Cache your data at build time Comparison to Observable Notebooks A change in strategy A static site generator for data projects and dashboards # At its heart, Observable Framework is a static site generator. You give it a mixture of Markdown and JavaScript (and potentially other languages too) and it compiles them all together into fast loading interactive pages. It ships with a full featured hot-reloading server, so you can edit those files in your editor, hit save and see the changes reflected instantly in your browser. Once you’re happy with your work you can run a build command to turn it into a set of static files ready to deploy to a server—or you can use the npm run deploy command to deploy it directly to Observable’s own authenticated sharing platform. JavaScript in Markdown # The key to the design of Observable Framework is the way it uses JavaScript in Markdown to create interactive documents. Here’s what that looks like: # This is a document Markdown content goes here. This will output 1870: ```js 34 * 55 ``` And here's the current date and time, updating constantly: ```js new Date(now) ``` The same thing as an inline string: ${new Date(now)} Any Markdown code block tagged js will be executed as JavaScript in the user’s browser. This is an incredibly powerful abstraction—anything you can do in JavaScript (which these days is effectively anything at all) can now be seamlessly integrated into your document. In the above example the now value is interesting—it’s a special variable that provides the current time in milliseconds since the epoch, updating constantly. Because now updates constantly, the display value of the cell and that inline expression will update constantly as well. If you’ve used Observable Notebooks before this will feel familiar—but notebooks involve code and markdown authored in separate cells. With Framework they are all now part of a single text document. Aside: when I tried the above example I found that the ${new Date(now)} inline expression displayed as Mon Feb 19 2024 20:46:02 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time) while the js block displayed as 2024-02-20T04:46:02.641Z. That’s because inline expressions use the JavaScript default string representation of the object, while the js block uses the Observable display() function which has its own rules for how to display different types of objects, visible in inspect/src/inspect.js. Everything is still reactive # The best feature of Observable Notebooks is their reactivity—the way cells automatically refresh when other cells they depend on change. This is a big difference to Python’s popular Jupyter notebooks, and is the signature feature of marimo, a new Python notebook tool. Observable Framework retains this feature in its new JavaScript Markdown documents. This is particularly useful when working with form inputs. You can drop an input onto a page and refer its value throughout the rest of the document, adding realtime interactivity to documents incredibly easily. Here’s an example. I ported one of my favourite notebooks to Framework, which provides a tool for viewing download statistics for my various Python packages. The Observable Framework version can be found at https://simonw.github.io/observable-framework-experiments/package-downloads—source code here on GitHub. This entire thing is just 57 lines of Markdown. Here’s the code with additional comments (and presented in a slightly different order—the order of code blocks doesn’t matter in Observable thanks to reactivity). # PyPI download stats for Datasette projects Showing downloads for **${packageName}** It starts with a Markdownheading and text that shows the name of the selected package. ```js echo const packageName = view(Inputs.select(packages, { value: \"sqlite-utils\", label: \"Package\" })); ``` This block displays the select widget allowing the user to pick one of the items from the packages array (defined later on). Inputs.select() is a built-in method provided by Framework, described in the Observable Inputs documentation. The view() function is new in Observable Framework—it’s the thing that enables the reactivity, ensuring that updates to the input selection are acted on by other code blocks in the document. Because packageName is defined with const it becomes a variable that is visible to other js blocks on the page. It’s used by this next block: ```js echo const data = d3.json( `https://datasette.io/content/stats.json?_size=max&package=${packageName}&_sort_desc=date&_shape=array` ); Here we are fetching the data that we need for the chart. I’m using d3.json() (all of D3 is available in Framework) to fetch the data from a URL that includes the selected package name. The data is coming from Datasette, using the Datasette JSON API. I have a SQLite table at datasette.io/content/stats that’s updated once a day with the latest PyPI package statistics via a convoluted series of GitHub Actions workflows, described previously. Adding .json to that URL returns the JSON, then I ask for rows for that particular package, sorted descending by date and returning the maximum number of rows (1,000) as a JSON array of objects. Now that we have data as a variable we can manipulate it slightly for use with Observable Plot—parsing the SQLite string dates into JavaScript Date objects: ```js echo const data_with_dates = data.map(function(d) { d.date = d3.timeParse(\"%Y-%m-%d\")(d.date); return d; }) ``` This code is ready to render as a chart. I’m using Observable Plot—also packaged with Framework: ```js echo Plot.plot({ y: { grid: true, label: `${packageName} PyPI downloads per day` }, width: width, marginLeft: 60, marks: [ Plot.line(data_with_dates, { x: \"date\", y: \"downloads\", title: \"downloads\", tip: true }) ] }) ``` So we have one cell that lets the user pick the package they want, a cell that fetches that data, a cell that processes it and a cell that renders it as a chart. There’s one more piece of the puzzle: where does that list of packages come from? I fetch that with another API call to Datasette. Here I’m using a SQL query executed against the /content database directly: ```js echo const packages_sql = \"select package from stats group by package order by max(downloads) desc\" ``` ```js echo const packages = fetch( `https://datasette.io/content.json?sql=${encodeURIComponent( packages_sql )}&_size=max&_shape=arrayfirst` ).then((r) => r.json()); ``` _shape=arrayfirst is a shortcut for getting back a JSON array of the first column of the resulting rows. That’s all there is to it! It’s a pretty tiny amount of code for a full interactive dashboard. Only include the code that you use # You may have noticed that my dashboard example uses several additional libraries—Inputs for the form element, d3 for the data fetching and Plot for the chart rendering. Observable Framework is smart about these. It implements lazy loading in development mode, so code is only loaded the first time you attempt to use it in a cell. When you build and deploy your application, Framework automatically loads just the referenced library code from the jsdelivr CDN. Cache your data at build time # One of the most interesting features of Framework is its Data loader mechanism. Dashboards built using Framework can load data at runtime from anywhere using fetch() requests (or wrappers around them). This is how Observable Notebooks work too, but it leaves the performance of your dashboard at the mercy of whatever backends you are talking to. Dashboards benefit from fast loading times. Framework encourages a pattern where you build the data for the dashboard at deploy time, bundling it together into static files containing just the subset of the data needed for the dashboard. These can be served lightning fast from the same static hosting as the dashboard code itself. The design of the data loaders is beautifully simple and powerful. A data loader is a script that can be written in any programming language. At build time, Framework executes that script and saves whatever is outputs to a file. A data loader can be as simple as the following, saved as quakes.json.sh: curl https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson When the application is built, that filename tells Framework the destination file (quakes.json) and the loader to execute (.sh). This means you can load data from any source using any technology you like, provided it has the ability to output JSON or CSV or some other useful format to standard output. Comparison to Observable Notebooks # Mike introduced Observable Framework as Observable 2.0. It’s worth reviewing how the this system compares to the original Observable Notebook platform. I’ve been a huge fan of Observable Notebooks for years—38 blog posts and counting! The most obvious comparison is to Jupyter Notebooks, where they have some key differences: Observable notebooks use JavaScript, not Python. The notebook editor itself isn’t open source—it’s a hosted product provided on observablehq.com. You can export the notebooks as static files and run them anywhere you like, but the editor itself is a proprietary product. Observable cells are reactive. This is the key difference with Jupyter: any time you change a cell all other cells that depend on that cell are automatically re-evaluated, similar to Excel. The JavaScript syntax they use isn’t quite standard JavaScript—they had to invent a new viewof keyword to support their reactivity model. Editable notebooks are a pretty complex proprietary file format. They don’t play well with tools like Git, to the point that Observable ended up implementing their own custom version control and collaboration systems. Observable Framework reuses many of the ideas (and code) from Observable Notebooks, but with some crucial differences: Notebooks (really documents) are now single text files—Markdown files with embedded JavaScript blocks. It’s all still reactive, but the file format is much simpler and can be edited using any text editor, and checked into Git. It’s all open source. Everything is under an ISC license (OSI approved) and you can run the full editing stack on your own machine. It’s all just standard JavaScript now—no custom syntax. A change in strategy # Reading the tea leaves a bit, this also looks to me like a strategic change of direction for Observable as a company. Their previous focus was on building great collaboration tools for data science and analytics teams, based around the proprietary Observable Notebook editor. With Framework they appear to be leaning more into the developer tools space. On Twitter @observablehq describes itself as “The end-to-end solution for developers who want to build and host dashboards that don’t suck”—the Internet Archive copy from October 3rd 2023 showed “Build data visualizations, dashboards, and data apps that impact your business — faster.” I’m excited to see where this goes. I’ve limited my usage of Observable Notebooks a little in the past purely due to the proprietary nature of their platform and the limitations placed on free accounts (mainly the lack of free private notebooks), while still having enormous respect for the technology and enthusiastically adopting their open source libraries such as Observable Plot. Observable Framework addresses basically all of my reservations. It’s a fantastic new expression of the ideas that made Observable Notebooks so compelling, and I expect to use it for all sorts of interesting projects in the future.

I tried out Observable Framework and built a little interactive plot (https://github.com/willmeyers/observable-ssta). It was incredibly easy to setup and get data plotted. My only gripe is that I wish you could configure Python data loaders to use virtualenvs. reply learned 12 hours agoparentI have a setup with poetry that runs the python data loaders in the poetry-managed virtualenv. I just created a python project and then instead of `yarn run dev` to start the dev server, just run `poetry run yarn run dev` so the python is executed within the virtualenv. This setup also lets you use a custom python package to define reusable and unit-testable code for the dataloaders that you can import into the *.json.py files to keep those really simple. reply eacapeisfutuile 9 hours agorootparentWhy do you need to bundle these, is it to simplify iterating on frontend and data loaders simultaneously? Why not run them separately? reply learned 7 hours agorootparentIt’s totally possible to decouple these if your python outputs plain JSON/csv into the data/ directory that you commit into the repo or generate just before build time. Then you can import that raw json data into an Observable .md file. But if you want dynamically generated data at build time and want to make use of Observable’s dataloader automatic execution of data/*.json.py, for instance, while still maintaining a custom virtualenv for the project rather than your system python, you’ll need some way to specify that virtualenv’s interpreter while observable executes the build for the dev server or the full dist/ output. So for both options it’s largely a matter of taste. I personally like using the poetry virtualenv because it’s simple to manage dependencies and the venvs in one tool, while letting me use observable’s dataloaders with third-party or custom python packages. It sounded like the parent comment wanted to use this type of approach so I focused it to that scenario specifically. I like the simplicity of the single command to generate the data and build the site. reply simonw 13 hours agoparentprevCan you put a shebang line in a .sh data loader that points to the full path to bin/python within the virtual environment directory? reply timmattison 12 hours agorootparentYou can. But then the only time it realizes that the code has been updated is when you update the script or touch it. It’s a minor annoyance but it adds up when making lots of changes. Periodically deleting the cache works too but also annoying. reply tel 9 hours agoprevI recently finished my first \"in anger\" project with an Observable notebook. This involved learning Observable Plot, Arquero, relearning bits of Javascript, and integrating it with a Rust based simulator that's my data generation process. It's honestly been really wonderful. Learning all of those tools has taken some significant energy, and I'm missing some functionality I'd love around parameterizing my data generator, but the final notebook is beautiful and functional. Using markdown and reactivity makes notebooks like this actually feel usable. Jupyter's custom format made version control a giant pain and without reactivity your iteratively designed notebook easily becomes a write-only, stateful mess. I've also tried making this work using Quarto and their Observable integration and it was hacky and piecemeal. Genuinely, this was the first time I've been pleasantly surprised and excited to write a notebook and share it with others. I'm sure there will be more sharp edges, but it's become my first choice notebook tool after this project. reply dleeftink 9 hours agoparentFor those looking for an alternative to Quarto, check out the recently released Living Papers for authoring reactive/static documents from a single source: [0]: https://living-papers.vercel.app/ reply wodenokoto 3 hours agoprevShould I move from jupyter notebooks to Observable?

If you want to show the code you have to hint 'js echo' Am I the only one thinking that it would have been better for backwards compatibility if it where the other way around? I.e: having an opt-in code hint like 'js exec' that runs code in a user's browser and leaving the widely used 'js' hint alone? The way this currently is set up, you cannot integrate that renderer in an existing app without having to manage where it is allowed to run. reply mbostock 4 hours agoparentWe’re planning to allow changing the default options for blocks (either per-page in front matter or across an entire project using the project config); you could then make `js run=false` the default and `js run` to opt-in to live code as you wish.

It's of course the de-facto language for interactive display in browsers. The use case for dashboards and data visualisation is clear. But it's an awful language for data science and data analysis, compared to Python or R. reply simonw 13 hours agoparentOne of the neat new features of Observable Framework is you can drop in a build script to gather the data that's written in any language you like. https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders So you absolutely can do the data processing step in R or Python and have that output JSON or CSV which is then visualized at the end using JavaScript. Not a small feature, but I bet it would be possible to use WebAssembly to add support for Markdown blocks that get executed in other languages as well, using Pyodide for Python for example. reply jarpineh 2 hours agoparentprevIn Observable Framework data work can be done before hand with Python or anything else really. JavaScript enjoys best integration into browser which is hard to deal with from server side. I myself like the self-contained aspect of it, since I can publish static files. Also, D3 is the pioneering library for data viz on the web. Especially with maps, which is what I've used it for back in the day. Time to refresh those skills. I wonder if one could combine this and reactive Python based Jupyter notebook alternative https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm.html Perhaps with web component packaging it should be doable. Web component attributes might allow tying reactive events from one side to the other. reply no_wizard 13 hours agoparentprev>It's of course the de-facto language for interactive display in browsers This is it, more or less. It is far, far easier to build an app like this where you want a plethora of users as a web application than a native one, for instance. For anything JavaScript as a runtime / language is missing, WASM can boost as well.

I’ve been waiting for something like this. My only gripe is that data loaders don’t seem to support Parquet files, which is really annoying. There’s an interesting possibility here where you can have large datasets in Parquet, exposed via HTTP, whilst being generated at build time with all the benefits that gives you (being able to read only specific columns, filtering via row group statistics etc). Not dissimilar to the “SQLite over http” WASM demo I guess. Because right now I need to take my large, nicely compressed dataset and export it as either a CSV or a zip file?

    "originBody": "Paul Butler Posts The hater’s guide to Kubernetes The hater’s guide to Kubernetes Paul Butler – March 3, 2024 Among a certain tech set, Kubernetes has earned a reputation as an unnecessarily complicated time-sink that startups should avoid. Using Kubernetes with a small team is seen as a sign of over-engineering. I’m guilty of taking pithy jabs myself. I might gripe about Kubernetes sometimes, but it really is a great piece of technology. I highly recommend it to all my competitors. — Paul Butler (@paulgb) September 9, 2022 Despite my snark, “great piece of technology” truly is sincere; at the time of that post I had recently written about how much of Kubernetes’ complexity is necessary for what it does. We’ve been running Kubernetes in production for a few years now at Jamsocket, and I’ve found a good flow with it. Kubernetes serenity has been achieved internally. A big key to this has been carving out a small chunk of Kubernetes’ features and pretending the rest don’t exist. This post started as an internal guide to the way we use Kubernetes, so it’s not meant to apply prescriptively to every startup; nonetheless I think it’s a good starting place for avoiding many of the sandbars in the vast seas of Kubernetes. Why use Kubernetes at all? As I see it, Kubernetes is the best-travelled path if you want all three of these things: To run multiple processes/servers/scheduled jobs. To run them redundantly and load balance across them. To configure them, and the relationships between them, as code. At its most basic, Kubernetes is just a layer of abstraction that lets you think about a pool of computers if it were one (headless) computer. If that’s your use case, and you can avoid the other parts of it, you can get pretty far. Some people have told me that #2 is overkill, startups shouldn’t focus on zero-downtime deploys or high availability. But we often do multiple deploys per day, and when our products break, our customer’s products break for their users. Even a minute of downtime is noticed by someone. Rolling deploys give us the confidence to deploy unceremoniously and often. How we use Kubernetes For background, Jamsocket is a service for dynamically spinning up processes that a web app can talk to. Kind of like AWS Lambda, but where the process lifetime is bound to a WebSocket connection instead of a single request/response. We use Kubernetes to run the long-running processes that are needed to support that. The API server, container registry, controller, log collector, some DNS services, metrics collection, etc. A few things we don’t use Kubernetes for: The ephemeral processes themselves. We did for a hot minute very early on, but we quickly found it limiting (more on that later.) Static/marketing sites. We use Vercel for those. It’s more expensive, but so is the opportunity cost of an hour of engineering time at a small startup, and Vercel saves us more of that than it costs. Anything that directly stores data we would be sad to lose. We do use some persistent volumes for caching or derived data, but otherwise we use a managed Postgres DB outside of the cluster and blob storage. It’s also worth noting that we don’t administer Kubernetes ourselves — the main advantage of using Kubernetes is that we can outsource the infrastructure-level operation of it! We have been happy with Google Kubernetes Engine, and while the Google Domains fiasco has shaken my faith in Google Cloud, I at least sleep soundly knowing that migrating to Amazon EKS would be relatively straightforward. Things we readily use There are a few types of k8s resources we use without hesitation. I’m only listing resources here that we create explicitly; most of these resources implicitly create other resources (like Pods) that I will not mention but which we of course (indirectly) use. Deployments: Most of our pods are created through deployments. Every deployment critical to our service functioning has multiple replicas and rolling updates. Services: specifically, ClusterIP for internal services and LoadBalancer for external ones. We have avoided NodePort and ExternalName services, preferring for our DNS configuration to live outside of Kubernetes. CronJobs: for cleanup scripts and that sort of thing. ConfigMaps and Secrets: for passing data to the above resources. Things we cautiously use StatefulSet and PersistentVolumeClaim: we have used some StatefulSets. The configuration is a bit more convoluted than Deployments, but they can have a persistent volume across restarts. We prefer to persist important data in managed services outside of k8s. We don’t have a hard rule against volumes because sometimes it’s nice to persist e.g. a cache across a service restart, but I avoid them when possible because they can interact badly (deadlock) with rolling deploys. RBAC: we have used this in a few places, e.g. to give a service permission to refresh a secret. It adds enough complexity to our small cluster that I mostly avoid it. Things we actively avoid Hand-writing YAML. YAML has enough foot-guns that I avoid it as much as possible. Instead, our Kubernetes resource definitions are created from TypeScript with Pulumi. Non-built-in resources and operators. I’ve written before about how the control loop pattern is a double-edged sword: it’s the core idea that makes K8s robust, but it’s also a source of indirection and complexity. The operator pattern and custom resources allow third-party software to use Kubernetes’ robust infrastructure for its own control loops, which is a great idea in theory that I’ve found to be clunky in practice. Rather than cert-manager, we use Caddy’s certificate automation. Helm. Helm is a no-go because of the operators and no YAML rules, but I also just think that using unstructured string templating to generate something machine-parsable means introducing fragility for no gain. nindent is like nails-on-a-chalkboard to me, I’m sorry. Anything with “mesh” in the name. I guess they’re useful to somebody, but not me, and not this guy either. Ingress resources. I don’t have any battle scars from these, and I know some people use them productively, but a theme of our successful use of Kubernetes is avoiding adding unnecessary layers of indirection. Configuring Caddy works for us, so we just do that. Trying to replicate the entire k8s stack locally. Instead of using things like k3s or kind to replicate production exactly, we just use Docker Compose or our own scripts that start the subset of the system we actually care about in the moment. A human should never wait for a pod Above I alluded to the fact that we briefly ran ephemeral, interactive, session-lived processes on Kubernetes. We quickly realized that Kubernetes is designed for robustness and modularity over container start times. As a general rule, my take is that Kubernetes is good for when you want to redundantly run some long-running processes, but if a human is ever waiting for a pod to start, Kubernetes is the wrong choice. I’ll confess that I’m talking my book here, but at least it’s an open-source book: we use an MIT-licensed Rust orchestrator called Plane that we designed specifically for quickly scheduling and running processes for interactive workloads (i.e. ones with a human waiting on them). Higher-level abstractions For completeness, I should also mention that some of the Kubernetes alternatives that have popped up are quite good. Particularly if you don’t want or need requirement #3 from my initial list (the ability to specify infrastructure as code.) For one of our products, we opted to use Railway rather than our k8s cluster, mainly for the preview environments. Some friends I respect highly swear by Render (I’ve dabbled but personally find Railway’s environment model cleaner.) I’m also partial to Flight Control’s bring-your-own-cloud approach. For a lot of SaaS type apps, you’ll probably get pretty far on those. But if you meet the three needs listed at the beginning of this article and you take a disciplined approach to it, don’t let anybody tell you that you’re too early for Kubernetes.

Once you let in complex generic things, it doesn't stop there. A chain reaction has started, and before you know it, you've got all kinds of components reinforcing each other, that are suddenly required due to some real, or just perceived, problems that are only there in the first place because of a previous step in the chain reaction. I remember back when the Cloud first started getting a foothold that what people was drawn to was that it would enable reducing complexity of managing the most frustrating things like the load-balancer and the database, albeit at a price of course, but it was still worth it. Stateless app servers however, was certainly not a large maintenance problem. But somehow we've managed to squeeze in things like k8s in the there anyway, we just needed to evangelize microservices to create a problem that didn't exist before. Now that this is part of the \"culture\" it's hard to even get beyond hand-wavy rationalizations that microservices is a must, assumingly because it's the initial spark that triggered the whole chain reaction of complexity. reply jupp0r 16 hours agoparentCloud providers automate things like lease renewals, dealing with customs and part time labor contract compliance disputes for that datacenter in that Asian country that you don't know the language of. I'm constantly fascinated how people handwaivingly underestimate the cost and headaches of actually running on prem global infrastructure. reply kortilla 16 hours agorootparentI’m constantly fascinated by people who think they need on prem global infrastructure when the vast majority of applications both have very loose latency requirements (multiple seconds) or no users outside of the home country. Two datacenters on opposite sides of the US from different providers will get you more uptime than a cloud provider and is super simple. reply jupp0r 15 hours agorootparentWhile some of the complexity goes away when it's on prem in to parts of the US, having to order actual hardware, putting it into racks, hiring, training, retaining the people there to debug actual hardware issues when they arise, dealing with HVAC concerns, etc is a lot of complexity that's probably completely outside of your core business expertise but that you'll have to spend mental cycles on when actually operating your own data center. It's totally worth it for some companies to do that, but you need to have some serious size to be concerned with spending your efforts on lowering your AWS bill by introducing details like that into your own organization when you could alternatively spend those dollars to make your core business run better. Usually your efforts are better spent on the latter unless you are Netflix or Amazon or Google. reply protomikron 13 hours agorootparentWhy is it always public cloud (aws, gcp, azure) vs. \"bring your own hardware and deploy it in racks\". There are multiple providers that offer VPS and ingress/egress for a fraction of the cost of public clouds and they mostly have good uptime. reply pclmulqdq 12 hours agorootparentI recently rented a rack with a telecom and put some of my own hardware in it (it's custom weird stuff with hardware accelerators and all the FIPS 140 level 4 requirements), but even the telecom provider was offering a managed VPS product when I got on the phone with them. The uptime in these DCs is very good (certainly better than AWS's us-east-1), and you get a very good price with tons of bandwidth. Most datacenter and colo providers can do this now. I think people believe that \"on prem\" means actually racking the servers in your closet, but you can get datacenter space with fantastic power, cooling, and security almost anywhere these days. reply jupp0r 12 hours agorootparentIt's a spectrum: On top is AWS lambda or something where you are completely removed from the actual hardware that's running your code. At the bottom is a free acre of land where you start construction and talk to utilities to get electricity and water there. You build your own data center, hire people to run and extend it, etc. There is tons of space in between where compromises are made by either paying a provider to do something for you or doing it yourself. Is somebody from the datacenter where you rented a rack or two going in and pressing a reset button after you called them a form of cloud automation? How about you renting a root VM at Hetzner? Is that VM on prem? People who paint these tradeoffs in a black and white matter and don't acknowledge that there are different choices for different companies and scenarios are not doing the discussion a service. On the other hand, somebody who built their business on AppEngine or CloudFlare workes could look at that other company who is renting a pet pool of EC2 instances and ask if they are even in the cloud or if they are just simulating on-prem. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentI think the question people are really interested in is usually \"What percentage over my costs would I pay to outsource X?\" (where X is some component of the complexity stack) Which, first order approximated, is a function of (1) how big a company you are (aka \"Can you even afford to hire two people to just do X?\") and (2) how competitive the market is for X. Colo and dedicated VMs are so reasonably priced because it's a standardized, highly-competive market. Similarly, certain managed cloud services are ridiculously expensive because they have a locked-in customer base. Which would suggest outsourcing components that have maximum vendor competition and standardization, as they're going to be offered at the lowest margin. reply pclmulqdq 8 hours agorootparentprevThere's also a good point here (at least at the top of the stack) about reliability: the top of the spectrum goes down relatively frequently due to its dependencies, but even plain old boring EC2 has much better reliability than services like Lambda. reply Zircom 12 hours agorootparentprev>I think people believe that \"on prem\" means actually racking the servers in your closet, but you can get datacenter space with fantastic power, cooling, and security almost anywhere these days. That's because that is what on prem means. What you're describing is colocating. reply pclmulqdq 12 hours agorootparentWhen clouds define \"on-prem\" in opposition to their services (for sales purposes), colo facilities are lumped into that bucket. They're not exactly wrong, except a rack at a colo is an extension of your premises with a landlord who understands your needs. reply hiatus 8 hours agorootparentprev> it's custom weird stuff with hardware accelerators and all the FIPS 140 level 4 requirements What kind of weird stuff are we talking? reply pclmulqdq 6 hours agorootparentServers for an API for https://arbitrand.com Essentially very high security and throughput TRNG servers (with cryptographic signing and the like). reply cangeroo 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause their arguments are disingenuous.

Because on the surface seems like a ridiculous statement. reply kortilla 3 hours agorootparentDo you know how many businesses software is used for? Look at every local business you go to and enumerate the things they use software to accomplish. When they pay their local utility bills, is that international? How about paying their rent? How about filing their state taxes? How about ordering from local suppliers? Very little of the world is international business. That tiny slice that is just dominates the zeitgeist because it’s international. For some examples of things well known that absolutely don’t need global data centers: - airbus and Boeing - Coca-Cola - Marriott and Hilton - the entire US federal government (apart from some maybe military applications) - McDonald’s The list goes on forever because it’s literally nearly every business. Unless you’re in real time markets or operating store fronts globally where latency hurts sales, putting up regions all over the world is a complete and utter waste of money. Making global regions as easy as a click of a button was one of the greatest marketing ploys of cloud providers to date. “Of course Good Will needs a Singapore data center!? How will we meet our P99 goals otherwise?” reply throwaway11460 2 hours agorootparentMcDonald's absolutely does need global data centers.

There is absolutely zero reason for a kiosk to touch 'a global data center'. No, not even for a payment, because it's just asks the payment terminal if the payment succeeded or not. reply throwaway11460 1 hour agorootparentI absolutely disagree. The restaurant managers really shouldn't need to manage servers too. They get the kiosk as a service that they don't need to care about and that is correct. So McDonald's should be dispatching kiosk admins all around the world? That's very much not eco friendly. And of course, expensive... And a total nightmare to manage. K8s and AWS is a night walk through the rose garden compared to that. > No, not even for a payment, because it's just asks the payment terminal if the payment succeeded or not. Yeah sure, works great as long as the kiosk doesn't crash during the payment. reply noodlesUK 10 hours agorootparentprevI would say that a large portion of b2b or internal software tends to come into this category. If you are building something for a single business that only operates in one jurisdiction, and you don't do i18n, why bother with global distribution?

There are more national companies than international companies, by a large factor. reply DinaCoder99 6 hours agorootparentAre the majority of applications even developed by \"companies\"? I'm honestly not sure at all, or even how to go about measuring that. By the numbers, most games on steam are developed by individuals or small teams, even if the bulk of sales are driven by games produced by larger companies. I'd imagine the same is true of app stores, too. reply alphager 10 hours agorootparentprevMost software is internal software used by a handful of people in a certain department of a company. Even in large multinational conglomerates the applications used by every single country subsidiary can be counted using your fingers. reply jupp0r 15 hours agorootparentprevThere are tons of examples where low latency is good for business, even small businesses. I'm sure you've seen the studies from Amazon that every 100ms of page load latency is costing them 1% of revenue, etc. Also everything communication is very latency sensitive. Of course there are plenty of scenarios where latency does not matter at all. reply groestl 13 hours agorootparentSo you can trade off 300ms of additional roundtrip time (on anything non-CDNable) at a cost of 3% revenue and reduce your infrastructure complexity a lot reply kortilla 3 hours agorootparentprevYour mind is stuck in low cost retail shopping. Even setting aside the likely self-serving nature of that “study”, most interactions are not latency sensitive like that. When I go to book my colonoscopy on my hospital’s reservation system, I don’t bail out and look for a new doctor if it takes me 10 tries. There are very few businesses where UX latency at the sub second level matters and the ones that do are not the ones you want to be in. reply throwaway22032 13 hours agorootparentprevNot every business is based on impulse buys. Amazon is a pretty biased sample there. reply threeseed 12 hours agorootparentThat latency is correlated with revenue is not exclusive to Amazon. And many people who aren’t impulse buying will not stick around on slow sites. reply pdimitar 12 hours agorootparentDisagreed, once we're not talking a worldwide shop for non-critical buys like Amazon the picture changes dramatically. Many people on local markets have no choice and will stick around no matter how slow the service is. Evidence: my wife buying our groceries for delivery at home. We have 4-5 choices in our city. All their websites are slow as hell, and I mean adding an item to a cart takes good 5-10 seconds. Search takes 20+ seconds. She curses at them every time yet there's nothing we can do. The alternative is both of us to travel by foot 20 minutes to the local mall and wait on queues. 2-3 times a week. She figured the slow websites are the lesser evil. reply jupp0r 12 hours agorootparentprevIs this agreeing with \"Of course there are plenty of scenarios where latency does not matter at all.\" or are you trying to make a point? reply hipadev23 16 hours agorootparentprevAnd colo providers solved those hurdles for decades.

I even wrote that it's worth running the LB/DB in the Cloud? reply jupp0r 15 hours agorootparentOh it was more of an addition to your point about \"reducing complexity of managing the most frustrating things like the load-balancer and the database, albeit at a price of course\". There is a whole mountain of complexity that most software engineers never think about when they dream about going back to the good old on prem days. reply elktown 14 hours agorootparentAlright, just feels like taking a bit too far into the exceptions. Even back then only large companies would consider that. Renting servers, renting a server rack (co-location), or even just a in-office server rack for what would be a startup today. reply the_duke 16 hours agoprevI know it's fashionable to hate on Kubernetes these days, and it is overly complex and has plenty problems. But what other solution allows you to: * declarative define your infrastructure * gives you load balancing, automatic recovery and scaling * provides great observability into your whole stack (kubectl, k9s, ...) * has a huge amount of pre-packaged software available (helm charts) * and most importantly: allows you to stand up mostly the same infrastructure in the cloud, on your own servers (k3s), and locally (KIND), and thus doesn't tie you into a specific cloud provider The answer is: there isn't any. Kubernetes could have been much simpler, and probably was intentionally built to not be easy to use end to end. But it's still by far the best we've got. reply p-o 16 hours agoparentI like to think that most people who are upset at Kubernetes don't hate on all of it. I think the configuration aspect (YAML) and the very high level of abstraction is what get people lost and as a result they get frustrated by it. I've certainly fall in that category while trying to learn how to operate multiple clusters using different topologies and cloud providers. But from an operational standpoint, when things are working, it usually behaves very well until you hit some rough edge cases (upgrades were much harder to achieve a couple of years back). But rough edges exist everywhere, and when I get to a point where K8s hits a problem, I would think that it would be much worse if I wasn't using it. reply koolba 16 hours agorootparent> I like to think that most people who are upset at Kubernetes don't hate on all of it.

Damn straight. It’s only bad because everything else is strictly worse. reply dfee 12 hours agorootparentHelm isn’t YAML. It’s a go template file that should compile to YAML, masquerading as YAML with that extension.

At the same time, people who suggest everyone to use kubernetes independently on the company maturity often forget how easy it is to run a service on a simple virtual machine. In the multidimensional space that contains every software project, there is no hyperplane that separates when it’s worth to use kubernetes or not. It depends on the company, the employees, the culture, the business. Of course there are general best practices, like for example if you’re just getting started with kubernetes, and already in the cloud, using a managed k8s service from your cloud provider could be a good idea. But again, even for this you’re going to find opposing views online. reply osigurdson 16 hours agoparentprevNaw, just use system-d, ha-proxy and bash scripts. That is much \"simpler\" (for some definition of simple). Kidding of course. If you need anything approximating Kubernetes, use it. If you just need one machine maybe don't. reply yjftsjthsd-h 16 hours agoparentprevThe thing is, \"kubernetes\" doesn't give you that either. You want a LB? Here's a list of them that you can add to a cluster. But actually pick multiple, because the one you picked in AWS doesn't support bare metal. reply davkan 16 hours agorootparentBare metal kubernetes is certainly a lot less complete out of the box when it comes to networking and storage but, people can, and often should, use a managed k8s service which provides all those things out of the box.

E.g. even if I have to spin up my own nginx-ingress to be able to handle ingress resources, after having learned that initially, I can basically do the same thing across clouds. It's just that GKE (Autopilot) does a lot of those out of the box for you that, so you get a much easier end-to-end experience for non-admins (= \"request resources -> have them instantiated\"). reply g9yuayon 14 hours agoparentprevWhen I reflect what Netflix did back in 2010ish on AWS: * The declarative infra is EC2/ASG configurations plus Jenkins configurations * Client-side load balancing * ASG for autoscaling and recovery * Amazing observability with a home-grown monitoring system by 4 amazing engineers Most of all, each of the above item was built and run by one or two people, except the observability stack with four. Oh, standing up a new region was truly a non-event. It just happened and as a member of the cloud platform team I couldn't even recall what I did for the project. It's not that Netflix's infra was better or worse than using k8s. I'm just amazed how happy I have been with an infra built more than 10 years ago, and how simple it was for end users.

I have no clue about kubernetes, but I think NixOS even goes much deeper in these points (e.g. kubernetes is at the \"application layer\" and doesn't concern itself with declaratively managing the OS underneath, if I understand right). The other points seem much more situational, and if needed kubernetes might well be worth it. For something that could be a single server running a handful of services, NixOS is amazing. reply the_duke 15 hours agorootparentI use NixOS, both on servers and on my machines, but it solves a completely orthogonal problem. Kubernetes manages a cluster, NixOS manages a single machine. reply matrss 15 hours agorootparentI wouldn't say completely orthogonal. E.g. the points I've cited are overlap between the two, and ultimately both are meant to host some kind of services. But yes NixOS by itself manages a single machine (although combined with terraform it can become very convenient to also manage a fleet of NixOS machines). Kubernetes manages services on a cluster, but given how powerful a single machine can be I do think that many of those clusters could also just be one beefy server (and maybe a second one with some fail over mechanism, if needed). If the cluster is indeed necessary though, I think NixOS can be a great base to stand up a Kubernetes cluster on top of. reply pxc 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are lots of native NixOS tools for managing whole clusters (NixOps, Disnix, Colmena, deploy-rs, Morph, krops, Bento, ...). Lots of people deploy whole fleets of NixOS servers or clusters for specific applications without resorting to Kubernetes. (Kube integrations are also popular, though.) Some of those solutions are very old, too.

Kubernetes is a commoditizing force to some extent. reply Too 16 hours agorootparentprevFar from it. TF is mostly writing static content, maybe read one or two things. It’s missing the runtime aspect of it, so are most cloud offerings, without excessive configuration. Rollouts, health probes, logs, service discovery. Just to name a few. reply theossuary 16 hours agorootparentprevYou missed what I think is the most important point in OP's list: it does all of the above in a cloud agnostic way. If I want to move clouds with TF I'm rewriting everything to fit into a new cloud's paradigm. With Kubernetes there's a dozen providers built in (storage, loadbalancing, networking, auto scaling, etc.) or easy to pull in (certificates, KMS secrets, DNS); and they make moving clouds (and more importantly) running locally much easier. Kubernetes is currently the best way to wrap up workloads in a cloud agnostic way. I've written dozens of services for K8s using different deployment mechanisms (Helm, Carvel's kapp, Flux, Kustomize) and I can run them just as easily in my home K8s cluster and in GCP. It's honestly incredible; I don't know of any other cloud tech that lets me do that. One thing I think a lot of people miss too, is how good the concepts around Operators in Kubernetes are. It's hard to see unless you've written some yourself, but the theory around how operators work is very reminiscent of reactive coding in front end frameworks (or robotics closed loop control, what they were originally inspired by). When written well they're extremely resilient and incredibly powerful, and a lot of that power comes from etcd and the established patterns they're written with. I think Kubernetes is really painful sometimes, and huge parts of it aren't great due to limitations of the language it's written in; but I also think it's the best thing available that I can run locally and in a cloud with a FOSS license. reply dijit 16 hours agorootparent> it does all of the above in a cloud agnostic way. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here and say that some of the basics are indeed cloud agnostic. However, it's plain for many or most to see that outside of extremely \"toy\" workloads you will be learning a specific \"flavour\" of Kubernetes. EKS/GKE/AKS etc; They have, at minimum, custom resource definitions to handle a lot of things and at their worst have implementation specific (hidden) details between equivalent things (persistent volume claims on AWS vs GCP for example is quite substantially different). reply theossuary 16 hours agorootparentFor multicloud I usually think of my local K8s cluster and GKE, it's been a few years since I touched EKS. I'd love to hear your opinions on the substantive differences you run into. When switching between clouds I'm usually able to get away with only changing annotations on resources, which is easy enough to put in a values.yml file. I can't remember the last time I had to use a cloud specific CRD. What CRD's do you have to reach for commonly? Thinking about it; the things I see as very cloud agnostic: Horizontal pod autoscaling, Node autoscaling, Layer 4 loadbalancing, Persistent volumes, Volume snapshots, Certificate managment, External DNS, External secrets, Ingress (when run in cluster, not through a cloud service), That ends up covering a huge swath of my usecases, probably 80-90%. The main pain points I usually run into are: IAM, Trying to use cloud layer 7 ingress (app loadbalancers?) I totally agree the underlying implementation if resources can be very different, but that's not the fault of Kubernetes; it's an issue with the implementation from the operator of the K8s cluster. All abstractions are going to be leaky at this level. But for PVCs I feel like storageclasses capture that well, and can be used to pick the level of performance you need per cloud; without having to rewrite the common provision of block device. reply elktown 14 hours agorootparentprevSomething feels very off and mantra-like with the proportionality of how often cloud migration benefits are being presented as something very important to how often that actually happens in practice. Not to even mention that it also assumes that simpler setups are automatically harder to move around between clouds, or at least that there are a significant difference in required effort. reply theossuary 13 hours agorootparentWhen I say it's easy to move between clouds, I'm not referring to an org needing to pick up everything and move from AWS to GCP. That is rare, and takes quite a bit of rearchitecting no matter what. When I say something is easy to move, I mean that when I build on top of it, it's easy for users to run it in their cloud of choice with changes in config. It also means I have flexibility with where I choose to run something after I've developed it. For example I develop most stuff against minikube, then deploy it to GCP or a local production k8s. If I was using Terraform I couldn't do that. reply elktown 9 hours agorootparentNot sure what kind of apps this is but I can't see the big value-add on a golang app binary wrt to being cloud agnostic, nor wrt local development.

If there have been unhappy engineers along the way - they’ve by the vast majority stayed quiet and lied about being happier on surveys. Yes, k8s is complex. The tool matches the problem: complex. But having a standard is so much better than having a somewhat simpler undocumented chaos. “Kubectl explain X” is a thousand times better than even AWS documentation, which in turn was a game changer compared to that-one-whiteboard-above-Dave’s-desk. Standards are tricky, but worth the effort. Personally I’m also very judicious with operators and CRDs - both can be somewhat hidden to beginners. However, the operator pattern is wonderful. Another amazing feature is ultra simple leader election - genuinely difficult outside of k8s, a 5 minute task inside. I agree with Paul’s take here tho of at least being extremely careful about which operators you introduce. At any rate, yes k8s is more complex than your bash deploy script, of course it is.

Velocity is the name of the game! reply pclmulqdq 12 hours agoparentI have to say that I don't believe the problem is all that complex unless you make it hard. But on the flip side, if you're a competent Kubernetes person, the correct Kubernetes config is also not that complex. I think a lot of the reaction here is a result of the age-old issues of \"management is pushing software on me that I don't want\" and people adopting it without knowing how to use it because it's considered a \"best practice.\" In other words, the reaction you probably have to an Oracle database is the same reaction that others have to Kubernetes (although Oracle databases are objectively crappy). reply paulgb 13 hours agoparentprevGood point about k8s vs. AWS docs — a lot of the time people say “just use ECS” or the AWS service of the day, and it will invariably be more confusing to me and more vendor-tied than just doing the thing in k8s. reply p_l 12 hours agorootparentAnd then if you're unlucky you might hit one of the areas where the AWS documentation has a \"teaser\" about some functionality that is critical for your project, you spend months looking for the rest of the documentation when initial foray doesn't work, and the highly paid AWS-internal consultants disappear into thin air when asked about the features.

The Ansible method works remarkably well for it's age, but the big thing I use to convince teams to move to Kubernetes is that we can take your peak deploy times from, say, a couple hours down to a few minutes, and you can autoscale far faster and more efficiently than you can with CPU-based scaling on an ASG. From service teams that have done the migrations, the things I hear consistently though are: - when a Helm deploy fails, finding the reason why is a PITA (we run with --atomic so it'll rollback on a failed deploy. What failed? Was it bad code causing a pod to crash loop? Failed k8s resource create? who knows! have fun finding out!) - they have to learn a whole new way of operating, particularly around in-the-moment scaling. A team today can go into the AWS Console at 4am during an incident and change the ASG scaling targets, but to do that with a service running in Kubernetes means making sure they have kubectl (and it's deps, for us that's aws-cli) installed and configured, AND remembering the `kubectl scale deployment X --replicas X` syntax. [Both of those things are very much fixable] reply jonathaneunice 16 hours agoparentThe problem with bespoke, homegrown, and DIY isn't that the solutions are bad. Often, they are quite good—excellent, even, within their particular contexts and constraints. And because they're tailored and limited to your context, they can even be quite a bit simpler. The problem is that they're custom and homegrown. Your organization alone invests in them, trains new staff in them, is responsible for debugging and fixing when they break, has to re-invest when they no longer do all the things you want. DIY frameworks ultimately end up as byzantine and labyrinthine as Kubernetes itself. The virtue of industry platforms like Kubernetes is, however complex and only half-baked they start, over time the entire industry trains on them, invests in them, refines and improves them. They benefit from a long-term economic virtuous cycle that DIY rarely if ever can.

I think for the vast majority of usecases where all you need is some simple templating/substitution, it just introduces way more complexity and abstraction than it is worth. I've been really happy with just using `envsubst` and environment variables to generate a manifest at deploy time. It's easy with most CI systems to \"archive\" the manifest, and it can then be easily read by a human or downloaded/applied manually for debugging with. Deploys are also just `cat k8s/${ENV}/deploy.yamlenvsubt > output.yaml && kubectl apply -f output.yaml` I've also experimented with using terraform.

Kustomize takes a little getting used to, but it's a nice abstraction and widely used. I cannot recommend terraform. I use it daily, and daily I wish I did not. I think Pulumi is the future. Not as battle tested, but terraform is a mountain of bugs anyway, so it can't possibly be worse.

If you're going to pay the complexity costs you might as well get the wins which is essentially a huge 'app-store' of popular infrastructure components and an entirely programmatic way to manage your operations (deployments, updates, fail-overs, backups, etc). For example if you want to setup something complex like Ceph - Rook is a really nice way to do that. It's a very leaky abstraction so you aren't hiding all the complexity of Ceph but the declarative interface is generally a much nicer way to manage Ceph than a boatload of ansible scripts or generally what we had before. The key to understand is that helm or operators don't magically make infrastructure a managed 'turn-key' appliances, you do generally need to understand how the thing works. reply fifilura 17 hours agoprevThere is nothing wrong with k8s it is a nice piece of technology.

There are a lot of reverse proxies that will do this. Traditionally this was the job of a load balancer. With that being done by \"software\" you get the fun job of setting it up! The hard part is doing it the first time, and having a sane strategy. What you want to do is identify and segment a portion of your traffic. Mostly this means injecting a cooking into the segmented traffics HTTP(S) requests. If you dont have a group of users consistently on the new service you get some odd behavior. The deployment part is easy. Cause your running things concurrently then ports matter. Just have the alternate version deployed on a different port. This is not a big deal and is supper easy to do. In fact your deployments are probably set up to swap ports anyway. So all your doing is not committing to a final step in that process. But... what if it is a service to service call inside your network. That too should be easy. Your passing id's around between calls for tracing right? Rather than \"random cookie\" you're just going to route based on these. Again easy to do in a reverse proxy, easier in a load balancer. It's not like easy blue green deploys are some magic of kuberneties. We have been doing them for a long time.

I keep it simple and Kubernetes works great. What's wonderful is that when I work on multiple clouds, my knowledge transfers just fine. I don't think of the AWS solution or the GCS solution, I use the same kubectl to check out both, view logs, inspect and fix. Even when I got tired of waiting for GKE to spin up a node, running Github actions on a self-hosted microk8s meant instant pod starts and very little fuss. But using Kubernetes meant I got to take advantage of the Github operator, which let me reuse the same machine for multiple builds without the headaches. When I want to run some open source, I often find a helm chart the helps me get set up. Nowadays running open source packages can involve all kinds of dependencies, but getting it running on a k8s cluster to check it out, or even in prod, is a relatively straight forward editing of some values files. I've recently ran Uptrace and Superset that way. They're not a bajillion requests per second setups, they don't have to be, and it was far easier to set up than most methods.

Also, in my experience, you either have to spend ridiculous amounts of money on SaaS/PaaS, or you find that you have to host a lot more than just your application and suddenly the deployment story becomes more complex.

This means that companies choose k8s (or related technologies like k3s, Microk8s, etc.) not because they strictly _need_ k8s, but because it improves their workflows. Otherwise they would need to invest a disproportionate amount of time and effort adopting and maintaining alternative tooling, while getting an inferior experience.

It’s not universally bad or universally good, and I don’t feel that there is a minimum team size required for it to make sense. Managing k8s, for me at least, is a lot easier than juggling multiple servers with potentially different hardware, software, or whatever else. It’s rare that businesses will have machines that are all identical. Trying to keep adding machines to a pool that you manage manually and keep them running can be very messy and get out of control if you’re not on top of it. k8s can also get out of control though it’s also easier to reason about and understand in this context. Eg you have eight machines of varying specs but all they really have installed is what’s required to run k8s, so you haven’t got as much divergence there. You can then use k8s to schedule work across them or ask questions about the machines. reply liveoneggs 16 hours agoprevWe've found kubernetes to be surprisingly fragile, buggy, inflexible, and strictly imperative.

The first one was the MongoDB/NoSQL hype - \"Let's use NoSQL for everything!\" trend. I tried it in a medium sized project and burnt my finger and it was right around when HN was flooded with full of \"Why we migrated to MongoDB\" stories. The next one was Microservices. Everyone was doing something with microservices and I was just on a good 'ole Ruby on Rails monolith. Again, the HN stories came and went \"Why we broke down our simple CRUD app into 534 microservices\". The final one was Kubernetes. I was a Cloud consultant in my past life and had to work with a lot of my peers who had the freedom to deploy In any architecture they saw fit. A bunch of them were on Kubernetes and I was just on a standard Compute VM for my clients. We had a requirement from our management that all of us had to take some certification courses so they would be easily to pitch to clients. So, I prepped for one and read about Kubernetes and tried deploying a bunch of applications only to realize it was a very complex piece of moving parts - unnecessarily I may add. I was never able to understand why this was pushed on as normal. It made my decision to not use it only stronger. Over the course of the 5 year journey, my peers' apps would randomly fail and they would be sometimes pulled over the weekends to push fixes to avert the P1 situation whilst I would be casually chilling in a bar with my friends. My compute engine VM, till date, to its credit has only had one P1 situation yet. And that was because the client forgot to renew their domain name. Out of all the 3 hype cycles that I avoided in my career, the Kubernetes is the one I really am thankful of evading the most. This sort of complexity should not be normalised.

When we were talking with their two person devops team about our architecture, I explained that we deployed some of our services on ECS. \"Have you ever used it?\" I asked them. \"No, thank goodness\" one of them said jokingly. By this time it was clear that Kubernetes had won and AWS was planning its managed Kubernetes offering. I assumed that after I became familiar with Kubernetes I'd feel the same way. After a few months though it became clear that all these guys did was babysit their Kubernetes cluster. Upgrading it was a routine chore and every crisis they faced was related to some problem with the cluster. Meanwhile our ECS deploys continued to be relatively hassle free. We didn't even have a devops team. I grew to understand that managing Kubernetes was fun for them, despite the fact that it was overkill for their situation. They had architected for scale that didn't exist.

The biggest value add that k8s has is that it gives you as many or as few autoscaling groups as you need at a given time using only a single pool (or at least fewer pools) of heterogeneous servers. There's lots of fine print here but it really does let you run the same workloads on less hardware and to me that's the first and last reason you should be using it.

Sure, everyone has their own product and experience and it's fine to express it, but I don't get the usage of other decisions such as \"no to services meshes\", \"no to helm\" and many more. You don't want to ideally reinvent the wheel for every workload you need (say you need a OIDC endpoint, an existing application): you are tempted to write everything from scratch by yourself, which is also fine, but the point is: why? Many products deliver their own Helm package. And if you are sick of writing YAML, I would look for Terraform over Pulumi, for the reason that you use the same tool for bringing up Infrastructure and then workloads.

Not always. Some applications are genuinely complex and need to be! But often, this has been the case for me. For all my stuff, though, I use kustomize and I'm pretty happy with it; it's too stupid for me to be clever, and this is good.

If there were an alternative to Kubernetes that were just 10% less confusing, complicated, opaque, monolithic, clunky, etc, we would all be using it. But because Kubernetes exists, and everyone is using it, there's no point in trying to make an alternative. It would take years to reach feature parity, and until you do, you can't really switch away. It's like you're driving an 18-wheeler, and you think it kinda sucks, but you can't just buy and then drive a completely different 18 wheeler for only a couple of your deliveries. You probably will end up using K8s at some point in the next 20 years. There's not really an alternative that makes sense.

First example being operators, this is the underlying mechanism that makes k8s possible. To me taking a stance not to use operators but use k8s is less than optimal, or plainly stupid. The whole stack is built on operators, which you inherently trust as you use k8s, but choosing not to use them. Sorry but this is hard to read.

The rest is hard to read ;(. reply api 17 hours agoprevI understand where most of the complexity in K8S comes from, but it still horrifies and offends me and I hate it. But I don't think it's Kubernetes' fault directly. I think the problem is deeper in the foundation. It comes from the fact that we are trying to build modern, distributed, high availability, incrementally upgradeable, self-regulating systems on a foundation of brittle clunky 1970s operating systems that are not designed for any of that. The whole thing is a bolt-on that has to spend a ton of time working around the limitations of the foundation, and it shows. Unfortunately there seems to be zero interest in fixing that and so much sunk cost in existing Unix/Posix designs that it seems like we are completely stuck with a basic foundation of outdated brittleness. What I think we need: * An OS that runs hardware-independent code (WASM?) natively and permits things like hot updates, state saving and restoration, etc. Abstract away the hardware. * Native built-in support for clustering, hot backups, live process migration between nodes, and generally treating hardware as a pure commodity in a RAIN (redundant array of inexpensive nodes) configuration. * A modern I/O API. Posix I/O APIs are awful. They could be supported for backward compatibility via a compatibility library. * Native built-in support for distributed clustered storage with high availability. Basically a low or zero config equivalent of Ceph or similar built into the OS as a first class citizen. * Immutable OS that installs almost instantly on hardware, can be provisioned entirely with code, and where apps/services can be added and removed with no \"OS rot.\" The concept of installing software \"on\" the OS needs to be killed with fire. * Shared distributed network stack where multiple machines can have the same virtual network interfaces, IPs, and open TCP connections can migrate. Built-in load balancing. I'm sure people around here can think of more ideas that belong in this list. These are not fringe things that are impossible to build. Basically you should have an immutable image OS that turns many boxes into one box and you don't have to think about it. Storage is automatically clustered. Processes automatically restart or, if a hardware fault is detected in time, automatically migrate. There were efforts to build such things (Mosix, Plan 9, etc.) but they were bulldozed by the viral spread of free Unix-like OSes that were \"good enough.\" Edit: That being said, I'm not saying Kubernetes is good software either. The core engine is actually decent and as the OP said has a lot of complexity that's needed to support what it does. The ugly nasty disgusting parts are the config interface, clunky shit like YAML, and how generally arcane and unapproachable and ugly the thing is to actually use. I just loathe software like this. I feel the same way about Postgres and Systemd. \"Algorithmically\" they are fine, but the interface and the way you use them is arcane and makes me feel like I'm using a 70s mainframe on a green VT220 monitor. Either these things are designed by the sorts of \"hackers\" who like complexity and arcane-ness, or they're hacks that went viral and matured into global infrastructure without planning. I think it's a mix of both... though in the case of Postgres it's also that the project is legitimately old. It feels like old-school Unix clunkware because it is. reply _factor 1 hour agoparentI’ll add to this: Boot and compute need to be entirely disconnected from one another. If I have a block of storage that boots on one system, it should boot on another. An OS should poll for available services, allow them to define APIs and be utilized, but no bloat should be added to a base to support elective services. Everything should be microkernel too, but now I’m just venting. reply happymellon 17 hours agoparentprevI'm not entirely convinced that there isn't a better way. With AWS Lambda and alternatives able to run containers on demand, and OpenFaas, they all point to \"a better way\". [Edit] Parent comment is almost entirety completely different after that edit to what I responded to. But I think my point still stands. One day, hopefully in my lifetime, we shall see it. reply api 16 hours agorootparentYeah I do think lambda-style coding where you move away from the idea of processes toward functions and data are another possibly superior way. The problem is that right now this gets you lock-in to a proprietary cloud. There are some loose standards but the devil's in the details and once you are deployed somewhere it's damn hard to impossible to move without serious downtime and fixing. reply happymellon 14 hours agorootparentCompletely agree, but that's where OpenFaas (or another open standard) comes in. Hopefully we should get OpenFaas and Lambda, in the same way we have ECS and EKS. Standardised ways to complete tasks, rather than managing imaginary servers. We are still early in the cycle. reply Too 15 hours agorootparentprevHow about Erlang? I can’t say I know it myself. It always looks good on paper. Strangely nobody uses it. There must be a catch that detracts from it? reply Izkata 12 hours agorootparentI don't know it either, but a vague understanding I got in the past was the language itself wasn't very user-friendly. I think Elixir was supposed to solve that. reply api 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople want to program in their preferred language, not be forced to use one language to have these benefits. reply kiitos 12 hours agoparentprev> These are not fringe things that are impossible to build. Maybe not, but I'm confident that the system you're describing is impossible to build in a way that is both general and efficient. reply throwaway892238 17 hours agoparentprevAgreed. If Linux were a distributed OS, people would just be running a distro with systemd instead of K8s. (Of course, systemd is just another kubernetes, but without the emphasis on running distributed systems) reply p_l 17 hours agorootparentCoreOS tried to distribute systemd and seemed it wasn't working all that well compared to trying to optimize for k8s reply geodel 16 hours agorootparentMaybe they folded before their ideas could take root and backed by decent implementation. reply throwaway892238 13 hours agorootparentprevThat whole concept is bizarre. It's like wanting to fly, so rather than buy a plane, you take a Caprice Classic and try to make it fly. If CoreOS actually wanted to make distributed computing easier, they'd make patches for the Linux kernel (or make an entirely different kernel). See the many distributed OS kernels that were made over 20 years ago. But that's a lot of work. So instead they tried to go the cheap and easy route. But the cheap and easy route ends up being much shittier. There's no commercial advantage to building a distributed OS, which is why no distributed OS is successful today. You would need a crazy person to work for 10 years on a pet project until it's feature-complete, and then all of a sudden everyone would want to use it. But until it's complete, nobody would use it, and nobody would spend time developing it. Even once it's created, if it's not popular, still nobody will use it (you can use Plan9 today, but nobody does). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_operating_system reply tayo42 17 hours agoparentprevWhat would you fix if you could? reply hobofan 17 hours agoprevOT: Can something be done about HN commenting culture so that the comments stay more on topic? Some technologies (like Kubernetes) tend to attract discussions where half of the commenters completely ignore the original article, so we end up having a weekly thread about Kubernetes where the points of the article (which are interesting) are not able to be discussed because they are drowned out by the same unstructured OT discussions? At the time of this posting there are ~20 comments with ~2 actually having anything to do with the points of the article rather than Kubernetes in general. reply geodel 17 hours agoparentHuh, this article has hardly anything deep, technical, thought provoking or unique compared to ten thousand other Kubernetes articles. I am rather happy that people are having general purpose discussion about K8s. reply freedomben 16 hours agoparentprevWhat you're seeing is the early-crowd. With most (not all) posts, comments will eventually rise to the top that are more what you're looking for. IME it usually takes a couple hours. If it's a post where I really want to read the relevant comments, I'll usually come back at least 8 to 12 hours later and there's usually some good ones to choose from. Even topics like Apple that attract the extreme lovers and haters tend to trend this direction reply cogman10 17 hours agoparentprevHaving read the article, isn't the point of the article kubernetes in general and what the author prescribes you sign up for/avoid? Discussions of k8s pitfalls and successes in general seems to be very much in line with what the article is advocating. And, to that point, there's frankly just not a whole lot interesting in this article for discussion \"We avoid yaml and operators\"... Neat. reply hobofan 16 hours agorootparent> Having read the article, isn't the point of the article kubernetes in general and what the author prescribes you sign up for/avoid? Yeah, and I think that provides a good basis to discussion, where people can critique/discuss whether the evaluation that the author has made are correct (which a few comments are doing). At the same time a lot of that discussion is being displaced by what I would roughly characterize as \"general technology flaming\" which isn't going anywhere productive. reply pvg 13 hours agoparentprevThe solution to that is to flag boring/generic articles and/or post/upvote more specific, interesting articles. Generic articles produce generic, mostly repetitive comments but then again that's what the material the commenters are given. reply More GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

If you’re not sure what to pick, try doing a poll of your friends to see what they’re interested in. You can also choose a theme for your marathon, such as all comedies, all horror movies, or all movies from a particular decade.2. Set a scheduleOnce you’ve chosen your movies, it’s a good idea to set a schedule for the night.

It might sound a little bit postmodern, but I think that there are only few somewhat universally accepted opinions on things thhat are \"responsible\" vs \"not responsible\". Just watch basically any debate on a topic where both sides have strong opinions on it, and analyze which cultural or moral traits each side has that lead it to its opinion. Does my answer offer a \"solution\" for this problem? I don't think so.

Similarly, I have a production service up somewhere that works with cooking recipes.

I added “you follow rules” in the system prompt, and it worked great… kinda. I later discovered that it would refuse to provide any information related to using blood in cooking (blood sausage, etc.), objecting that such content disobeyed some cultural “rules” about cooking (the Jews and their Torah, the most ancient rule book of all).

I don't think that's the case, in that, Google of all companies should have enough from Bard to improve Gemini. The only thing I can think of left is that it genuinely was a horrible idea for Sundar to coming swinging in, in a rush, in December/Jan, to kneecap Brain (who owned the real grunt work of LLM work) and crown the always-distant always-academic DeepMind. Like in retrospect, it seems obviously stupid. The first thing you do to prepare for this exisential calvary battle is swap out the people with experience riding horses day to day. And that would also explain why we're still seeing the same generally bad performance so much later, we're looking at people getting their first opportunity to train at scale for chat, and maybe Bard and Gemini were completely separate groups, so Gemini didn't have the ability to really leverage Bard feedback. (classic Google, one thing is deprecated, the other isn't ready yet) It really makes me wonder about some of the #s they'd publish in papers and how cherry-picked they were, it was nigh-impossible to replicate the results even with a boatload of curiosity and gumption to try anything - I mean, I didn't systematically try to do a full eval, but...it never, ever, ever, worked even close to consistently the way the papers would make you think it did.

They don't actually understand anything, they chain words together. C and C++ are often used next to words like 'unsafe' and 'dangerous'.

These chains are not random - they are formed by training. And whoever trained it was so obsessed with \"safety\" and not letting anything \"unsafe\" to leak through - probably at explicit command of their higher ups - that they trained the model to have this bias. It's not only their blame - in current American culture, it's always better to be insane safety-obsessed coward, than take any kind of risk of offending anyone. The former gets you a mild derision, maybe, the latter gets you people that would hound you till the end of time, forever, and would think that destroying you is their sacred duty. A lot of such people, that have much more free time and energy to obsess about destroying you than you do. And this behavior is considered normal and socially accepted.

It just hasn't always been this visibly bad. reply kmeisthax 13 hours agoparentprevThey used an LLM, that's how. On the surface level, Google tends to release stuff right away to get feedback, which means you get to see all the bullshit right away. OpenAI carefully manages access to their models, which increases hype, even if that isn't what they intended. Going deeper, a lot of Google's core[0] search business relies on having a healthy information ecosystem. Their search algorithms - e.g. PageRank, TrustRank, etc - use scarcity as a proxy for signals of quality. That's been chipped away at by linkspam and blogspam schemes. Furthermore, social media and even Google's own Knowledge Graph feature have created incentives to pull information out of Google. This decay has happened over decades, and Google fights back against it over time, but it keeps being a problem for them. Now, if I wanted a weapon to Fucking Kill Google[1] with, an LLM would be my go-to. While there are ways to defeat Google's antispam measures, they all leave pretty obvious statistical evidence that can be detected and compensated for. LLMs generate garbage text that is nearly indistinguishable from humans, at extremely low cost, which can be used to Sybil-attack the Google search algorithm basically forever. Ok, but what does that matter for the quality of Google's LLM? Well, the quality of that garbage text depends greatly on both the quality and quantity of the training data fed into it. OpenAI specifically stopped crawling the public Internet for text around the release of GPT-3 for fear of feeding new models the output of prior models. In other words, they have a huge cache of freely obtained \"low-background metal[2]\" that Google is having to scrounge around for. Furthermore, we have to keep in mind that none of these models are pure representations of the training set. If they were, they wouldn't answer questions or follow directions very well. There's a second, parallel training set that OpenAI had to build to turn GPT-3 into ChatGPT, which isn't crawled and harvested text from the Internet, but instead a list of dos and don'ts that are fine-tuned on after the initial model training is complete. This includes both basic instruction-following, refusing unsafe requests, and political alignment[3]. Google also has to build that second training set itself. Except it's almost certainly less well-developed than OpenAI's. In fact, this is the intent behind OpenAI's really long preview periods. The people using the model in preview are specifically being spied on to find out new corner cases for their models.

Well, yes and no, I think. It is entirely plausible that nobody at Google composed a library of Nazi soldier pictures (though I imagine their data set contained some) and trained it specifically and purposely to produce historically correct results in this context. What they did train for is that the results should be \"diverse\", and I am sure the model was appropriately punished (retrained, etc.) when they weren't \"diverse\" enough. Until the model learned, that if it follows historical data, it is bad. If it follows the required \"diverse\" result, it is good. The model does not know what \"Nazi soldier\" means and how it's different from \"Forth programmer\". It just knows it's very, very bad to produce non-diverse results for \"Forth programmer\". Really, really low value function, stay away from it. So the weights are adjusted accordingly, and of course the other group of people would be as diverse - because why not? It was specifically trained to give ideologically biased results. It gives ideologically biased results. It's being a good LLM. It's not an oversight - you can't tell the model to prefer ideological component over existing data set and not get results that prefer ideological component over existing data set. Exactly because the model doesn't understand anything, it just does what it is told. It's not an oversight, it's inevitable consequence of the training paradigm. Of course, if they though about the specifically hilarious example of Nazi soldiers, they could tell the model \"except in case where we're talking about Nazi soldiers, in this case be historical\". But there's no way you can list all the cases, while keeping the bias (or, in minds of googlers, bias correction) intact. It's very hard to teach doublethink to a computer, it's not smart enough for that yet. reply danielmarkbruce 14 hours agoprevi imagine there is a lot of \"footgun\", \"blow your foot off\", \"unsafe\", \"bug\", \"leak\", \"this is irresponsible\", \"who the fuck wrote this\" and so on in a lot of c++ code bases... reply dotancohen 14 hours agoparentRight, I was thinking that Gemini was deriving as much information from the comments as from the code.

Alright, let's dive into this. You're looking to modify your function to not use the `auto` keyword with parameter packs but instead use a template parameter. The thing is, when we talk about replacing `auto` with a template parameter in a situation like yours, it gets a bit tricky due to how parameter packs work with templates and concepts. Your initial function definition is pretty sleek because it uses C++20 concepts (`std::same_as`) alongside `auto` to enforce that all arguments passed to `IsKeyDown` must be of the same type as `KeyCode`. This is cool because it gives you compile-time type checking right off the bat. However, when you're looking to shift away from `auto` and use a template parameter list directly, you'd typically define a template that applies a concept to a type parameter. Unfortunately, the direct translation you're asking for, using `std::same_as` directly in a template parameter list for a function, isn't how concepts are applied in template parameter lists. Here's how you can achieve a similar effect: ```cpp template requires (std::same_as && ...) inline bool IsKeyDown(Keys... keys) { return (::IsKeyDown(KeyCodeToRaylibKey(keys)) || ...); } ``` In this version, `template` declares that `IsKeyDown` is a function template that accepts a variadic template parameter list named `Keys`. This means you can pass any number of arguments of any types to `IsKeyDown`, as long as they all meet the requirement defined by the `requires` clause that follows. The `requires` clause here uses a fold-expression over the logical AND operator (`&&`) combined with the `std::same_as` concept to ensure that every type in `Keys` is the same as `KeyCode`. It's a way to say \"all types in `Keys` must be `KeyCode`,\" which aligns with your original intent but doesn't use `auto`. This approach maintains the compile-time check you wanted, ensuring all arguments to the function are of type `KeyCode`, and it doesn't use `auto` in the parameter list directly. It's a bit more verbose but achieves the goal within the constraints of the language and how templates and concepts interact. Remember, this approach leverages C++20 features heavily, so make sure your compiler and build environment are up to date to support this syntax. reply zenolove 14 hours agoprevhttps://archive.is/WxX69 reply Mistletoe 14 hours agoprevToo young to fight for his country, too young to code… reply noemit 14 hours agoprevanything that is \"dangerous\" or \"unsafe\" in programming is restricted.

The fact that Google did try to correct for the bias implies that either, rather than being politically neutral, they are actually on the side of the \"woke\" group, or they perceive that the \"woke\" group is stronger than the other groups. Other evidence suggests that Google is probably on the side of the \"woke\" group. 10 years ago I would have loved to be hired by Google, now they repel me with their political bias and big nanny approach to tech.

    "originBody": "CAL BRYANT HOMEABOUTGITHUB TABLE OF CONTENTS The idea Goals Research Liquidctl lm-sensors sysfs/hwmon The solution Calibration The control loop Installation Measuring performance with Grafana Installation & setup Terminology Recording Results Conclusion Future improvements Hybrid mode Abstraction Integrated monitoring Stall speed detection Beat frequencies General undervolting Better fans and thermal interface compound Better PC cooling with Python and Grafana Mar 2024 - 16 min read I recently upgraded from a Ryzen 3700X to a 5959X. Double the cores, and nearly double the potential heat output. I didn’t upgrade my cooling solution, a 240mm Kraken X53 AIO liquid cooler. Doing any real work with the 5950X made my PC significantly louder, and worse yet the fans were now spinning up and down suddenly and erratically.1 Inside -- the Kraken X53 and rear case fan, 92mm The 2 Noctua 120mm fans on the radiator Assembled, blasted with my compressor. The reason for this is the radiator fans are controlled based on the CPU temperature, which quickly ramps up and down itself. This is the only option using the motherboard based fan control configurable in the UEFI for me – the X53 cannot control fans by itself. I presume the quick temperature rises are specific to modern Ryzen CPUs, perhaps others too. Maybe this is due to more accurate sensors, or even a less-than-ideal thermal interface. Right now, I’m uncertain it’s not my thermal compound even. I know modern CPUs – particularly Ryzen 5000/7000 or intel 13th/14th gen – are designed to boost as much as possible with tight margins around temperature and power limits.2 The kraken cooler is by default designed to vary the pump speed based on liquid temperature. I think this is not optimal for cooling – it does reduce the slight whine of the pump however. The idea As I use liquid cooling, there’s significant thermal mass available which really should mean the sudden ramping behaviour of the fans is not required. If I could instead control the pump speed based on CPU temperature and the fan speed based on liquid temperature, I could take advantage of the thermal mass of the liquid to avoid ramping up the fans unnecessarily as the liquid takes some time to heat. The CPU would also be cooled more effectively, and the rate of heat transfer to the liquid would peak with the CPU demand, instead of being tied to liquid temperature. Goals Reduce irritating erratic fan speeds Reduce noise Reduce dust Eliminate throttling if any Work on NixOS (my main OS) A bit of dust. Let's limit that build up. Eww. Whilst I’m at it I may as well attempt a negative PBO2 offset to reduce the heat output of the CPU, and apply better thermal interface material in the hope to make cooling more effective. I could also try a traditional underclock/undervolt as described here. Research I decided to write a python script, installed as a systemd service to implement the idea. I’d need to read CPU temperature + liquid temperature, and control fan + pump speed. Liquidctl Liquidctl is an excellent project that allows programmatic control of the X53 among others. It even has python bindings! Writing the control loop in python therefore seemed like a good choice. Liquidctl with the X53 allows reading & controlling pump speed as well as liquid temperature; unfortunately the X range of Krakens does not allow radiator fan speed control unlike the Z series. I had to find a way of controlling the radiator fans and also reading the CPU temperature. For controlling the fans I considered making my own fan controller PCB, or using a Corsair Commander which I know can be interfaced under linux, also with liquidctl. lm-sensors In the mean time, I looked at lm-sensors has been around since the dawn of time. It is able to interrogate a plethora of hardware sensors by scanning various busses and integrating with many kernel modules. There are python bindings too. Truncated lm-sensors output I experimented with parsing the output, and using the module. This worked fine – it was a little awkward due to the nested tree structure from lm-sensors – but nothing a flattening couldn’t fix.3 I didn’t like the extra complexity of the necessary sensors-detect scanning, nor the fact that I ended up calling the lm-sensors executable multiple times a second. In the end I found a way of reading the temperature and controlling the fans connected to the motherboard using python after a friend suggested the possibility. This was thanks to the lm-sensors source code and scripts – I was able to find a fan control bash script that appeared to be interfacing with sysfs directly. sysfs/hwmon I figured I could do the same thing, and possibly read temperatures too! As it turns out, since lm-sensors 3.0.0 (2007) the kernel module drivers all implement the same sysfs interface and libsensors is an abstraction atop this to normalise manufacturer specific values. hwmon tree This sysfs interface is documented here. It’s straightforward! Just writing and reading values from specific files. The kernel module I had to load after running sensors-detect was nct6775. This is for a family of system management chips, one of which exists on my motherboard. After loading this module, I could interface via sysfs – without libsensors or lm-sensors; this is great news as it means my script can be much simpler with one less dependency. nct6775-specific settings are documented here.4. I’m also going to use k10temp to get the best reading of temperature from the CPU directly. Here’s a quick summary on the files used to interface with fans and sensors with sysfs. Substitute hwmon5, pwm2 & temp1 (etc) for your own controller and channels. /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon5/pwm2_enable – manual: 1, auto: 5 /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon5/pwm2 – value of PWM duty, 0 - 255 /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp1_input – temp in °C /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp1_name – name of temperature sensor /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon5/fan2_input – measured fan speed in RPM /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon5/name – name of controller To find the right path for a given fan, you can look for clues via the given names and also figure out the mapping by writing values and watching the fans/sensors/temperatures change. Make sure you restore automatic mode after! Note that simply switching from automatic to manual is usually enough, as it will cause 100% duty and make it obvious what fan is connected. The solution You can download the complete script here. I’ll explain the meat of how it works in this section. Be warned – the script is specific to my system, but could be adapted. Note having the control loop running on my OS could be risky – if the control loop crashes, the CPU could overheat or damage could otherwise be caused. Bear this in mind. That said, the CPU is designed to throttle so in practice it would be difficult to cause any damage. I also rely on systemd to restart the python application if it crashes. Crashing is detectable by checking systemd and observing the calibration cycle – the fans ramp up. Calibration I use Noctua fans. According to the Noctua datasheets, Noctua guarantee the fans can run above a 20% duty cycle; below that is undefined. Usually, fans will run quite a bit below this before stopping – we should figure out what the minimum value is empirically on startup for the quietest experience possible. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 def min_speed(pwm_file: str, fan_input_file) -> tuple[int, int]: # Turn off fans, wait to stop set_file_int(pwm_file, 0) for x in range(10): sleep(0.5) if get_file_int(fan_input_file) == 0: break else: raise RuntimeError(\"Could not stop fan for calibration\") # ramp up fan, until it starts moving for duty in range(100): set_file_int(pwm_file, duty) sleep(0.5) if get_file_int(fan_input_file) > 0: break else: raise RuntimeError(\"Could not start fan for calibration\") return duty, get_file_int(fan_input_file) Copy The minimum duty cycle is actually hysteretical – the fan will run at a lower speed than the start speed if already running due to momentum. To be safe, I prefer no start from 0% duty and increment slowly until the fan starts so it will always recover from a stall – as above. I discovered the fans can start at around 11% duty, 200RPM – almost half the guaranteed duty and less than half the min speed – great! This means less noise and dust. This calibration is performed automatically at start. I also measure the maximum RPM for curiosity on startup – by setting the duty to 100% and waiting. The CPU temperature range is based on the maximum temperature defined by AMD, and a measured idle temperature at max cooling; spoiler: this worked fine, without any adjustment. The liquid temperature was chosen ranging from idle temperature to max temperature, both on full cooling. This seemed to work well, too. For both, my room temperature was around 20c. As for the case temperature, I took some values I considered reasonable. The control loop Most PC fan control software maps a temperature to a fan speed, using some kind of curve. For instance, 40-70c may correspond to 600-1500RPM. The hope is that, for a given heat output, the fan speed will settle at an equilibrium. This is done using the concept of simple negative feedback. Example fan curve from a friend's liquid cooler Some curves may rise quickly – presumably to anticipate a load, or gradually, to slow down the initial response of the system to perhaps ride out small peaks in demand. The peaks could cause annoying fluctuations in speed, otherwise.1 The debug output of the first working version I know some BIOSes also allow a delay time constant to further smooth the response; basically a low pass filter simulating thermal mass! I think the best solution is to have actual thermal mass – the liquid. This allows a smoother response without sacrificing cooling performance when it’s needed most. Especially important given how aggressively modern CPUs boost. Anyway, the control loop reads 3 temperatures (liquid, case and CPU) then scales them linearly to 3 PWM duties – the pump, case fan and radiator fan. The PWM values are capped between the minimum PWM (detailed above) and 100%. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 def loop(self): print(\"Entering main loop...\") for status in controller.watch(): liquid_factor = (status[\"liquid_temp\"] - LIQUID_BASE_TEMP) / ( LIQUID_MAX_TEMP - LIQUID_BASE_TEMP ) cpu_factor = (status[\"cpu_temp\"] - CPU_BASE_TEMP) / ( CPU_MAX_TEMP - CPU_BASE_TEMP ) case_factor = (status[\"case_temp\"] - CASE_BASE_TEMP) / ( CASE_MAX_TEMP - CASE_BASE_TEMP ) controller.set_pump_speed(cpu_factor) set_fan_speed(RAD_PWM_FILE, controller.rad_fan_start_duty, liquid_factor) set_fan_speed(CASE_PWM_FILE, controller.case_fan_start_duty, case_factor) Copy This is done within a context manager to ensure we close the liquidctl device.

Measuring performance with Grafana Installation & setup I could have dumped the values via CSV and plotted graphs in a spreadsheet. However for multiple readings this can become tedious. I gave Grafana, a monitoring solution combined with influxDB – a timeseries database. This is a common pairing. I found 2 things non-intuitive when setting up this stack: Connecting the services together – terminology mismatch Influx-specific terminology around the data model Unhelpful error messages …so I will cover setting the stack up and help make sense of it, as I presume someone else out there has faced similar difficulties. The “add data source” workflow and UI in Grafana looks polished, but in practice it does seem like a hack connecting the services together. I used docker-compose to start influx and Grafana. Helpfully, you can initialise the database and set initial secrets as environment variables: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 version: '2' services: influxdb: image: influxdb:latest ports: - '8086:8086' volumes: - influxdb-storage:/var/lib/influxdb2 environment: - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=admin - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=badpassword - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=default - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=default - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_RETENTION=4w - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=a0a77e5d-983d-4992-bcad-4a5280a9eca6 grafana: image: grafana/grafana-enterprise container_name: grafana restart: unless-stopped environment: GF_RENDERING_SERVER_URL: http://renderer:8081/render GF_RENDERING_CALLBACK_URL: http://grafana:3000/ GF_LOG_FILTERS: rendering:debug ports: - '3000:3000' volumes: - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana renderer: image: grafana/grafana-image-renderer:latest ports: - 8081 volumes: influxdb-storage: grafana-storage: docker-compose.yml DownloadCopy After a docker compose up -d, you can log in to the Grafana instance at http://localhost:3000/ using admin/admin. After that you need to connect the Influx DB – do to Home > Connections > Data sources and click on InfluxDB after searching.5 Unhelpful error message Success! I set the URL to http://influxdb:8086/, and attempted to enter credentials. I didn’t see any option to add an API key (which seems like the logical thing to connect 2 services, and is defined in docker-compose.yml). Here’s where things don’t make sense. I tried the username and password in the InfluxDB Details section, and also the Basic auth section to no avail. I was greeted with InfluxDB returned error: error reading influxDB. This error message doesn’t help, and the logs from Grafana/InfluxDB reveal nothing too. In the end, after reading a random forum post somewhere, I learnt that the answer is to put the API key in the password section of InfluxDB Details. The User field can be any string. FYI: The Database field actually means bucket in Influx terminology. Really, it feels like an abstraction layer that doesn’t quite fit. Terminology InfluxDB has its own volcabulary. I found it a bit confusing. After reading this thread, viewing this video and speaking to a friend I have this understanding when compared to a relational database: tags are for invariant metadata. They are like columns, and are indexed fields are for variable data. They are also like columns, but are not indexed a measurement is akin to a table a point is equivalent to a row (but with no schema) It seems to be good practice including multiple reading types in a single point, so long as the data is coherent. For instance, a weather station may report wind speed, temperature and humidity on the same data point if sampled together. As far as I can see, you could also report some reading separately with no penalty to reflect the sampling used. There is no schema (“NoSQL”). Recording To record, I hacked together a monitoring system based on the fan controller script that would submit readings to InfluxDB. I made it independent so a failure wouldn’t affect the control loop. The script is here. Results Before the new controller, you can see the fan speed ramped up and down all over the place: Erratic and annoying fan speeds This was when building my blog (with a custom heavy optimiser) and then a stress test. Interestingly, you can see the CPU peak in temperature before setting down. The pump, set by liquid temperature by default, doesn’t spool up fast enough so the rate of cooling is less than it could be at the start – hence the peak. With the new control scheme, the fan speed change is much more gradual: Response under the new control scheme …and that peak in CPU temperature is gone! That’s because the rate of cooling maximises immediately as the pump spools up based on CPU temperature instead of liquid temperature. The time scale is the same for both graphs. Here’s what I had before I started experimenting: bad.png In this case the pump speed was fixed. The CPU was exceeding the maximum temperature and presumably throttling as a result. Here’s a graph during calibration: fancalib.png Here, the script finds the minimum speed and then the maximum speed. Interestingly, this max speed is not stable – perhaps there is a curve that the fan itself applies in its firmware. Conclusion Exploiting the thermal mass, and running the fans at an empirically derived minimum speed results in a significant improvement in cooling and acoustic performance. Subjectively, the machine is now silent during idle, and doesn’t get audible unless the system is stressed for several minutes. The fans also don’t reach maximum when running games unlike before. It is also possible to control the entire cooling stack without buying any additional control hardware, in my case. My script above is, however, specific to my installation; so isn’t that useful outside of this post. As a result however, it’s trivial – I prefer this greatly over running a bloated GUI application. Future improvements Hybrid mode I think a “hybrid” mode would be great. My PSU, a Corsair SF750 platinum, has a hybrid mode. In this mode (the default) the PSU operates passively (zero RPM fan) until some threshold when the fan kicks in. As a result it’s silent, but to me more importantly it’s completely spotless after 3 years in 24/7 use! No dust whatsoever. I experimented with this by letting the system idle with the radiator fans off but the pump at 100%: The liquid temperature with the fans off at idle The liquid temperature quickly approaches the recommended maximum of 60c. This tells me it probably isn’t possible without a larger radiator. I intend to investigate more thoroughly though. This also tells me that there’s a stark difference between cooling performance at minimum (silent!) fan speed and fans off. This could result in a hunting behaviour if the control algorithm isn’t right. The system would have to leave large gaps between the passive mode being activated to avoid sporadic system use resulting in toggling between maximum fan speed and zero. In addition, we fill up the thermal mass in the process, meaning the CPU is likely to overheat immediately if loaded in this mode before the fans kick in and the liquid temperature drop. A solution to this may be to detect if the computer is in use (mouse movements) and only allow passive mode if not. The fans would start and bring down the liquid temperature as soon as the machine is used. Abstraction Making the script useful for other machines could involve abstracting coolers and sensors. The control loop for each pair could also be in a separate thread to prevent a crash in one causing the others to stop too. Integrated monitoring The script could record straight to InfluxDB. This could be useful for long term analysis and assessing the impact of changing system properties – a new thermal interface compound, new fans etc. Stall speed detection I mentioned earlier that the start speed of a given fan is greater than the stall speed. Providing there’s a start/restart mechanism, it should be possible to run the fans even slower, resulting in even less noise and dust. Beat frequencies The fans (2x radiator, 1x case) sometimes make a throbbing noise. This is due to a beat frequency being emitted when the fans are close in speed. It’s slightly annoying. The system could drift intentionally to allow a large enough gap in rotational speed to avoid this. General undervolting I’ve played with PBO2 adjustment as I said, but it should be possible to reduce the voltage at the expense of a bit of performance. Better fans and thermal interface compound Finally, courtesy of a friend I have a pair of Phanteks T30s to try. Also, I have some Noctua NT-H1. They could help!

    "commentBody": "Better PC cooling with Python and Grafana (calbryant.uk)221 points by naggie 17 hours agohidepastfavorite106 comments dvdkon 11 hours agoIt's surprising that there are no PC fan controllers that would use some variant of PID control with a temperature target. Traditional fan curves are simple, but the result isn't very intuitive. And many desktop motherboards manage to screw up even the basic fan curve, offering users control of only two points within strict bounds, no piecewise linear curves or hysteresis settings. I started a fan controller project some 4 years ago and it's now sadly in limbo, waiting for me to solve power filtering issues for the makeshift power supply it grew into. Maybe I should just limit myself to 4-pin fans... reply Aurornis 9 hours agoparentPID control isn’t an easy solution in PC cooling. CPU temperatures can swing from 40C to 90C and back in a matter of seconds as loads come and go. Modern fan control algorithms have delays and smoothing for this reason. If you had a steady state load so stable that you could tune around it, setting a fan curve is rather easy and PID is overkill. For normal use where you’re going between idle with the occasional spike and back, trying to PID target a specific temperature doesn’t really give you anything useful and could introduce unnecessary delays in cooling if tuned incorrectly. reply duped 6 hours agorootparentI would be surprised that a PID controller can't adjust the control signal of the fan on the order of milliseconds/hundreds of microseconds. The mass of the fan would be the bigger issue. Something that would help is multiple fans being adjusted by the same PID controller. It's not a problem if they're spinning too fast, but if you need more cooling the controller needs to increase air flow at the fastest rate which means turning up multiple fans. reply lostlogin 3 hours agorootparentFans are annoying enough when at a steady speed, but a fan that is continually changing speed sounds extra irritating if it’s in the same room. Some sort of smoothing plus a conservative base rate might be more tolerable. reply guappa 2 hours agorootparent> a conservative base rate Do you use windows? I find that with windows the fan is always spinning, even if at low speed. While with linux most of the times it is not spinning at all. reply lostlogin 2 hours agorootparentI’m on a Mac - and for the first time a computer I can’t hear (it’s a model with a fan). reply crote 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that you really don't want the fans to react that quickly. Fans make noise, and a changing noise is far more irritating than a constant buzz in the background. You quickly stop hearing a fan constantly running at 50%, but a fan randomly switching between 10% and 100% gets on your nerves extremely quickly. reply mr_tombuben 2 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't the better solution be to rely on the heatsink temperature instead of on the chip/core temperature then? I mean in the end, the air from the fan is cooling the heat sink, not the chip directly. reply hoseja 1 hour agorootparentHeatsinks don't typically have thermocouples, is the problem. reply pca006132 12 minutes agorootparentbut it isn't hard to add thermocouples to a heatsink? perhaps the reason for not doing this is because the improvement is not visible in standard benchmarks? it is not improving the overall performance, not reducing the peak noise, just make the transition smoother... reply leetcrew 7 hours agorootparentprevthe CPU temp can do that, but your typical desktop air tower has a lot of thermal capacity. if it took 5 seconds for the fan to react, that wouldn't be a big issue. reply wtallis 7 hours agorootparentDesktop case fans also have a fair bit of inertia. They take at least a second or two to ramp up to full speed, and longer to coast back down to their minimum speed. reply selcuka 11 hours agoparentprev> It's surprising that there are no PC fan controllers that would use some variant of PID control with a temperature target. They actually exist (such as ARCTIC F12 TC) but not very common. Separate controllers such as Adafruit EMC2101 are also available. reply 4gotunameagain 3 hours agorootparentBoth EMC2101 and F12 TC work with a look up table, so a normal curve as opposed to a PID. You can verify that in the datasheet of EMC2101, and in the case of F12 TC in product descriptions (..The fan responses to the rise in temperature swiftly  within a critical 6°C range, the rpm of the ARCTIC F Pro TC fan increases from around 500 to its maximum of 2,000 rpm (the steep curve in the chart).) reply joshspankit 6 hours agoparentprevI’m more surprised there aren’t fan controller standards so the mobo or OS can tell the fan to ramp up with usage instead of relying on temperature probes. reply crote 2 hours agorootparentThere are, you can override your fan speed from the OS. But that leads to issues with a control software crash potentially leaving your fans stuck in a low-speed state. There's pretty much a 1:1 link between CPU load and CPU temperature, so relying on temperature probes is good enough for almost all situations. reply jerrygenser 16 hours agoprevAnother thing I've had great success with on my AMD 7700X is to use AMD Ryzen Master to reduce the TDP. The chip comes to consumers overclocked by default with a TDP of 105W. I suspect this is the case so that it can beat Intel on benchmarks on \"default\" settings. You can set it to \"eco mode\" and have it run at 65W or 45W TDP. Under load, this only results in like a 5% reduction in performance for a dramatic reduction in electricity consumption, fan speed, heat, etc. Not sure if the 5500x series chips are overclocked but using eco mode could be a good approach. reply Aurornis 9 hours agoparentI’ve tried Eco mode on AMD parts before. The performance drop was a lot more than 5% for heavily multithreaded workloads (compiling), but I could see it being negligible for certain single threaded workloads. reply fbdab103 7 hours agorootparentInteresting we have different reports. My experience was far more in line with parent's in that enabling ECO mode hadtheir turbo clocks/voltages aren't sustainable with most cooling solutions And also, starting with 7nm it becomes a lot harder to transfer that heat out of the chip, even if you have thermal mass. The IHS itself becomes a bottleneck. On X3D chips it gets even worse, as the cache acts as a heat shield too - these chips actually are pre-binned running at relatively low voltages, which is why they usually don't see as huge gains in as others in curve optimizer. reply parineum 15 hours agorootparentprevThe chips overclock themselves under load but it's unsustainable. Limiting their TDP can allow them to sustain their overclocks longer/indefinitely. reply LegitShady 13 hours agoparentprevJust an FYI AMD Ryzen Master installer contains a dark pattern. When you first launch it you have to scroll down the disclaimer/license to check off the \"I agree to terms and conditions\" box (which is obviously unchecked by default). When you do, it creates the \"install button\" you can click but the checked box now sits beside text about sending AMD information and if you aren't looking you may assume its still the same text as when you checked the box. The end effect is to get the user to agree to send data without them noticing. reply this_user 14 hours agoparentprevI had a similar problem to what the article describes with a Ryzen 9.

Most modern coolers will provide sufficient pressure to spread a pea sized amount of thermal paste to cover the whole cooler. There are also thermal pads, both reusable and single use, that perfom well and don't require any guesswork. If you want to paste, noctua has the best paste in terms of thermal resistance, but mx4 or mx5 both perform well, as does cryorig and a bunch of others. reply willis936 9 hours agorootparent>You want to use as little paste as possible while fully covering the heat spreader.

It's just a compound what helps with a heat transfer. Both CPU IHS and the radiator are not ideal surfaces, so if you install one on one without TP then there would be bubbles of air trapped in imperfections of the surfaces. They are not a problem per se but they do make the heat transfer worse, so IHS is hotter than it could be and a bit less effective to transfer the heat to the radiator. You have two options to improve the heat transfer: a) polish both the IHS and the radiator to a perfect surface, ie they would should mirror like; and then you should use a torque screwdriver to ensure what the cooler is tightened and leveled exactly right; b) or you can just slap some thermal paste between them and call it done. And in the second case you need 'just enough' of TP to smooth out the imperfections, but if you slpat too much then again you are making the heat transfer between the IHS and the radiator worse. So if you ever find yourself minding about how much TP should you use then just start with a pea size, place the radiator (you can even screw it if that's your jam) then remove it and look at how the TP spread around the IHS. If it covers 90% with a thin film (and your radiator isn't the lowest shit tier polished with the old rusted raspel) when you are fine enough. The only difference between 20yo and now is what IHS are way more larger so now you may find a need to use... a larger pea as a reference. reply kelvie 13 hours agoprevI've been using an esp32-based fan controller with esphome and inlined C++ for my waterloop for a while, with a custom (but super simple) temp control algorithm as well: https://github.com/kelvie/esphome-config/blob/master/pc-fan-...

Thanks! https://i.imgur.com/KDeHgFY.png reply js2 15 hours agoprevI geeked out on something like this for my TrueNAS server setting fan speed based on drive temperature with a PID controller. e.g. https://github.com/dak180/TrueNAS-Scripts/blob/master/FanCon... (That's not mine. I think I wrote a variation in Python.) Then I realized: my server is in the unfinished part of my basement where I can't hear it anyway. Let's just run the fans at 80% speed all the time since that's sufficient to keep the drives cool. reply pstrateman 14 hours agoprevThis is pretty cool but honestly just setting the pump speed to a constant that's not annoying and setting the fans to a constant that's not annoying is likely to get the same result. reply Arch-TK 14 hours agoprevWith a Noctua NH-D15 and about 30 minutes spent tweaking the motherboard fan curves I was able to get my 5950x to not thermal throttle without producing any noticeable fan noise. This seems extremely over-engineered and sounds like it could have been solved by using Noctua or similar quiet fans. reply ComputerGuru 14 hours agoparentThe author specifically mentions (multiple times) that they are using Noctua fans... reply asmor 13 hours agorootparentNot exactly the optimal Noctua fan, considering it's a high RPM redux. reply gen_greyface 4 hours agoparentprevHow did you achieve this? tweaked by hand? i'm in the middle of building a pc and would love to know more. reply cinntaile 14 hours agoprevIt says 5959x in the article but it should be 5950x. reply craftoman 14 hours agoprevBetter cooling with Python, Grafana, Prometheus on top of Kubernetes with enchanted AI.

These run at 1700 RPM by default, whereas Noctua has a version - even in the redux line - that runs at 1200 RPM. Though the non-redux like gets even slower - so much that Noctua includes a \"low noise adapter\" (presumably a resistor). reply anticodon 15 hours agoprevOn AMD it helps to have pretty recent kernel and amd_pstate=active string in the kernel boot params. I haven't checked the temperatures but I think I've started to hear the fan noise less after enabling it. This option was finally implemented in kernel 6.1 or 6.2. I don't remember the exact version, it happened only 1-1.5 years ago. reply naggie 17 hours agoprevI got annoyed at my fan speeds so decided to experiment with controlling my fans with Python and measuring the results. reply jtriangle 16 hours agoparentYou likely have a setting for fan ramp time in your bios, usually in seconds. So setting your pump to always run at 100% and your fans to ramp slowly, say 10 seconds or longer, and using a minimum fan speed that is as high as tolerable would likely work as a no-additional-code solution. reply jeffbee 13 hours agorootparentAn AIO pump running flat out will draw 25W all by itself. An idle CPU can be below 100mW (Intel ... AMD idle powers are slightly higher). Setting your AIO pump to static full power will greatly increase the idle power consumption of the machine. reply jtriangle 5 hours agorootparentAnd? reply fwip 16 hours agoparentprevLooks pretty cool, the self-calibration routine is very nice too. My only worry is that rapid changes in pump speed might cause extra mechanical stress or wear on the pump, but I have no data to back that up. I've just heard that water pumps sometimes behave in counter-intuitive ways - e.g: sometimes running at a higher speed is better for longevity than a lower one. reply AceJohnny2 15 hours agoprevIn conclusion, this is why Systems (Thermal) Control is a profession.

Replace the included fans with Noctua. That is the full story of how I made my computer silent despite having a CPU with a TDP of over 200W. reply jrockway 6 hours agoparentI have 8 Noctua fans in my PC and I can tell you they are not silent at 100%. Are they annoying at full power? Not really. But they aren't silent. Thus, fan curves are applied so that when air movement is not required, they aren't running at full speed. reply ltbarcly3 5 hours agorootparentRight. Do you think this isn't obvious? So if you get an oversized cooler, then you don't run the fans at 100%. They never run at 100%, because the cooler has a significant amount of excess heat removal capacity. You don't have to do a bunch of manual curve crap because the AIO already does that. I never even plugged in the USB for it or installed the software, because it has excess capacity to cool what I need it to cool, so the fans hardly ever make a noticeable amount of noise. I just bought the biggest AIO that I found at Best Buy. I did zero research and didn't even look anything up. Hey presto, I spent literally 5 minutes and my computer is for sure more powerful than yours by a wide margin and probably still quieter. Also, literally every not-cheap (actually probably even the really cheap ones these days) motherboard also has pwm RPM/temperature curves you can edit in the bios. reply asmor 13 hours agoparentprevDidn't read the article, did you? reply ltbarcly3 10 hours agorootparentYes? reply asmor 1 hour agorootparentBecause OP uses a (mid-sized, but large by most standards) AIO with two Noctua redux PF-12 1700 PWM's.

An up-to-date Chromium-based web browser compatible with Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 8.x, and newer. The official homepage for the Supermium project Supermium is a drop-in replacement for Google Chrome with privacy and usability enhancements, optimized for legacy and modern Windows systems alike. Supermium is developed by Win32 (win32ss on GitHub). The purpose of this website is to provide additional information about the project, as well as to lessen its dependency on GitHub. For this reason, this website does not enforce HTTPS/SSL, and is designed with legacy platforms in mind. Essentially, you needn't worry about having a new web browser just to download Supermium! Download the latest build for your system architecture below: (currently 121.0.6167.81) Visit the official GitHub for additional download options 64-bit Setup (91.4 MiB) 32-bit Setup (80.2 MiB) To use Supermium browser, you'll need: Windows XP SP3 or later or Windows Server 2003 SP2 or later An Intel Pentium 4 processor or later that's SSE2 capable. Hyper-threading or dual-core recommended. Main website is certified to work with a minimum of Firefox 3 or Internet Explorer 7 Supports your favourite Chrome extensions, including uBlock Origin Unlike Google Chrome, Manifest V2 is NOT slated for removal from Supermium browser. You may download the latest builds of uBO directly from the project's GitHub, in the event that it is not obtainable from the Chrome Web Store. The latest, feature-complete version of uBO will be made available here if/when Manifest V2 builds for Chromium are discontinued. Key differences between Chrome and Supermium Supermium browser has: Aero Glass and Aero Glass-style titlebars instead of Windows 10-style ones Turnaround for major vulnerability patches generally less than one week from upstream disclosure A functional sandbox for enhanced security Custom tab options including trapezoidal tabs, transparent tabs, and outlined tabs Many flags from ungoogled-chromium Google Sync On Windows 7 and up, Widevine CDM support for viewing DRM content GDI font rendering, using #force-gdi in chrome://flags Persistent dark mode on the browser's UI elements, using #force-dark-mode in chrome://flags Support for SSE2-only processors in the 32 bit build Future support for: Windows 2000 Ungoogled Chromium features (in progress) WebGPU for D3D9 renderer Manifest V2 (once removed by Google) ...and more! If there's a feature you want, which cannot be replicated by a Manifest v2/v3 extension, please ask! It is important to note that Google Chrome is proprietary software, while Supermium, like Chromium is open source. This means that while similar, Google Chrome's feature set cannot be reproduced perfectly by Supermium. Return to Main Index Privacy Disclaimer © 2024 SupermiumWebsite by Ryan C.",

But it begs the obvious question if there's a legitimate use case for this, other than having a modern browser when spinning up your retro machine for that nostalgia once a year. And even then, unless you're visiting vogons, any modern website probably chokes your machine to death if it's a period-correct XP/7. Old POS terminals for example? But I think they would just display an ancient website in an ancient browser anyways, and again if the hardware is as old as the rest of the system, this will probably just add slowness with no actual benefit. Oh and yeah, nice job with the name, I misread it the first time. :-D reply oynqr 20 hours agoparentA period correct Windows 7 era machine is something like a Core 2 Quad with 4-8 gigs of RAM, I'd hope that even the worst modern web abomination runs on that. reply creshal 20 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of systems back then had Core 2 Duos, modern web apps (or overcomplicated sites) can easily choke those. reply drewzero1 19 hours agorootparentI was using a Core2 Duo with 4GB as my main home computer until about a year ago, and while some sites made it run slowly (mostly recipe sites and others with a lot of video ads) it was certainly still usable. The trick was to keep the browser down below 10 or so tabs and close it when I needed to use some other heavy piece of software. reply iforgotpassword 18 hours agorootparentInteresting, maybe it actually is Firefox being slower than chromium, but incidentally a few days ago I was trying to make an old core 2 duo laptop a browser-only machine for a friend's kid, and with debian 12 and Firefox, the start page of YouTube with no video playing had both cores hover at around 70%. The page worked but was notably slow. Videos played smoothly. So I guess if you don't mind the fans spinning constantly it's usable, but eh... reply pantalaimon 18 hours agorootparentYou probably didn’t have Hardware Video Decoding enabled in the browser, that’s still not the default on Linux. reply iforgotpassword 18 hours agorootparentBut as said, that was on the landing page with no video playing. What is it even doing there that can load up the CPU like that? I was rather surprised then that playback was actually smooth at least at 480p. Otoh I doubt core2duo had any sort of hardware acceleration for video decoding, but don't quote me on that... reply pantalaimon 18 hours agorootparent> I doubt core2duo had any sort of hardware acceleration for video decoding That would be the job of the GPU anyway, but H.264 decoding was pretty much standard back then.

Old reddit as well. I do that regularly on a 1st gen Atom netbook with 1GB of RAM and no SSD. reply rcarmo 18 hours agoparentprevI have a use case. I keep a Windows 7 laptop solely for dealing with old microcontroller boards (flashing, reconfiguring, sometimes coding whole chunks). A browser like this is going to come in really handy. reply beeboobaa 15 hours agorootparentDo yourself a favor and wrap that thing in a VM reply FirmwareBurner 13 hours agorootparentWhy? I have a Windows XP laptop online only for that exact same use case and I don't do any banking on it, nor am I signed in any accounts whatsoever, so what's the risk? If some malware were to compromise it somehow, there's absolutely no credentials or valuable info on there to steal or encrypt for ransom, and the machine is on it's own VLAN, so if it were to hypothetically get infected with something, the malware has nowhere else to pivot in my network just in case someone made some ultra-specific malware that can target both Windows XP machines and Amazon Alexa devices together as if I'm running Iranian nuclear centrifuges or something and have state actors targeting me. Plus, is there any Windows XP malware still circulating in the wild online mainstream? Feels like worrying about catching smallpox today. reply rcarmo 12 hours agorootparentI wouldn't compare it to actual diseases. As an European, the anti-vaxxer movement provokes profound disillusionment in me, and that last sentence... Apologies, I had to say this. (You are correct in that using a XP machine is likely less risky today if you're only doing so in a LAN and with minimal access to the Internet) reply FirmwareBurner 12 hours agorootparent>Apologies, I had to say this. Why? It was just a silly example, not a anti-vax promotion. reply rcarmo 12 hours agorootparentprevYou likely don’t do a lot of hardware development. VMs cannot talk TTL and even low-level USB properly without a significant amount of hassle. Typically unplugging peripherals (or rebooting an MCU) will disconnect the device from the host, and then you usually have to reconnect them to the VM and lose logging output. reply ptek 18 hours agoparentprevWindows XP64 (amd64) supports multiple cores and up to 128GB physical memory (maybe 8 years till that is standard on laptops?) Is the problem the website or the browser? Do modern web sites need all that spyware crap added e.g modern media sites, YouTube? Or is it the frame works that slow it down. I guess to use winXP 64 you need to be a driver coder as well to create drivers for latest internal gfx hardware built into intel cpus. Good on them for getting it to compile and work. I miss WinXP and Win7 with classic UI theme. reply Jerrrry 18 hours agoparentprevI have been proudly using the same instance of Windows 7 as my \"daily driver\" for 11 years. reply iforgotpassword 18 hours agorootparentI guess as long as daily driving (regarding online activities) isn't much more than browsing reddit and Facebook that might work, but wouldn't using Online-Banking/PayPal/Amazon on a system that hasn't been patched in years make you nervous? I mean the browser is a good sandbox but still... reply Jerrrry 17 hours agorootparentReddit, Facebook, Paypal, Amazon are all the only sites this computer connects to. The attack vector of malicious ads on these sites are the largest attack vector - which is nearly abysmally small since Chrome is a better sandbox than windows is. Aside from 0-days, which are basically/practically out of scope, the only thing to worry of is automated scans and 3 letter agencies. I am behind a NAT, and the 3 letter agencies are inescapable - but a defense of \"my computer is old and insecure\" may retro-actively be the only plausible deniability that the \"layman\" such as myself can muster. Hypothetically. Similar to having an open wifi network for the sole purpose of muddying the waters and adding noise to a signal. reply saagarjha 14 hours agorootparentThe browser sandbox is reliant on functional OS features to work. I would not recommend using something that old. reply carlosjobim 18 hours agorootparentprevThe opposite I would say. Facebook and Reddit are the worst hogs you can find. Advanced productivity software and most websites have no problems running on old machines. reply iforgotpassword 18 hours agorootparentAh that was worded poorly I guess; I was saying that in regards to security, but that sentence got awful long now that I re-read it. As in, you're probably not doing anything too critical on there. reply FirmwareBurner 13 hours agorootparentprevThe recent Reddit frontend update is insanely bad for both UX and performance. I had no idea further enshitification was even possible but holy crap they knocked it out of the park this time. I wonder at what point having a company with a terrible product like that on your resume ruins your chances of being hired somewhere that actually cares about quality products? reply apexalpha 17 hours agorootparentprevI hope you realise that that OS has not been receiving any security patches since 2020 or so. reply Jerrrry 17 hours agorootparentThe ROI on targeting older machines in Western countries is so asymmetrical, that I only fear targeted attacks - given my personal risk assessment, I'd rather allow a targeted attack and be alerted when my honeypot accounts get compromised, then join the ranks of Win11 botnets and a juxtapositionally genuine false sense of security. reply apexalpha 14 hours agorootparentI think you're miscalculating here. Most of the 'hacks' taking place are scripts scanning the entire internet looking for non-patched machines running knows vulnerabilities. The risk of being targeted by one of these is near 100% on a long enough timeline. I'd _seriously_ advice you to never put a WinXP machine on the internet, even with a firewall in between. At least get the extended support thingy. reply bambax 18 hours agorootparentprevMe too! reply Paianni 18 hours agoparentprevMaybe offline web development on old, perhaps proprietary, hardware platforms? Security and the risks of running untrusted code wouldn't matter so much. reply Unfrozen0688 19 hours agoparentprev>But it begs the obvious question if there's a legitimate use case for this, other than having a modern browser when spinning up your retro machine for that nostalgia once a year.

This is possibly why Putin seems to still use it Although it is very possible that more recent proprietary OSes contain spyware, Putin showing himself using XP is almost certainly propaganda to fuel distrust towards Microsoft and western governments/corporations in general. They have top notch FOSS developers in Russia, and I'm sure he can obtain a 100% spyware free Linux/BSD/whatever PC, unless he doesn't trust the hardware itself which can be bugged just like OSes and software (firmware, binary blobs etc.) so that he uses very old iron that most certainly don't contain malware but can run only ancient OSes. If that's the case, then it could make sense. reply jtriangle 18 hours agorootparentIntel IME, AMD PSP, have both long been thought of as hardware backdoors. AMD's licensed zen1 chips that China makes, whose name excapes me at the moment, have the AES instructions and PSP removed. They're also banned from being imported by the state dept, so, that's either because they're also backdoored by china somehow, or, they aren't backdoor-able, maybe both. Suffice to say however, modern computers (and smartphones) are chock full of potentially spooky SoC's and someone like ol'vlad might just be paranoid enough to not trust them. reply ronsor 18 hours agorootparentThe China version has all the American backdoors removed and Chinese backdoors added instead. reply FirmwareBurner 13 hours agorootparentSo if I live in the west I can protect myself from being spied on by my own gov by using Chinese CPUs?

XP was introduced in 2001 and was succeeded by Vista in 2007. The dates for the ME and Vista introduction seem close enough that if there was some sort of secret plan, that concurrent development would have been happening. That said, I have read many times that Putin does not use any computer or the Internet. (For those unfamiliar with it, the ME is an inaccessible second CPU running Minix and is network-aware.) reply wkat4242 18 hours agorootparent> That said, I have read many times that Putin does not use any computer or the Internet. I wouldn't be surprised no. He's got flunkies to do everything for him. And he does seem pretty out of touch with reality, which might be because they tell him only what he wants to hear. For example consider the war on Ukraine, it seems he really expected to overrun them in a day or two. reply netsharc 18 hours agorootparentLegend has it that he was giving money to his intelligence service to bribe the Ukrainian army generals to surrender at first sight of the invasion. They noticed \"You're giving me money that you don't need a receipt in return, in preparation for something that's never going to happen? Let me call you back, I need to call the Bentley dealership.\". And when asked they just reported \"Yeah, the Ukrainian army will surrender, no problem!\"... reply carlosjobim 17 hours agorootparentprev> Putin showing himself using XP is almost certainly propaganda to fuel distrust towards Microsoft and western governments/corporations in general. Hardly. He probably has more important matters to think about. That would be a world record in propaganda with the least impact. There's no reason for him or anybody else to use inferior FOSS software when an old OS does just fine. reply shortrounddev2 20 hours agoparentprevSome people don't like modern UI design and continue to use windows 7 and before reply zozbot234 19 hours agorootparentIf that's a concern for you, there are themes for GTK3 and GTK4 that replicate classic 3D widgets and remove much of the excess padding in modern apps. https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-95 https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95 (You should install both; Chicago95 is more actively developed, but B00merang gives you a GTK+4 theme that's currently missing from Chicago95.)

Anything more recent than XPis too heavy for x86 VM emulation on ARM and Win 10/11 ARM come with their own quirks that are not worth dealing with for my purposes. It's handy to have a modern browser at hand to not have to shuffle files around between the host and the VM, so you can do Google -> website of the tool in question (plus uBlock, so the main source of infection, ad networks, is taken care of). The likelihood of either Google or whatever very focused and targeted website I happen to visit to be serving XP malware is negligible. And if it does get infected, congrats, you infected a VM with no connection to the host or shared folders that has no personal files and is powered up maybe 30 minutes per year.

How does it? A buffer overflow in the TCP/IP stack? Maybe. Have you got an CVEs to back that claim up? Maybe DNS? But the Browser can easily bypass the hosts DNS resolver so this is a solvable problem. Beyond that, the browser manages the rest. > Heck, this Browser may even send a user agent that actually says it's some old windows that is no longer supported, lol. User agent string is trivial to change. It's literally just a HTTP header and there are numerous browser plugins that support doing just this. --- As I commented in another reply, we need to be clear about attack surface and threat model. In the case of the former, most (nobody said \"all\") of the security concerns are sandboxed by the browser. In the case of the latter, if your threat model includes targetted attacks then this browser on an older OS would clearly be the wrong choice. But for most people this would appeal to, that isn't a risk worth accounting for. ie this is safe enough for anything not important. reply Wowfunhappy 19 hours agorootparentprevLet's say I was running VirtualBox† on top of a bare-metal Windows XP host. Inside of Virtualbox is a modern Linux distro with Chromium installed, which I'm using to browse the web. Would you still consider this a major security risk? If so, fair, I'd like to hear more about why you would be concerned! But if not, how is this situation inherently different from running Chromium, which has a strong sandbox and statically links basically everything? I realize that in the virtualization case, Chromium is running on a separate kernel, but does that really make a difference in practice? --- † I can't figure out from a quick Google search exactly when Virtualbox dropped support for Windows XP hosts, but it appears to have have happened relatively recently. It probably wouldn't be too hard to build the latest version from source with some patches for XP compatibility. reply saagarjha 14 hours agorootparentYes, it does. To be fair I wouldn’t really trust some old version of VirtualBox that runs on XP (it probably has bugs of its own) but it’s way better than sharing a kernel that is known to be full of bugs. reply hnlmorg 11 hours agorootparentVirtualBox on XP would still be sharing the XP kernel. If you're concerned about bugs and age of code then Supermium would actually be better than VirtualBox: 1. VirtualBox doesn't support XP hosts, so you'd have to use an older version. 2. Whereas Supermium is current Chromium. So you will get the latest patches. 3. Chromium also has more maintainers than VirtualBox. Google and Microsoft invest far more resources into Chromium than Oracle does into VirtualBox. And that's without factoring in all the other contributors outside of G&M. VirtualBox just isn't nearly as cool. The fact that there still isn't a stable VBox release for Apple Silicon speaks volumes for just how stark the contrast is with regards to developer resources. reply jdiff 18 hours agorootparentprev> But if not, how is this situation inherently different from running Chromium, which has a strong sandbox and statically links basically everything? I realize that in the virtualization case, Chromium is running on a separate kernel, but does that really make a difference in practice? This is just not how static linking works. You're not suddenly running on a modern, secure OS because all your web browser dependencies are up to date. And your up-to-date, statically-linked browser is still interacting with your OS, not just the kernel but the OS and userland and everything. Static linking is not a security measure. reply Wowfunhappy 17 hours agorootparentStatic linking is not typically a security measure because you would assume the host system's libraries are equally if not more up to date. In the case of modern software designed for Windows XP, I absolutely consider static linking to be a very significant security measure, because every statically linked library decreases the amount of vulnerable userland code in use. For example, Chromium literally doesn't use the Windows SSL stack—it brings its own—so any and all SSL vulnerabilities on the Windows side are irrelevant. On Linux, you could decide to statically link everything and create a binary which literally doesn't touch userland—but I don't know if it's possible to go this far on Windows. Regardless, it's true that at some point Chromium will need to tell the OS to e.g. blit pixels on the screen—as does VMWare, which was the point of that comparison—and you could attack the OS via the pixel blitting function. However, this would be considered a Chromium zero day. A zero-day which is non-exploitable in Windows 11 might be exploitable in Windows XP—this is what you loose by forgoing defense in depth—but it would be fixed in due time regardless. reply jdiff 15 hours agorootparent> blit pixels on the screen This is where you lose me. The browser is a bloated beast that incorporates and reimplements so much of the OS. But not that much. The OS still interacts with the OS far too much for static linking to make much of a difference. And even if there is a modern Chromium 0day, like the Skia exploit I mentioned, sure, that's a Chrome bug. That's still a bigger problem for older OSes that have absolutely no protection once something escapes the sandbox. reply Wowfunhappy 14 hours agorootparent> The browser is a bloated beast that incorporates and reimplements so much of the OS. But not that much. The OS still interacts with the OS far too much for static linking to make much of a difference. The thing is, we don't actually care about the whole OS, we care about the bits that interact with untrusted remote data, i.e. web content. I really don't think there are many opportunities for Chromium web content to interact with the host OS. Everything goes through Chromium's renderer. If web content is able to affect things on the other side of that renderer, that's a zero day! > And even if there is a modern Chromium 0day, like the Skia exploit I mentioned, sure, that's a Chrome bug. That's still a bigger problem for older OSes that have absolutely no protection once something escapes the sandbox. We agree on this point! A zero day is vastly more dangerous to a Windows XP user than a Windows 10 user. This is the benefit of defense in depth, which you loose by blatantly removing a major layer of defense. However, for regular consumers, I still believe the risk of being hit with a zero day is vanishingly small. A person who daily drives Windows XP but browses the web in Supermium, installs new versions of Supermium within 24 hours of release, keeps his or her passwords in Bitwarden behind a strong master password, and uses a good home router with updated firmware is less vulnerable to cyber threats than the vast majority of the population! Zero days aren't used to create botnets, they're used to launch targeted attacks on high-stakes targets. No one uses them in automated attacks because (A) people would see the attack and patch the vulnerability and (B) it's so much easier to take over insecure wifi routers. https://xkcd.com/538/ is also relevant here. --- Please do share if you think there is a specific attack surface I am overlooking. As I've said, this is directly relevant to me as a user of OS X 10.9, which hasn't been updated by Apple since 2015. If I am currently exposed in a way that leaves me vulnerable to an automated attack (!), I need to either patch the OS myself—I have done this before—or, if I absolutely must, take more drastic measures such as moving all of my web browsing inside VMWare Fusion or migrating off of my favorite platform. reply saagarjha 14 hours agorootparentOk recent example we had a bunch of 0 days targeting Android where attackers sidestepped basically all of Chrome’s security features because of bugs in Mail GPU drivers. A fully-patched Chrome can only assume that these were written correctly and dutifully calls into them as appropriate (from userspace, of course). If these legitimate calls end up triggering the bug then you have attack surface that is exposed to web content. reply hnlmorg 17 hours agorootparentprevLet me throw the same question to you that I had to redder23: What part of the OS are you specifically concerned about? \"Operating system\" is a pretty broad description and there isn't a whole lot of surface area between this specific sandbox and the OS-owned APIs. Font rendering is one concern that has already been raised; and by those defending this browser too. But literally no-one who's opposed to this browser has named a single specific vulnerable API in this thread. This is the problem we're having in this conversation. Claims are being made that this is insecure -- made in absolute terms. Yet zero attempts have been made to back up those claims. Just handwavey comments about \"the OS is out-of-date\". reply jdiff 15 hours agorootparent> \"Operating system\" is a pretty broad description That's the problem, and the concern.

But the point you keep missing is that browser do not interface with the entirety of the OS. Just because code exists, it doesn't mean the browser calls that code. For example notepad.exe was used as a UAC bypass in early versions of Vista. But there isn't any way a website running in Supermium can elevate itself to run as Administrator, let alone use notepad.exe to bypass the UAC, without exploiting a serious zero-day in Chromium. And if attackers have a zero-day that serious in Chromium, then they're not going to burn it on infecting the 10 people who run Supermium. > I've given several concrete examples (both of actual exploitable surface area and more abstract kinds of exploitable surface areas) in this thread already, feel free to refer back to them. You've given one and even that was impossibly vague. > A lot of what you're complaining about as handwavy is just common knowledge. Nobody is disputing that you should keep your OS fully patched. But what's being said here is that the age of the system ironically actually works in its benefit: it's now a small enough market share that it isn't worth burning a Chromium zero day on. That all said, advise of not running XP / Vista for work is wise. And not connecting them to untrusted networks is wise too. Nobody is disputing that either. What is being said is that having an XP / Vista machine at home (likely for retro gaming or other niche use case) isn't automatically catastrophic. Things don't have to be boolean :) > Ask questions if you're interested, but out-of-date OSes are factually insecure in known-unfixable and unknown-unfixable ways. I have quite a lot of experience hacking Windows and even wrote my own hobby browser a while back. I'm pretty well versed on the topic. The one question I asked is examples of how you would exploit \"the OS\" from the browser. So maybe it's better we agree to disagree reply Wowfunhappy 14 hours agorootparentprevWith all possible respect, I don't think you have given concrete examples. You have given general examples, and hnlmorg and I have explained why we don't think there are concrete problems to be found there. The exception is font rendering. I haven't used Supermium specifically and I don't know enough about how it works, but if Supermium is passing remote web fonts directly to the OS for rendering, that needs to stop immediately, and until it does all Supermium users should disable webfonts! As an aside, if there is in fact something like an exploitable buffer overflow in Windows XP's TCP/IP stack, that is something enthusiasts could probably patch. reply Wowfunhappy 20 hours agoparentprevIf the browser is properly sandboxed, and you're only accessing the internet through the browser, you should reasonably safe, no?

No, just as an example, Windows has had multiple kernel exploits that only required crafted fonts to be loaded by the victim computer. Any interaction with the world outside of the sandbox leaves room for a foot in the door, and there's necessarily a lot. Images, video, audio, the multitude of device APIs, and like the font exploits show, even the most basic page rendering. reply Wowfunhappy 19 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that Chromium renders fonts and other graphics primitives via Skia. Video and audio uses ffmpeg. And all of these libraries are statically linked. reply jdiff 19 hours agorootparentSupermium in specific will let you render text with GDI (for performance, probably?), videos are played with FFMPEG but that still means hauling untrusted footage outside of the sandbox for hardware decoding, and there's still countless other potentially-pierceable membranes in the sandbox. This (probably) isn't a practical vector for a browser, but kernel exploits have been crafted out of scrollbars in the past. Any time the sandbox calls out to the OS in any capacity it's trusting that the surface it's touching isn't vulnerable, and sometimes it is. For a sandbox to solve this, it's not good enough to just prevent people from misusing the APIs that exist on paper, you have to verify that the API itself isn't bugged and exploitable. And it's not just OS surface, either, Skia's just as penetrable as any other membrane in the sandbox.[0] [0] https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6345 reply hnlmorg 19 hours agorootparentIf ffmpeg is statically linked then code isn't leaving the sandbox. Browsers don't use the OS's scrollbars because browser scrollbars are themeable in ways that the system scrollbars are not. I do agree with you in principle but in practice, we aren't talking about a wide attack surface if you're using an older OS + modern browser vs a modern OS + modern browser. It's certainly drifting into the realm of a targetted attack. And if you're the kind of individual that is likely to be targetted in this kind of way, then you'd have a lot more secure defaults than just \"modern OS + modern browser\". So it all boils down to what your threat model is. If you're Satya Nadella then this would be stupid. But if you're just some random Joe Bloggs who plays a few retro games, then realistically this should be safe enough to load GOG. reply jdiff 18 hours agorootparentIt does leave the sandbox. How else are you going to get hardware acceleration? That means talking to the hardware, which means talking to the OS, which is outside of the sandbox. I already said scrollbars weren't a practical example, just an example of how benign APIs can be exploited. I heavily disagree about the threat model. It costs next to nothing to cast the net out for users neglecting their computer (and there are very many), and the payout is a hefty botnet. reply hnlmorg 17 hours agorootparent> It does leave the sandbox. How else are you going to get hardware acceleration? Depends on what you're hardware accelerating and how you want to \"accelerate\" it. In the case of video decoding, ffmpeg would talk directly to the hardware. There wouldn't be an \"OS\" component to that (if there were, then ffmpeg wouldn't exist in the first place). The rendering part of video playback would be owned by the browser. So whatever graphics libraries Supermium uses. There is already a conversation about GDI elsewhere in this conversation. At least with the rendering part, the browser owns the API interaction. Which does reduce the attack surface significantly. Though that's not to say that there isn't the possibility of someone carefully crafting a zero day that exploits the latest builds of ffmpeg to purposely to attack an unpatched bug in an older rendering library. However this comes back to my earlier point that such an attack would be highly specific to this exact browser fork running on a specific version of Windows. ie you're now talking about nation state actor level of targetted attack. If that's your threat model, then you definitely shouldn't run this. But I doubt that's a concern for most people > I already said scrollbars weren't a practical example, just an example of how benign APIs can be exploited. I don't think anyone is confused about the fact that APIs can be exploited :) > I heavily disagree about the threat model. It costs next to nothing to cast the net out for users neglecting their computer (and there are very many), and the payout is a hefty botnet. Actually it costs a great deal of time and effort to craft an exploit that would target a zero day on a modern browser even if the underlying OS API vulnerability is already known.

More like two, actually. First, it costs almost nothing to include exploits for known out-of-date OSes (and browsers, but that's separate to this particular point). Second, if a modern browser is exploited, it needs a payload to deal with the OS on the outside. It, again, costs almost nothing to see if there's any low hanging fruit on the outside. And plenty of modern vulnerabilities affect older OSes, so you may just get it for actually free instead of nearly free. Nobody who cares about their threat model is running an out-of-date OS. And yet, out-of-date OSes are vacuumed up in mass amounts for botnets. They're worth going after, even if the people running those machines don't even know what \"threat model\" means. They have an internet connection? That's plenty to make it worth the minimal effort. reply hnlmorg 13 hours agorootparent> FFmpeg does not talk directly to hardware. That's the job of the OS and the drivers. They exist outside of the sandbox. So does the hardware itself. It depends how you run (and build ffmpeg). ffmpeg supports a plethora of different hardware and software configurations. I don't know how Chromium runs ffmpeg -- likely different on each platform -- but Supermium could easily fallback to software decoding. > You missed a step. More like two, actually. First, it costs almost nothing to include exploits for known out-of-date OSes I haven't missed anything. We aren't talking about software that directly interfaces with the OS. We are talking about software that needs to escape the browser sandbox first. It's all good and well saying \"it costs nothing to include exploits for known out-of-date OSes\" but how do you execute that payload? That's the hard part. > Second, if a modern browser is exploited, it needs a payload to deal with the OS on the outside.

Exactly!! This browser is only going to be used on systems that aren't important. So the risk isn't as serious. > And yet, out-of-date OSes are vacuumed up in mass amounts for botnets. Indeed. And having an up-to-date browser will help those 0.29% of people still running XP: https://www.statista.com/statistics/993868/worldwide-windows... > They have an internet connection?

Direct2D, DirectWrite, et al. are all technologies introduced with NT6, aka Windows Vista and 7. reply Wowfunhappy 18 hours agorootparentSorry, I think is misunderstood. I've edited GP to remove the note about GDI. Is Supermium passing webfonts directly to the Windows font renderer instead of going through Skia? A good test for this might be whether emojis render properly in Windows XP, which doesn't natively support colored fonts. reply Dalewyn 18 hours agorootparentI don't know how Chrome/Chromium/Supermium handle text rendering, I'm just commenting on how GDI is the only option for Windows XP and prior. reply mkup 18 hours agorootparentDoes GDI/non-GDI distinction really matter if the only job for GDI is to blit already rendered framebuffer after Skia library (up-to-date part of browser) to the hardware? I.e. when GDI is actually not exposed to the fonts and vector graphics downloaded from the web, just pixels? To me it seems highly unlikely that GDI can be exploited via colors of pixels. reply hnlmorg 18 hours agorootparentprevDirectDraw existed in old versions of DirectX. After a while it was deprecated in favour of using Direct3D even for 2D planes. So you don't really need to fall back to GDI. Though I wouldn't say older versions of DirectX would be any more secure than GDI. reply krackers 12 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't chrome use harfbuzz for the glyph shaping, which ends up calling into coretext? It may use skia for the drawing, but (at least in the past) text rendering (in the sense of font parsing and gyph shaping) is then ultimately still done by coretext. So it seems like it would still be vulnerable to CoreText exploits, of which there was a notable recent 0-day. This is why I think it is prudent to disable remote fonts (PDFs are still an issue, but you can at choose to not auto-render them). Edit: This may not be the case, seems like CoreText was only invoked by Harfbuzz for some specific fonts, and newer versions of Harfbuzz can handle those too. See https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40597670, it was only ever AAT fonts that invoked coretext and that too since 2019 it's handled natively. Webfonts never allowed AAT in the first place (https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41475337). reply Wowfunhappy 11 hours agorootparentHi! Note that this thread is about Windows, which definitely doesn't use Coretext. ;) If anyone actually has an XP machine handy, I really am curious whether colored emojis work in Supermium. If they do, I would assume Chromium (or at least Supermium) isn't using the OS font renderer. And I'd honestly be pretty surprised if emojis didn't work. Passing web fonts off to be handled by the OS (in anything above the most trivial way) just doesn't seem to fit how Chromium does things, for the security reasons we are discussing if nothing else. reply guestbest 10 hours agoparentprevNot that I recommend using such an old operating system or not getting current patches, what is the likely ways a hacker would own the user is they were otherwise using a host blocker combined with unlock origin and not running any other executables except chrome on their system? reply rasengan 19 hours agoprev> For this reason, this website does not enforce HTTPS/SSL No SSL on the website means someone could easily MITM the connection and serve something else. That’s a very bad decision short of providing a different form of cryptographic authentication. SSL isn’t just for encryption, friends. reply toast0 15 hours agoparentThey do have SSL on the website, but it's optional. But assuming MITM, the only defense against MITM a site owner has is getting preloaded on the HSTS list. Refusing to serve content in HTTP doesn't help, because the MITM can upgrade the request on the backend. Redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS is window dressing. For a site like this, I might version sniff and send modern browsers to a favicon served over HTTPS with HSTS headers; future accesses will get upgraded to HTTPS (unless the MITM drops these requests), and older browsers don't understand HSTS anyway. But I wouldn't put that favicon on generally, because it's not likely possible to get a certificate older browsers will like, and older browsers like to throw popups when they can't negotiate https on subresoures, which ruins everyone's day. Older browsers are likely to require SHA1 certificates, and have a more limited selection of CAs. CA/Browser rules prohibit issuing new SHA-1 certificates, so you're pretty much out of luck there. Even if you can get a SHA-1 certificate that older browsers like, you have to also have a certificate that newer browsers like and get your server to distinguish between the two and serve the right certificate. Helpfully, Client Hello does not provide user-agent information, so you have to kind of guess at age of the browser / capability by what version, ciphers, and extensions they suggest. But really, all of that is moot unless you can get a trusted CA to issue a usable cert, which I'm pretty sure you can't. reply redder23 19 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] OsrsNeedsf2P 19 hours agorootparentDepends on your threat model.

I don't think that everyone truly understands the nature of the larger problem, so I'll briefly explain it here... You see, a long time ago in computer history, OS adoption -- drove corresponding software development. That was the case with various versions of Microsoft Windows -- for many years. These days, it's not the Operating System but the Browser -- of which (Google) Chrome (and its open-source counterpart, Chromium) -- which drives corresponding OS adoption... Basically, if a given OS can't run the latest version of Chrome / Chromium -- then it's basically a dead OS! That's a huge problem because by way of this, Chrome/Chromium unintentionally forces adoption of increasingly complex newer OS'es on the general public... That's a problem because these increasingly complex newer OS'es are orders of magnitude more lines of code (LOC) than their predecessors. If the complaint is that older OS'es are not secure, then guess what? That complaint also applies at least doubly (and perhaps exponentially!) to newer OS's as well, which comprise exponentially more lines of code than the older OS'es! In the future, it would be great to see the simplest (least amount of lines of code) OS that could successfully run Chrome/Chromium -- but even going a step farther than that, it might be an idea to freeze the Chrome/Chromium source at a certain point, then simplify Chrome/Chroumium such that its dependencies on an underlying OS were minimized! In other words, develop a fork of Chrome/Chromium in lock-step with developing the simplest OS that Chrome/Chromium could possibly run on, with the corresponding idea of refactoring all of that software into the simplest, cleanest, most documented, most modular piece of software that is or could exist. It is not in that form now. That is because Chrome/Chromium has incorporated source code from a lot of third party software. Does any single person, much less a single person at Google (as bright as everyone is at Google?) truly understand ALL of those lines of code? ? Based on the source code hierarchy -- I highly doubt it. That's because if they truly did -- then all repeated functionality in all third party libraries would be merged in the most minimum form necessary. Don't get me wrong, I love Google, I love everyone that works for Google, I love their products -- but I have to believe after looking at the Chromium source that there isn't a single person (compare to Linus Torvalds and the BDL concept) \"running the show\"... In other words, Chrome/Chromium is a \"diffusion of responsibility\" system, with multiple parties taking responsibility for different parts of Chrome/Chromium at different times... Compare that concept to that of a Maintenance Programmer Vs. a Chief Architect... A Maintenance Programmer typically changes a few lines of code at a time in a system in response to support tickets and customer requests. A Maintenance Programmer might very well implement the change or feature requested -- but with their changes they also might introduce subtle future bugs into the system because their view is local in scope, and they lack full global awareness of all of the rules and constraints that the entirety of the system must obey. A Chief Architect on the other hand -- will have that global knowledge -- and will harmonize any changes they make with the broader rules, constraints, goals and caveats of the entire system... In other words, the changes they make to a system, should they make them -- will be more finessed, more nuanced, more filled with understanding -- than those made by a Maintenance Programmer in response to a support ticket, customer request, or bug fix... Anyway, great job (so far!) with Supermium!!! We need Chrome/Chromium on those older OS'es! reply josephcsible 16 hours agoparent> If the complaint is that older OS'es are not secure, then guess what? That complaint also applies at least doubly (and perhaps exponentially!) to newer OS's as well, which comprise exponentially more lines of code than the older OS'es! This is wrong because the reason that older operating systems are insecure is that vulnerabilities in them are no longer being patched, but in newer ones, they still are. reply peter_d_sherman 7 hours agorootparentVulnerability patches -- while fixing some vulnerabilities -- can be the source of future vulnerabilities... One might ask themselves why constant \"security\" patches are needed... Did the security patchers not fix all of the security vulnerabilities in the OS they are patching with a single patch? Self-evident truth: If an OS ever has more than one security patch -- then the second (or Nth) security patch is a self-evident proof/truth -- that the OS vendor did not fix all OS security vulnerabilities in the first (or (N-1)th patch. Self-evident truth! But that's no fair you say! You're going to say something like: \"Oh no, OS vendors didn't know about the security vulnerabilities until after they were discovered later in time, that's why they needed to deploy multiple patches later in time, and that's why there's many of them!\" And that may be true... But it is also equal-and-oppositely the self-evident proof/truth that what was assumed to be secure at one point in time -- turned out not to be so secure, in hindsight, at a future point in time! Point is: The fact that there are security updates, multiple ones of them -- is a self-evident proof/truth that the viewpoint that a given OS is secure at one point in time (directly after the latest patch) and was not secure prior to that patch -- means that at the point in time that the prior to the latest patch was deployed, that is, directly after the N-1 patch was deployed (where N is the latest patch), it was thought that the system was \"secure\"... until the latest patch was then required... and then that point in time (as all of the other post-patch times in the history of the chain of patches) -- would have been shown as myopic (flawed) thinking -- about the matter... Conclusion: By virtue of the self-evident proof / perceptual contradiction pre and post patches I have laid out above, newer OS'es are not secure. The simpler (and the older) the OS -- the greater the chance it has of being actually secure... I am not wrong. Your conclusions about the security of a given OS pre and post patch at every point in the patch chain. Post previous patch, but before the next patch comes out: \"Now it's secure!\" New patch comes out, but before applying it: \"Oops, I guess it wasn't secure after all -- let's apply this patch!\" Post applying the latest patch: \"Now it's secure!\" Then the cycle repeats again and again, ad infinitum, ad naseaum... Self-contradiction. reply josephcsible 4 hours agorootparentThere are two flaws in your logic: 1. Security is not a binary. One system can be more secure than another even if it's not totally secure. 2. It's impossible in practice for any nontrivial system to be completely free of all vulnerabilities. When people talk about systems being secure, they generally mean free of known vulnerabilities. reply npteljes 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Browser is central, but an OS is more than just a host for the browser. It's a separate system, and thus, a separate attack vector. Backporting the browsers are not as crucial as keeping the security updates flowing - those are what really make or break any connected piece, software and hardware alike. And when talking about keeping the lights on, consider that support is not cheap. As things progress, the supported platform diversifies naturally, so you have to actively remove from it too, so that the resources are not spread too thin. This means stopping to support older platforms, especially those that themselves are EOL, and diversify the platforms by not supporting X new function, requiring a shim or other such complexity. Another thing is the understanding. Why would anyone need to understand the entirety of X? Suppose a person understands every line of Chromium code. Do they also understand the compiler? The x64 CPU that the software runs on? I don't think anyone ever did. The closest people come to this when they write everything themselves, like how Terry did with TempleOS. But even then, understanding stops at the hardware level. At a point, you have to let go, and trust, and manage. Consider looking into management. The issues you describe are not technological, but rather stem from product management, project management. reply peter_d_sherman 6 hours agorootparent [–] >Browser is central, but an OS is more than just a host for the browser. It's a separate system A Browser is a piece of software that has dependencies on the underlying Operating System. If you have a mechanical Machine A and Machine A depends on Machine B to function -- then Machine A's working is dependent that Machine B work. Security is of secondary concern than that Machine A actually works... If Machine A doesn't work -- well, what's the point of security in that scenario? Putting security before Machine A working -- is like proverbially \"putting the cart before the horse\" (possessing a working horse is a higher priority than possessing a cart, because without the horse, the cart cannot work as intended -- it cannot move!) A Browser is a complex machine. An OS is a complex machine. But you see, if the Browser increases in complexity and that increased complexity forces the dependency on an increasingly complex OS -- then what we've done is evolved a machine that may have been understandable and controllable by some people in society (mechanics) -- to something so unwieldy and complex that fewer and fewer people can work with it, much less control it (compare to the current AI debate). >Another thing is the understanding. Why would anyone need to understand the entirety of X? Suppose a person understands every line of Chromium code. Do they also understand the compiler? The x64 CPU that the software runs on? I don't think anyone ever did. We do, at minimum, know that there were groups of people who worked on all of those things; that is, to have been created the collective knowledge must have existed in some form somewhere. If anyone sought such understanding, then I would suggest a quote by the esteemed (and very learned!) Software Engineer, Grady Booch, who wisely stated: \"Complex systems evolve from simpler ones\" While it may be impossible or impractical for someone to rigorously study all of the systems you have mentioned, if someone did want an understanding of all of them, yes, all of them -- what they first might do is recognize that \"Complex systems evolve from simpler ones\", and then seek to find the simplest working example of such systems, i.e.: Chromimum Code -> First version of NCSA Mosaic (whose soure code later became Netscape, which later became Firefox, which later became Chrome/Chromium...) Compiler -> Simplest of simple C compilers. x64 CPU -> Simplest RISC CPU on an FPGA (then study VAX or other early CPU's microcode for the microcode aspect) X11 -> Simplest earliest graphical window manager / GUI. etc., etc. Also, Terry A. Davis, the creator of TempleOS, deserves to be praised for his effort, not shamed because he was not a member of the \"I'll let other people do it for me\" managerial class... >Consider looking into management.

It gives us com­fort to think great things await us, even though we’re long over­due for the per­son­al jet­pack and moon colonies. And yet it’s Asi­mov who appar­ent­ly owned the only set of post­cards of En L’An 2000, a set of 87 (or so) col­lectible artist cards that first appeared as inserts in cig­ar box­es in 1899, right in time for the 1900 World Exhi­bi­tion in Paris. Trans­lat­ed as “France in the 21st Cen­tu­ry,” the cards fea­ture Jean-Marc Côté and oth­er illus­tra­tors’ inter­pre­ta­tions of the way we’d be living…well, 23 years ago. The his­to­ry of the card’s pro­duc­tion is very con­vo­lut­ed, with the orig­i­nal com­mis­sion­ing com­pa­ny going out of busi­ness before they could be dis­trib­uted, and whether that com­pa­ny was a toy man­u­fac­tur­er or a cig­a­rette com­pa­ny, nobody seems to know. And were the ideas giv­en to the artists, or did they come up with them on their own? We don’t know. One of the first things that stands out scan­ning through these prints, now host­ed at The Pub­lic Domain Review, is a com­plete absence of space trav­el, despite Jules Verne hav­ing writ­ten From the Earth to the Moon in 1865 (which would influ­ence Georges Méliès’ A Voy­age to the Moon in 1902). How­ev­er, the under­wa­ter world spawned many a flight of fan­cy, includ­ing a whale-drawn bus, a cro­quet par­ty at the bot­tom of the ocean, and large fish being raced like thor­ough­bred hors­es. There are a few inven­tions we can say came true. The “Advance Sen­tinel in a Heli­copter” has been doc­u­ment­ing traf­fic and car chas­es for decades now, fed right into our tele­vi­sions. A lot of farm work is now auto­mat­ed. And “Elec­tric Scrub­bing” is now called a Room­ba. For a card-by-card exam­i­na­tion of these future visions, one should hunt out Isaac Asimov’s 1986 Future­days: A Nine­teenth Cen­tu­ry Vision of the Year 2000, which can be found on Ama­zon right now.

    "commentBody": "French artists in 1899 envisioned what life would look like in the year 2000 (openculture.com)206 points by gslin 13 hours agohidepastfavorite120 comments simonsarris 12 hours agoOne of the interesting things about these photos is that, aside from all the under-water ones, many of the contraptions exist. We just call them Roomba, Kubota tractor, Audible, Philips All-In-One Trimmer, etc. One consistent facet is that many of our modern technologies are a lot more complex on the inside, but simpler in appearance. There really is one guy pushing buttons to harvest thousands of acres. There's a complex kitchen one, and many people do have robot butlers in their kitchen today, they're just corporate chic instead of nearly alchemical, and called a Keurig. Though I would not invite such a creature into my home on account of its aesthetics I do admit its impressive. Another observation is that we've abstracted away the robot-ish nature of a lot of these machines. There's a special factory that makes k-cups, so that our home environment can have the simpler machine. We decided to pave millions billions(?) of miles of road, and also perfectly flatten the square footage of nearly every store and warehouse, just to make the machines run smoother. I think it would be hard for a person from 1899 to understand just how much flatness we've engineered for our cars and roombas and shopping carts to work universally. reply Sebb767 11 hours agoparent> Another observation is that we've abstracted away the robot-ish nature of a lot of these machines. In some ways, this is also limited by the format. It would have been easy for people back then to illustrate a Roomba or a modern sound setup (instead of the old-school speakers), but it would have been a pretty boring picture and confusing to people at the time, without additional explanation at least. The way these scenes are drawn, it's immediately obvious what has changed. reply GuB-42 12 hours agoparentprevI didn't realize that the underwater thing was so important back then. We are all thinking about flying cars, and these drawings don't disappoint, but there is as much happening underwater as it is happening in the sky. Now, we are still fascinated with flying, machines, etc... but going underwater is boring by comparison. We have submarines, mostly for the military, a bit of scientific exploration, etc... but besides a few passionate people, people usually don't think that much about the underseas. It is as if space completely took its place in our imagination. reply sandworm101 9 hours agorootparent>> the underwater thing was so important back then. Because, unlike outer space, the deep ocean was a magical and alien dimension that existed only feet away from everyone's doorstep, and the technology for getting there was under rapid development. Jules Verne's 20,000 LUTS came out only twenty years previous to this article. The artist may well have read it as as child. reply 0xEF 19 minutes agorootparentSeems like a reasonable inference. Futurology, even before there was a name for it, seems to hinge on two important factors; immediate need vs convergence of technologies. This results in some admittedly anachronistic ideas, but seems like a pretty rational approach, none the less. That the sea was not only accessible to a degree, but we also had hints of what was down there, would likely put that in the front of thinking minds as a problem solved in the near future, outer space being a bit less attractive of a mystery, since it was not obvious that resources could be gained from trying to go there. I do often wonder what our current predictions of the future will look like five or six generations down the line. I'd like to think that we have a better grasp on problems that need solving or how technology will naturally combine to accomplish more work, but I bet the folks in the late 1800's thought they had a good grasp on that, too. reply bluGill 8 hours agorootparentprevYet space now seems more accessable. The pressures in the ocean are no joke. reply alpha_squared 9 hours agorootparentprevI think the underwater craze has to be at least partially related to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which was published in 1871. reply appplication 8 hours agorootparentYes, I was just thinking it was probably in large part influence from Jules Verne. reply bboygravity 11 hours agorootparentprevThis seems super logical to me though: it's just way cheaper and simpler to build into the sky: few to no issues with air pressure. Fewer issues with sun-light. No issue with the build-surface moving (except for during earthquakes). Compared to building underwater: massive costly issues to overcome due to water pressure (when going deep), issues with lack of light. When building at the surface: waves, wind, lack of stable build platform. These are all issues that where known and predictable in 1899 as well... reply 4hg4ufxhy 11 hours agorootparentMaybe thats exactly why they thought we would solve it in the future. Space was more of an unknown unkown. reply Jensson 9 hours agorootparentSpace is still an unknown unknown, there just isn't anything interesting there that we know of. Most sci-fi space aliens and planets are based on underwater animals and plants, so I'd argue the dream of underwater exploration is still there but now labeled space exploration. reply throwup238 7 hours agorootparentprev> We have submarines, mostly for the military, a bit of scientific exploration, etc... but besides a few passionate people, people usually don't think that much about the underseas. BIG submarines are for the military but by far the biggest consumer of submarine technology is the oil and gas industry so people do think about it a whole lot. The underwater world is largely inaccessible to the average person because of the capital requirements (even fewer people can afford subs than boats) but we absolutely depend on that technology to power our energy infrastructure. reply dredmorbius 2 hours agorootparentThe underwarter world is highly accessible, at least for a few tens of metres, using SCUBA apparatus. Which was also invented by a Frenchman: Jacques-Yves Cousteau. reply nottorp 2 hours agorootparentTens of metres needs training, but I recommend to everyone to take a discover diving PADI tour if you're holidaying in a place where it's available. You'll go to at most 10 meters with their gear and a bunch of professional minders. Great fun. reply Anotheroneagain 1 hour agorootparentprevProbably more the opposite, space travel would seem too outlandish to consider. reply unsupp0rted 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat would be the benefit of large scale underwater transportation and living? I suppose if the surface became uninhabitable, or if we wanted to hide from space-based surveillance. reply bboygravity 11 hours agorootparentNice radiation shielding in case the earth poles reverse. I can't think of anything better. reply rvnx 8 hours agorootparentOr in case submarines launch nuclear warheads, then the people living under water would actually be the ones surviving (for some time) reply Jensson 9 hours agorootparentprevLiving space. Imagine if they built out San Francisco into the sea, you would open up so much more attractive locations a to build homes at and live in. reply marcosdumay 8 hours agorootparentThere's no lack of living space. What we lack is living space in transportation range of interesting places. reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparentMy example shows that the sea would open up a lot of new space near interesting places. People bunch up at coasts, you could bunch up more people around coasts if some of them lived underwater. reply pram 10 hours agorootparentprevPerfect place to build your anarcho-capitalist utopian city without government interference. reply datameta 10 hours agorootparentThat would be quite a shock to biology reply SgtBastard 9 hours agorootparentWould you kindly… reply drewcoo 10 hours agorootparentprevMost of our planet is underwater and barely explored. And most of the region isn't really claimed. By countries or individuals in those countries. The long-term benefits of exploration are often in the tools to solve the problems with the exploring. Tang and Velcro and microwave ovens are minor examples - I bet you can think of better things the space program gave us! Overall, it's s greater good for society and it spawns lots of specialized businesses and innovation. It's not the destination; it's the journey. The ocean may not be \"the final frontier\" (nods to Roddenberry), but that seems like an appropriate \"next frontier.\" reply vasco 2 hours agorootparentNASA did not invent velcro. A Swiss guy did in the 1940/1950s. reply unsupp0rted 1 hour agorootparentA Swiss guy invented it while exploring, err hunting reply foofie 3 hours agorootparentprev> We have submarines, mostly for the military, a bit of scientific exploration, etc... There's a special mention that deserves to be featured: submarines used for logistics in intercontinental trade routes: the infamous narco subs from south America cartels. Also, tourism subs exist, including those used in deep sea trips. reply vasco 3 hours agorootparentOr the ones the US uses to watch other people's YouTube feed underwater directly from the fiber cables. reply jasonwatkinspdx 7 hours agoparentprevYeah, it's crazy how different things are now. My neighborhood dates from the turn of the century. The houses that date back to the original days of the neighborhood are easy to spot, because they're built up on a berm about 3 to 4 feet higher than the street level. This is because when they were built, the street was just a bunch of mud and horse manure. The standard house design would dig out a half under grade basement, piling the excavated dirt into a berm around the house to keep it above the surrounding muck. reply wanderingstan 7 hours agorootparent> My neighborhood dates from the turn of the century. Note that this phrase now means “24 years ago.” Seems every day I have to correct myself to “turn of the 20th century.” reply thih9 12 hours agoparentprevWhat contributes to accuracy is what’s not there. To me especially the biology and medical advancements are missing. While we’re way better at maintaining our bodies than 100 years ago, we’re still mostly focused on improving our environment, just like 100 years ago. In 2124 I’d like no illnesses, regrowing limbs, perfectly balanced nutrition that is universally available, safe and accessible bio tech, and I could go on. reply Animats 12 hours agorootparentThat's not the full set.

Regrowing bones from genetic/growth defects for children at least, maybe minor bone reconstruction too. reply sandworm101 8 hours agorootparentIt is closer than that. Arguable, we are regrowing lost bits and pieces already (skin graft, moving blood vessels around). >> World’s 1st drug to regrow teeth enters clinical trials https://globalnews.ca/news/9984605/tooth-regrowth-drug/ reply orwin 1 hour agorootparentThis is exiting, really.

There was a huge effort in XIX century to develop better roads for the horse-drawn buggies and stagecoaches. reply simonsarris 12 hours agorootparentI think, like with almost all of these, the scale of our modern success is out of the scope of any of their beliefs. reply eastbound 12 hours agorootparentYes. In 1899, they hadn’t even invented the lift, necessary for skyscrapers. Imagine showing them, not Dubai, but a mundane success story like Bangkok. Edit: The Eiffel Towers had some, earlier than that. See comments ;) Sorry. reply samatman 11 hours agorootparentIn 1899, the Eiffel Tower was 10 years old. Not only did it have lifts, it famously, notoriously had lifts. French futurist artists could hardly be more aware of the concept. reply eastbound 11 hours agorootparentOk I thought they were created around 1920 when skyscrapers started in NYC. Maybe that is wrong too. My apologies. reply Gibbon1 10 hours agorootparentprevI remember reading about an early hotel or some such. Passenger elevators weren't a thing but they knew they were coming so they designed in round elevator shafts. Which later they needed to make a custom elevator for. Because round. Google comes through for once. https://www.amusingplanet.com/2020/04/the-elevator-shaft-tha... tl;dr: Cooper Union's Foundation Building built 1853.

In England, a major improvement effort was done around 1810-1830 by a rich nobleman, who was irritated by having to use very bad country roads to go to his local nobility political meetings (can't recall his name at the moment), and he was going there by horse. He had a scientific mind and devoted last decades of his life to studying road construction techniques and writing up the results. Since he had money and political clout, his ideas were adopted, and later spread across Great Britain, leading it to having by far the best roads in the world at the time. reply BrandoElFollito 18 minutes agoprevThese pictures, 120 years old, look old and so different from current standards. I like to think that in 100 years what seems modern will look the same to our descendants (if there is no event that brings us back to the Middle Ages). Even today's science-fiction movies are limited by an imagination that is born from what we see around, including the ones with magic. reply dado3212 12 hours agoprevThis might be a better source, with all of the images. https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/a-19th-century-vis... reply forgotusername6 2 hours agoparentOne of these shows an electric train.

(and no, the paris decree does not count). There were female marketed \"trousers\" appearing in the 1850s, so it is clearly completely retarded to suggest that the french artists \"couldnt envision women wearing pants\". But carry on with the official party line, but do so knowingly that it is fake. reply macintux 7 hours agorootparentIt's quite possible that the downvotes were expressing confusion/annoyance at the brevity and lack of context of your comment without additional explanation. There are three different \"could\"s in the comment to which you're replying. I think, had your comment included the second paragraph, it would have been much more useful. reply pmontra 12 hours agoprevOne of the most difficult things seems to be forecast fashion but probably the artist didn't even attempt to envision future clothing, except for technical ones. That would distract from the main point.

As a first step towards broader custom clothes. Entering assorted measurements, or modifying the dimensions of a previous purchase, a custom pattern was quickly laser cut, manually stitched in one of the last garment factories in the US, and overnighted. Patented, sold, bungled, abandoned. Stitching automation continues to improve, but full automation isn't quite there yet? Body scanning seems close. So near-term next-day almost-automated tailoring from Mexico? reply hef19898 2 hours agorootparentThat is basically the B2C version of Zara. The start-up doesn't exist anymore, the Zara founder is one of the richest people on earth now. This particular problem is bot about production of clothing, it is about everything else: design, sourcing of rae materials, distribution.

I think they tended to expect tech to change instead of culture, while in reality our culture has adapted to what is available technologically. reply naasking 5 hours agorootparentprevRobotic tailors might not be close, but we can try on outfits digitally for form and fit, so part of it kind of exists. reply guyomes 10 hours agoprevThis reminds me of this 1947 documentary [1] in French that imagined smartphones. Many scenes are surprisingly accurate. [1]: https://youtu.be/ZKfOcR7Qbu4 reply Affric 13 hours agoprevIt’s interesting because they got so much right but they just couldn’t quite imagine the computer so they have humans pulling levers, remotely operating machinery, being carried by advanced surveillance helicopters… Perhaps this hints that our vision of the future should have us doing less. reply sotillan 12 hours agoparentYeah, I do think the thing that will date most 20th century science fiction is that it usually has humans actively doing most things, like mining, piloting space ships, fighting battles, etc. When it seems more likely that almost all of that will be done by AIs, with humans directing them at best. reply shantara 12 hours agorootparentRegarding space sci-fi in particular, the image of a human manually piloting a space ship is iconic in both Western and Soviet fiction. Before the advent of real world human spaceflight era, it could be linked both to the lack of understanding of computers and other technical systems, along with the eternal popularity of the heroic explorer/captain/pilot archetype. However, even as public knowledge of space exploration has advanced, this portrayal persists in fiction. We humans just like good engaging stories, even if they are not always realistic. reply mc32 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably more like AI doing everything and very few humans overriding a few things here and there, negative things. reply ein0p 2 hours agoprevAnd we still aren’t quite there where it comes to freeing people from hard manual labor.

The relentless pace of change prompts me to question what life may entail in the next 10, 40 years, or even beyond 2010. Personally, I am inclined to think that as time unfolds, the complexities of forecasting the distant future intensify. Just a month ago, the notion of individuals donning AR/VR headsets while walking down the streets seemed far-fetched. However, with the release of the Vision Pro and folks using it in public places as it was a phone, I realized I would not be able to predict much in the coming future and just live the moment and hoping the best for humanity. reply dotnet00 7 hours agoparentI think anyone who was paying even a little attention to the tech in modern smartphones could see that really the only reason AR headsets aren't commonly worn outside is that no one has come up with a compelling enough application and associated compelling enough packaging, not a lack of technical ability to make such a device, and I doubt Vision Pro will accomplish that either, just like with Google Glass, its main source of popularity is that it's from a brand that many people consider their identity. reply lm28469 1 hour agoparentprev> the notion of individuals donning AR/VR headsets while walking down the streets seemed far-fetched. afaik it's mostly social media clout chasers shenanigans, you can't use the vision pro like that because the windows are fixed reply ffgjgf1 5 hours agoparentprev> the notion of individuals donning AR/VR headsets.

Our last significant social experiments and discoveries date from the 1850s or so (nationalism, socialism, slightly later fascism). While that period led to some of the worse massacres in history, it also led to some positive changes in attitude that persist today - mainly respect for the rights of each people, an end to the colonial mindset. Perhaps just like a mostly peaceful independence of India, Australia, Canada etc would have seemed unthinkable at the height of the British Empire, perhaps a non-consumerist society which seems unthinkable today is still in the cards. Either way, we will obviously see less consumption in the coming century - either voluntarily, as I hope, in order to stop the worse forms of global warming; or else global warming will continue in its current path to 3, 4, 5 degrees of warming, and the ensuing catastrophes will force it on us. reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the new surge of interest in Dune is a sign in this direction.

    "originLink": "https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/",
    "originBody": "Motion Blur All the Way Down Pierre CusaNovember 2022 (history) \"Torusphere Accelerator\", the animation that motivated this article. What happens if you take motion blur past its logical extreme? Here are some fun observations and ideas I encountered while trying to answer this question, with an attempt to apply the results in a procedural animation. What is motion blur supposed to look like? Motion blur started out purely as a film artifact, the result of a subject moving while the camera's shutter is open. This artifact turned out to be desirable, especially for videos, because it improves the perceptual similarity between a video and a natural scene, something I'll dive into in this section. In a 3D and animation context, it's interesting to note that those two goals - looking natural, and simulating a camera, might not be in agreement, and might result in different motion blurs. I'll keep the simulation aspect as a side note, and ask what the most natural possible motion blur should look like. This can be broken down into a few questions: How do we perceive a natural moving scene? How do we perceive this scene reproduced in a video? What is the perceptual difference between those two cases? How can video motion blur minimize this difference? Perception of motion in a natural scene For the purpose of crafting motion blur, we can start by analyzing the very first steps of human vision, where the light hits our retina and phototransduction takes place. Under well-lit conditions, this is handled by cone-type cells. Phototransduction is not immediate, and we can model this lag by smoothing out the light stimulus over time. 1. Example of temporal integration in goldfish cones, taken directly from Howlett et al. (2017). Raw stimulus is the number of photons entering the photoreceptor, in this case, a realistic example. The weighting function is derived from the cone's response in different conditions, and can be used to simulate the cone's average temporal integration. The resulting \"effective stimulus\", while not a measurable response, is a successful first step in modeling the cone's actual photocurrent response. Combining the above weighting function's shape with known human cone response times, we can create a detailed simulation of a perceived image based on any input scene. This concept has been used before, but without the shape of the time response. time: 0 s object speed: 10 rad/s [source] [full] 2. Motion Smearing. Left: Example scene, assumed to be natural and continuous. Right: simulated perceived image. This assumes the viewer is looking at a fixed point, and not tracking the object with their eyes. What this shows is that there already exists a natural blur at the photoreceptor level, a phenomenon often called motion smear. So why do we add artificial motion blur in videos, and what is the link between motion smear and motion blur? Perception of a scene on a screen Let's see what this perceived image looks like when viewing a screen with limited frames per second. video motion blur: none traditional with sine shutter time: 0 s object speed: 10 rad/s [source] [full] 3. Perception of a video. Left: Example scene as it would appear on a screen. Right: perceived image. This finally gives us a way of visualizing the usefulness of motion blur. When viewing a video without motion blur, the resulting perceived image looks like overlaid frames instead of the expected motion smear. This situation is improved with a motion blurred video, where each frame no longer shows a moment in time, but an average of all the moments within the time interval covered by this frame. This is analogous to a video made with a camera whose shutter is open for the duration of each frame's timespan. The resulting perceived image looks a lot more similar to the natural case. Making the screen natural with a shutter function Something still looks off in the perceived image for traditional motion blur. At some object speeds, artifacts still appear as discontinuities in the motion smear. This can be almost eliminated by applying a shutter function: instead of averaging all the moments within a frame, we weight them by a function so that the start and end moments have less weight than the central moment of a frame. The name \"shutter function\" comes from the analogy to shutter efficiency in a diaphragm camera, where the shutter takes time to transition between open and closed states. But instead of simulating cameras, the shutter function can be chosen in a way that minimizes the perceptual difference between the screen and a natural scene. The problem then becomes very similar to crafting window functions in signal processing, and indeed the most popular window functions give very good results. 4. Applying a shutter function. How well does this work? You can get a rough idea in the following demo, which can be switched between motion blur with and without a shutter function. My impression is that the shutter function is not necessary at low speeds, but is noticeably more natural for fast-moving objects1. This makes it highly relevant to the \"past the logical extreme\" experiment I'm aiming for. It also looks smoother in still frames, which is incidental but sometimes relevant. video motion blur: none traditional with sine shutter object speed: 10 rad/s [source] [full] 5. Live comparison of motion blur with and without a shutter function. I'll emphasize that this perceptual approach to motion blur is not conventional and could be misguided in some way. The common approach is to simulate cameras, which results in zero time overlap between frames, and often entirely discards moments that fall between frames. Meanwhile, the method I'm describing results in overlapping time-ranges for successive frames. With that out of the way, let's try applying this technique. Getting irrational with the torusphere To make things both difficult and interesting, I decided to make this infinite motion blur animation as a realtime shader. Because I like hardship and misery, yes, but mostly because I'd like the end product to be interactive, and in this case, a shader might be the simplest way. First, how does one render motion blur in realtime? After ruling out multisampling2 and analytic ray-traced motion blur3, I settled on a terrible hack best described as \"integrated volume motion blur\". Represent the moving object as a function that takes coordinates (including time) and returns density (the inside is 1, the rest is 0). Integrate this density function over time, and the result should give you a \"motion-blurred density\" over any time interval. The result can be rendered by volume ray casting. This method is not photorealistic, but can handle extremely long trails with realtime performance. The intended animation combines an orbiting sphere and a rotating torus, both of which need to be motion-blurred up to essentially infinite speed. Motion-blurred sphere Taking a 2D slice of the orbiting sphere, the problem is reduced to finding the motion-blurred density for an orbiting circle. Let's assume an orbital radius 𝑅 R, and a circle of radius 𝑎 a. The circle's center is always at a distance of 𝑅 R from the origin, so it can start at the point ( 𝑅 , 0 ) (R,0). This means that initially, all points ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) (x,y) on the circle are defined by: ( 𝑥 − 𝑅 ) 2 + 𝑦 2 = 𝑎 2 (x−R)2+y2=a2 In order to work with the orbit, this should be expressed in polar coordinates ( 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) (r,θ), which can be done by substitution: 𝑟 2 − 2 𝑟 𝑅 cos ⁡ 𝜃 + 𝑅 2 = 𝑎 2 r2−2rRcosθ+R2=a2 Finding the density function means taking any point, and answering the question: When does this point enter the orbiting circle? When does it exit? The answer lies in the angle coordinate coordinate 𝜃 θ of the initial object's surface, with the same radial coordinate 𝑟 r as the given point. Because the object is orbiting, this angle is directly related to the time when the object will hit the point. So let's find 𝜃 θ based on the above definition of the surface: 𝜃 = ± arccos ⁡ 𝑅 2 + 𝑟 2 − 𝑎 2 2 𝑟 𝑅 , 𝜃 ∈ [ − 𝜋 , 𝜋 ] θ=±arccos2rRR2+r2−a2,θ∈[−π,π] The ± ± sign comes from the inversion of cos ⁡ cos. This ± ± is useful, since it determines which half-circle is defined: positive or negative 𝜃 θ. The two halves can be combined to get a polar expression of the density 𝜌 ρ of the corresponding disk: 𝜌 ( 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) = { 1 if − ℎ ( 𝑟 ) < 𝜃 < ℎ ( 𝑟 ) 0 otherwise where ℎ ( 𝑟 ) = arccos ⁡ 𝑅 2 + 𝑟 2 − 𝑎 2 2 𝑟 𝑅 ρ(r,θ)={10if −h(r)<θ<h(r)otherwisewhere h(r)=arccos2rRR2+r2−a2 From this starting position, the disk is orbiting around the origin. This is equivalent to removing the time 𝑡 t times the speed 𝑣 v from the angle coordinate: 𝜌 ( t, 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) = { 1 if − ℎ ( 𝑟 ) < 𝜃 - v t < ℎ ( 𝑟 ) 0 otherwise ρ(t,r,θ)={10if −h(r)<θ- v t<h(r)otherwise We can separate 𝑡 t from the time interval 𝐼 I during which the object is present at a point ( 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) (r,θ): 𝜌 ( 𝑡 , 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) = { 1 if 𝑡 ∈ 𝐼 0 otherwise 𝐼 = [ 𝜃 − ℎ ( 𝑟 ) 𝑣 , 𝜃 + ℎ ( 𝑟 ) 𝑣 ] ρ(t,r,θ)={10if t∈IotherwiseI=[vθ−h(r),vθ+h(r)] The motion-blurred density is the integral of the density 𝜌 ρ over the current frame's time interval 𝐹 F. This works out to be the length of the intersection between 𝐼 I and 𝐹 F. This can also be described intuitively: we're measuring how much of the frame's time is occupied by the object at a given point in space. ∫ 𝐹 𝜌 ( 𝑡 , 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) 𝑑 𝑡 = ∫ 𝐹 ∩ 𝐼 1 𝑑 𝑡 = ∣ 𝐹 ∩ 𝐼 ∣ ∫Fρ(t,r,θ)dt=∫F∩I1 dt=∣F∩I∣ Let's apply a shutter function 𝑠 s. For simplicity, assume 𝑠 s is already centered on the current frame's time span. We can apply it by multiplying the density with 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) s(t) before integrating, replacing the need for any bounds of integration of the density. If 𝑠 s has an antiderivative 𝑆 S, then the motion-blurred density becomes: ∫ 𝜌 ( 𝑡 , 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑 𝑡 = ∫ 𝐼 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑 𝑡 = 𝑆 ( max ⁡ 𝐼 ) − 𝑆 ( min ⁡ 𝐼 ) ∫ρ(t,r,θ)s(t)dt=∫Is(t)dt=S(maxI)−S(minI) This can be implemented in a shader and works with any shutter function, however, based on the goals from the first part of this article, shutter functions should have an integral of 1 and should overlap in such a way that the sum of all shutter functions at any timepoint is always 1. This can be satisfied with a trapezoid function, or with a sinusoid function such as this one, used in the animation: 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) = { 1 − cos ⁡ ( 𝑡 − 𝐴 ) 2 𝜋 𝐵 − 𝐴 𝐵 − 𝐴 if 𝐴 < 𝑡 < 𝐵 0 otherwise 𝐴 = min ⁡ 𝐹 − ∣ 𝐹 ∣ 2 , 𝐵 = max ⁡ 𝐹 + ∣ 𝐹 ∣ 2 s(t)=⎩⎪⎨⎪⎧B−A1−cosB−A(t−A)2π0if A<t<BotherwiseA=minF−2∣F∣,B=maxF+2∣F∣ Motion-blurred torus The same process can be followed for the torus. A 2D vertical slice of a torus is called a spiric section, or Spiric of Perseus. Aside from sounding like an epic videogame weapon, it also has a convenient formulation in polar coordinates. Take a torus of minor radius 𝑎 a and major radius 𝑏 b. Take a section at position 𝑐 c, and within this section in polar coordinates ( 𝑟 , 𝜃 ) (r,θ), all torus points are defined by: ( 𝑟 2 − 𝑎 2 + 𝑏 2 + 𝑐 2 ) 2 = 4 𝑏 2 ( 𝑟 2 cos ⁡ 2 𝜃 + 𝑐 2 ) (r2−a2+b2+c2)2=4b2(r2cos2θ+c2) Solving for 𝜃 θ, assuming 𝜃 ∈ [ − 𝜋 / 2 , 𝜋 / 2 ] θ∈[−π/2,π/2], this becomes: 𝜃 = ± arccos ⁡ ( 𝑎 2 − 𝑏 2 − 𝑐 2 − 𝑟 2 − 2 𝑏 𝑐 ) ( 𝑎 2 − 𝑏 2 − 𝑐 2 − 𝑟 2 + 2 𝑏 𝑐 ) 2 𝑏 𝑟 θ=±arccos2br(a2−b2−c2−r2−2bc)(a2−b2−c2−r2+2bc) Once again, the inside of the torus is enclosed between the positive and negative cases of the ± ± sign, giving us a polar expression of the density of the solid torus. The remaining steps to get the motion-blurred rotating torus are exactly the same as for the sphere above. video motion blur: traditional with sine shutter minor radius: 0.2 major radius: 0.3 slice position: 0.1 rotation speed: 10 rad/s [source] [full] 6. Motion-blurred spiric section. Putting it together All that's left is to \"draw the rest of the owl\" by combining elements in a convincing way, and by using standard volume ray casting on the result. Surface normals need extra care because there's no such thing as \"motion-blurred surface normals\", so they're just blended together here. The animation should run below with basic mouse/touch interaction. It might not work well on all devices, so there's also a pre-rendered video at the top of the page. You can also find this shader on Shadertoy. [source] [full] Torusphere accelerator (live) According to some very subjective testing, the shutter function becomes useful when an object moves fast enough that the distance it covers in one frame is in the same order of magnitude as the width of the object itself. ↩ The multisampled (or distribution) method involves rendering the scene at multiple timepoints for every frame. High object speeds require proportionally high numbers of samples, so this technique is a poor fit for the intended \"infinite speed\" animation. Some examples: 1 2 3 ↩ Analytic ray-traced motion blur can be done in a few ways. For meshes, triangles can be turned into prisms. This method would require some work to apply here, but it might also have worked. Another approach is purely analytic: I believe I've found a way of applying it here, but it would be much heavier than the linear-motion sphere in the linked example. Both of these methods would still require multisampling for the material. ↩ [source] [history]",

Curiously, before the classic paper on modeling shutter efficiency [2] came out in 2005, all renderers used in VFX production used box shutters. I.e. the shutter opens instantly, stays open for the specified duration and then closes instantly. When you watch movies like \"Jurassic Park\" or \"The Mask\" and see scenes with extreme motion blur, that's PhotoRealistic RenderMan with a box shutter. The first in-the-wild 1:1 implementation of the parameterization in [2] was done in [3] in the same year the paper came out (hasn't changed until today). It was first used on \"Charlotte's Web\" (only the spider character done by Rising Sun Pictures has it as they used [3] for it). Pixar added it a few years later too and went a tad overboard with theirs in [4]. Most offline renderers nowadays have this feature and call it a \"shutter curve\". [1] O.

In real life, that causes the object to become sharp. So, you either need to track eye motion and blur according to relative motion, or do no motion blur at an infinite refresh rate. Neither is practical with todays's technology, so it's always going to look wrong. A good director or game designer will choose shutter rate or render blur according to how they expect the audience eyes to be moving. reply chaboud 5 hours agoparentHowever, the audience is used to shutter angle as part of the visual vernacular (e.g., narrow shutter angle for hyper edgy rap videos, long shutter angle for dreamy retro vibes). If rendered content can't speak the same visual language, a tool is missing, regardless of framerate (up to a point... At 400Hz, I'd be impressed by someone really seeing the difference).

This can be achieved through CRT/OLED scanout (often rolling) or LCD backlight strobing (usually full-frame by necessity). Unfortunately displaying each frame for a short time is unbearably flickery at 24 Hz (so movie projectors would show film frames 2-3 times), just barely tolerable at 50 (to the point some European CRT televisions frame-doubled 50 Hz video to 100 Hz, causing objects to appear doubled in motion), and ideally needs 70-75 Hz or above for optimally fluid motion and minimum eyestrain (which can't show 60 FPS recorded video without judder and/or tearing). reply Veedrac 5 hours agoparentprevYou can't properly make a moving image sharp at a finite refresh rate (though you can approach it for sufficiently high ones), because the object can only move in a temporally juddered path, which doesn't match the eye's movement. reply modeless 5 hours agoprevThe torus demo is really neat. I think it's interesting how high frame rate changes the perception of blur. I'm using a 240 Hz display and on figure 5 I can't see the discrete circles until around 12 rad/s. And even at 40 rad/s I can't see any difference between the traditional and sine shutter options (in motion). I highly recommend 240 Hz if only for the smoothness and low latency of mouse movements.

Re-reading it now, I think it should really have been 2 articles. I think I still like the first half, it's a reasonable dive into the detail of what motion blur is, or should be in theory. The second half is a slightly crazy, extremely condensed explanation of how the shader works for this particular \"torusphere\" animation based on motion blur. I find that part mainly useful because otherwise the code would be impenetrable at this point, at least to me. In retrospect the transition between the 2 parts feels a bit like jumping into a frozen lake, sorry about that! reply chaboud 5 hours agoparentI read through it and got the sense that it just jumped into one particularly odd special case bag of crazy after providing a clean explanation of motion blur as a function of shutter-angle (exposure window). I'm glad it wasn't just the glass of wine I finished. I've played with motion blur as a function of projection of 4D extrusions a few times, but the practical context (video, textures) ends up leaving it an impractical approach when compared to sampling in hardware with caching. This write up leaves me thinking \"maybe just one more time\". reply pierrec 4 hours agorootparentIf you're working with triangle meshes, I think the approach of extruding triangles into prisms looks promising. It allows drawing arbitrarily long trails with OK performance. Sadly it did not match the constraints of cramming the whole scene into a shader, hence the weirder volume-based techniques.

However the light emitted by the moving object should be lower than the static object.

Having hit the glass ceiling herself many times, Shirley set out to establish her own software enterprise for women, built by women. She and her employees pioneered the idea of women going back into the work force after a career break, and promoted flexible work methods, job sharing, profit-sharing, and company co-ownership. Born Vera Buchthal in 1933 in Dortmund, Germany, she fled Nazi Europe through the Kindertransport rescue effort orchestrated before the start of WWII. She lived with foster parents in Sutton Coldfield, England, and attended Oswestry Girls’ High School. Unfortunately, her school did not teach mathematics, so she took classes at the local boys’ school. Attend COMPSAC, the IEEE Computer Society’s signature Conference on Computers, Software and Applications. Later in life, she founded a work-from-home contract programming company in 1962 exclusively for women called “Freelance Programmers” that eventually employed over 8,500 people. The company grew rapidly and went public in 1996. Ultimately, her company was valued at $3 billion, making millionaires of 70 of her team members.

(Photo credit: steveshirley.com) Shirley’s company was responsible for programming the black box for the supersonic Concorde. She and her employees were also instrumental in helping develop software standards, management control protocols, and other standards that were eventually adopted by NATO. But building a huge corporation in post-war Britain came with its own unique challenges. Marie Hicks, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, interviewed Shirley for a 2018 article on behalf of the Computer History Museum. She explored Shirley’s early life, influences, flair for math, business acumen, and ambition. A shorter version of the interview, edited by Dag Spicer of the Computer History Museum, appears in the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. The original transcript with Hicks’ full interview may be accessed here. Here are some of the more thought-provoking quotes from that interview: How she started a company for women, how she escaped the Nazis, how she got her first job, how she began her career, how she soldiered through discrimination, and how she donated a fortune to autism research while raising an autistic son. Like what you’re reading? Explore our collection of magazines and journals, including IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. How Dame Stephanie Shirley started a company just for women Dame Stephanie Shirley with Queen Elizabeth. “My business was very special. It was a woman’s company in the computer industry; 297 of the first 300 staff were all women. “It was really a female-friendly organization. It was set up as a crusade rather than to make money, and indeed it took a long time before it did make any money, and I was very proud eventually when it succeeded that I’d set up this special women’s company. Again, another first, I thought, because I have to justify my existence.” On escaping the Nazis “It is as strong today as it was 75 years ago, when, as a traumatized, weeping five-year-old, I was put on a train and sent to a strange country with strange languages, strange people, strange parents, strange food. It would’ve been disastrous, I think, had I not been with my older sister, a nine-year-old who was really not ready yet to care for a younger sibling,” Shirley said. “But what that two-and-a-half-day transition between Vienna and the Liverpool Street Station in London did for me was it made me able to cope with change, and I think that’s relevant to my technical career.” Check out our online resources for women in computing. On forging her career “A lodger that my mother had knew somebody who knew somebody who worked at the Post Office Research Station, and I had a similar introduction to another corporation and had interviews at both. “The first one, General Electric Company, was fine and so on, but they were not terribly interested in me, in my future, in my continuing training and education, and so although they offered me a job, I went with the Post Office because they clearly were interested in ongoing education.” TED Talk: Stephanie Shirley answers the question: “Why do ambitious women have flat heads?” On changing her name from “Stephanie” to “Steve” Derek and Stephanie Shirley at their wedding. (Photo credit: steveshirley.com) “I had already launched my own business when I began to become professional. Not just relying on introductions but actually going out and marketing and getting new business, and in a very naive way I was writing literally dozens of letters, introducing my company’s services, and getting absolutely no reply whatsoever. “It was my dear husband of now 50 years who actually suggested, ‘Well, perhaps it’s the name.’ I was writing with this double feminine, Stephanie Shirley, Shirley being my marital name. He asked, ‘Why don’t you use the family nickname of Steve?’ so I wrote exactly the same letters as Steve Shirley, and I began to get some replies.” Dame Stephanie Shirley with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. On employing gays and lesbians “When the company was small, we knew a lot about each other’s families. I knew which child had gotten measles. When it came to gay and lesbian people, we might’ve guessed. It probably wouldn’t have been something that we talked about. It wasn’t relevant to our mobility, which was something that we were always very interested in. It’s clear that we did attract many lesbian staff; we employed thousands of people over the years, of course.” On how the private sector gave women more opportunities “Nobody could say I couldn’t do this if the rule book said that I could. In my generation of women, there were many things you couldn’t do. One college that I attended part-time didn’t have washroom facilities for women. Shirley was one of two non-engineers who worked on ERNIE, a new breed of random-number machine. The head of the project was Tommy Flowers of “Colossus” fame. (Photo credit: steveshirley.com). “My job actually would’ve entailed me going onto a cable laying ship [a deep-sea vessel designed to lay underwater cables for telecommunications or electric power transmission] and I couldn’t do that. Women just did not go on working ships. I couldn’t work on the stock exchange. “I could write software for the London Stock Exchange, but I couldn’t actually work there myself. Couldn’t drive a bus, couldn’t fly an airplane. These were legislative things, and the public sector was very firm on things like that….” Shirley’s life after retirement Since retiring, Shirley has spent her time supporting various IT-related causes and, most recently, organizations researching and providing services to those with autism. Her interest in autism has personal roots. “I’ve moved to a certain extent away from computing and become really a manager, a businesswoman, and later with the need to care for my learning disabled, autistic son, into really a career, and then a philanthropist. That’s now what I do. I try to give money away in a wise way,” says Shirley. On what she chose as her philanthropy “Autism is a strange disorder. It’s known to be genetic, but we don’t really know very much about it. What we do know is that it’s difficult to deal with, and difficult for the people with autism. Stephanie Shirley and her only son, Giles. She became a philanthropist for autism because he was diagnosed with the condition. (Photo credit: steveshirley.com) I’ve set up several charities in the autistic field and so my experience is through them. “A child that is dashing about in all directions could today be wearing a Fitbit bracelet to see what’s going on there. They could well be monitored how they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping and so on. They could be using fingerprints as access keys, because child protection is very important with these very, very vulnerable pupils. Many of them are using iPads to communicate. “Back in 1982—I remember the year because it was the International Year of Disabled People—I was starting to talk about using computers as a communication aid, as distinct from process control or calculations, to help the blind to see, the deaf to hear. Communication is vitally important for people with autism, so there’s a whole host of things.” Shirley’s short film in a Google series on the early days of computing Produced by Google as part of a series of short films highlighting women’s involvement in the early days of computing, “Freelance Programmer: the story of Dame Stephanie Shirley” features Shirley’s inspirational story in her own words.

Their boss was unhappy with the woman's performance, because she took much longer to do the same work as the man. Then, one day, the woman suddenly worked much faster and everything went much easier. At the same time, the man had a much harder time and customers were weirdly stubborn and obstructive. Turns out they were accidentally mailing under each other's name: the woman used the man's name, making customers much more willing to accept her expertise, while the man used the woman's name, making customers question everything he said. There's a lot of that kind of subtle sexism in our society that goes way deeper than mere equal rights. How can you possibly control customers taking you seriously or not based on your name?

This question reminds me of the way mean, median and mode are all different versions of equal. It seems to me that 'equal' is a mixed bag. While it may be true that men may feel that they need to ask more questions of a woman to get an answer they are happy with, men are also generally friendlier to women - men can't bat their eyelashes and get let off a speeding ticket, for example. I'm personally not a fan of sexless equal treatment, because there really are general, stereotypical differences between the sexes. And I'm ok with that. I don't plan on getting in a fight with reality. What I'm not ok with is the idea getting into that fight - of trying to make the world convert to my view of 'equal'. I don't have such a handle on truth that I see myself as some sort of arbitrator of morality - I don't think it is my place to force a morality 'upgrade' on others. And I don't know of anyone or anything else who could force such an upgrade. I'm ok with deciding for myself what is right and wrong. PS From the article, one is linked to an article by Marie Hicks. This is her bio: https://marhicks.com/blog/ > On the last day of Black History Month, and the eve of Women’s History Month, I wanted to take some time to tell you about Professor Halcyon Lawrence, who is a part of both of these histories. She was a brilliant, kind, pathbreaking, and warm colleague, and she died suddenly in late October 2023. > I’m a professor of data science who focuses on history of technology and the intersection of computing & labor. My award-winning first book, Programmed Inequality (MIT Press 2017), investigated how the declining proportion of women helped wreck Britain’s early lead in computing, and why this holds important lessons for the today. My current co-edited book, Your Computer Is On Fire, explores how we can understand and solve the current tech crises we’re living through. > I’m always up for talking about technology and its socioeconomic effects: send me e-mail, or follow me at @histoftech on twitter.

The fact that there are cases where women can benefit from this inequality doesn't change the root issue: that a lot of men still don't take women seriously in various ways. But especially having your professionality and expertise questioned constantly in the work you do every day must be extremely tiring and potentially harmful to your career. Does getting out of the occasional traffic ticket really make up for that? reply felsokning 0 minutes agorootparentI'm confused: Did your anecdote transition from `customers` to `men` somewhere within itself? pompino 11 minutes agorootparentprevIt is not a serious argument when you malign the character of half the worlds population by extrapolating one anecdote. reply verisimi 58 minutes agorootparentprevYou're missing the point of what I'm saying I think. The idea of 'equal' is a false one because things aren't equal, can never be equal. It sounds good to say 'equal' but its just not the way humans are. Neither men nor women are perfect. No individual is perfect. Now you can force and harass people to do this or that.. but what you are doing is making everyone unhappy - people will be unable to act naturally and will never never be themselves. I personally think it is better to to let individuals be natural and a/ allow making of mistakes and b/ allowing for the opportunity of learning from those mistakes. The idea that there is some known perfect state 'equal' is a nonsense - no one knows what this is - we are not gods in fact. Forcing others to adopt such an idea is certainly wrong though - we can say that much. Manipulating others, indoctrinating them will surely make people unhappy - men and women - for who can say what is right for others? reply nerevariine 31 minutes agoparentprevnext [5 more] [flagged] mcv 9 minutes agorootparentThey do worse because they're constantly questioned.

Computer assembly languages are not conceptually complex in the same way that higher level math is. The difficulty of assembly comes from its relative obscurity, the proliferation of instructions and architecture variants, and the process of analyzing a problem into the required steps. These are things that can be overcome with patience and reference manuals. At its heart, assembly instructions are doing simple things. At the risk of an analogy, I would describe assembly programming as memory-intensive, and math as compute-intensive. reply jojobas 5 hours agorootparentprevJust having learned maths or physics doesn't magically make you able to code, let alone blindfold-code. reply basilgohar 5 hours agorootparentCode is math.

[1] Meaning non-standard in this case, Joplin is the only software using Joplin's storage method reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentIt's \"just\" a SQLite database, I wrote a small Python script to extract my Joplin notes to a static site: https://gitlab.com/stavros/notes/ reply theshrike79 2 hours agorootparentOn the other hand Obsidian markdown with front-matter can be fed pretty much directly to a static site generator. Sqlite does give some speed improvements and makes searching easier. reply anonzzzies 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s SQLite; arguable the format most fast custom storage format requiring software (games notably) should use instead of rolling their own. reply moneywoes 15 hours agorootparentprevis there anything with a lightweight learning curve akin to Obsidian that uses a accessible format? reply theshrike79 14 hours agorootparentAny text editor with markdown support should work. Just VS Code with a Markdown viewer is a decent replacement. You don't _need_ all of the fancy plugins that Obsidian has, but some of them are genuinely useful. reply rubymamis 16 hours agoparentprevThat’s exactly why I’m building a note-taking app in Qt C++ and QML that is vastly more performant than other note-taking apps[1]. This degradation of software by web apps shows in the lack of optimal resource utilization of even one of the most powerful chips of recent times. [1] https://www.get-plume.com/ reply neuromanser 1 hour agorootparentScrolling in the webpage crashed my browser (Firefox, ios). reply bleomycin 15 hours agorootparentprevPlume looks very interesting! One place I personally find many apps in this category fall down is their ability to handle pdf’s embedded or attached within notes gracefully. This applies to desktop and mobile apps. This may be a slightly weird use case but I accumulate tons of pdf’s that are often relevant to my notes and want them easily embedded and viewable in a first class way. Obsidian is a great example of how not to handle a pdf locking it to a small portion of the window and not allowing it to be full screened. Forcing the user to dump all of their pdf’s into something like google drive locked away from the rest of their notes is a crappy experience and h fortunately keeps me using apps like evernote purely for this functionality. reply fiforpg 14 hours agorootparentIf you need pdf viewing and management (indexing, annotations, citations), it might be useful to look into citation managers, which are built to do exactly these things: check out Zotero. reply rubymamis 14 hours agorootparentprevThanks! Hmm, I've seen many open-source Qt apps integrate PDF support, so I guess I can study them. I'm adding this to the to-do list. How do you usually add a PDF to your notes? Drag and drop? What's the ideal way you look to interact with it? You said no full-screen, so what it does look like? reply limandoc 12 hours agorootparentprevI am working on a knowledge structuring tool as well; will silent release soon: limandoc.com You can put all your documents/PDFs there and structure them as you wish. And it will be syncing locally only! reply wkat4242 15 hours agorootparentprevNice that's exactly what I'm looking for, as I use KDE and Qt apps fit in so well. Will the client side be open source? I hope so because I'm on FreeBSD so you probably won't make a compiled version :) reply rubymamis 14 hours agorootparentPlume is actually based on my open source note-taking app Notes[1]. You can already get it on Flathub, Snap Store etc. Notes uses just a simple plain text editor while Plume has a completely revamped block editor that I built from scratch. That parts of Notes used in Plume will remain open source (per the MPL license) but the rest of the code will be closed source. At least for the time being. [1] https://github.com/nuttyartist/notes reply vunderba 10 hours agorootparentI don't mind using a closed source solution - but only if I can keep my notes separated from the application itself. Makes it easy for me to back up my notes and to use versioning tools like git. It also allows me to use bash to manipulate my notes independently of the application at any given time. Plume seems very pretty - good job on that, but.... \"All notes in Plume are simple plaintext strings under the hood. Right now, all these plaintext strings are stored in a SQLite database locally on your computer. But we have plans to remove the reliance on a custom database and to store all notes as simple .txt files inside a folder.\" I've been burned too many times by organizational tools that like to keep your notes internally stored within their systems. reply rubymamis 5 hours agorootparentGotcha, no worries, I'm 100% going to migrate the database to a simple arbitrary folder with .md/.txt files. I also want that for myself. It will take a few months of work after the initial release, tho. reply wkat4242 3 hours agorootparentprevA SQLite database is not really proprietary though. It's easy to work with. And perhaps there is an export function too in case you want to move. reply wkat4242 14 hours agorootparentprevAh too bad, I do need a rich text notes app (and no markdown, I hate markdown, under the hood it's fine but I don't want to deal with it :) ). Also hate kanban and agile methodology by the way ;) Luckily I'm not a dev otherwise I would have to work with all of those lol. But perhaps you could do the monetisation via the sync service only and make the app open source :) That would be great, at least for me so I could compile it on FreeBSD. Some others do this, like Obsidian, for which there's an actual BSD port. But it's electron, sadly. But I understand... It's a tiny niche. I'll keep looking. Of course I can't use flatpak and snap. And I can't stand snaps so no way I'd use that. Flatpaks are a bit better but not working on BSD. I really used to love tomboy. It was fast, rich text, would automatically hyperlink notes together as you typed, it was so great. But they stopped development on it. There were a few reboots but they were complete rewrites and lacked all the speed and smoothness I loved. reply rubymamis 14 hours agorootparentIs it a deal breaker for you that the app isn't open source? What if I create binaries for FreeBSD/your distro and there's no telemetry/option to disable connecting to the internet (even for updates)? reply wkat4242 13 hours agorootparentThat would work perfectly yes! It's not the internet connection that bothers me (in fact I'd probably use the sync). But usually developers don't care enough about the tiny userbase of FreeBSD to even consider that. If you would do that, I would really like it, though I can imagine that from a time/gains perspective there is no point. Which I do totally understand. One thing I like is that your monthly fee is very reasonable. Obsidian costs double the price of my entire Microsoft 365 subscription :) Besides it being electron that's another issue for me. Especially because it's just not really that great. reply rubymamis 12 hours agorootparentThat's awesome to hear, then. I'll see what I can do (: reply coldblues 14 hours agorootparentprevI support your app so much I would pay a monthly fee instead of a one-time purchase. My notes are as valuable as my life. I don't mind the app being proprietary if it gets the love it deserves. If you can accomplish the goals you set out, like providing good functionality and performance, then I'm cheering you on. My needs are very basic, just the minimum to accomplish Zettelkasten. reply rubymamis 12 hours agorootparentThat's nice to hear. Same here, I have thousands of notes, it's my second brain. Sign up for the waitlist, I'd love you to try Plume when it's out. reply tvshtr 14 hours agorootparentprevThere's Qownnote too, it's really nice and open source. reply wkat4242 13 hours agorootparentOh yeah good point. I never checked that one out because I don't really use owncloud but it's worth a look. reply moneywoes 15 hours agorootparentprevwill the mobile all be fast as well? my issue is i can’t find a platform with a fast mobile app it seems they’re all react native reply rubymamis 15 hours agorootparentI didn't yet try to create a mobile version, but I don't see why, as Qt Quick is very performant. I guess we'll have to wait till I port it and do some testing. reply ukuina 16 hours agorootparentprevPlume looks neat! What is the pricing model you have in mind? reply rubymamis 16 hours agorootparentThanks! It will be a subscription model. $25 paid yearly or $3 monthly (that’s the idea for now). reply ToucanLoucan 15 hours agorootparentprev> This degradation of software by web apps shows the lack of optimal resource utilization of even one of the most powerful chips of recent times. A-fucking-men. Web tools are for building web apps, software tools are for building software. I avoid all these goddamn electron things like the plague if at all fucking possible. Garbage on phones, garbage on computers, garbage on tablets. Garbage. reply rubymamis 14 hours agorootparentIt's unfortunately very hard to avoid them. But indeed, on macOS, I try to find only native or native-like apps for my needs. It's the difference between a healthy diet and junk food for my computer. reply vunderba 14 hours agoparentprevyeah, it goes to show you that Electron based apps can be done in a reasonably performant way but it does require extra care/attention as Obsidian is an electron app as well. I have about 13,000 notes (with embedded media PNGs, MP4s, etc) across 50 folders/subfolders on my Mac M1 and searching across all notes in Obsidian is for all intents and purposes instantaneous (less than a second). reply lbotos 12 hours agoparentprevJoplin released an ARM build a few months back -- so if you were using the pre-arm build it was bad, so just throwing this out there for folks who maybe had similar experiences -- make sure you are using the arm build (it should happen automatically now) Disclaimer: I've contributed to Joplin in the past, and I use it dozens of times a day with no big speed complaints. reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentI use it on Linux and it's always really snappy and a pleasure to use. reply Liquix 15 hours agoparentprevDoes Obsidian feature a way to seamlessly sync between devices that doesn't rely on a propreitary service or external tool (Syncthing)? reply tmoravec 15 hours agorootparentI sync Obsidian with iCloud Drive and it's been 100% reliable and very fast so far (a few months). reply SteeCee 15 hours agorootparentprevObsidian has a built in sync feature if you pay for it. https://obsidian.md/sync reply refactorguy 14 hours agorootparentEvery time I see a post about a note-taking app, Obsidian is mentioned in the comments.

At this point I'm not even surprised anymore, especially when conversations always end with a mention of Obsidian Sync. reply bccdee 14 hours agorootparentIt's the biggest & most popular app in the note-taking space. It's closed-source, which I don't love, and I've tried to look for alternatives, but there just isn't anything else that's as good as Obsidian. In a situation like that, you don't need to pay people to talk about your product. People will evangelize it on their own. reply adhamsalama 13 hours agorootparentTry SiYuan Note. reply grantc 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's because there are two ways to sync content across devices, paid sync through Obsidian vs. git. Given sync is a p0 feature, it seems logical that both get mentioned when the question arises. Also, the app's really good, and I pay for Sync -- git works well, but it's a bit clumsier on iOS.

If you have thousands of notes in a folder ~/my_notes ~/my_notes/work ~/my_notes/music etc. Joplin takes them and stores the notes internally as a SQLite table with UUID named markdown files. It makes it very difficult to use bash tools, finding them, other IDEs, etc to work with your files after Joplin has ingested them. Compare this to apps like VS Code / Obsidian / Logseq (also open source) which don't mess with your markdown file organization. You can just point them to a root folder and they'll work natively with your markdown files. Furthermore, embedded media are also renamed to GUID.ext files and then are stored in ~/.config/joplin-desktop/resources which is terrible since now are notes are split from their related media. reply suprjami 13 hours agoparentThis is the reason I don't use Joplin either. Obsidian can handle an existing file structure. I use Vim and folder sync to Nextcloud. reply ilian 2 hours agoparentprevYou can try TagSpaces as well, it works also directly with your file system and do not use a database. reply rubymamis 12 hours agoparentprevWhere do you expect embedded media to be stored? For example, if I have the following note: ~/my_notes/art/renaissance.txt do you expect images in that note to be stored in ~/my_notes/art or in ~/my_notes/media, or something else? reply vunderba 10 hours agorootparentI don't use Joplin for the aforementioned reasons earlier, but they should at least let you customize the \"media folder\". The embedded media is already referenced using relatively standard markdown syntax in a respective MD note, e.g.: ![image info](./pictures/image.png) Since apps such as Logseq and Obsidian work with your existing notes, they avoid this issue of massive file duplication and don't need to move the files at all. EDIT: I just realized if you're talking about adding media onto a note through the notetaking application itself, take a look at what Typora does as a good example of how to handle it. It auto-creates a relative folder called \"note_name.assets\" and moves them to it. Obsidian OTOH lets you specify a \"media\" folder that exists for each subdirectory of your existing note structure. reply rubymamis 5 hours agorootparentThanks for all the info! reply herrherrmann 12 hours agorootparentprevIn Obsidian, for example, you can choose where your media data is stored (and there are options to store them alongside the Markdown files, e.g. in a hidden folder). I guess OP’s point is that this would be a better way, or at least to store media in the same root folder as notes and not some arbitrary folder far away from the notes. reply devsda 17 hours agoprevJoplin works well for what it does and is good enough for regular note-taking. Has most features like live view, webclipper, sync & plugins for that extra missing functionality. What you don't get is a \"polished\" UI with a WYSIWYG editor. The storage format is markdown, but it has its own way of organizing files[1]. If your notetaking process includes multiple editors(other than joplin apps) then joplin may not be the best choice. [1]. https://joplinapp.org/help/faq/#is-it-possible-to-use-real-f... reply yborg 14 hours agoparentJoplin has a WYSIWYG editor mode. https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/rich_text_editor Joplin also can use external editors. https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/external_text_editor reply devsda 12 hours agorootparentSure there's the rich text editor but it has limitations and you lose the functionality of some plugins. The rich text editor mode had bugs the last time I tried it. By external editor I mean editing the markdown files directly without opening joplin app first. There can be many reasons to do that like editing in a terminal or auto generate/manipulate notes using a tool. We can still do it of required but we need to be careful not to touch the Joplin metadata. PS: I use Joplin regularly. These are not complaints about Joplin, but just an fyi to help someone make an informed decision before they switch. reply moralestapia 16 hours agoparentprevI came to the comments to find some insight about the format it stores notes on, so thanks.

(I love iA Writer, but it’s not as good as it could be on Android.) I think the sync server is Joplin’s secret weapon on this front.

I've got thousands of PDF notes going back decades, and the ability to search on their OCR has kept me on Evernote for years. But the latest Joplin includes OCR out of the box, and Obsidian has the Omnisearch/Text Extractor plugins to add it. Both of those use Tesseract to do OCR locally. I've got it working on Joplin fairly well. But it hardly works at all on Obsidian. That's unfortunate because Obsidian seems to be a much more user friendly and responsive app over all. Since I need the OCR search capability so badly though, I'm about to settle for Joplin. That's not a terrible fate, but the grass seems greener on the Obsidian side. I wish I could replace Tesseract with some industrial strength OCR though. reply pqs 3 hours agoparentEvernote works well now.

(on x platform, Windows/iOS use case here, but just post your needs) I tried to move to Obsidian from Evernote after they raised the subscription price but wasn't able to onboard successfully - Obsidian seemed powerful but was too customizable for me, had to get back to more pressing day job needs before I could figure out a setup that would work for me, ended up just paying the Evernote fee another year. reply tmoravec 15 hours agoparentI was suffering with Joplin for years and finally found the time to migrate to Obsidian a few months back. So far I'm much happier and more importantly, more productive. The biggest points are about the UX. My workflow requires switching between multiple notes rapidly (e.g., TODO list, Project 1, Project 2, Employee 1, Employee 2, Meeting Notes 1, and so on) and Joplin doesn't have native tabs. The plugin is only so so but it works only on desktop (I'm on Mac). On mobile it's a disaster. Doubly so on iPad which is just stretched phone version - working productively on iPad (which is otherwise just fine for my job) is impossible with Joplin. Plus the mobile app has awful design and awful navigation. Who on Earth would put the most used button to the top left corner? Swipe from the left doesn't work of course because the following: Neither desktop of mobile app follow the system patterns. Keyboard shortucts, if they exist, are different. Navigation is different. Everything is sort of clunky. I used Dropbox for sync and while it does work, it's very slow and there's no background sync. On a regular day I have to sync about 50 items (some of them are history I guess) which can take a minute or two, which is the time I don't have when I open my phone and want to quickly add an item to the TODO list. Couple that with no conflict resolution and a recipe for data loss is born :-) . Initial sync on a new phone took me eight fucking hours when I had to keep the phone open and the app in the foreground. What I do appreciate is the native encryption. Now I do all my work in Obsidian but keep Joplin for the secrets. So this is the main problems I had with Joplin. Rant over (but you asked) :-) reply dstorm1 14 hours agorootparentThe mobile design does leave a lot to be desired. It does fit my needs however because usually I am just jotting down a quick idea or reference for later. I can see how switching between multiple notes quickly can be difficult. Not related to the parent comment but I have been using the math plugin and I love it. It does unit conversion and lots of other things! reply theshrike79 14 hours agoparentprevI tried both, my Joplin experience is a few years ago so grain of salt and all. Joplin is open source, doesn't really have a plugin ecosystem, has a custom storage format for its data and is _really_ easy and reliable to sync with WebDav (I had mine set up with Fastmail's webdav while sipping my morning coffee) Obsidian (my current system for going on 2 years) on the other hand is the closest I've gotten to org-mode with a modern tool, with all the pluses and minuses. The plugin ecosystem is completely crazy, you can find a plugin for pretty much everything. And you'll lose days of actual work progress bikeshedding the plugin system =) Data is stored as regular standard files (Canvases are the exception, but there really isn't a standard for stuff like that). Syncing with third party tools is ... workable if you don't switch platforms quickly - basically if you make a note on your phone and immediately switch to desktop, the note might appear or might not, depends on the phase of the moon. iCloud takes a while to sync and sometimes just freezes, works fine if you let it work. Dropbox, OneDrive etc aren't officially supported and tend to have conflicts. I actually ended up paying for their sync service and it Just Works - even though it's not the cheapest option, but _for_me_ it's worth it because I regularly use multiple devices in short succession on the same notes. reply cypherpunks01 17 hours agoprevMy only concerns about using Joplin were security-related, when handling sensitive notes (financial data, logins, etc). The interface looked awesome. Have Joplin plugins been secured/sandboxed yet, or are they still able to exfiltrate data? That's one reason I never used it for very secure notes, same with Obsidian. Joplin also used to store notes unencrypted locally, not sure if that's still the case. Of course most people don't mind, but I was investigating the highest-security note tool I could find at the time. reply Groxx 16 hours agoparentIt absolutely boggles my mind that anyone releases a plug-in system without sandboxing nowadays. reply carlhjerpe 15 hours agorootparentEngineering effort reply Groxx 15 hours agorootparentWhich should be left at zero unless you can get over the \"you actually do have a responsibility to take basic safety measures for your users\" hurdle.

I wish it was possible to have WYSIWYG in the terminal, but that seems to be an impossible task (rows of text all being the same size is baked into the terminal ecosystem). Having a GUI WYSIWYG with vim bindings is probably pretty doable, but the lack of terminal ecosystem has discouraged me from looking into this (even though it is not that important, but I am a perfectionist). reply ck45 17 hours agoprevPast thread (2021): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27520906 reply SergeAx 3 hours agoprevI migrated from Evernote to Joplin and didn't lost most of the features.

    "commentBody": "Google's SRE Book (2017) (sre.google)168 points by udev4096 22 hours agohidepastfavorite78 comments dijit 17 hours agoWhat I found most fascinating is that Google essentially rediscovered what is important in a sysadmin and codified the contract between feature developers and reliability roles. Instead of having feature developers feeling like they have no say in operational requirements, and instead of having reliability staff fighting unstable mess: properly making the contract means everyone gets heard. Contrasted to devops which despite coming out later was in vogue when this book came out; which caused the muddying of the role of sysadmin to meaning either: * a sysadmin practicing agile (the original definition btw) * a software engineer with enough OS skills to carry the pager (the popular one), or * a team consisting of sysadmins and software developers with no barrier between them (10+ deploys per day style). Everyone had their own definition of DevOps. So when SRE came clear: sysadmins are needed, stop trying to push everything into one person, heres how we fix the tension between teams: it was a breath of fresh air. The only revisionist history (that even google seems to forget) is that sysadmins could indeed write code, though it wasnt pretty and didnt have the nice things like mocks and tests. This has changed a little since 2010 at least but it is still dire, even with Cloud making things much easier. *EDIT:* I've gone from +4 to 0 points in a very, very rapid amount of time. If I have offended you; how? reply ranger207 15 hours agoparentSysadmin originally meant Unix greybeards who were competent at C and could write and implement, say, Kerberos. Then in the 90s-2000s the term came to primarily refer to Windows admins clicking around Active Directory and Group Policy for large enterprises. The \"sysadmins can't code\" thing came grom that time and the early 2010s when all the cool startups were building on Linux and the available pool of sysadmins were largely Windows specialists. Then DevOps came along trying to get Windows sysadmins that were dabbling in Linux into modern development practices, and SRE came along trying to revitalise the old Unix greybeard style with modern software development practices. reply alexey-salmin 13 hours agoparentprev* SRE are sysadmins with Go * DevOps are sysadmins with Python * Sysadmins are sysadmins with Perl (stolen from twitter, can't find the source) reply jimbokun 12 hours agorootparentI’m a software engineer that also does operations work. But I really love Go for operations type tasks. Simple, direct, code that’s not too verbose, with predictable performance, and fast compilation to a single executable.

I would never describe myself, a SRE-SE, as a sysadmin because I would be describing someone whose primary job is to operate software and iterate on configuration. SRE-SEs on the other hand are SWEs, they just have a focus in systems adjacent software whereas a SRE-SWE is someone who can dig into compiler level issues and optimization. Both write application code, do analysis, and write policy. A sysadmin of today would be out of place on a team like that. reply jupp0r 16 hours agoparentprevI don't think that's how the SRE role is described in the book. It shifts the boundaries between sysadmins and developers to give developers much more freedoms in deciding the operational parameters of how their softwane is run/released but also gives SREs the ability to push back if they get handed over some piece of software that's not sufficiently following recommended patterns that make actually operating it mostly automated. reply dijit 16 hours agorootparentThat's exactly right. Can you please point to the part of my comment that you think disagrees with this? reply jupp0r 11 hours agorootparentI think I might have misclicked and responded to a different comment than I intended to. You were basically saying the same thing :) reply arccy 15 hours agoparentprevi would think most people object to calling SREs sysadmins. reply ozr 14 hours agorootparentAs someone that has had those titles for many years in the past: I'm only going to object to the one that's paying less at the time. A good sysadmin was always doing the same thing as a good SRE. reply dilyevsky 15 hours agorootparentprevthere's a sort of bifurcation of SRE responsibilities with one branch focusing on software-enabled automation and the other on \"systems engineering\" aka sysadmin. Both are called SREs at Google which seems to cause widespread confusion externally (and even within Google). Also see so called \"Ben Treynor Curve\"[0] [0] - https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_jun... reply lrem 13 hours agorootparentWithin Google: Treynor’s curve is a hiring concept. Once in, you’re doing literally the same job. Being in a team doing greenfield development it took me three years to notice that my TL, with whom we’ve been defining the mathematical model, designing and implementing the system, is on the SysEng ladder. reply dijit 15 hours agorootparentprevthats unfortunate, I think that means they arent aware that the job of SRE is functionally identical to a sysadmin from 2005 in terms of responsibilities and required knowledge. We just live on a higher level of abstraction and have better tools & processes now. reply rvnx 15 hours agorootparentCompared to 2005, we live in a society where a lot of people are very sensitive to words. For example, \"developer\" is considered offensive, because for some people it's very important to be called \"software engineer\". Really good developers don't care about titles. They don't have time to worry about such, or they have so much money / experience that even if you call them \"smart monkeys\" they'll be happy with it. Same goes with sysadmins, SREs, devops, or whatever role you choose. For some people they have shitty jobs: they don't have such recognition (whether for a good reason or not). No recognition from work, no recognition from colleagues, no recognition financially, etc, that, if you remove them the title / prestige, obviously they would feel bad. Source: my experience in a school calling itself \"engineering school\", and all other schools calling it a \"place where to pee code\" reply darksim905 2 hours agorootparentAs someone who always knew I didn't really need to know code for what I wanted to do, I'd posit that a developer comes across as someone who may not be formally trained. Maybe they're a hacker, maybe they know a language or two and dabble. A software engineering is someone who is comfortable at various levels and understanding machine level code in so far as also being comfortable with software patterns. -shrug-. That's what I feel like in my org at least. reply dataflow 12 hours agorootparentprev> Really good developers don't care about titles. They don't have time to worry about such, or they have so much money / experience that even if you call them \"smart monkeys\" they'll be happy with it. That's about the money, not about being good at your work. Ask anyone on the street if you can call them a rat in exchange for a million dollar salary and they'll say yes. It's quite simple. reply achiang 13 hours agorootparentprevI was a sysadmin (at uni, in the early 2000s) and I am an SRE today (at Google). The two jobs are nothing alike, at all, whatsoever. Sysadmins are support roles. Their functional role is to provide a healthy substrate to run the application layer on top of. SREs work at the application layer itself. If the system can't scale due to internal architecture, an SRE would be expected to propose a new, scalable design. That would be in addition to maintaining the substrate. To be clear, there is also nothing inferior about performing a support role. No org can succeed without support. But the two roles are not the same, and if a job's set of responsibilities don't include shared ownership over application layer architecture, then it can be a great job but it's not an SRE role. reply joshuamorton 9 hours agorootparentprevThis seems unlikely to me solely from a growth perspective. That is, it is possible to reach \"Principal\" or \"Distinguished\" SRE as an IC, the equivalent of a director (or similarly: SRE Director). I don't recall companies having, or desiring to have large organizations of sysadmins. I think one of the key differences to highlight is that usually SREs are engaged early in the design process of new features, and are often driving their own feature changes to the product for reliability or scalability reasons. Those aren't responsibilities or expectations that I've really ever seen in the context of a sysadmin. reply throwaway5752 14 hours agorootparentprevThis might be an age-related perception. I think if you're over 40, you'd consider this complementary to SREs. The role of sysadmin, as it existed in 2000, is almost unimaginable now. reply doctor_eval 7 hours agoparentprevI think you’re right, but I want to relate a story where the agile team leader decided that devops meant “developer operations”, or in other words the development team. Sometimes all you can do is shake your head. reply habitue 14 hours agoprevThe SRE book is a little more advertisement of Google's internal systems than real actionable advice outside of Google for SREs. There is some generally useful stuff in there, but it probably fits in a few pages vs a full book. reply pquki4 11 hours agoparentOnly a few paragraphs into the book: > One continual challenge Google faces is hiring SREs: not only does SRE compete for the same candidates as the product development hiring pipeline, but the fact that we set the hiring bar so high in terms of both coding and system engineering skills means that our hiring pool is necessarily small. I was thinking, ok so does this mean the book is completely useless for most companies in the world, since they don't have such standards for hiring people or run DevOps this way? How much of the rest of the book is still applicable? reply waynesonfire 2 hours agorootparentMost SWEs are SREs, they just don't realize it.

Thanks people at Google for writing and open sourcing it. reply hrpnk 16 hours agoparentThe important bit to remember when reading is to understand the origin (why) of the concepts. I've seen Engineers being too dogmatic about the book, saying that \"Google does it this way\" and not being able to apply the concepts to one's own organizational context. Even at Google, there will be different teams who will deviate from the \"described process\" given their business context, setup, or stakeholders. reply jeffbee 16 hours agorootparent> Even at Google, there will be different teams who will deviate from the \"described process\" given their business context, setup, or stakeholders. Seriously. A lot of the book was influenced by Social SRE who had opinions all out of proportion to their own importance and success. At the time, there was some doubt about whether Social's pet theories belonged in the book, considering the varying practices and beliefs of other SRE groups supporting products that people actually use. This is related to my rule that anybody can title their doc \"Best Practices\" even if nobody subscribes to them. reply brandall10 15 hours agorootparentCan you please expound on what Social SRE is?

Is it still a useful read? reply oooyay 17 hours agoparentYeah, it is, but there's also a lot more to being a SRE than this book. This book more or less tells you how to stand up a reliability program, what it doesn't really indicate is what SREs do. A lot of people I meet think SRE is just the new title for \"operator\" which can't be farther from the truth. Whether you're doing an embedding model, like is referenced in the book, or you have a central org - both are made up of software and systems software engineers that are focused on performance and reliability. They build software, do analysis, and write policy that improve the bottom line reliability of the organization. reply pm90 17 hours agoparentprevNot an SRE, but I think the main contribution from this book was to popularize terminology of operations (eg SLAs) and to give an opinionated perspective on how to handle operations at scale. More practically, I don’t think the book is as useful, as it generally only makes sense when you reach a certain scale that few organizations ever do (imo). However, we are heading into a future where computing will be everywhere and sensors in everything so in maybe a decade even the “smallest” of organizations may be responsible for large scale distributed systems and operating that would require concepts that are provided in the book. reply arter4 16 hours agoparentprevAs a non Googler myself, it still is if you want to know how to set up an SRE team and introduce SRE (ie good sysadmin, for lack of a better word) best practices. The focus on actual indicators such as SLI and SLO, the importance of reducing \"toil\" (boring repetitive tasks) and automating,... these are all valid concerns. If you want more about system design and how to design reliability, I suggest reading https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-system... reply Rapzid 15 hours agoparentprevThe front half is for introducing ideas.

A few months back there has been announcement already & one of the reflections is to start with reducing the numbers - https://archive.ph/YWp4O reply rwiggins 14 hours agoparentIt has indeed been a strange time for Google SRE recently. However, they're definitely not planning on shutting down SRE - at least, if you can trust what Google leadership's actual explanation of what that meant. Supposedly, the ratio of SRE to product eng had been growing slowly over the years. The KR to \"readjust\" that ratio was to bring it back in line with historical norms, i.e., to ensure that SRE continued to scale sub-linearly with SWE/systems. This had (primarily) two facets. First, it gave SRE teams an effectively-blank check to reevaluate their existing dev engagements and jettison the ones that weren't working well. Second, it pushed to eliminate old tools/systems/platforms and converge onto the more modern stuff, like Annealing [1]. Fewer crufty platforms means fewer teams needed to run them, and improvements in those platforms have broad impact. Anecdotally, my own sub-org (within SRE) is growing at the moment. Not by a huge amount, but growing nonetheless. [1]: https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/prodspec-and... reply danpalmer 15 hours agoparentprevThis doesn't say SRE is shutting down, it says that they're changing the ratio of SRE to SWE. One thing to realise about Google is that the technology is increasingly unified across the company. 10 years ago everything worked in different ways, but now there are very standard technologies and paths, and naturally this requires fewer SREs to the SWEs developing the products. I don't think this is a bad thing, and in the layoffs SREs have not to my knowledge been hit any harder than SWEs. reply dpbriggs 8 hours agoparentprevI can't read tea leaves but I'm fairly confident they're not shutting down SRE. They want to get back to sublinear scaling and move away from the \"devs create crap, bribe SRE (headcount) to babysit it in production\".

There has been recent announcement already & have already started the move - https://archive.ph/YWp4O reply hedora 14 hours agoparentThe archive link is busted for me, but that sounds like a bad move. 90+% of SWEs are bad at and hate SRE work, and vice versa. The rare ones that can do a mediocre job at both (and that won't burn out and switch jobs if told to do both) are usually not capable of doing an excellent job at either. Using analogies from pretty much any other field shows how dumb it is to combine SRE and SWE, or fuse DevOps (or, god forbid DevSecOps) into one rule: - Would you have a surgeon drive an ambulance? - An expert car mechanic manage fleet scheduling and logistics? - Tell a salesman to design marketing graphics, and have your graphic designer manage high-value customer accounts? reply VirusNewbie 7 hours agoparentprevThat’s not what your link says, did you read what you posted? reply softirq 17 hours agoprevMost companies completely missed the point of SRE/PE/DevOps and keep them on separate teams doing sysadmin toil work and oncall thrown over the wall by engineers who are only concerned with feature deadlines. They regress them back to sysadmin duties and get none of the value of a true SRE program. SRE should always be a subtitle for a SWE and not a separate position, and they should always be embedded with SWEs into one team either building products of infrastructure. The shared ownership and toil reduction only works if you have these two things. All this said, I think the regression is also due to the fact that real SREs are rare. A solid SWE that also has deep systems domain knowledge, understanding how to sift through dashboards and live data, and root cause complex performance problems is a master of many domains and is hard to find. reply snowfield 16 hours agoparentThe regression is also due to that a real SRE is expensive. It's cheaper to just get some newly grads to react to alarms following a set runbook of what to do if that alarm triggers. VERY few companies operate at googles scale. For 99.99% of companies it makes sense to investigate single machine issues. reply bananapub 15 hours agorootparentGoogle SREs also end up investigating single machine issues, fyi. reply dpbriggs 8 hours agorootparentIn my experience it's fun to do that but only worth it when SLOs are on the line (so a significant number of bad machines). reply jeffbee 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, but At Scale® It's a totally different experience when you have the people who technically own the hardware side of the operations taking no responsibility for the well-being of it, and the people who own the software developing elaborate workarounds for bad machines, and the SREs maintaining blacklists of individual nodes. reply poisonta 16 hours agoprevI'm curious whether the success of Google in launching software that seems not fully developed can be attributed to their Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. reply dpbriggs 8 hours agoparentNot really, the company is massive and until recently very motivated (promo) to launch new things.
