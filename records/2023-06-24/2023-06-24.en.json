Firstly, thank you for the submission. I honestly didn't anticipate being featured on the homepage of HN without any major update to the library! To those wondering why the project hasn't been updated recently, it's simply because I've been working on a new version (V4) for the last two years. The core library has been completely rewritten, I'm currently in the testing and documentation phase and should be ready for release by this summer.Some of the new features of V4 include:* Improved performance: The library has been entirely rewritten with performance optimization and low memory usage in mind.* New ESM Module first API: Import only what you need and benefit from improved tree shaking.* Better timelines: New options for animation positioning, allowing looping animations in timelines and improved parameters inheritance.* Additive animations: A new tween composition mode that lets you smoothly blend concurrently running animations.* Variable framerate: Specify different framerates for each animation or set it globally.* New callbacks: onTick, onLoop, onRender, etc.* Value modifiers: A function to modify or alter the behavior of the numerical values of the animated property value before rendering.* Animate from: Animation from a given value to the current target value.* Improved documentation: A new design with enhanced animations demos and more in-depth explanations.* Unit testsAnd much more! I can't wait to share it with you!replynextaccountic 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]So another comment says that CSS Tweening makes your lib obsolete, which I don't think is true, but,Can Anime.js make use of CSS Tweening on browsers that support it?

With Anime.js you are able to animate individual elements, placed around static text and buttons, which you can't do with videos.Alpha support in videos is not so good, so I had to create a full-page video (in both portrait and landscape) with the right background color, and placed it as a background layer with a low z-index.Finding the right video compression parameters to avoid background grain was not easy.replySebastianKra 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]After a bit of reluctance to give up my right CMD-key, I decided to try rcmd and it has since disappeared into my workflow like no other app since window snapping.Unlike similar solutions, unused keys are assigned dynamically based on the first letter of the app. So I can have my main apps on 1,2,3... and the rest will change based on which apps are open.replyRyanHamilton 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]rcmd looks cool. Good work. I use Windows + Number to go to the same apps, your idea of letters is a definitive improvement.replyalin23 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks! That's where I got rcmd's inspiration from, I was previously a Windows power user and sorely missed the WinKey+number hotkey.replycriley2 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As a windows power user using OSX for work, does your tool allow you to cycle through open windows by repeating the button?While I do love cmd+` for window switching in OSX, I still prefer Win+### (repeated taps of the same number like Win+1,1,1) to cycle through my chrome windows in a known order. (So Win+1,1 always opens my second chrome window).Also for anyone else in this situation, is there a way to click on an app in the OSX dock and have it not surface every single window all at once? 2 years of OSX and I still struggle when all 6 chrome windows are surfaced and drown out my perfectly arranged other work.replyalin23 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]By default it doesn't do that, because window focusing needs special privileges that App Store apps don't have.There is an addon thing that you can install by clicking on the Switcher button and scrolling all the way to the bottom to find the Install experimental window switching button.After that is installed, a new \"Cycle Windows\" button will appear: https://shots.panaitiu.com/klbRwgTGThe addon will also assign the Right Option key for focusing specific windows of the focused app, by letter: https://shots.panaitiu.com/j9cgRP9Creplyjtha 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I've been using a simple home-made Autohotkey script for years (decade?) to do it more like rmcd is doing.Here's an example for opening Chrome or switching to it if it's open.

I would like to keep using BTT for higher level config.In BTT I have currently set right cmd as a second hyper key (first one being caps). I could see rcmd being useful if I can define on a per key basis if it should run or not.PS: Great blog you havereplyalin23 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Hey thanks!No, rcmd does not expose any API, but you can disable/enable only specific letters from the Settings: https://shots.panaitiu.com/zz8Y2kxLYou can also change the trigger key from \u2318 Right Command to any combination of direction-aware modifiers.Also, if you don't make use of rcmd's dynamically assigned apps and you prefer to assign a letter to a specific app, you can use BTT only for this, no need for going through rcmd.BTT has a focus-or-open action and it's what I used before building rcmd. It can't hide or cycle apps with the same letter like rcmd does but it's good enough for some people.replygeenat 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Mostly obsolete with CSS tweening.You can do non-blocking animation timelines without any library if you use async javascript. <html> <body> <div>Click me to change color every second, then remove.  <script>   // Locality of Behavior   me = document.currentScript.parentElement;   me.addEventListener(\"click\", async event => {    me = event.target    me.style.transition = \"background 1s\"    await sleep(1000)    me.style.background = \"red\"    await sleep(1000)    me.style.background = \"green\"    await sleep(1000)    me.style.background = \"blue\"    await sleep(1000)    me.style.background = \"none\"    await sleep(1000)    me.remove()   })   const sleep = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));  </script> </div> </body> </html>If you like this, you may also want to check out: https://github.com/gnat/surrealreplyhombre_fatal 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Libs like Anime.js are declarative and programmatic.

VS using https://motion.dev/api/timeline or Framer Motion both of which can sequence complex WAAPI animations.replygeenat 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It won't stutter because the actual animation is done by the browser CSS engine.await is only used to build the non-blocking timeline: Think keyframes, not frames.replySirHound 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It will stutter because if your browser is under heavy load then your async function will run when the browser is free to do so - not at the 1s mark as specified by your transition.If you instead build the keyframes up front and give them to WAAPI/CSS then you won\u2019t encounter stutters.This is easily provable by adding some blocking JS into your code. Block the main thread for ten seconds after your first transition and see when that next await triggers. Your animation will run smoothly for 1 second and then the next chunk of your timeline won\u2019t run for another 9.replytroupo 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Regardless of the \"fundamental building block\" when you need actual complex animations, you will end up building your own lib anyway.Because `await setStyle` ain't it.replyBellend 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Are you really comparing this to Anime.js?

But, that doesn't mean implementing these things is any easier. Maybe if you're sliding an element in and out, the WebAnimations API would suffice. If you're wanting to do advanced animation, you will end up creating your own library. With anime.js, you have better control over your animations. You can pause, play, reverse, and seek animations, as well as control their speed. It provides a powerful timeline feature which allows you to chain animations and control their sequence, something that is not available in the Web Animations API. You can also do things like line drawing and morphing, as well as animate CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects.You can do most things natively, if you have the time and luxury of reinventing the wheel.replySirHound 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Fwiw Motion One and Framer Motion both have complex sequencing of WAAPI animations so you have the control but also the off-thread performancereplygeenat 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Sure but in many situations a vanilla async function gives you the same result without the extra layer.replythe8472 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The animation API is likely more efficient/smoother if it lets the browser offload the animation to separate threads without blocking the event loop or having to rerun layout.

In either case, the resultant behavior is dependent on browser-code, not your own js. This is very different than setting up your own manual draw loop with setTimeout.replymarban 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Related: https://www.theatrejs.com https://rive.app https://greensock.com https://motion.devreplyTimon3 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Does one of these tools support an animation timeline with arbitrary seeking? Essentially I want to be able to have a progress slider representing the current time, and if the user clicks on any time on the slider, all animations should spring to that state, like a YouTube video. I played around with GSAP, anime and some others, but none properly supported playing the animations \"backwards\" (while jumping back).I wrote my own implementation of a declarative animation engine (i.e. the same timeline position always looks the same), but I'm pretty sure there are still a couple of bugs allowing you to go out of sync.replyEpskampie 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'd think GSAP timeline is exactly made for that, but you say you've already tried that?https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timelinehttps://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/seek()https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/reverse()replyTimon3 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I thought I did.

In French it just means 'with' - eggs with ham, let's go to the beach with friends, whatever. In Japanese it is used to mean that you're romantically with someone, and is used as a noun to stand in for the word couple.Or for a more specific usage example, high ball in English refers to any mixed drink where the base spirit is a lower volume of the drink than the mixer, e.g. gin and tonic, screwdriver, etc. In Japan a \u30cf\u30a4\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb / hai barru refers almost universally to whiskey and soda water. Of course other highball drinks are served there, but will tend to get a more specific name, such as a shochu highball being a \u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30cf\u30a4 / chuhai.It's more rare for this to happen with a chain of original word -> loan word -> loan word, but still something that happens - it's called 'reborrowing' a word. Another example of this would be the Chinese having reborrowed matcha to mean Japanese-style green tea.It's not silly or wrong to utilize the word anime in the west to refer specifically to Japanese-style animation.replyaerio 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Japanese animation and comics are also particularly popular in France. 55% of all comics in France were manga in 2021, and it's the second biggest anime market outside of Japan.

In fact, most of us use WYSIWYG Markdown daily in apps like Slack without even thinking about it. That said, I think any general, open solution needs to offer \u201cmanual/WYSIWYG\u201d toggles the same way we see \u201cmanual/preview\u201d toggles on DockerHub/GitHub, ideally also maintaining cursor position.

They understand WYSIWYG well and that is how most things work.Most users know how to muddle through with WYSIWYG, but they also lack experience with actually reliable editing environments. So they just take for granted all of the fighting they have to do with the semi-hidden state of the WYSIWYG editor.99% of WYSIWYG users also fail to use their word processors correctly even on the terms of those word processors themselves. They most often totally eschew templates and page/paragraph/character styles in favor of manual formatting changes that all individually 'look right', turning all sizeable documents into unmanageable messes when it comes to consistency or formatting changes. It would be generous to describe this norm as actual proficiency, especially in a professional context.Moreover, it's clear that the WYSIWYG paradigm itself is what invites this widespread incompetency and poor document quality. Why manage things in a systematic, organized, or efficient way when you can watch the document take shape before your eyes by highlighting individual words and manipulating their appearance or padding things with spaces, without having to give a thought to the structure of your document in advance?> Markdown seems an nice, limited format that would make for a nicer, saner WYSIWYG for developers (except the inline HTML part of the spec).WYSIWYG is not in fact less buggy with Markdown, as can be witnessed in the unholy WYSIWYG-Markdown unions of, e.g., Teams and Slack. You still inevitably end up fighting the system just to get your cursor to stop adding text with that formatting, or to escape that quote box, or whatever.replybrazzledazzle 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Teams\u2019 editors aren\u2019t even the same between chats (e.g. DMs and discussion on a meeting) and channels in a \u201cTeam\u201d.

Back ticks start and close the monospaced strings and code blocks, underscore and asterisk start and stop emphasis and bold, > starts quotes and newline +backspace drops the formatting (same with ordered and unordered lists).replyarek_nawo 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think there is use for good WYSIWYG-Markdown integration. Can't really speak for others but, when writing longer forms of content (technical blog posts, docs, etc.) Markdown becomes a bit more difficult for me to navigate. I always fallback to a visual editor (even if it's just StackEdit) and then try to somehow convert that content back to Markdown destination (which can sometimes be hard).Vrite's primary format is JSON, but with MD shortcuts, parsing on paste and parsers converting JSON to MD, I think it integrates quite nicely in most cases.replychii 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> primary format is JSONthe primary format is prosemirror document format, rather than JSON (even tho it is in JSON).replythaumaturgy 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think Obsidian's \"live preview\" editing mode is a great counterpoint to this. I'm pretty sure it's the first WYSIWYG editor I've ever used, in 30-odd years of computing, that hasn't pissed me off.You type markdown, and as you go along, it renders the markdown into its presentation style: italics are italicized, links turn blue and underlined and clickable, lists become lists, and so on.And so there certainly is a visual difference between \"plain text\" markdown and \"rendered\" markdown, but behind-the-scenes you still have a markup language that is less awful than all the other markup languages.replyarek_nawo 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm a bit confused about that. I have heard of but haven't really tried Obsidian. How does what you're describing differs from so-called \"Markdown shortcuts\" (implemented in my editor and other popular ones like Notion)?

Obsidian has 2 different editing modes [0]: \"Live Preview\" and \"Source mode\". Your implementation and Obsidian's Live Preview editing mode implementation are very similar at-a-glance; yours is a bit more interactive / \"GUI-forward\".Here's an example of what Live Preview mode looks like [1].I'm surprised how many people here like Live Preview editing mode in Obsidian though \u2014 it drives me insane constantly shifting the bits under / around my cursor... it's very distracting. I mostly use their Source mode editing mode for that reason.That said, I did not see an equivalent of Reading view mode from Obsidian in Vrite in a few minutes of playing with it.

It's true that WYSIWYG is kind of pointless for READMEs or what have you, but for writing prose it's very useful to continuously understand what your output will actually look like. (And writing prose in markdown is great because you have a plain text, easily manipulated & cross-compiled storage format that you can read the plain text of easily if you have to)replyzerkten 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I've wanted this when the primary requirement was a WYSIWYG editing experience acceptable to business users.

I'm completely onboard with your feelings as a technical person.Using Markdown as the storage format solved the problem because it is consistent and templates can easily be updated to support design updates.

It's fast, easy and works.For making a link, the friction is higher because you have to remember the link/text order, and the link/text punctuation. There's a what, one in four chance of getting it right if you haven't memorised it?

In fact, most of us use WYSIWYG Markdown daily in apps like Slack without even thinking about it. That said, I think any general, open solution needs to offer \u201cmanual/WYSIWYG\u201d toggles the same way we see \u201cmanual/preview\u201d toggles on DockerHub/GitHub, ideally also maintaining cursor position.

They understand WYSIWYG well and that is how most things work.Most users know how to muddle through with WYSIWYG, but they also lack experience with actually reliable editing environments. So they just take for granted all of the fighting they have to do with the semi-hidden state of the WYSIWYG editor.99% of WYSIWYG users also fail to use their word processors correctly even on the terms of those word processors themselves. They most often totally eschew templates and page/paragraph/character styles in favor of manual formatting changes that all individually 'look right', turning all sizeable documents into unmanageable messes when it comes to consistency or formatting changes. It would be generous to describe this norm as actual proficiency, especially in a professional context.Moreover, it's clear that the WYSIWYG paradigm itself is what invites this widespread incompetency and poor document quality. Why manage things in a systematic, organized, or efficient way when you can watch the document take shape before your eyes by highlighting individual words and manipulating their appearance or padding things with spaces, without having to give a thought to the structure of your document in advance?> Markdown seems an nice, limited format that would make for a nicer, saner WYSIWYG for developers (except the inline HTML part of the spec).WYSIWYG is not in fact less buggy with Markdown, as can be witnessed in the unholy WYSIWYG-Markdown unions of, e.g., Teams and Slack. You still inevitably end up fighting the system just to get your cursor to stop adding text with that formatting, or to escape that quote box, or whatever.replybrazzledazzle 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Teams\u2019 editors aren\u2019t even the same between chats (e.g. DMs and discussion on a meeting) and channels in a \u201cTeam\u201d. Which seems so odd and unnecessary it makes me curious how they ended up needing such a confusing and seemingly redundant editor.As far as slack goes I don\u2019t usually need to futz with the format buttons. Back ticks start and close the monospaced strings and code blocks, underscore and asterisk start and stop emphasis and bold, > starts quotes and newline +backspace drops the formatting (same with ordered and unordered lists).replyarek_nawo 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think there is use for good WYSIWYG-Markdown integration. Can't really speak for others but, when writing longer forms of content (technical blog posts, docs, etc.) Markdown becomes a bit more difficult for me to navigate. I always fallback to a visual editor (even if it's just StackEdit) and then try to somehow convert that content back to Markdown destination (which can sometimes be hard).Vrite's primary format is JSON, but with MD shortcuts, parsing on paste and parsers converting JSON to MD, I think it integrates quite nicely in most cases.replychii 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> primary format is JSONthe primary format is prosemirror document format, rather than JSON (even tho it is in JSON).replythaumaturgy 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think Obsidian's \"live preview\" editing mode is a great counterpoint to this. I'm pretty sure it's the first WYSIWYG editor I've ever used, in 30-odd years of computing, that hasn't pissed me off.You type markdown, and as you go along, it renders the markdown into its presentation style: italics are italicized, links turn blue and underlined and clickable, lists become lists, and so on.And so there certainly is a visual difference between \"plain text\" markdown and \"rendered\" markdown, but behind-the-scenes you still have a markup language that is less awful than all the other markup languages.replyarek_nawo 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm a bit confused about that. I have heard of but haven't really tried Obsidian. How does what you're describing differs from so-called \"Markdown shortcuts\" (implemented in my editor and other popular ones like Notion)?

All these shortcuts are described here: https://docs.vrite.io/content-editorHow does it differ from Obsidian? Out of curiosity.replytedmiston 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> How does it differ from Obsidian? Out of curiosity.I am not OP, but I am a heavy Obsidian user. Obsidian has 2 different editing modes [0]: \"Live Preview\" and \"Source mode\". Your implementation and Obsidian's Live Preview editing mode implementation are very similar at-a-glance; yours is a bit more interactive / \"GUI-forward\".Here's an example of what Live Preview mode looks like [1].I'm surprised how many people here like Live Preview editing mode in Obsidian though \u2014 it drives me insane constantly shifting the bits under / around my cursor... it's very distracting. I mostly use their Source mode editing mode for that reason.That said, I did not see an equivalent of Reading view mode from Obsidian in Vrite in a few minutes of playing with it.

It's true that WYSIWYG is kind of pointless for READMEs or what have you, but for writing prose it's very useful to continuously understand what your output will actually look like. (And writing prose in markdown is great because you have a plain text, easily manipulated & cross-compiled storage format that you can read the plain text of easily if you have to)replyzerkten 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I've wanted this when the primary requirement was a WYSIWYG editing experience acceptable to business users. Neither HTML nor Markdown were acceptable and while it's perhaps more accepted today, there are still huge audiences which won't touch anything looking like code. The options available generated terrible HTML on the backend that wouldn't roundtrip or resulted in problems when the overall site design was changed. I'm completely onboard with your feelings as a technical person.Using Markdown as the storage format solved the problem because it is consistent and templates can easily be updated to support design updates.

It makes it easier to remember and to learn new ones. Markdown is composed of arbitary punctuation which is harder to remember.For making something bold, there's low friction in wrapping it in asterisks compared to the HTML version. It's fast, easy and works.For making a link, the friction is higher because you have to remember the link/text order, and the link/text punctuation. There's a what, one in four chance of getting it right if you haven't memorised it? It always trips me up and I have to go and look it up.Whereas a link in HTML is pretty much the same format as everything else in HTML.I think Markdown excels for short or limited things that consist of headings, lists and inline formatting, like blog-posts and comments and ReadMes, but I find it doesn't scale well.replywouldbecouldbe 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Only some developers like markdown, the rest of the world just expect things to work like Word.Things like this can bridge the gap.replylostlogin 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> work like WordThis instantly makes me think about spending 20 minutes trying to get a picture to stay where I put it and have text neatly formatted.

Markdown was designed to prioritize simplicity and readability, allowing documents to be published as plain text without any markup clutter. Introducing a WYSIWYG editor seems to contradict the essence of Markdown itself. While I appreciate the effort and consideration for different use cases, the combination of Markdown syntax with a WYSIWYG editor strikes me as odd. However, everyone has their own preferences, so perhaps there is a balance to be found between simplicity and flexibility. Keep exploring and iterating, and who knows, you might discover the sweet spot that works for you and your users.replymisnome 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> I personally find the combination of Markdown syntax with a WYSIWYG editor to be a bit odd.I can see where you are coming from in terms of wanting to stay \"true\" to the intention of being able to read the plain text (although it always supported the html escape hatch from the beginning), but for me personally the value is that I can write in something WYSIWIG, and drop photos/screenshots/diagrams/sketches into my notes without having to switch back and forth (or have a preview-window by the side taking double the space) - with the absolutely crucial feature that I can do so without being beholden to a single app or nonportable file format.I mainly use Obsidian for this now, but if I wanted to switch away the Obsidian-only features are small/unobtrusive enough that I wouldn't really miss them; I can edit things remotely on the terminal easily enough; and in the end the entire thing is just a git repository of markdown files.replytoastal 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]A lot of folks only care about the visual output of Markdown with little regard for the HTML semantics of the output or the plaintext legibility.

(Obviously this specific query could be done with ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 but if you want the highest paid employee per team or department etc...)replyDaiPlusPlus 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]ISO SQL permits aggregate queries returning (\u201cplain ol\u2019 data\u201d) non-aggregate/non-grouping-key columns - but only when the engine can prove a functional-dependency from the grouping-keys - this isn\u2019t exactly the same thing as what SQLite supports (and MySQL 4-5\u2019s weird behaviour was disabled by default in v8) - but Postgres supports it now too.I don\u2019t know exactly where in the spec it\u2019s defined, though - but I\u2019ve seen people say it was introduced in SQL99.replydiogocp 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The submission title is misleading.

The assumption has always been that the companies who have to (or want to) implement those standards can afford the expense. However, one point addressed by the Advocate General\u2019s present Opinion is that it should be possible for citizens to check whether the relevant standards are being obeyed, which means that citizens need to have access to those standards, not just the entities implementing the standards. In addition, an important part of the current court case is about whether copyright (the basis on which fees are charged) can apply to standards that are effectively part of the law.replykonschubert 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Not all companies are big, old industry dinosaurs.

In other words, the copies are expensive because the authors need to make money off their books published in parallel, with the book text also containing much needed commentary. At least it used to be like that years ago.If you want \"free\" standards, look what happened to so-called web standards dominated financially by FAANG, and the catastrophic results to the extant web. Might as well say the web as such doesn't exist anymore.replydiego_sandoval 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Yes, but the lawmakers are the ones that should abstain from referencing closed standards in the law, not the standard the one that has to open itself because the law references it.Or maybe the law could create its own official standard that simply paraphrases what the closed standard says, effectively making it open.replycsense 9 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I figure this should be a straightforward case of eminent domain.Say you own a house. The government needs to take your house to demolish it to build a road. The government is within its rights to just take it (after due process and fair payment).Now say you own a document that you make people pay to read. The government needs to take your document to make it part of the law to build a building code. Why doesn't the government exercise same kind of rights to just take it (after due process and fair payment)?replyjstanley 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The government needs to take your document to make it part of the law to build a building code.This part doesn't follow.Why doesn't the government make their own document? Eminent domain exists for land because it's not possible to make more land in the same place.replycsense 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Why doesn't the government make their own document?(Sorry this is a US-centric explanation, I don't really understand how the EU system works)Sometimes legislators say \"We don't feel like having government employees write this particular set of regulations from scratch. Instead we'll make a law that says such-and-such a document written by a private organization is effectively promoted to a law.\"There are three separate questions here: (1) Should legislators promote documents to laws? (2) Should legislators be allowed to promote documents to laws? (3) If legislators do promote a document to a law, how should the legal system interpret that action?If you say \"(1): No,\" then you should vote for a Congress / President that doesn't think it's okay to promote documents to laws. But sometimes a Congress / President might be elected that does think it's okay, and they might promote some documents to laws.US law currently says \"(2): Yes.\" If you think it should say \"(2): No\" you probably need to change the system. I.e. pass a Constitutional amendment, which is extremely difficult, much harder than merely voting in a Congress / President that agrees with you. Good luck on that.That means it comes down to (3). Which is where I make the analogy with eminent domain. You had a document that people were paying you money for. The government made that document part of the law, and the law must be freely available, so now because of the government's actions, people aren't paying you money because a copy of your thing is now free.Sure, the government could have not promoted the document to a law. Or the system could be set up so the government isn't allowed to promote documents to laws.But those things that could have happened didn't happen. Instead, what actually happened is the government promoted your document to a law.Why didn't they make their own document instead of promoting yours? It doesn't matter at this point. They did promote your document, and they are allowed to do it under the current system.The obvious ways to resolve the conundrum are: (a) Make people pay to see the law, or (b) Make the law free and have the taxpayers compensate you for the lost revenue of the document, or (c) Make the law free and you just have to suck it up, too bad, so sad.(a) just feels icky because it effectively means the law is a secret. Penalizing people for violating laws they can't know about (without paying) seems pretty unfair and maybe violates some legal principles (due process maybe), I dunno the specifics, not a lawyer. (c) definitely seems wrong too because it seems like \"the government took my stuff and didn't pay me for it\" falls (or should fall) under eminent domain even if the thing the government took isn't land. That leaves (b), I can't really think of any other optionsreplyrat9988 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Because nobody will make the effort afterwards to make good standards. Fair payment is in most countries quiet unfair in fact.replycsense 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> nobody will make the effort afterwards to make good standardsThat's not true. If 3000 people a year would have paid you $100 for access over the next 20 years, that's $300,000, which as a future income stream has some PV X. You'll be indifferent [1] between collecting the trickle of revenue from customers paying the paywall, and a one-time lump sum from the government of X [2].[1] You'll be indifferent by definition. Because you'd say \"Yes please\" to a lump sum of $1 trillion, \"No thanks\" to a lump sum of $1, and PV is defined to be the crossover point where your answer changes.[2] If you have a discount rate of 5%, then X ~= $300,000 / 1.05^10 or so, depending on how front-loaded the payments are and how much you care about payments more than 20 years in the future.> quite unfair in factIf the government pays you less than X, in theory it's unconstitutional, plain and simple. If the legal system doesn't accept your projected revenue, or discount rate, or you have to pay the lawyers and expert witnesses too much to legally establish the basis for those calculations...well then, the problem isn't the government taking your document to make it part of the law. The problem is the legal system is too inefficient or unreasonable, which has a different set of fixes (e.g. make laws about what calculations the government has to use in this situation, and make the government pay the plaintiff's attorney fees if the case is sufficiently clear-cut instance of \"the government didn't follow its own official rules and this should never have gotten to court in the first place\")replyrat9988 13 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What do you mean by unconstitutional?

React\u2019s component model can be an excellent abstraction for building a \u201cnormal website\u201d\u2014or rather, its component parts\u2014for developers who prefer it. React can compile to static HTML, without running any JS client side, and/or can be used to mount or hydrate arbitrary subtrees however one sees fit. (I\u2019d probably favor Preact or Solid for the latter, but React is a perfectly cromulent choice)replyafavour 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]React can be used without JS or by hydrating subtrees but those are very uncommon. It\u2019s certainly not React\u2019s \u201chappy path\u201d.replyeyelidlessness 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Rendering to static HTML is actually pretty common. Admittedly, hydrating subtrees is fairly uncommon (at least where the full tree is also rendered by React server-side), but it\u2019s well within the \u201chappy path\u201d and both patterns have been heavily promoted by React from very early on.What\u2019s not within the \u201chappy path\u201d is automating any sort of partial hydration process, which is unfortunate, but it seems pretty likely RSC is going to subsume that use case for most anyone trying to solve it with React.replykamikaz1k 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Literally just a single API call: renderToStringhttps://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStringreplyllanowarelves 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What would be the right tool for an entertaining highly interactive and animated (game-like, but still mostly text based) thing then?

I am wondering why there isn't design diversity (not using the sociological meaning of the word here) for forward-looking web technologies? Somehow the conversation typically centers around AR/VR or inserting crypto into everything. VisionOS is stereotypically \"clean and modern\". Web design in general seems so derivative and uninspired, which is strange given that a web page is the main point of interaction for most people.replyrafark 6 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]When flat design started to become a thing I was very excited. It was beautiful. But then EVERYTHING became flat and now I\u2019m extremely bored.Just recently I started using reddit and stumbled upon the old version of the site. Look at this subreddit, it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous and goes very well with the theme of the discussions:https://old.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/replyjtolmar 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]A lot of alternative visual designs run into problems with the technical realities of modern UI tooling. I'm going to talk about web tech, but Android layout works largely the same, last I checked (one trillion years ago, to be fair).The futuristic UI look that Arwes is doing comes with a whole lot of animation, which is very cumbersome on the web. The CSS transition property is good, but it works on a very narrow range of properties, and anything involving inserting/deleting/adding elements needs a whole song and dance to trigger the animation then go clean it up when it's done. You can do it, but it's a whole lot of extra work.Most other stylized looks involve big chonky stylized borders and background graphics. But we generally want the same style to work on mobile, and the chonkier your borders, the harder it is to cram it into reduced space. (Also CSS still doesn't have native 9-patches for some absurd reason. It used to be how everything was done, until the world agreed to stop abusing tables.)Meanwhile the modern flat look is easy to implement in CSS and doesn't have any trouble scaling down to mobile. And it's still a good enough look, it'd even be kind of striking if it wasn't ubiquitous.replyhbn 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If we were speculating what UIs will look like in the future and came up with something good, why wouldn't we just do them right now?

It's just easier to understand for the everyman.replyjavier_e06 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The future looks there comes in dark aqua tones and chirping noises when information scrolls up and down.

The future can be very distracting.replyalisonatwork 3 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Windows 8 and Windows Mobile embraced this aesthetic, and I thought it the best mainstream UI we've gotten since the 32-bit era. Everything resolves back to a straight edge, because computer screens are largely square, not round. Every object has a bold, flat color so you can easily and immediately identify it. And the background is matte black. None more black. Windows Mobile on an AMOLED display was a thing of beauty. It's too bad the design regressed in Windows 10 before proper dark mode was released for desktop, because by the time we finally got the clean backgrounds that would really make stuff pop outside the start menu, they'd already ruined the whole UI (including the start menu).Of course this latest Windows feels like Microsoft designers have fallen completely into Mac OS X redux, which to me makes computers look like some kind of ridiculous hand-carved artifact from antiquity instead of the modern, practical tools they are.

    "content": "California will begin backing intentional burns to control wildfireMillions of dollars have been set aside to encourage controlled burns that can help defang forest fires.wakr10 / Adobe StockBy B. David ZarleyJune 22, 2023In an effort to curb the wildfires that regularly engulf the state, California is now fighting fire with \u2026 well, you know.So far in 2023, only 6,700 acres of Golden State land has burned, but fire season has barely begun \u2014 since 2017, the state has been averaging 1.8 million acres burned per year, overwhelmingly concentrated in the back half of the year.To deal with the rising threats from fire and smoke, the state is sponsoring a program to encourage more prescribed burns and cultural burns. The \u201cPrescribed Fire Liability Claims Fund Pilot\u201d will allocate $20 million to cover losses that may occur if a prescribed or cultural burn ends up slipping control.Setting fires intentionally may sound like a paradoxical approach to fire control, but if they are done correctly, controlled burns reduce the fuel available for wildfires, helping to prevent the catastrophically large, hot fires that overwhelm firefighting resources. They also are beneficial for a healthy ecosystem.To deal with the rising threats from fire and smoke, California is sponsoring a program to encourage more prescribed burns and cultural burns.While they rarely burn out of control, it can happen, and the fear of liability for unintentionally starting a wildfire is one key reason holding back more prescribed burns.\u201cThe Prescribed Fire Claims Fund pilot project removes a significant barrier to obtaining insurance for potential damages from a prescribed fire or cultural burn conducted by a certified prescribed fire burn boss or a cultural fire practitioner,\u201d said Joe Taylor, the director and chief of CAL FIRE, the state\u2019s fire protection agency. According to the California Wildfire & Forest Resilience Task Force, the fund\u2019s purpose will be twofold: providing coverage to encourage prescribed burns, and demonstrating that prescribed and cultural burns are low risk, so private insurance companies will enter the market.The overall goal: more controlled burns.Why burn on purpose? It admittedly seems counterintuitive \u2014 or even dangerous \u2014 but purposeful burns have been used by Indigenous people to keep forests and wildland healthy for millenia. Thanks to centuries of overzealous fire protection and the suppression of Indigenous cultural burns \u2014 which Europeans found \u201cprimitive\u201d \u2014 forests have become overgrown, accumulating piles of underbrush and fallen trees. In trying to prevent wildfires altogether, we\u2019ve been essentially storing up bigger and bigger piles of fuel. And with that extra fuel comes fires that burn more ferociously, exacerbated by drought and drier conditions from climate change.\u201cWhen you talk to different native people from the Yosemite area, they talk about how it used to look when fire was used as a management tool,\u201d UC Davis professor of Native American Studies Beth Rose Middleton Manning said in a University of California article. Areas that were once open valleys are now choked with conifers and other fuel sources that were not there when cultural burns helped groom the land.Setting fires intentionally may sound unusual, but if done correctly they reduce the fuel available for wildfires and are beneficial for a healthy ecosystem.In addition to devouring fuel on purpose, cultural burns especially were aimed at helping promote ecological health and biodiversity. As well as clearing out diseased trees, regular fires help keep trees from overrunning other ecosystems. (If that seems odd, here\u2019s an East Coast example: the Venus fly trap, native of the Carolinas, needs a ton of sun and relies on fire burning away some competition to get it.)The suppression of prescribed and cultural burns has made California\u2019s forests twice as dense, the Honorable Ron W. Goode, Tribal Chairman of the North Fork Mono Tribe, told UC. When purposeful burns were being used, a variety of plants were able to grow; now, tall trees, which spread fire rapidly when their crowns catch, dominate.Prescribed burns vs. cultural burns: While both types of burns help control wildfires, there is a difference between prescribed burns \u2014 like the kind used by forest services \u2014 and cultural burns. Prescribed burns are generally focused mainly on acreage and reducing the amount of fuel available for wildfires; cultural burns are focused on what needs burned to revitalize woodlands and promote biodiversity.\u201cCultural burning comes back to what we are burning for, and it\u2019s not burning for acres,\u201d Goode said. \u201cWe\u2019re burning to restore the land, restore the resources, restore water. Bring it back to where it can reproduce on its own.\u201dBoth will now be officially encouraged, although to regain their important roles will require eventually spinning up a larger insurance market.\u201cIt\u2019s a tool that has been used for millennia by Native American tribes and one that will continue to play a big role in wildfire prevention,\u201d state senator Bill Dodd, who wrote the bill establishing the fund, said. \u201cThe rollout of this fund is a big step toward keeping California communities safe.\u201dWe\u2019d love to hear from you!

Nobody is arguing against that. Pretty much they never have.

The challenges include: Air Quality Laws, Insurance Liability, Federal control of National Forest, and the high population in the Wildland Urban Interface and large number of houses near areas that need fire control.

We should try to burn as much around those areas to reduce the likelihood a fire spreads to that area.

I have literally said the opposite of that, in this very thread.More, it has not been established that it is too far into the \"no pollution side at all.\" Do you have evidence that it is pollution regulation that has caused no controlled burns?

I am not claiming that pollution alone should preclude the idea of doing burns. I am claiming that to reduce pollution concerns to being \"dumb\" is wrong.This is a hard area to regulate.

That is the reductive part that is problematic.They are a factor, in that you have to do it in a way that addresses pollution concerns. At large, that is probably going to include what accelerants and controls are allowed, as they will have a unique impact on the pollution generated.Or are you suggesting that the pollution can, in fact, not be controlled and impacted in ways that may need special mitigations?replybobthepanda 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Pollution happens as a result of fire.Under current regulations, people are often prevented from controlled burns due to air quality concerns under CEQA. This leads to fuel buildup.When the eventual real wildfire happens, the risk to property and lives is much worse, and so is the pollution; places experiencing wildfire experience AQIs of 300,400+ when the WHO considers 150+ to be unhealthy. Mother Nature doesn\u2019t have much concern for laws and regulations, and we have trouble controlling these large fires.There is no way to control and thin fuel that does not result in pollution. Manual excavation is impractical and arguably worse since we\u2019d be certainly trampling ecosystems in the process; these ecosystems are often expecting some baseline level of fire.replytaeric 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That... is mostly not how this has gone down. It is easy to contrive that current pollution regulations prevent controlled burns, but at large that is not accurate. See the rules I posted about how you can do controlled burns in your yard. Look up similar rules in other states, and you'll often find carve outs specifically for \"forest health\" reasons. (Edit: forgot to say that you will still almost always have rules about the accelerants and extinguishing methods you are allowed to use. Largely for ecological pollution concerns.)replybobthepanda 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Those regulations are different on a state by state basis.The entire discussion thread is about California, the CEQA in my parent comment is the California Environmental Quality Act, and here is an article describing the differences between the South and the West on burning policy: https://www.npr.org/2021/08/31/1029821831/to-stop-extreme-wi...> Florida has done prescribed burns on more than 1.6 million acres so far this year. California has only burned around 35,000 acres.

Permits from firefighting agencies and air quality regulators can be cumbersome to secure.> In May [2021], Quinn-Davidson helped lead the first burn manager certification course in California. Fourteen local groups, known as prescribed burn associations, recently formed to help private landowners with burns across the state.replytaeric 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That article is frustrating. It seems to completely ignore the drought conditions in the western states as a big reason why they can't burn as often in the year as FL can...More, none of this actually shows that it is \"air quality regulators\" that is specifically preventing prescribed burns. That actually reads more as a dog whistle to get people riled up over the idea.And indeed, the linked article presents a better explanation. Liability concerns on decontainment and other impacts goes a long way to stopping people from doing anything. Straight forwardly, if they do a controlled burn and it impacts others, they are liable to make the others whole. If a wildfire happens, they are both victims.That is, this article is a direct downstream event from the \"prescribed burn associates\" effort of the NPR story. If you have a certified associate, you can get insurance to limit your liability. And this is largely because the certified associate will be following necessary rules and regulations to limit the impact.

Getting a healthy tree to burn needs a lot of heat or time, so if you burn frequently enough the undergrowth burns away long before the trees have a chance to catch fire.

I.e. thin the forests out by logging trees here and there.Or do both. Thin out the substantial trees with selective logging, which reduces the fuel load, then burn the undergrowth.replyRoyalHenOil 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not sure how it's done in California, but in a lot of places, they do something kind of similar to this. In areas with a very large buildup of fuel that puts trees at risk of burning, they will cleacut a ring around the planned burn to keep the fire contained.However, they would not normally log all the trees within the burn area. The goal is to preserve the trees and clear out the fuel that has built up at the underbrush level. After the burn, mature trees help suppress further underbrush development.When trees are removed, it leads to a lot of secondary growth, which both promotes fire and is heavily susceptible to being killed by fire. This is fine if the goal is to maintain the area as a more open field-like space via frequent controlled burns (which we honestly should be doing more of; meadows are highly ecologically valuable), but if the goal is to maintain it as forest, then you don't want to remove mature trees.replypengaru 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Unless something's changed recently, California doesn't control such things within its own borders for a huge swath of its forests. The federal government does, and that's been the crux of the matter for as long as I've paid any attention to it.replybitxbitxbitcoin 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> \u201cFight fire with\u2026 well you know\u201dI recommend the Good Fire podcast for anyone confused by this headline.[0][0] https://yourforestpodcast.com/good-fire-podcastreplymynonameaccount 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]how about allowing loggers to cut down some trees instead of just burning it or capturing that energy released.

You burn to clear up the dry, flammable plant material on the ground. If controlled burns are conducted regularly, this fuel does not build up enough to create large fires that kill trees.replyjonnycomputer 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm not personally opposed (though most of that kind of harvesting might disturb a lot of habitat, potentially introducing non-native invasives.
