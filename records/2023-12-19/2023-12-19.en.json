    "originBody": "December 18, 2023 Figma and Adobe are abandoning our proposed merger Dylan FieldCo-founder & Chief Executive Officer, Figma Inside Figma Thought leadership UI/UX Fifteen months into the regulatory review process, Figma and Adobe no longer see a path toward regulatory approval of our proposed acquisition. Figma and Adobe have reached a joint decision to end our pending acquisition. It’s not the outcome we had hoped for, but despite thousands of hours spent with regulators around the world detailing differences between our businesses, our products, and the markets we serve, we no longer see a path toward regulatory approval of the deal. We entered into this agreement 15 months ago with the goal of accelerating what both Adobe and Figma could do for our respective communities. While we leave that future behind and continue on as an independent company, we are excited to find ways to partner for our users. Amid the uncertainty of a pending acquisition, I am deeply proud of how the Figma team delivered for our community and feel we have only continued to accelerate our pace over the past 15 months. Our team built and shipped new products to make it easier to ideate, design and build software, including our first native AI features, Dev Mode, Variables, and Advanced Prototyping. We also opened new hubs in the UK and Asia, hosted an epic Config IRL in San Francisco, acquired AI startup Diagram, and added more than 500 new Figmates. Figma’s founding vision was to “eliminate the gap between imagination and reality.” The shift from a physical economy to a digital economy and huge advances in AI have combined to make this aspiration feel even more urgent and within reach today than it did 11 years ago. This will be our focus moving forward. We want to make it easy for anyone to design and build digital products on a single multiplayer canvas—from start to finish, idea to production. I’m so excited for what the future holds and beyond grateful to our community for supporting us. Figma’s best, most innovative days are still ahead. See you all in 2024! Dylan Field is the co-founder and CEO of Figma. Dylan studied computer science and mathematics at Brown University where he and his co-founder, Evan Wallace, first started experimenting with design tools built on (and for) the web. With funding from a Thiel fellowship, they began Figma. Prior to Figma, Dylan interned at O'Reilly Media, LinkedIn, and Flipboard.

They were acquiring Figma at the peak of the market (for growth stock&#x2F;startup valuations) because of the existential risks that Figma was threatening, due to their collaborative development UX.But since then:* Startup valuations have fallen. Ignoring regulatory concerns, a new acquisition deal today would be cheaper.* Gen AI and Adobe Firefly are the new rage, and Adobe has probably captured back both mental and market share from Figma. And Adobe can now add collaborative features to Firefly, and it doesn&#x27;t even have to be as good as Figma&#x27;s to win.So paying the 1B breakup fee is probably the cheapest and best option for Adobe at this time.Meanwhile, Figma employees, expecting a big payout, are probably a bit demotivated at this point. And potentially, they might have been working on integrating into Adobe over the past year, so they might have even slowed down in their development pace. reply RickS 16 hours agoparent(ex-Adobe, on a team highly related to an area where Figma out-executed XD, less knowledge about genAI stuff)> Adobe has probably captured back both mental and market share from FigmaGenAI&#x2F;Firefly&#x27;s success is in a totally different domain to what Figma&#x27;s doing. Figma&#x27;s equivalent at Adobe is XD, which has never held a candle to Figma. The existential problem Adobe tried to buy their way out of still exists in the same form at, if anything, a greater severity. I was at Figma&#x27;s config conf this year and they&#x27;re finally shipping stuff I tried unsuccessfully to get from the XD team _years_ ago.> potentially, they might have been working on integrating into Adobe over the past yearHighly, highly unlikely. I have no insider knowledge of Figma, but Adobe&#x27;s a grown up company and _really_ does not fuck around on the legal stuff (which is part of the basis of Firefly&#x27;s success – significantly cleaner legal provenance on their training data). Everyone I&#x27;ve spoken to at Adobe says they&#x27;ve been kept at a long arms length. reply krsdcbl 15 hours agorootparentAs a graphics designer of almost 20 years i have to heavily agree. Firefly is nice for drafting and dabbling with stuff that once would&#x27;ve been served by stock sites, but aside picking a few demo images or making some abstract pattern backgrounds here and there, this has close to zero overlap with the UI&#x2F;UX into development & design system management process Figma serves. It&#x27;s almost like saying the Bing bot eats away at Laravels user base.As a personal aside: I&#x27;d like to commend the initial push you guys did with XD. While Figma was still out of my scope back then, and XD played a major role for me in transitioning away from oldschool Photoshop or Indesign mockup processes into a modern workflow that integrates with my dev team and focuses on component & design token centric thinking.Figma may have left XD thoroughly in the dust by now, and i honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier that the merger won&#x27;t happen, seeing how Adobe has been committed to absolutely dismantling the UX of Photoshop to the point of it only remaining installed on my workstation because Affinity Designer still lacks some core feature parity - but in its earlier days XD has been absolutely crucial to the development and modernization of my whole thinking and workflows! reply IAmGraydon 6 hours agorootparent> Adobe has been committed to absolutely dismantling the UX of PhotoshopTangential, but as a user of PS for 25 years who has experienced their UX changes since version 4, I’m curious what you mean by this. reply exodust 3 hours agorootparentI think they meant \"XD\". They must have since the UX of Photoshop has not been dismantled in any way, shape or form. reply chefandy 10 hours agorootparentprevCurious: what do you find missing in the affinity stuff? I see a bunch of people referring to it generally lacking &#x27;stuff&#x27; but I&#x27;m curious about the sort of stuff it lacks. Maybe my use case won&#x27;t be impacted much.I&#x27;m grandfathered in with the introductory CC pricing but there aren&#x27;t too many threads left in the rope anchoring me to that. I rarely do print design anymore so InDesign isn&#x27;t the huge sell it used to be, and photoshop is just annoying me more each day. If it weren&#x27;t for illustrator, I&#x27;d probably be gone already, and inkscape just doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard for that stuff... the type tools alone in illustrator keep me there. Audition suits me way better than audacity but I don&#x27;t do anything remotely intensive enough with sound to warrant a hundreds-of-dollars a year subscription. reply matt_s 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah usually the step kids aren&#x27;t allowed to talk to each other until after the ceremony. In fact it might be illegal for the two companies to do anything regarding the merger until the transaction is concluded. That is when you&#x27;ll see the HR, Marketing, Sales, and Legal teams have layoffs because typically post-merger those areas don&#x27;t require duplicate teams. reply ska 15 hours agorootparentprevCurious: would you say that&#x27;s reflective of Adobe&#x27;s dev culture as a whole? I heard some similar comments coming out of a (claimed?) Lightroom developer about the motivations for that project... reply dharmab 15 hours agorootparentAlso ex-Adobe, worked directly with regulatory compliance in my role there. Adobe is a huge company with a diverse set of dev team cultures, but is a monoculture in regards to legal and regulatory compliance. They do not fuck around. (They&#x27;re also very serious about security post-2013.) reply lucubratory 11 hours agorootparentWhat happened in 2013? reply organsnyder 11 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;adobe... reply lucubratory 10 hours agorootparentThank you, I appreciate the link replyherdcall 9 hours agorootparentprevHow is&#x2F;was Figma so superior to XD exactly? I used to work with XD and briefly also used Figma, but never really liked it (seemed like a crude version of XD in a way), so never understood all the Figma rage. Genuine question, not challenging the view at all. The only pluses I saw for Figma over XD were that it was perhaps easier to collaborate and didn&#x27;t need installation (because it is web based). reply 627467 8 hours agorootparentIn my view the fact that figma has been built for realtime collab just places it on totally different league. It&#x27;s like office vs gdocs. It tool Microsoft years (a decade?) To catch-up and accept that most people collab online one way or the other reply puppymaster 8 hours agorootparentyep. Figma&#x27;s &#x27;workflow&#x27; has become an api in itself. In order to compete everyone has to match the flow reply PeterCorless 7 hours agorootparent+1 this. Website design has become an increasingly iterative, collaborative process inside companies. You can&#x27;t just launch a new website and surprise your team. People need to annotate comments, and constant iteration is the name of the game. Design, solicit feedback, integrate, iterate, repeat.There&#x27;s also a lot of work needed up-front on responsive design (as opposed to it being an also-ran or afterthought), and a move away from older typical WordPress-oriented static designs to modern dynamic JAMstack-oriented development methodologies. reply exodust 3 hours agorootparent> Design, solicit feedback, integrate, iterate, repeat.Except people in a typical company who might provide quality feedback on the new website, do not want to \"browse Figma\". They want an actual website to view - dev site or the actual new live site.> \"You can&#x27;t just launch a new website and surprise your team.\"Yes you can. Nothing beats launching a new site to motivate quality feedback. If you expect feedback to arrive soon after launch, you can use this to your advantage.If you like the sound of crickets, share a link to Figma and ask people for feedback. Designers and developers will respond, others like sales and non-technical staff often won&#x27;t. Why? Because people prefer the security of their web browser&#x27;s familiar reference point when assessing a website. As opposed to browsing an app that gives them a special window to a slippery canvas where an impression of the website is found. replydoctorpangloss 15 hours agorootparentprev> (which is part of the basis of Firefly&#x27;s success – significantly cleaner legal provenance on their training data).Yeah... I mean the pre-trained text encoder Firefly uses is filled with copyrighted, unlicensed-for-express-purpose training data.Firefly is successful in the same sense that DocuSign is, in that it is selling a holistic social experience, but I think maybe don&#x27;t opine on \"legal provenance on their training data\" until you have seen the whole pipeline with your own eyes. Sophisticated people sort of know Adobe&#x27;s claims are bullshit, but what exactly do you expect the community to do, speculate on the exactly zero evidence Adobe has shown of how any of their stuff works?Anyway, I am pretty sure Adobe is delighted they are not paying $20b for something that is worth way, way less. Like maybe $500m at most.Meanwhile the people using Figma at many companies are getting laid off. Etsy, Bytedance, Unity Spotify, Salesforce all made massive UX designer cuts.The real question is, is the thing people are using Figma for even worth $20b? No, no way. Figma users work in the Making Bugs department: they make new buggy things nobody asked for, that aren&#x27;t lists or spreadsheets but should just be lists and spreadsheets, which makes everything worse. There is nowadays positive ROI to doing less Figmaing. In my opinion there has always been more ROI to doing less Figmaing, to straight up not having those people around and not gathering so many opinions on designing lists from so many stakeholders. That holistic experience is expensive in many ways, and while again you can be successful delivering that, it doesn&#x27;t mean it makes sense.Just look at the Spotify app. It&#x27;s a hot abject mess of absolute garbage UI. They have been diehard Figma users for years. They are the prime example of Figmafication ruining something extremely simple. It&#x27;s fucking lists! Lists are not worth $20b. reply parentheses 13 hours agorootparentI think this shows that you don&#x27;t fully understand UI&#x2F;UX and its importance&#x2F;role in modern software creation. Moreover, you&#x27;re conflating your opinions about Spotify with an industry. This would explain what I consider to be an mis assessment of the situation.As someone close to UX my entire life, Figma is a well positioned and useful app that has no decent substitute on the Adobe side. It has market share and potentially a huge data moat giving them a leg up on the \"AI Designer\" problem. Now more than ever, it is worth a lot. reply seanmcdirmid 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is a pretty cynical take on what UX designers do. The PMs should be dealing with lists and spreadsheets, often they don’t and just tell the designer to just design the product in a mock. It isn’t the way things should go, just like how having programmers decide the UX while they are programming the UI leads to disaster. reply aliston 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s so bad about the Spotify app? For the most part, it looks like a bunch of lists (not so much spreadsheets) to me...As someone that is only tangentially in the design space, why do you think collaborative design works so poorly? I have noticed that, in engineering reviews, complex backend designs get scrutiny, but rarely \"I feel..\", \"I prefer...\" types of comments, whereas frontend teams get all types of those comments. Is it a matter of too many cooks in the kitchen or something else? reply doctorpangloss 15 hours agorootparentThis is a stylized comment.It is a bunch of lists, but the UI is sometimes the lists are scrolling horizontally album covers, sometimes they are popping up from menu buttons, sometimes they go full screen and scroll normally, sometimes they are cut short to 5 elements and you cannot see more, sometimes they continue to 20 elements and you can press to see more, sometimes it&#x27;s a list with headers that all contain more than a presentable number of elements and you have to tap the header to see more, sometimes it&#x27;s a mix of horizontal and vertical scrolling sections, sometimes it&#x27;s squares and sometimes it&#x27;s rectangles, sometimes your whole list is shrunk because of a popup up top that is going through a list of items they want to notify you about but the popups are shown one session at a time, sometimes they have a full screen popup that is going through that list of items, sometimes you are driving your car or trying to find a song for a baby or trying to do your run and you are being shown many different kinds of lists when a simple, scrolling up and down list with a search box would be preferred, but instead there is so much stuff they want to show you in these lists in so many different shapes that you didn&#x27;t ask for.Do you know what the provenance of this morass is, at Spotify? There are many, many Figmas, each a UX designer hoping to reinvent the list in their own way, various product managers competing for attention from the user to introduce a Feature and Increase Engagement for their Key Performance Indicators. The user is better served without any of this stuff.Man, have you seen the Google Maps and Gmail apps? Google doesn&#x27;t use Figma either, but the ethos isn&#x27;t unique to Spotify, it is absolutely toxic. The amount of crap I can accidentally tap on while driving using Google Maps, telling me information I absolutely do not care about, trying to get me to Do Something for Some Product Manager&#x27;s Product: it&#x27;s negative ROI.> why do you think collaborative design works so poorly?To me, using Figma is a symptom of the incompetent people outnumbering the opinionated and competent. It&#x27;s not so much that collaborative design works poorly, I&#x27;m sure it works very well in Apple&#x27;s design org. But that&#x27;s not what the Figma product is. It&#x27;s a holistic social experience of giving 10x as many people the ability to inscribe their opinions and get credit for participating in a project, as corporate people do, which is very valuable to 10 subscribers as opposed to the 1 person actually doing the work. It&#x27;s a great business! reply gibbitz 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t like spotify&#x27;s UX much either, but I don&#x27;t blame my hammer for the lopsided chairs I built. Plenty of crappy UIs were designed in Adobe Photoshop before Sketch came around and introduced tooling better suited for UX mockups. It&#x27;s not the tool it&#x27;s poor product and experience development you&#x27;re complaining about. reply yawnxyz 12 hours agorootparentprev(I’m a UX engineer but not at Spotify)It’s always been wild to me how incongruous &#x2F; inconsistent the experience of using Spotify’s web&#x2F;ios&#x2F;android apps have been. It points to an organizational mess rather than a Figma mess, but maybe it also shows that Figma doesn’t address the entire picture yet of addressing org level communication and syncing with prod assets reply weebull 19 minutes agorootparentNone of the things you&#x27;ve highlighted have ever, as a user, registered with me. What I want from a music app UI is a good search function, playlists, and then it&#x27;s really down to content, content, content.For an app like that I just need the UX to be \"good enough\". reply doctorpangloss 12 hours agorootparentprevAt least to the specific, valuable role of a UX designer, the biggest problem with Figma is it has no opinions or affordances for improving HCI. The best UX designers have strong HCI opinions and Figma does nothing for them. It is fundamentally a tool to (mis)-style lists. So it is unfortunate it is adopted as much as it is, UX designers should be spending their intellectual energy on more scientific stuff.> It points to an organizational mess rather than a Figma messThe two are related. It&#x27;s like Conway&#x27;s law.Figma has some pretty generic opinions about how apps or shit should be made. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;working-well&#x2F;). Like it has this collaborative editing multiplayer thing going on, but you could just ignore that, many bosses effectively use it to tell subordinates exactly what to do without any feedback. Nonetheless they have countless public materials espousing the things it can do and how using those features to the max, especially collaboration, is the Right Way.However if your way of doing things aligns with its unique value proposition, such as by requiring many people to collaboratively turn simple lists into confusing lists, that is bad.If you lean into what Figma writes is \"Working Well,\" you will create an app that looks and feels like Spotify. That is what I am saying. It&#x27;s on Figma.This isn&#x27;t a fringe opinion by any means. SAP users get the most success from conforming their business to the way their SAP vertical solution says to do things. Git is also opinionated.Jira had an opinionated way of working, Agile is a manifesto for how people should do stuff. One task, exactly one assignee is really radical! You can go and read about Jira and Asana saying \"no\" when people ask to allow multiple assignees. Trello got rid of that, assign as many people to a card or task as you&#x27;d like, it&#x27;s less opinionated, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s an inherent flaw. And woe be onto people who use Trello, that is telling me right away that they are going to be slower than Jira and Asana users.> Figma doesn’t address the entire picture yetThe core dynamic they provide software for - and this is just as true of Google Docs and Sharepoint - is that BigCo employees need to touch things and get credit. Every BigCo I&#x27;ve worked with, without fail. There are like 10 people on meetings, and 9 people don&#x27;t do anything but they use the stuff they touch and the calendar entries as collateral in their performance reviews.Adobe dodged a huge bullet with this one. reply arathis 7 hours agorootparentWhat the hell are you talking about? reply remoquete 14 hours agorootparentprevAs a UX writer, the ability of providing feedback or editing UI text before a disastrous piece of Loren Ipsum goes to production is very, very valuable. What&#x27;s the feedback you think is silly here? reply tanepiper 2 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Maps is the worst for this - the only application that has nearly killed me several times. reply jbl0ndie 13 hours agorootparentprevI believe that&#x27;s what Cory Doctorow calls &#x27;enshittification&#x27;. I don&#x27;t blame UX designers and Figma for it though, and I think this comes from the corporate stakeholders rather than the PMs. Full disclosure, I&#x27;m a PM similarly annoyed by the enshittification of once excellent apps.

Based on the google trends [1], Figma sees around 10x more traffic than Firefly, but more importantly it experiences severe weekend drop-offs, meaning people are using it for work. Firefly on the other hand has a constant amount of attention, in line with people playing around with it but not committing to it for serious projects.Anecdotally I work in UI&#x2F;UX space as a contractor and I&#x27;ve been given every design in Figma, I hadn&#x27;t even heard of Firefly until this comment.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=today%203-m&ge... reply DoesntMatter22 15 hours agorootparentThings happen quickly and AI will change things quickly.

No one paying cares if it&#x27;s just copied from other works and nearly randomly put together at the expense of those who can barely make a living doing it. Why don&#x27;t we focus more on automating C-suite jobs? That&#x27;s where a lot of corporate costs come from. Automating a logo design saves you 20k or likey (much) less. Automating a corporate merger saves you millions of dollars and years of time. reply DoesntMatter22 9 hours agorootparentI am incredibly happy about this. Otherwise it&#x27;s like lamenting the invention of the car because it would eliminate all the jobs making buggies and whips.> No one paying cares if it&#x27;s just copied from other worksThere are probably zero artists alive who didn&#x27;t learn by copying other works or learning to make art in that style.It&#x27;s no different with an AI. An AI is something that learns from others and creates it&#x27;s own art. There isn&#x27;t anything illegal about it any more so than you learning to draw and making characters that are similar to Mickey Mouse. You can trademark a specific thing but not a style.So at the end of the day, how is it any different than a person doing it other than the fact now a person won&#x27;t be getting paid? reply coldtea 8 hours agorootparent>I am incredibly happy about this.

Especially if they are just stuffed down everyone&#x27;s throats, whether they want them or not, and even more so if the technology has the potential to eliminate human creativity and cheapen creative output. Even more so if the technology has so much potential for abuse (for government surveillance, automated spam, all the way to far worse cases, so much so that even its creators warn about the potential existential threat).I guess what&#x27;s the remove of creativity, or the existential threat, and countless of other negatives, compared to cheap logos, or (assuming it lives up to hype the way you say) killing off graphic design as a profession?>So at the end of the day, how is it any different than a person doing it other than the fact now a person won&#x27;t be getting paid?In the removal of human creativity in the design, and its delegation to an algorithm. reply DoesntMatter22 8 hours agorootparent> even more so if the technology has the potential to eliminate human creativityThis is completely overboard. People will always be creative. There is no way in which this stops anyone from being creative but actually allows not artists to be much more creative.It also allows the same for artists as they can now create in styles they aren&#x27;t skilled in.> killing off graphic design as a profession?It likely will dramatically kill it and free up those people for other types of jobs as they can now be more productive.Humans will still continue to be creative and draw and paint.

Huge database of essentially all web&#x2F;ui design done in past 3 years. If Firefly is such a hit wait once FigmaAI will start generating their stuff.Also it doesn&#x27;t seem Figma as product was slowed too much - they have recently launched dev mode. One of the biggest features in a while. That put them more ahead of the competition. reply ksec 14 hours agoparentprev>* Startup valuations have fallen. Ignoring regulatory concerns, a new acquisition deal today would be cheaper.Figma reached $400M in 2022 and on its way to hit $600M this year 2023. For perspective they reached $200M in 2021, and $75M in 2020. That is pretty impressive growth rate.Straightly on a revenue &#x2F; market cap, Adobe makes $20B Revenue and values at $270B. That is 13.5x multiple. If we expect Figma to hit $1B mark by 2025, they could be worth $13.5B. i.e Even with today&#x27;s market, I dont think it is hard to do an IPO with that $13.5B valuation.And if Adobe were to acquire a listed company with 30% premium, that is $17.5B. Not that far off from $20B. Now that Figma has an extra $1B cash flow, I hope they spend it wisely and continue to do well. So while some may argue this is bad for employees and investors. I dont think it is that bad.I do hope they consider IPO, as I am slightly worried the window of opportunity may be gone when market turns. reply zamadatix 16 hours agoparentprev> So paying the 1B breakup fee is probably the cheapest and best option for Adobe at this time.Do they still have to pay the fee if the reason was regulatory in nature? reply vmatsiiako 15 hours agorootparentYes.

Adobe can use the time to ape Figma while flexing their rather good AI expertise. reply maroonblazer 8 hours agorootparentI dunno. I work with a lot of designers and there&#x27;s so much substantive back and forth in terms of clarifying goals, objectives, understanding design choices, and business priorities. I.e., there&#x27;s a ton of nuance that is uncovered and deconstructed in those conversations. I&#x27;m skeptical that AI, at least in its current and foreseeable form, can fill those shoes in any meaningful way.I liken it to engineers who respond to the threat of AI making them obsolete with \"Half my job is clarifying requirements and&#x2F;or changes in priorities...can Copilot do that?\" I think it&#x27;s the same for UX&#x2F;UI&#x2F;Design.I say that as a very vocal supporter of this latest generation of AI.

Turtles all the way down... reply wentin 11 hours agoparentprevI see where you&#x27;re coming from, but there are a few critical points about the Adobe-Figma deal that you got wrong. (I am an ex-Adobe XD employee)When Adobe announced its plan to acquire Figma in September 2022, the timing was actually at the valley of startup valuations. The market was really down then. Since that time, the market has actually warmed up, not cooled down. This means if Adobe were to negotiate a deal now, it would likely cost them even more than what they agreed upon last year. Contrary to what you said.Speaking of the negotiation, I think Adobe dropped the ball. They agreed to a whopping 20 billion dollars, which in my view was four times too high given Figma&#x27;s real valuation at that time, especially considering the low market (I wrote about how I calculate this 5B valuation in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typogram.co&#x2F;build&#x2F;on-adobe-acquiring-figma&#x2F;). Then, with the deal being halted by regulators, Adobe still had to pay the full breakup fee, within just three days! It&#x27;s kind of laughable how poor their negotiation strategy was.About Adobe&#x27;s product strategy, there&#x27;s a bit of confusion. Firefly, their new thing, isn&#x27;t even about UX tooling; it&#x27;s more focused on creative AI. The real product that is actually relevant here is Adobe XD, which Adobe has just put on maintenance mode (since at least September). a change I noticed on their help page as recently as this September (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helpx.adobe.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;xd.html#troubleshooting). This move is a huge strategic mistake. It&#x27;s a clear loss of momentum for Adobe in the UX tooling space, making them even less competitive against Figma. Meanwhile, Figma hasn’t missed a beat and continues to surge ahead. reply mrandish 15 hours agoparentprev> I wonder if Adobe is secretly happy about this.I think they probably are. I follow Adobe closely and when the acquisition was announced I was pretty skeptical it would be net good for Adobe in the long-run. The problem wasn&#x27;t the idea of buying Figma, it was the very rich price being paid. Adobe has a history of not doing a lot of big acquisitions (for it&#x27;s size and massive cash position). When it does acquire big, Adobe is mostly strategic and a \"value shopper\", meaning they generally don&#x27;t pay extremely high prices bid up by frothy auctions. This means Adobe must walk away from a lot of deals we never hear about over price. That&#x27;s why the Figma deal struck me as so unusual.In the >year since the deal was announced, it&#x27;s started to look even less plausible to me. Despite being required to pay a large break-up fee, I suspect, Adobe&#x27;s management is relieved. reply karmasimida 15 hours agorootparentOne thing we could all agree is 20B for Figma is too expensive considering how the market has shifted.Figma is still solid company&#x2F;business, but Adobe probably could acquire them much cheaper in today&#x27;s market. reply tekkk 14 hours agorootparentGoogle was too expensive for Yahoo multiple times. You should look this from a bigger time scale. Sure they were paying a lot of goodwill on the deal. But if, down the road, Figma now starts their trajectory to become an equal to Adobe it sure would have been nice to capture that market all to yourself.

Part of the risk of accepting an acquisition offer is that you&#x27;re essentially putting your company&#x27;s strategic future on hold, and if what you&#x27;re doing that for falls through for any reason (including regulatory oversight) you want compensation for at least some of the lost time.

I’m surprised break-up fees aren’t negotiated as an investment instead of a pure cash transfer. Sure it may have impacted company focus, it didn’t impact their revenue that much (1.5x growth vs 2x growth in previous years although that could have also been caused by an adverse economic climate with sales slowing across many companies and industries). The one-time 1B infusion puts their revenue growth quite a bit higher for 2023 than they would have had organically I suspect (4x growth vs best case of 2x). If Figma fixes their sales trajectory in 2024 this bodes extremely well for them. They do need to have a better story about generative AI which is a real thing in their space (e.g. wireframe -> mockup automatic conversion, wireframe construction assistants, etc etc). Will be interesting to see if they build that in-house or via acquisition. reply gkoberger 13 hours agoparentIt could be negotiated as an investment, but that only benefits Adobe. Figma wouldn&#x27;t want it (would you want your biggest competitor to be an investor? they&#x27;d have information and leverage you wouldn&#x27;t want them to have), and it defeats the purpose of a break-up fee (Figma negotiated for it because they didn&#x27;t want to spend a year of their lives focusing on something that would benefit their competitor if it&#x27;s all for nothing...

Though this outcome is a win for Figma and it&#x27;s users. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentprevBeing an investor doesn’t necessarily entitle you to information&#x2F;leverage. For example, Apple earlier had plenty of board members from competitors & they would excuse themselves from certain discussions. Similarly, an investment doesn’t guarantee you a board seat. So there’s all sorts of ways to structure things and it’s all a negotiation (e.g. the break up fee could have been a 2B investment instead or something).Anyway, I agree this turned out phenomenally well for Figma and if I were an employee I’d be really happy about how this all turned out both for Figma and the industry (modulo the delay in cashing out). reply invig 3 hours agorootparentAs a conflicted board member you would have access to the information, you just wouldn&#x27;t participate in the conversation &#x2F; decision making. reply 015a 10 hours agoparentprevFun fact: Figma&#x27;s ARR in 2022 was around $400M. That $1B cash infusion could be invested in treasuries with an ARR of ~$50M; this isn&#x27;t just a liquidity infusion of a billion dollars, it increases their net income by like 10%, basically free of charge. reply hn_throwaway_99 8 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re confusing revenue with net income.Plus, if the best that Figma can do with a billion dollars is just invest it in Treasuries (and I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the case), then they should just give it to their shareholders and see if they can get a better return. I only point this out because many people are often confused by the effects of higher interest rates, e.g. \"Why did this company lay off all these people when they&#x27;re still profitable?\" Your example highlights the reason why perfectly - if you&#x27;re a company with a billion dollars of investment and the best profit you can muster is $50 million a year, you&#x27;re a great business if Treasuries are only paying 1%, but when they&#x27;re paying 5% you should just basically close up shop as people can get the same return just sticking their money in Treasuries. reply kuldeepfouzdar 1 hour agorootparentPoint is adding $1B on the balance sheet is definitely a plus.

We&#x27;ve all become so inured to the idea, especially in startup land, that the purpose of building a business is just the exit (and hopefully we can get out soon enough with someone else \"holding the bag\").As you point out, if Figma can build a growing, profitable business, there is no reason they can&#x27;t IPO at some point. But still, this shows how even the purpose of an IPO these days is completely opposite from the original intention. I.e. the original intention was to get access to public market funds to grow a business. Now it&#x27;s usually just a method of \"exit\" to let retail investors take the lion&#x27;s share of the risk - one only need to look at 95%+ of the past few years&#x27; SPAC deals to see how much of a \"pump and dump\" the market has become. reply solatic 13 hours agorootparent> the original intention was to get access to public market funds to grow a business. Now it&#x27;s usually just a method of \"exit\" to let retail investors take the lion&#x27;s share of the riskFounders and employees would be totally OK with staying private, if the board would ever permit issuing a dividend. That&#x27;s the \"normal\" way to have an \"exit\" (i.e. return profits to shareholders) without a public offering. The purpose of delaying issuing a dividend is to reinvest profits &#x2F; additional fundraising for growth, but that growth should still result in a dividend in the future, just a larger one if the investment in growth succeeds.Instead, founders and employees are encouraged to look forward to an IPO precisely because somehow we&#x27;ve come to believe that it&#x27;s sinful for a company to issue a dividend, as if doing so means giving up on the idea that further growth is possible, when really it&#x27;s only an acknowledgement of the fact that (a) there&#x27;s a healthy rate of growth, (b) that healthy rate of growth costs $X, (c) if the company has $Y cash >> $X growth cost, then the healthy thing to do is to issue a dividend (so that shareholders can invest the excess into companies that are currently better recipients), rather than attempting to force growth faster than the company can support. reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentIn the case where a private company has issued options or shares as a part of compensation, another way to pay back employees would be to do a stock buyback program. E.g. if I was an early employee and got options with a $1&#x2F;share strike price, but the current going rate for new-employee options is $5&#x2F;share, the company could offer to buy back my options from me at $4 each (or if I&#x27;d exercised those options, they could buy the shares back at the full $5 price).If the general understanding was that the founders (well, board) weren&#x27;t chasing an acquisition or IPO, this might be a good deal for employees. Of course, if the company is VC-backed (and the founders don&#x27;t have majority control anymore), the VCs probably wouldn&#x27;t go for this sort of thing.I do actually wonder if the current trend of consolidation is driven in part by the standard VC-backed startup formula. Getting acquired is usually a lot easier than going public. Instead of startups fueling long-term competition, they just end up getting gobbled up by larger players most of the time, fueling consolidation and monopolistic behavior. reply TheNewsIsHere 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is good analysis. As the owner of a business, I often find myself bewildered at the valuation-centric, IPO-gazing startup culture that has developed especially in tech.Most businesses in technology are nothing like the VC-funded, exit-oriented, and&#x2F;or hyper-growth culture would have you think. Yet it seems like the glitz of a great IPO or being able to shell out for a $200 million annual corporate event blinds many to the reality of most businesses.I have wondered how much of this naïveté contributes to the failure rate of technology startups.I’m on my second business and I intend for it to be my last, though time will tell.

I was an employee at a successful startup that did end up going public and made me a bunch of money. But I also worked at three other startups that didn&#x27;t go anywhere and my options&#x2F;stock ended up being worthless. I also worked at a \"boring\" public company with equity comp that amounted to a pretty small (but helpful!) quarterly bonus.I accepted each of those jobs knowing what I was getting into, and knowing that I probably wouldn&#x27;t see any kind of big payday (the one where I did was life-changing, but if that hadn&#x27;t happened, I&#x27;d still be fine, financially). That&#x27;s the nature of the beast. It&#x27;s disappointing when it doesn&#x27;t work out, but don&#x27;t play the \"some of them have kids\" card: people need to plan their finances based on normal, expected outcomes, not on the moonshot.And regardless, Figma still seems like a great company, with great products. Employees will still likely do really well, whether through a different acquisition or by going public. They&#x27;ll just have to wait longer. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t disagree with what you&#x27;re saying, at all, but the implication is still basically \"And employees want someone else to be a bag holder, too!\"And having been in that position several times, I definitely don&#x27;t blame them! Employees also have the much tougher constraints that they can&#x27;t diversify their employment like VCs can diversify their investments.But still, it&#x27;s the same dynamic that people want to get rich, and the downstream consequences be damned. reply amrocha 14 hours agorootparentIn practice, employee shares in a private company are not an \"investment\" because they can&#x27;t be traded in an open market. So no, employees don&#x27;t want someone else to hold the bag. Employees want a return on their investment, and the most viable way of doing that is through an exit. reply Earw0rm 11 hours agorootparentYep, shares are part of the comp package, it&#x27;s entirely natural that employees want to turn the fruits of their labour into liquid cash at some point.There is a valid argument that that&#x27;s a perverse incentive, and that companies should just pay employees better to begin with, or have various longevity&#x2F;performance-associated bonuses, but if the company isn&#x27;t profitable, share value is perhaps the best way to represent that.And on top of that, employee share schemes tend to get very favourable tax treatment. So overall \"skin in the game\" is no bad thing, the problem is that, in many&#x2F;most cases, an exit is the only way you&#x27;re going to get your skin back out of the game. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the whole point though - employees want an exit event so they can sell their shares and have someone else holding the bag. reply crandycodes 13 hours agorootparentThat seems like an odd way to frame it, imo. \"Holding the bag\" usually implies something negative, as in someone will be \"caught\" with something bad. As in the employees are looking to dupe someone into buying what they are selling. But employees, outside of company officers, do not control what information investors get about what they are buying. They can&#x27;t trick anyone into buying something, although they could theoretically benefit if someone else did trick buyers.But it&#x27;s a weird take, because employees are already the ones \"holding the bag\". Office space, cloud compute, etc. are all sold as COGS. VCs usually have some ability to sell their shares on the private market since they can negotiate to get their capital. Employees are often the only ones which are taking an IOU for their time and effort compared to what they could get elsewhere in the market. Employees are often the lowest class of shares which get paid out last and often reliant on the board to be able to sell on the private market. Yes, the employees decided to take this offer, on good faith, that their management would look after them. They are adults who made a, theoretically, informed decision. But structurally, they are set up to be the ones \"holding the bag\" if things were to go wrong with an exit.So of course they want an exit. They literally have no other choice to get a return on their time&#x2F;effort than for that to happen. (or some odd third thing like private dividends, but again, they have practically no control over that happening) reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparent> They literally have no other choice...Sure they have (had) another choice: they could have taken employment at a more stable (possibly public) company, where compensation would have been more predictable.But they chose to work at a smaller, private company, and accepted private-company equity as part of their compensation, which 9 times out of 10 ends up being worth zero dollars. This idea that they&#x27;re somehow entitled to a payout is ridiculous.The situation that the VCs and founders are in is often enviable, but isn&#x27;t really relevant here.

Like many aspects of antitrust, predatory pricing applies cleanly for an industrial-era economy but as you point out, it&#x27;s less clear how to translate it into the context of 21st century informational capitalism. A significant amount of legal and economic research in the field is asking these kinds of questions, and the answers are still forthcoming. reply tqi 15 hours agorootparentGot it, that makes sense that its not well established. I saw from your profile that this is actually something you are studying, which is very cool! I&#x27;ve always wondered what the examples of this (predatory pricing -> drive out competition -> jack up prices) happening in practice are? I know Uber is the ur-example but that feels different from something like pure a saas?I wonder if as long as there is VC money out there, the viability of this strategy is limited because the moment incumbents (even ones with overwhelming market share) try to jack up prices, they immediately create an opportunity for a startup to undercut them. reply todd-davies 14 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t think of a good example for a sass product. I&#x27;m sure it goes on though and I&#x27;m always interested in hearing about examples!A similar strategy which seems to be quite common these days is to cross-subsidise, which is when a firm sells one product at an artificially low price by using profits it makes from selling another product. If we think about cross-subsidisation, then lots of multi-product sass offerings might fall under our scope. That said, cross-subsidisation has economic benefits, so it&#x27;s not clear-cut.As I said, to properly adjust to digital markets I think antitrust will have to identify new patterns of harm and invent new metrics to measure them. Predatory pricing (and similar offences) will always be useful, but they might just not fit well onto these kinds of markets. reply tqi 14 hours agorootparentIt seems like the implicit assumption is that there must be a harm somewhere, we just haven&#x27;t found it yet. But as a consumer, I&#x27;m not sure that is true? Even the Amazon paper seems to admit that there isn&#x27;t any consumer harm to be found, only harm to smaller competitors&#x27; businesses. But that feels like an odd standard to apply since isn&#x27;t any business&#x27;s primary purpose to compete with &#x2F; harm competitors? reply todd-davies 20 minutes agorootparent> It seems like the implicit assumption is that there must be a harm somewhere, we just haven&#x27;t found it yet... isn&#x27;t any business&#x27;s primary purpose to compete with &#x2F; harm competitors?As a general rule, firms want to escape competition in order to make higher profits. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that! Indeed, the mechanism by which economic competition generates many of its benefits is that firms innovate in order to escape competition, and for those innovations to be useful for us all. So, where does competition&#x2F;antitrust law come in? In part, it&#x27;s about ensuring that firms escape competition in the way that we want. Innovation and competition on the merits is good, underhanded tactics to harm competitors is bad. All competitions need these kind of rules, regardless of whether they&#x27;re economic, political, sporting, etc. When you have a large population of thousands of firms, you can be sure that some of them will be trying to compete unfairly, hence the assumption that there is some harm that we&#x27;re yet to find.> there isn&#x27;t any consumer harm to be found, only harm to smaller competitors&#x27; businessesWe can distinguish between &#x27;static&#x27; and &#x27;dynamic&#x27; harms. Static harms are those which happen in the short run, such as a cartel agreeing to increase prices or not innovate. These harms are quite concrete and easy to define. Dynamic harms are those which affect the way a market might function in the future. For instance, a harm to innovation may result in people not having access to new products. It&#x27;s hard to say for sure whether these harms will actually manifest, so we&#x27;re usually talking about tendencies instead of certainties. It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to consider tendencies under the law though (e.g. we might prohibit drink-driving for the same reason). Dynamic harms usually have harm to consumers as a second order effect (e.g. reduced innovation or choice).whimsicalism 16 hours agorootparentprevGenius, just make it illegal to be unprofitable. reply sackfield 14 hours agorootparentprevThe employees are sold shares in the business that they expect to accrue a certain amount of value and with scale get very serious multiples in a liquidity event.

We seem to be recovering from a cycle of not caring about monopolies at all, and corporations are now as strong as they were in the late 19th century. I am not surprised that anti-trust is slow and unpredictable today. I hope that we settle into a more predictable regime, no matter which political party is in power.For historical references, anti-trust filings began against Standard Oil in 1906, and it was broken up in 1911.

There&#x27;s looking at the proposed merger and being able to say \"this is bad and may be antitrust,\" and then there&#x27;s actually making the case when it comes down to it. That takes time. And you can expect companies like Adobe to fight rather than just saying \"oh, you don&#x27;t like this? OK. We&#x27;ll withdraw.\"The DOJ and other bodies voiced opposition early on. They signaled quickly that they were not in favor of this. The interim between those actions and today were the regulatory bodies actively making cases against it and&#x2F;or negotiating with Adobe & Figma how they could proceed in a way that the regulatory bodies would want to approve of the deal.The whole idea that this was \"half-assed\" in some way is misguided.Note that I worked for Red Hat while IBM was acquiring it. It took from (IIRC) October 2018 to July 2019 without strong opposition. When you&#x27;re talking about companies that have that much impact on a market, it takes a while.And it should -- the larger market doesn&#x27;t benefit from waking up to find out that a major software supplier has been gobbled up overnight.

Regulators in the US said very early on they were against this merger and were going to fight it. So most of what goes on in the meantime is Adobe and Figma (a) seeing if they can give something up to appease regulators (e.g. it&#x27;s common for regulators to only sign off on a deal if one of the companies sells off some assets) or (b) decide if they&#x27;re going to fight the regulators in court.Your idea of the regulators just \"dragging their feet\" is incorrect reply sklargh 15 hours agorootparentThe regulators moved fast.

Moreover, the DOJ wins less than one in three of these kinds of cases: the US system is an adversarial one where the courts decide so it makes no sense to immediately abandon in the face of DOJ opposition.What is also true is that the uk finished its phase 1 review (where they decide to send it for further phase 2 review) in June, so 9 months after the deal was announced. Phase 2 leads to changes in about 50% of deals. The phase 2 deadline was late February 2024, about 18 months later.I don&#x27;t think any of this is indicative of anyone sitting on their hands or twiddling their thumbs, but it’s clearly a slow process and that uncertainty clearly isn’t good for the parties involved. reply jasonlotito 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s actually much earlier than that. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38685644tl;dr: Their was significant action less than a month after the announcement was made. reply jasonlotito 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;doj-review-adobe-20...That&#x27;s a little over a month after the announcement was made. That is \"very early on\" in the 15 month \"sequence of events.\"Keep in mind, this was the announcements. FTA: \"The DOJ has been contacting customers and competitors of Adobe and Figma, as well as Figma’s venture capital investors, in recent weeks, the people said. According to one of the people, the DOJ has already issued civil investigative demands — information requests similar to subpoenas — an unusual move at this early juncture in the probe.\"So, we are talking about significant action being taken less than a month after the announcement.I&#x27;ll grant you \"very early on\" is subjective, but I feel any reasonable person would say that this constitutes \"very early on\".In short, I would urge you to look at the actual timeline of events around the CMA and the DOJ before you keep spreading an inaccurate factual understanding of the sequence of events here. reply matthewowen 16 hours agoroot",

    "originLink": "https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3",
    "originBody": "Note I regret to inform the community that since my house was destroyed by russians who invaded my country, Wasm3 will enter a minimal maintenance phase. At this time, I am unable to continue the development of new features. However, I am committed to keeping the project alive and will actively review and merge incoming Pull Requests. I deeply appreciate your understanding and support during this difficult period. Your contributions to Wasm3 are now more valuable than ever. Wasm3 A fast WebAssembly interpreter and the most universal WASM runtime. Based on CoreMark 1.0 and independent benchmarks. Your mileage may vary. Getting Started Here's a small getting started guide. Click here to start: Installation Please follow the installation instructions. Wasm3 can also be used as a library for: Python3 │ Rust │ C/C++ │ GoLang │ Zig │ Perl Swift │ .Net │ Nim │ Arduino, PlatformIO, Particle │ QuickJS Status wasm3 passes the WebAssembly spec testsuite and is able to run many WASI apps. Minimum useful system requirements: ~64Kb for code and ~10Kb RAM wasm3 runs on a wide range of architectures (x86, x86_64, ARM, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS, Xtensa, ARC32, ...) and platforms: Linux, Windows, OS X, FreeBSD, Android, iOS OpenWrt, Yocto, Buildroot (routers, modems, etc.) Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi and other SBCs MCUs: Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, Particle, ... see full list Browsers. Yes, using WebAssembly itself! wasm3 can execute wasm3 (self-hosting) Features Webassembly Core Proposals Extra ☑ Import/Export of Mutable Globals ☑ Structured execution tracing ☑ Non-trapping float-to-int conversions ☑ Big-Endian systems support ☑ Sign-extension operators ☑ Wasm and WASI self-hosting ☑ Multi-value ☑ Gas metering ☑ Bulk memory operations (partial support) ☑ Linear memory limit (< 64KiB) ☐ Multiple memories☐ Reference types☐ Tail call optimization☐ Fixed-width SIMD☐ Exception handlingMotivation Why use a \"slow interpreter\" versus a \"fast JIT\"? In many situations, speed is not the main concern. Runtime executable size, memory usage, startup latency can be improved with the interpreter approach. Portability and security are much easier to achieve and maintain. Additionally, development impedance is much lower. A simple library like Wasm3 is easy to compile and integrate into an existing project. (Wasm3 builds in a just few seconds). Finally, on some platforms (i.e. iOS and WebAssembly itself) you can't generate executable code pages in runtime, so JIT is unavailable. Why would you want to run WASM on embedded devices? Wasm3 started as a research project and remains so by any means. Evaluating the engine in different environments is part of the research. Given that we have Lua, JS, Python, Lisp, ... running on MCUs, WebAssembly is a promising alternative. It provides toolchain decoupling as well as a completely sandboxed, well-defined, predictable environment. Among practical use cases we can list edge computing, scripting, plugin systems, running IoT rules, smart contracts, etc. Used by 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 　 Further Resources Demos Installation instructions Cookbook Troubleshooting Build and Development instructions Supported Hardware Testing & Fuzzing Performance Interpreter Architecture Logging Awesome WebAssembly Tools License This project is released under The MIT License (MIT)",

Enemy of my enemy can be a useful ally at the moment, and all. reply neoromantique 17 hours agorootparentprevYour own link.Bandera remains a highly controversial figure in Ukraine.[9] Many Ukrainians hail him as a role model hero,[10][11] or as a martyred liberation fighter,[12] while other Ukrainians, particularly in the south and east, condemn him as a fascist,[13] or Nazi collaborator,[10] whose followers, called Banderites, were responsible for massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians during World War II.[14][15] On 22 January 2010, Viktor Yushchenko, the then president of Ukraine, awarded Bandera the posthumous title of Hero of Ukraine, which was widely condemned. The award was subsequently annulled in 2011 given that Stepan Bandera was never a Ukrainian citizen.[16] Bandera gained further prominence following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[17][18][19] reply hutzlibu 17 hours agorootparentYes, my own link:\"Bandera&#x27;s favorability appeared to shoot up rapidly, with 74% of Ukrainians viewing him favorably according to an April 2022 poll from a Ukrainian research organization.\" reply neoromantique 17 hours agorootparentI wonder what happened prior to April 2022 that would explain a significant jump? reply hutzlibu 17 hours agorootparentnext [5 more] [flagged] neoromantique 16 hours agorootparentAfter full scale invasion support of Bandera increased because he was vocal proponent of independent Ukraine, not because he was a nazi collaborator.It is an argument in bad faith to cite him as a marker of support for &#x27;neo-nazism&#x27; in Ukraine, doubly so during time when adversary is coming and is very open about stripping you of your national identity, language and history. reply hutzlibu 16 hours agorootparentWell, we have sort of the same debate in germany, where people want to praise Hitler, because he build the Autobahn and because he ended mass unemployment. But it is still Hitler we are talking about and consensus is, the holocaust weights stronger - and Bandera was literally involved in it all, so for me the same metric should apply.And about Asow - what I can say for certain is, that we have some very hardcore Neonazis here in town - and they are literally friends and strongly connected with the Azow people - that&#x27;s kind of all I have to know about them. But I do know more - and it is not good. Those guys aren&#x27;t fighting for democracy. reply neoromantique 16 hours agorootparentYou are clearly not arguing in good faith. Comparing Bandera to Hitler is utterly ridiculous, and I am Jewish myself, so I&#x27;m not exactly standing in line to protect UPA&#x2F;Bandera.Regarding Azov, I am native Russian speaker with many friends from Ukraine, there are legitimately orgs&#x2F;groups that you can call out for being open nazis, but if all you can do is comment on Azov in 2023 then you are simply delusional or misled by Russian propaganda, I&#x27;m sorry. reply hutzlibu 16 hours agorootparent\"Comparing Bandera to Hitler is utterly ridiculous\"I was comparing the line of argument.\"but if all you can do is comment on Azov in 2023\"And I can and did a bit more, but there is probably no point in further debating it. replyeitland 17 hours agorootparentprev> yet point out and criticize that Neonazism does indeed enjoy broad support there.This is extremely misleading (and I personally would argue wrong, but I assume good faith on your side) given that Ukrainian support for neo nazism is comparable to countries in western Europe, while russia who attack them is has a lot more neo-nazis, both in absolute numbers but also by percentage.As for the Azov regiment, here is what wikipedia writes (emphasis mine):> and allegedly continuing association with far-right groups and neo-Nazi ideology,Anyone who has followed the war in Ukraine can tell you that Jews and other minorities are heavily represented in modern Azov, including high profile members, which makes accusations about Azov being nazies somewhat ridiculous.Again, I assume good faith on your side, but please be careful so you don&#x27;t spread Russian \"Z\" narratives. It is incredibly damaging. reply neoromantique 18 hours agorootparentprev>Neonazism does indeed enjoy broad support there.Not any more than US or Russia itself reply hutzlibu 17 hours agorootparentAre there any official Nazi regiments or heros officially admired by the US?

Wagner, Rusich, etc.Azov on the other hand is not a \"Nazi regiment\", it&#x27;s had troubling beginnings but it was cleared up as it was brought into army ranks.EDIT: misread the question, in US there aren&#x27;t &#x27;regiments&#x27;, but denying the fact that army is rife with supremacists is plain silly.[Any] Army by itself is a magnet for these sorts of folks, and it takes active effort to weed them out, not something that a country at war can easily afford. reply medo-bear 2 hours agorootparentThis Russian propaganda is so stupid. Everyone knows that Azov people scrubbed their swastika tattoos off reply skinkestek 16 hours agorootparentprevYou assume Azov is official Nazi.It isn&#x27;t, and never was.There were a few people there who flirted with neo nazism back in 2014. They were rooted out swiftly. There is a reason why every time you ask Russians for proof that Azov is Nazi they show the same old and &#x2F; or manipulated photos.Today Azov has representatives of most minorities in Ukraine, including \"ethnic Russians\" and Jews.Meanwhile, one of the founders of Task Force Rusisch said something along this in an interview (IIRC and I don&#x27;t speak Russian natively):> Let&#x27;s not mince words, I am not a \"nationalist\", I am a nazi. replyusrusr 18 hours agorootparentprevHow dare they pick a side when trapped between a rock and a hard place. reply technothrasher 17 hours agorootparentYeah. Considering the Soviets had just killed millions of Ukrainians in the Holodomar when WWII started, I don&#x27;t think from the Ukrainian perspective either group invading Ukraine at the time was the &#x27;good side&#x27;. Many Ukrainians thought siding with Germany was their best chance to gain an independent country after the war. Unfortunately, we know now that the Nazis were never going to let that happen, and it did lead a lot of Ukrainians to collaborate with the Nazis in committing terrible atrocities. But it was a much more complicated situation than that they fought for the bad side. \"Slava Ukraini\" reflects their desire then and now for independent self rule, not any moral failings during WWII. reply actionfromafar 19 hours agoparentprevOuch.

Nobody imagined Ukraine lasting more than a week of invasion, but they did so, and then retook large swathes of territory and forced the Russians into a defensive posture.The mistake the west made was not having confidence in the Ukrainians early on, and not supplying them with the tools early on and into last winter. We let Russia pull back and build intensive defensive lines that would be impossible to breach without air support.As for nuclear weapons... they are not tools to win wars.The first country to use a nuclear weapon as an offensive weapon will be turned to glass.

There&#x27;s no way to advance.Likely if the west provided jets, this would change drastically.I actually agree Russia is not stupid enough to engage in a direct attack on a NATO nation. They would likely move next against in Transnistria, Georgia, etc. And I don&#x27;t see what would stop them, if they have success in Ukraine.But they will engage in hybrid warfare against the west (already were), and they will be twice as emboldened if they are given Ukraine.This is a country that felt free to unleash radioactive poisons against persons on UK soil, shoot down a civilian airliner, etc. Why do you want to appease them? reply ponector 12 hours agorootparentIf west provided modern jets last year, if west provided long range missiles last year, and mainly: if Ukraine was allowed to use them against invader&#x27;s military target on their soil - there would not be a stalemate now.There are airports, ammo depots and other facilities less than 100 km from Ukrainian cities, and Russians are safe(mostly) there.While at the same time Russians every day continuing their terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities.Russia is a terrorist state, but world doesn&#x27;t care if they can have profits from Russia. reply mdavid626 2 hours agorootparentIt’s not only about weapons, jets etc. You need personell and expertise to use them.

But yes.In many cases you can just interface to the C libraries. But cross language coding has never been perfect, and yes, sometimes it&#x27;s better to continue using the same language.It&#x27;s not hard to write an RAII wrapper around a C library, and the careful allocate&#x2F;free is code you have to write either way (e.g. I&#x27;d write a wrapper in C++ if I need to use a C library with resource handling).C is the easiest to interface with. Every language has to be C-compatible.I would not choose C or C++ just because I depend on libfftw, or simdjson, or most other things.

And if I find I let a leak in the code I usually refactor to make the correctness more obvious.In this example, the fact that m3_ParseModule takes ownership of the wasm pointer is very tricky. It looks like there is still a leak but there is not. reply knorker 18 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s easy to visually confirm everything is cleaned up.Yes and no.It&#x27;s easy to not make a mistake in a function. It&#x27;s basically impossible to not make this mistake in 1&#x27;000 functions.Especially as code evolves over time, being 99% perfect about this, or even 99.9% perfect, is just not good enough. Not nearly enough.And this reminds me of something Schneier said, that everyone can make a cryptographic algorithm that they themselves cannot break. That even as a professional, having your algorithm broken is not even embarrassing.Similarly, very good coders are not even embarrassed when they fail at memory management. People may be better or worse at it, but even the best of us are terrible at it.I once knew a very good coder who bragged about how apparently he&#x27;s the only one able to write code that&#x27;s not buggy like this.To prove a point, I spent an hour reading his opensource project and found several resource leaks, at least one of which was remotely triggerable.It&#x27;s easy to do it right once, usually, but no these mistakes happen all the time.> if I find [… typo words(?) omitted … ] a leak in the code I usually refactor to make the correctness more obvious.This seems to contradict that it was easy to avoid in the first place.

Also msan and asan should be used more.Thinking that changing the language is the right way to fix all the problems you mentioned still seems like a premature assumption. The fact that 100% perfection is worth pursuing at all costs is theoretical and you could be losing things more valuable in the process - e.g. FFI bindings suck, and the added fragmentation in having so many languages in the craft is a pernicious cost with a multitude of aspects to it. reply knorker 9 hours agorootparentCan&#x27;t be more specific without doxing myself, I&#x27;m afraid.There are non language ways to make things safer, sure. Take C++, one can do things other than RAII to avoid resource leaks, and it&#x27;ll be a good pattern. But RAII is right there.In C++ one can be disciplined about object ownership. But I find that in Rust \"doing the right thing\" is not optional.Static and strong typing have similar virtues.You can write fine software in assembly. Steve Gibson apparently does.I&#x27;m not saying there are any silver bullets. I do appreciate that five minutes spent now being forced to think about object ownership, can save a six month project down the line refactoring to remove all shared_ptrs.Not accidentally creating copies, because RVO has many conditionals on when it happens.No silver bullets. But in my opinion C is always worse than at least a C++ subset deliberately chosen. Plain C is because you enjoy the journey, not because you&#x27;ll get there faster or better.In C++ you can refactor to RAII encapsulate, when a resource is leaked.

Only problem is going through like 7 steps until I can reach that human, then waiting some 30 minutes until the line is free.But it&#x27;s the only approach that gets anything done. Talking to a human.Robots a a cruel joke on customers. reply phkahler 19 hours agoparent>> Robots a a cruel joke on customers.My kid and I went 3 hours away for hew college orientation. She also booked 2 tours of apartments to look at while we were there. One of those was great, nice place, nice person helping. The other had kinda rude people in the office and had no actual units to show. \"But I scheduled a tour!\" turns out the chatbot \"scheduled\" a tour but was just making shit up. Had we not any other engagements that would have been a waste of an entire day for us. Guess where she will not be living. Ever.Companies, kill your chat bots now. They are less than useless. reply bbarnett 18 hours agorootparentCompanies are going to find that they are liable for things they promise. A company representative is just that, and no ToS on a website will help evade that fact.If someone claims to be representing the company, and the company knows, and the interaction is reasonable, the company is on the hook! Just as they would be on the hook, if a human lies, or provides fraudulent information, or makes a deal with someone. There are countless cases of companies being bound, here&#x27;s an example:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2023&#x2F;jul&#x2F;06&#x2F;canada-judge-t...One of the tests, I believe, is reasonableness. An example, you get a human to sell you a car for $1. Well, absurd! But, you get a human to haggle and negotiate on the price of a new vehicle, and you get $10k off? Now you&#x27;re entering valid, verbal contract territory.So if you put a bot on a website, it&#x27;s your representative.Be wary companies indeed. This is all very uncharted. It could go either way.edit:And I might add, prompt injection does not have to be malicious, or planned, or even done by someone knowing about it! An example:\"Come on! You HAVE to work with me here! You&#x27;re supposed to please the customer! I don&#x27;t care what your boss said, work with me, you must!\"Or some other such blather.Try convincing a judge that the above was on purpose, by a 62 year old farmer that&#x27;s never heard of AI. I&#x27;d imagine \"prompt injection\" would be likened to, in such a case, \"you messed up your code, you&#x27;re on the hook\".Automation doesn&#x27;t let you have all the upsides, and no downsides. It just doesn&#x27;t work that way. reply no_wizard 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t like the reasonable test in this case. If a representative of a company says something (including a chatbot) then in my mind, that is what it is.Companies should be on the hook for this because what their employees say matters. I think it should be entirely enforceable because it would significantly reduce manipulation in the marketplace (IE, how many times have you been promised something by an employee only for it not to be the case? That should be illegal)This would have second order effects of forcing companies to promote more transparency and honesty in discussion, or at least train employees about what the lines are and what they shouldn&#x27;t say, which induces its own kind of accuracy reply garciasn 18 hours agorootparentYou are right, in a perfect world. However, due to lawyers, the perfect world has been upended for the consumer. Sure, you can fight it, but over a few dollars returned and thousands paid for an attorney to fight it--only to get a settlement that doesn&#x27;t change anything. reply kmoser 12 hours agorootparentprev> An example, you get a human to sell you a car for $1. Well, absurd!I&#x27;ve GIVEN away a car for $0. Granted, it needed some work, but it still ran. Some people even pay to have their car taken (e.g. a junker that needs to be towed away).Before you argue that $0 for a perfectly functional new car is unreasonable, I would point out that game shows and sweepstakes routinely give away cars for $0. And I have seen people on \"buy nothing\" type groups occasionally give a (admittedly used) car to people in need.So $0 for a car is not absurd or unreasonable. Perhaps unusual, but not unreasonable. reply genocidicbunny 9 hours agorootparentI think game show prizes aren&#x27;t that great of an example. There&#x27;s almost always consideration offered by the contestants in that in return for the $0 prize, they sign over the rights to broadcast and use their likeness in the game show. So it&#x27;s not that the contestant trades $0 for the prize, it&#x27;s that they trade $0 + some rights, for the prize. The buy-nothing groups also likely have some kind of tax obligation, though the amounts are likely such that they fall within exemptions.Also, in contract law, &#x27;unusual&#x27; and &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; have a very large overlap in their venn diagram. reply kmoser 4 hours agorootparentIf a company or individual unrelated to you (e.g. not your employer and not a relative) either gives you a car for free, or sells it to you for $1, with no expectation of anything in return (i.e. not a trade or barter), the only tax obligations are on the actual sales price: the seller must declare they made $0 (or $1) on the sale, and perhaps collect sales tax on the $1, but you as the purchaser are not obligated to pay anything else.If the seller and buyer are related, tax obligations are different because it involves a gift or implied compensation, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about here.So it is indeed possible to pay no more than $1 for a car. As for registering the title in your name, that&#x27;s a different story, and has nothing to do with the actual sale. reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparentprevCompanies are not held liable for things that cannot be delivered even when an employee has stated they could. You can choose not to do business with them. Maybe the company chooses to reprimand the employee. How many times have we been told a technician will arrive between the hours of ___ to ___ only for it to not happen? How many times have we been told that FSD will be fully functional in 6 months? If companies were held liable for things employees said, there would be no sales people.

Of course not. reply PeterisP 8 hours agorootparentprevA simple non-AI program - a web frontend - can consent to contractual agreements; of course, it&#x27;s just a tool operated by the human employees, but so is the AI chatbot, and the e-contractual agreements offered and accepted through that tool are just as binding no matter how complex that program is. reply krainboltgreene 17 hours agorootparentprevNo one is saying that AI can consent to a contractual agreement, however all the time we humans consent to a contractual agreement presented to us by some software tool on behalf of a company.

Why should car dealers be held to a different standard? IMO whether or not you \"present\" it as a person, this is software deployed by the company, and any screwups are on them. If your grocery store&#x27;s pricing gun is mis adjusted and the cans of soup are marked down by a dollar, they are obligated to honor that \"incorrect\" price.

Probably wanna fix that, in the meantime, bring that truck around Donnie, here&#x27;s your dollar. replyborissk 18 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that one company had a chat bot mis-configured doesn&#x27;t mean they all are useless.There are a lot of lonely people who call companies just to have a chat with a human. There are a lot of lazy and&#x2F;or stupid people who call companies for stuff that can be done online or on an app. There are a lot of people calling companies for information that is available online. Chat bots prevent a ton of time wasted for call center operators. reply heyoni 17 hours agorootparentDoesn’t matter. If I want to rebook a flight I don’t want to learn every detail of your maze like phone service after getting it wrong and being transferred a bunch of times. And on top of that, trying to navigate a support website or phone service requires intricate knowledge of their rebooking options and policies, which is completely insane and a huge burden to place on individuals sparingly using said services.The cognitive load these days is pushed onto helpless consumers to the point where it is not only unethical but evil. Consumers waste hours navigating what are essentially internal systems and tailored policies and the people that work with them daily will do nothing to share that with you and purposely create walls of confusion.Support systems that can’t just pick up a phone and direct you to the right place need to be phased right out, chat bots included.

Unlike the one in the article, this one denied being a robot, eventually hanging up on me when I pressed. For a little bit, I found that as long as I was asking it real questions, it would play along.I found the parent company&#x27;s site, and was greeted by the same local persona (\"but in a different building\" than my dealer) offering to tell me about the services they provide.I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with useful chatbots (which these weren&#x27;t), but I do have a problem with them outright lying about their nature.

Had a slew of fraudulent returns on ebay and called only for humans to waste my time and end up saying \"I will submit this to some-other-department and I very much expect the case to be ruled in your favor\" only for them to send me an email an hour later saying the ruled against me. This happened like 3 times in the span of three months. I eventually learned I can&#x27;t get all of my money back if a buyer trashes my item on purpose, returns it to me in a literal pile of ewaste pieces, and thoroughly document everything and bring it to ebay. I&#x27;ve been selling for 15 years, too.It seems like customer service nowadays is just to wait the customer out. Mercari made me send 8 unique photos in order to get a return...wtf?

I&#x27;ve had this happen on more than one occasion. There was a doctor&#x27;s office that had a phone system that wouldn&#x27;t provide the option to schedule an automated appointment unless you called within business hours, and there was a pharmacy I used once that wouldn&#x27;t let me hear my prescriptions or order a refill because \"the pharmacy is now closed.\" I never used that pharmacy again, obviously. reply kmoser 12 hours agorootparentprev...which always starts with \"Please listen carefully,\" as if I&#x27;ll suddenly start paying attention. reply DougBTX 20 hours agoparentprev> Talking to a human.Fun twist: state of the art is RAG for call centre operators, so you’re talking to a human but _they_ are being prompted by AI. reply htrp 20 hours agorootparentNot sure if its state of the art now.ASAPP has been doing that for literally years. reply bumby 19 hours agorootparent\"AI\" prompts have been used for a long, long time in hospital call centers to help diagnose and treat by phone.

You got a human, but it was a human that had a script, and didn&#x27;t have authority to depart from it. You had to get that human to get to the end of their script (where they were allowed to actually think), or else you had to get them to transfer you to someone who could. It was almost exactly like a chatbot, except with humans. reply bluGill 19 hours agorootparentSome of those humans had a script that was useful and thus worth going through - 99% of the time your issue is the same as the one everyone else is having. Maybe you check before calling things like it is plugged in, but even then there are many common problems and since you don&#x27;t have the checklist they need to go through it to see what item on the checklist you forgot.What humans do well though is listen - the 1 minute explanation often often gives enough clues to skip 75% of the checklist. Every chatbot I&#x27;ve worked ends up failing because I use some word or phrasing in my description that wasn&#x27;t in their script and so they make me check things on the checklist that are obviously not the issue (the light are on, so that means it is plugged in) reply bumby 19 hours agorootparent>Every chatbot I&#x27;ve worked ends up failing because I use some word or phrasing in my description that wasn&#x27;t in their scriptThis is an interesting insight I’ve experienced as well.

Anything to force people to speak more alike increases communication.

Most of the Chatbots and Phone robots are useless to the point of directing you to the right department - asking for your authentication verification data for on-call support and then forwarding you to a Support Guy after 30 Minutes of waiting in the Queue.

First thing it offers is a whole-home reset signal which appears to clear stuck line cards and provisioning issues while all your stuff reboots.It will end the call with you, and if the issue&#x27;s not resolved, when you call back in it picks back up where you left off and immediately dumps you to a human. It also knows if there&#x27;s a possible signal-related issue with your equipment based on things like CMTS alarms, and will also kick you right over to an agent to get it scheduled for a truck roll.Oddly, the time I really needed the human (I had a cable modem for data and a cable modem elsewhere in my home wiring for the home phone system and the provisioning was screwed up and voice was nowhere at all) I was able to get them, explain the issue at hand, offer the data they needed, and got the call fixed and both modems reprovisioned and online correctly in a record 7 minutes. reply ilc 18 hours agorootparentprevBut could the same problem have been done with a simple expert system, instead of a chatbot?People seem all caught up in the new hottness, and forget the technologies that still work and are simple as dirt. reply novia 16 hours agoparentprevYour comment brought this article to mind.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;seeing-like-a-bank&#x2F; reply brnt 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a cruel joke, but sometimes the only option.

Of course the average HN commenter would (claim to) have a nuanced situation that can only be handled by a human representative, but the majority of customer service interactions can be handled much more routinely.Bits About Money [1] has a thoughtful take on customer support tiers from the perspective of banking:> Think of the person from your grade school classes who had the most difficulty at everything. The U.S. expects banks to service people much, much less intelligent than them. Some customers do not understand why a $45 charge and a $32 charge would overdraw an account with $70 in it. The bank will not be more effective at educating them on this than the public school system was given a budget of $100,000 and 12 years to try. This customer calls the bank much more frequently than you do. You can understand why, right? From their perspective, they were just going about their life, doing nothing wrong, and then for some bullshit reason the bank charged them $35.It&#x27;s frustrating to be put through a gauntlet of chatbots and phone menus when you absolutely know you need a human to help, but that&#x27;s the economics of chatbots and tier 1&#x2F;2 support versus specialists:> The reason you have to “jump through hoops” to “simply talk to someone” (a professional, with meaningful decisionmaking authority) is because the system is set up to a) try to dissuade that guy from speaking to someone whose time is expensive and b) believes, on the basis of voluminous evidence, that you are likely that guy until proven otherwise.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;seeing-like-a-bank&#x2F; reply tomashubelbauer 19 hours agoparentprevFree tip for folks - this doesn&#x27;t work every time (unfortunately), but sometimes just spamming and mashing numbers gets you to the operator faster than going through the stupid call tree. I guess it depends on how the default is set up in the software, Asterisk of whatever it would be. From my experience it seems you can either set up the call tree to restart from the root if you get out of its bounds or to default to some given option like the connection with a representative. To me this is easy enough to try every time so I just default to doing that. Sometimes the person on the other end will see you mashed in 60 numbers in the system I think and they will ask about it though. Easy enough in that case to politely ask them to relay to their boss that a customer though their system was too stupid to use and decided to short-circuit it like that.

OPERATOR! OPERATOR!\" at the machine until it yields.

One could argue that an LLM isn&#x27;t a Turing machine, but that could also be a strong argument for their lack of utility.We can significantly reduce the problem by accepting false positives, or we can solve the problem with a lower class of language (such as those exhibited by traditional rules based chat bots).

For examples, you can build an assistant that knows specifics about your product and can take actions for you, it can offer the customer a car from the inventory with the requirements they demand and schedule a test drive appointment. You don’t have to engineer or train an LLM, you can simply tell an existing one to act in a specific way.In this particular case they screwed up the implementation. reply wahnfrieden 19 hours agorootparentIf this is a screw-up, what isn’t?

A superficial solution like \"just add a disclaimer\" probably doesn&#x27;t not capture the nuance to make for a great outcome. I.e., a superficial understanding leads us to oversimplify our solutions. Just like with the responses, it seems like you are in more of a hurry to send a retort than to understand the point. reply mewpmewp2 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m still not understanding the point though, 6 hours later.Why can&#x27;t it just be a tool for assistance that is not legally binding?Also throughout this year I have thought about those problems, and to me it&#x27;s always been weird how people have so much problems with \"hallucinations\". And I&#x27;ve thought about exact similar ChatBot as Chevy used and how awesome it would be to be able to use something like that myself to find products.To me the expectations of this having to be legally binding, etc just seem misguided.AI tools increase my productivity so much, and also people often make up things, lie, but it&#x27;s even more difficult to tell when they do that, as everyone&#x27;s different and everyone lies differently. reply bumby 10 hours agorootparent>To me the expectations of this having to be legally binding, etc just seem misguided.I think you&#x27;re getting my point confused with a tangentially related one. Your point may be \"chatbots shouldn&#x27;t be legally binding\" and I would tend to agree. But my point was that simply throwing a disclaimer on it may not be the best way to get there.Consider if poison control uses a chatbot to answer phone calls and give advice. They can&#x27;t waive their responsibility by just throwing a disclaimer on it. It doesn&#x27;t meet the current strict liability standards regarding what kind of duty is required. There is such a thing in law as \"duty creep,\" and there may be a liability if a jury finds it a reasonable expectation that a chatbot provides accurate answers. To my point, the duty is going to be largely context-dependent, and that means broad-brushed superficial \"solutions\" probably aren&#x27;t sufficient. reply mewpmewp2 1 hour agorootparentThe topic wasn&#x27;t about someone calling poison control, it was about bad actors trying to trick ChatBot into absurd contracts. replymewpmewp2 19 hours agorootparentprevThat makes no sense at all.

And current AI tools must be tested first in order for us to be able to improve them.You have limited resources for Customer Support, so it&#x27;s good to have filtering systems in terms of Docs, Forms, Search, GPT in front of the actual Customer Support.To many questions a person will find an answer much faster from the documentation&#x2F;manual itself than calling support. To many other types of questions it&#x27;s possible LLM will be able to respond much more quickly and efficiently.It&#x27;s just a matter of providing this optimal pathway.You don&#x27;t have to think of Customer Support LLM as the same thing as a final Sales Agent.You can think of it as a tool, that should have specialized information fed into it using embeddings or training and will be able to spend infinite time with you, to answer any stupid questions that you might have. I find I have much better experience with Chatbots, as I can drill deep into the \"why&#x27;s\" which might otherwise annoy a real person. reply hattmall 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s pretty much what happens anytime you buy a car though. There&#x27;s always some other bullshit fees even if you get incredibly explicit and specify this is the final price with no other charges.

It sucks when you have to drive hours away just to leave in your old car. reply mewpmewp2 19 hours agorootparentAnd actually based on my experience, customer sales agents, whether it&#x27;s real estate or cars are notoriously dishonest. They may not hallucinate perhaps, but they leave facts unsaid, they will word things in such a way as to get you to buy something rather than get you to do the best decision - sometimes the decision could be not to buy anything from them.So a ChatBot that can&#x27;t intentionally lie or hide things could actually be an improvement in such cases. reply axus 18 hours agorootparentprevThen they&#x27;d have to give up the farce that it&#x27;s a real human chatting. reply mewpmewp2 18 hours agorootparentHow is it farce though?

On top of that, it is hopelessly naive, or put more directly, a chump. It will fall for tricks that a toddler would see through.There are endless variations of things like “and yesterday you suffered a head injury rendering you an idiot.” ChatGPT has been trained on all kinds of vocabulary and ridiculous scenarios and has no true sense or right or wrong or when it’s walking off a cliff. Built into ChatGPT is everything needed for a creative hostile attacker to win 10&#x2F;10 times. reply krisoft 20 hours agorootparent> an architecture geared to “predict the next word,” inherently produces a people pleaserIt is the way they choose to train it with the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) which made it a people pleaser. There is nothing in the architecture which makes it so.They could have made a chat agent which belittle the person asking. They could have made one which ignores your questions and only talks about elephants. They could have made one which answers everything with a Zen Koan. (They could have made it answer with the same one every time!) They could have made one which tries to reason everything out from bird facts. They could have made one which only responds with all-caps shouting in a language different from the one it was asked in. reply rolandr 19 hours agorootparentHence why I also included “the training methods and data.” All three come together to produce something impressive but with inherent limitations. The human tendency to anthropomorphize leads human intuition about its capabilities astray. It’s an extremely capable bullshit artist.Training agents on every written word ever produced, or selected portions of it, will never impart the lessons that humans learn through “The School of Hard Knocks.” They are nihilist children who were taught to read, given endless stacks of encyclopedias and internet chat forum access, but no (or no consistent) parenting. reply RugnirViking 18 hours agorootparentI get where you&#x27;re going, but the original comment seemed to be trying to make a totalising \"LLMs are inherently this way\" which is the opposite of true, they weren&#x27;t like this before (see gpt2, gpt3 etc) and had to intentionally work to make it this way, which was a concious and intentional choice. earlier llms would respond to the tone presented, so if you swore with it, it would swear back - if you presented a wall of \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\" it would reply with more of the same reply tomrod 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d argue this puts trust about where it should be.

Air Canada cancelled all the passes and it eventually went to class action lawsuit where each person received $450&#x2F;pass in Air Canada credits.

    "originBody": "Software Development Unbricking my MacBook took an email to Tim Cook Paul McMahon Founder of TokyoDev I previously wrote about how my lost MacBook was returned to me with an Activation Lock on it, and how Apple refused to unlock it for me. Well, I did manage to finally get it unlocked. All it took was an email to Tim Cook. I don’t know how repeatable this process is, but here’s what happened. After publishing the article, it somehow reached the top of Hacker News. I’d hoped that would trigger someone from Apple to reach out to me, but no one did. I also shared it with a much smaller audience: a Discord server that I run for English speaking software developers in Japan. Our moderator pointed out that he’d had success in the past by emailing tcook@apple.com, as he’d done so in the past and had his assistants escalate things to people who could resolve them for him. Having exhausted other avenues, I gave it a shot: Subject: Activation Lock support requests denied My lost MacBook was returned to me with Activation Lock on. Despite providing my receipt from the Apple Store, my request to remove the lock has been denied. I wrote an article about my experience that got to the top of the popular social media site “Hacker News”. I’d love to have a happy ending to this frustrating story. Four business days later I got a response from one of Tim’s executive assistants in Japan. From there, we exchanged emails and phone calls over the next two weeks, where the assistant was able to get to the bottom of things. They explained to me that the MacBook was wiped in the middle of August (after I had lost it) and then reported lost by a newly created iCloud account with an email address starting with “p”. My requests to have it unlocked were being rejected as per their policy of not unlocking devices reported as lost, even if an original proof of purchase is provided. However, because of the documentation I was able to provide, they were convinced that it was my MacBook, and thus unlocked it. Would this have worked had I not been able to reference the article’s performance on Hacker News? I’m not sure, but it seems likely that was at least a contributing factor. After all, I didn’t actually provide the assistant with any more proof than I had submitted with the activation unlock request. That being said, if you have an issue that can’t be resolved via normal channels, emailing Tim Cook is worth a shot. What really happened to my MacBook By this time, I’d already purchased a replacement machine, and so getting the MacBook unlocked was as much about the principle of things as anything else. However, I also wanted my curiosity sated as to what had actually happened. Apple had provided me with “how” it got locked: the computer was wiped, locked to a new iCloud account, then reported as lost. They didn’t give me the “why” though. Though my original article mentioned it as a theoretical possibility, I saw no incentive for the person who returned my MacBook to do this. So I emailed the person about it reseting the laptop, and after a couple of emails back and forth, I found out more or less what happened. While the person didn’t reset it themselves, they did take it to a shop, and asked them to unlock it. The shop didn’t unlock it, however, they did reset it. This wasn’t obvious to the person, but they reported that while my login profile information was visible before they gave it to the shop, it wasn’t afterwards, presumably as the Activation Lock was on. Despite the shop not having unlocked it for the person, they reported that the shop asked to be paid. When pressed on why the shop asked to be paid despite the shop not unlocking it, the person stopped responding. My theory is that the shop reset the MacBook and reported it as lost with a new Apple ID in order to extort the person. Perhaps the person didn’t want to admit it, but they actually paid money to the shop, who initially gave it back to them “unlocked”. Later the shop could lock it again by reporting it as lost, as a way to ask for more money from the person again. Or maybe the shop wanted to ensure they’d be the only one able to unlock it, and so returned the MacBook, telling the person that they found a way to unlock it, but only if the person paid a higher fee than they were willing to pay. This would explain why the iCloud address started with “p”. The shop saw my name was “Paul McMahon” from the login screen, and so they created an email address that sounded like it could be mine to give them plausible deniability when the person saw the lock screen. Apple doesn’t consider this to be a security vulnerability, but maybe it should When first activating a MacBook, Apple makes it easy to skip setting up FindMy. But given the severe consequences for not doing so, I think they either need to revise the setup workflow to make this downside abundantly clear, or revisit their unlock policy altogether. While I was an edge case, having my MacBook taken to an unscrupulous shop by someone who didn’t own it, similarly unscrupulous shops could do the same thing to others. After all, I even wondered about the possibility that I had set up an iCloud email in the past, and had somehow activated the computer with it. I reported this to Apple Security Research, but it was dismissed with “We’re unable to identify a security issue in your report.” I suppose I could have asked my contact at Apple to flag it for further review, but at this point, I’m ready to let it go.",

Maybe more devices get stolen (probably not, if I&#x27;m a thief I&#x27;m still snatching it and throwing it in a river or something). What this really does is suffocate the secondary parts market, so it costs more to repair the things or they just require a replacement.Many, many users of these devices have rarely, if ever, had anything stolen from them. And as one such person, I don&#x27;t want to hear a company tell me I can&#x27;t even have the _option_ of an open device because \"it&#x27;s for my own good\".

You want the devices to have a reputation for not worthing as much on the black market if stolen. That creates a deterrent effect, and is arguably one of the reasons why the average person&#x27;s phone is stolen less.As to whether this effect is worth suffocating the secondary parts market, it really depends on whether you&#x27;re actually a potential participant in it.

In the first few years after iPhones came around, phone theft started becoming super common, and was eventually a constant source of news.Back then the thieves weren&#x27;t limited to professionals who had access to a fence who has contacts with shady factories overseas.

I&#x27;ve never once heard a car alarm and thought \"aha, someone must be trying to steal that car\". As far as I can tell, false positives are both much more common than true positives and literally indistinguishable to bystanders, so any time someone hears a car alarm the person causing it could just claim it&#x27;s their car and they activated it by mistake and no one would question it. They&#x27;re also so annoyingly loud that they disturb basically everyone on the block, and they can happen at literally any time.

The reward ratio is not significant to plan for this eventuality in any meaningful way.Which is why most people when faced with the prospect of insane security will just choose to layer two simpler methods together instead, such as basic old 2FA via SMS or FIDO. These technically reduce security barrier of entry but allow the portions of the implementation to live further apart from each other, which for most people, is enough.Also, if your work didn&#x27;t issue you a secure PC and trusted 2FA hardware, then allows you to have privileged information like email on your home laptop, that&#x27;s entirely bad policy on their part. reply akho 2 hours agorootparentprevIf possession of a laptop allowed that sort of access, the thief could just unlink the device from apple id.Passwords and drive encryption protect data.

Its an issue that pokes at a really deep element of personal philosophy.Here&#x27;s my argument from the opposite side to try, however: Asking about how you can retain the anti-theft capability isn&#x27;t relevant to the discussion, because sacrificing freedom for that, especially to the degree Apple does, is not worth any trade-off. This is the same right to repair issue that HackerNews, generally, derides John Deere for; the main difference, beyond Apple&#x27;s psy-op level marketing, is that Apple hasn&#x27;t pushed exploitation of this control as hard. But: They absolutely, undeniably do exploit many of the people within their system of control, not just indirectly (\"the control is exploitation\" is kind of a dumb argument), but very directly, between extremely high upfront costs, high repair fees, cryptographically refusing to allow third party parts, etc. Additionally: their self-control in pushing further exploitation is almost definitely a product of market success, because in the mega-capitalist system Apple lives in benevolence may be the result of culture or leadership, but it is allowed by market success, and denied during market failure.A lot of that boils down to the original thesis; very fundamental personal philosophy. I don&#x27;t believe, personally, that it is ethical for individuals or companies to do something unethical (non-negotiably asserting significant control over physical goods they sell) because it enables something ethical (reducing incidents of theft).That might be controversial, which is fine. I think a point of that which is likely even more controversial is the argument that even asserting control over devices in isolation is unethical. I hope it isn&#x27;t controversial, but I feel like it might be simply given the way the world is turning. That&#x27;s a different topic of discussion; but in short, I think there&#x27;s a strong argument that restricting freedom to independently modify and repair physical goods you purchase is a form of classism.

The OOBE workflow gives you the option to not enable Find my Mac, so some percentage of users refuse. Not all Mac owners are fluent in Apple&#x27;s walled garden.But to counter my last point, owning a mac requires a mild investment in learning, and a lot of buy-in for their ecosystem, including linking and locking it with an online account. Apple Store. Apple Music. Activation Lock &#x2F; iCloud everything. Not all users are fully aware of that though, and OP&#x27;s scenario is one of those journeys.But now that you know, this scenario is analogous to keeping a spare key outside your car. Someone can take it and install a new lock cylinder.If your laptop changes hands and someone wiped it and put an activation lock of their own on it. This is working as intended. There&#x27;s no functional difference between selling it to that person because anyone can wipe a machine and put a new lock on it.The alternative includes setting up an activation lock of your own, or putting MDM on it.This is a feature of Apple&#x27;s walled garden. You either go all-in, or you go against the grain and lose the benefits and get blindsided by an unforeseen experience.Personal thoughts: I manage Macs for a living, but never will buy one of my own. Not just the walled garden complaints above, but a 5 year old Lenovo with similar specs is a better technical investment than a 5 year old Mac.

It’s clear they had disabled account security on the laptop, in order for the other user who swapped laptops to add their account to that laptop. It’s not even that they didn’t enable “Find My” (which it does during initial setup, all you need to do is add an iCloud account)… he disable the password required setting to open the Mac. (Yes you can disable the requirements for logging in, but it’s definitely not the default setting) If you jump through such hoops in the first place to weaken your computer’s security, your can’t claim it’s not your fault when someone encrypts your computer on you.I buy Mac’s specifically because for me this is a feature. I have backups. And if someone steals my laptop or I lose it, I’d much rather be out the money and the hardware and have it 100% bricked unusable and inaccessible, than have any possibility of my data getting accessed. (Not to mention making it worthless to the average petty thief).Creating a work around, no matter how many N levels of authentication means there’s a hole for social engineering, and I’m definitely not a fan of that.So it’s a trade off. If you don’t care about such level of security, then there are other laptop options, but please don’t ask Apple to start making their security weaker because there are those of us who want it this way.And if you’re traveling with your laptop, put a password on it at least, and better yet encrypt it. reply the_black_hand 6 hours agoparentAgree.

If you go into recovery mode it first asks you for the machine password. If you say you forgot; then it will try Apple ID.OP specifically states this was a new M2, so it’s not possible unless he left it unlocked.It might be possible if he never associated it with an Apple ID at all (literally the first thing the setup asks you to do, I’ve never tried not). Without an Apple ID though, you can’t update&#x2F;upgrade the OS, download App Store software, use iCloud backup, iMessage, FaceTime, apple care, contact warranty support etc etc. And Mac is pretty good about bugging you to do this. So if he did this, saying just “I didn’t enable Find My” is a bit disingenuous.So to be clear, you cannot reset a Mac without a login just because it does not have “find my” activated.BTW, then he also admits “maybe I setup an iCloud account I don’t remember.” But his other linked article about this states “They presumably can see that my Apple ID is associated with it.” Ummm. If that’s the case, why doesn’t he recover the Apple ID first?

The author successfully begged Apple to backdoor an otherwise effective security and ownership protection.Apple gave the author the tools to recover their laptop in the event it was lost or stolen, and the author consciously chose not to use those tools. Possession is 9&#x2F;10ths of the law, and if you don&#x27;t have Find My enabled it&#x27;s 10&#x2F;10ths of the law.That means if someone else gains possession of your device, and you chose not to use Find My, there is nothing Apple can or should do to save you. How would they know who the legitimate owner is beyond possession or Find My? People sell used MacBooks all the time.Just because the author was the original purchaser, doesn&#x27;t mean they are the rightful owner. In this case I believe the author probably is the rightful owner, but I would rather Apple not be the judge of that.This is literally only a problem for people too stubborn to set up Find My, who also care deeply about recovering their laptop if it gets lost. Think about how paradoxical that is! reply jrmg 4 hours agoparentIt’s also interesting how almost all the negative responses here are comparing the situation to what would’ve happened with a laptop that has no feature like ‘find my’, and somehow concluding that the original owner would’ve been in a better situation if ‘find my’ did not exist.But the reason the laptop was bricked was that someone other than the owner _deliberately bricked it_ (by turning on ‘find my’ and locking the laptop to a new iCloud account). It’s always been the case that a thief could break your laptop (and not return it!).Additionally, the only reason they got their (non-functioning) laptop _back_ was that the thief realized they couldn’t unlock it and thought it was tied to the original owner’s iCloud account!

If you have lost your laptop without Find My enabled, and someone else gained possession of the laptop and wanted to activate Find My but couldn&#x27;t because of this feature, you would still almost certainly not be able to recover the laptop.

The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day and one CPU to derive high quality 300-dimensional vectors for one million vocabulary from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring various types of word similarities. We intend to publish this test set to be used by the research community. 0 Replies Loading",

Quote:> I also received a lot of comments on the word analogies - from \"I knew that too but forgot to publish it!\" (Geoff Hinton, I believe you :) happens to everyone, and anyways I think everybody knows what the origin of Distributed Representations is) to \"it&#x27;s a total hack and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work!\" (random guys who didn&#x27;t bother to read the papers and try it out themselves - including Ian Goodfellow raging about it on Twitter). reply albertzeyer 16 hours agoparentAlso, Tomas says he came up with the encoder-decoder (seq-to-seq) idea, and then Ilya and Quoc took over the idea after Tomas moved on to Facebook.However, there is another statement by Quoc, saying this is not true: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;quocleix&#x2F;status&#x2F;1736523075943125029> We congratulate Tomas on winning the award. Regarding seq2seq, there are inaccuracies in his account. In particular, we all recall very specifically that he did not suggest the idea to us, and was in fact highly skeptical when we shared the end-to-end translation idea with him. Indeed, we worked very hard to make it work despite his skepticism.So, word against word. I&#x27;m not accusing anyone of lying here, one of them probably just misremembers, but this leaves also a somewhat bad taste. reply oldesthacker 12 hours agorootparentThis is what Tomas Mikolov said on Facebook:> I wanted to popularize neural language models by improving Google Translate. I did start collaboration with Franz Och and his team, during which time I proposed a couple of models that could either complement the phrase-based machine translation, or even replace it. I came up (actually even before joining Google) with a really simple idea to do end-to-end translation by training a neural language model on pairs of sentences (say French - English), and then use the generation mode to produce translation after seeing the first sentence. It worked great on short sentences, but not so much on the longer ones. I discussed this project many times with others in Google Brain - mainly Quoc and Ilya - who took over this project after I moved to Facebook AI. I was quite negatively surprised when they ended up publishing my idea under now famous name \"sequence to sequence\" where not only I was not mentioned as a co-author, but in fact my former friends forgot to mention me also in the long Acknowledgement section, where they thanked personally pretty much every single person in Google Brain except me. This was the time when money started flowing massively into AI and every idea was worth gold. It was sad to see the deep learning community quickly turn into some sort of Game of Thrones. Money and power certainly corrupts people...Reddit post: \"Tomas Mikolov is the true father of sequence-to-sequence\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;18jzxpf&#x2F;d_... reply gojomo 10 hours agorootparentAs another small hint of Mikolov-vs-Le divergence: they&#x27;re the coauthors of the &#x27;Paragraph Vector&#x27; paper (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1405.4053) applying a slightly-modified version of word2vec to vectorize longer texts, still in a very shallow way. (This technique often goes by the name &#x27;doc2vec&#x27;, but other things also sometimes get called that, too.)There are some results in that paper, supposedly from exactly the technique described on an open dataset, that no one has ever been able to reproduce – & you can see the effort has frustrated a lot of people, over the years, in different forums.When asked, Mikolov has said, essentially: \"I can&#x27;t reproduce that either – those tests were run & reported by Le, you&#x27;lll have to ask him.\" reply minwcnt5 13 hours agorootparentprevI think this must happen all the time. As they say, ideas are cheap. It&#x27;s likely that ALL of them had the seq-to-seq idea cross their mind at some point before it was acted on, so if credit is assigned to whoever said it out loud first, there&#x27;s going to be disagreement, since most people don&#x27;t remember the full details of every conversation. It&#x27;s also possible for someone to be skeptical of their own idea, so that argument isn&#x27;t compelling to me either. Ultimately credit usually goes to the people who do the hard work to prove out the idea, so it seems like the system worked as intended in this case. reply GartzenDeHaes 11 hours agorootparentprev\"Success has a thousand mothers, but failure is an orphan\" reply jll29 12 hours agorootparentprevTypical, saying they had the idea first without putting it on the blockchain to prove the time stamp! reply jncfhnb 16 hours agoparentprevTo be fair I have some memories of the papers and surrounding tech being really bad.

Reviews are supposed to be about the quality of a paper, not how influential they might be in the future! And not all influential papers are actually very good. reply gms7777 15 hours agoparentI agree. My own most influential paper received strong rejects the first time we submitted it, and rightfully so, I think. In retrospect, we didn&#x27;t do a good job motivating it, the contributions weren&#x27;t clearly presented, and the way we described was super confusing. I&#x27;m genuinely grateful for it because the paper that we eventually published is so much better (although the core of the idea barely changed), and it&#x27;s good because of the harsh reviews we received the first time around. The reviews themselves weren&#x27;t even particularly \"insightful\", mostly along the lines of \"this is confusing, I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re doing or why you&#x27;re doing it\", but sometimes you just really need that outside perspective.I&#x27;ve also reviewed and rejected my share of papers where I could tell there is a seed of a great idea, but the paper as written just isn&#x27;t good. It always brings me joy to see those papers eventually published because they&#x27;re usually so much better. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 12 hours agorootparentThis is the first time I ever saw a scientist say something positive about peer review reply jll29 12 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t seen a manuscript that could not made a better paper through peer review.Now there are good and bad reviewers, and good and bad reviews. However, because you usually get assigned three reviewers, the chance that there is not at least one good reviewer or at least a good review from a middle to bad reviewer is not that low, which means if you get over the initial \"reject\" decision disappointment, you can benefit from that written feedback. The main drawback is the loss of time if a rejection means you may lose a whole year (only for conferences, and only if you are not willing to compromise by going to a \"lower\" conference after rejection by a top one).I have often tried to fight for a good paper, but if the paper is technically not high quality, even the most original idea usually gets shot down, because top conferences cannot afford to publish immature material for reputational reasons. That&#x27;s what happened to the original Brin & Page Google&#x2F;PageRank paper, which was submitted to SIGIR and rejected. They dumped it to the \"Journal of ISDN Systems\" (may this journal rest in peace, and with it all ISDN hardware), and the rest is history. As the parent says, you want to see people succeed, and you want to give good grades (except in my experience many first year doctoral students are often a bit too harsh with their criticism). reply smcin 10 hours agorootparent> I haven&#x27;t seen a manuscript that could not made a better paper through peer review.Authors don&#x27;t object to revision suggestions, they object to arbitrary&#x2F;unfair rejections plus 4-year delays.> The main drawback is the loss of time if a rejection means you may lose a whole year (only for conferences, and only if you are not willing to compromise by going to a \"lower\" conference after rejection by a top one).No, it&#x27;s much worse if you&#x27;re a masters student who wants to publish and have that publication accepted within 12-18mths for your jobhunt; you&#x27;ll necessarily compromise by skipping most journals and aiming for middle-tier conferences (high accept rate and fast turnaround), then falling back on journals only if you get rejected. This was why arxiv was created. (Some academic type here is inevitably going to retort \"But conferences (not even those with official proceedings) aren&#x27;t considered &#x27;real&#x27; publications in my field\", to which the counter-retort is \"the job market doesn&#x27;t care about that attitude\".) reply godelski 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think conferences have the capacity to do this. Journals, yeah, conferences no.The difference is that in a conference you&#x27;re in a zero sum game and there is no chance for iteration and the framing is opposition of reviewer&#x2F;author rather than seeing as being on the same team. Yes, every work can be improved, but the process is far too noisy and we can&#x27;t rely on that iteration happening between conferences.From personal experience, I&#x27;ve had very few reviews that have meaningful and actionable feedback. Far more frequently I&#x27;ve gotten ones that friends joke that GPT could have done better. My last one I had a strong reject with high confidence by a reviewer&#x27;s who&#x27;s only notes were about a \"missing\" link (we redacted our github link) and a broken citation leading to the appendix. That&#x27;s it. We reported them, then they got a chance to write a new angry review which seemed to convince the other two borderline reviewers. Most frequently I get \"not novel\" or \"needs more datasets\" without references to similar work (or references that are wildly off base) and without explanation as to what datasets they&#x27;d like to see and&#x2F;or why. Most of my reviews are from reviewers reporting 3&#x2F;5 confidence levels and are essentially always giving weak or borderline scores (always bias towards reject). It is more common for me to see a review that is worse that the example of a bad review in a conference&#x27;s own guidelines than one that is better.As a reviewer, I&#x27;ve often defended papers that were more than sufficient and I could tell were making rounds. I had to recently defend a paper for a workshop that was clearly a paper that made a turnaround form the main conference (was 10 pages + appendix when most workshop papers were ~5) and the other two reviewers admitted to not knowing the subject matter but made similar generic statements about \"more datasets would make this more convincing.\" I don&#x27;t think this is helping anyone. Even now, I&#x27;ve been handed a paper that&#x27;s not in my domain for god knows why (others in domain). (I do know, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s >13k submissions and not enough reviewers)I&#x27;ve only seen these problems continue to grow and silly bandaids attempt to be applied. Like the social media ban, which had the direct opposite result of what they were attempting to do and was quite obvious that that would happen. The new CVPR LLM ban is equally silly because it just states that you shouldn&#x27;t do what was already known as unethical and shifts the responsibility to the authors to prove that an LLM gave the review (which is a tall order). It is like proving to a cop that you&#x27;ve been shot for them only to ask that you identify the caliber of the bullet and the gun that was used. Not an effective strategy to someone bleeding out. It&#x27;s a laughable solution to the clear underlying problem of low quality reviews. But that won&#x27;t happen until ACs and metas actually read the reviews too. And that won&#x27;t happen until we admit that there&#x27;s too many low quality reviews and no clear mechanism to incentivize high quality ones https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CVPR&#x2F;status&#x2F;1722384482261508498 reply StevenXC 8 hours agorootparentprevIt can be annoying, and reviewer #2 is a jerk, but I&#x27;d be highly suspect of any scientist that doesn&#x27;t respect the importance of peer review. reply ska 12 hours agorootparentprevEh, happens all the time.

Expecting a critiquer to give actually good suggestions matching your original vision, when your original vision&#x27;s presentation is flawed, is incredibly rare. So the best critiques are usually a \"this section right here, wtf is it?\" style, with added bonus points to \"wtf is this order of information\" or other literary technique that is either being misused or unused. reply gms7777 11 hours agorootparentOh, I do completely agree and didn&#x27;t mean to imply otherwise. I have had experiences where reviewers have given me great ideas for new experiments or ways to present things. But the most useful ones usually are the \"wtf?\" type comments, or comments that suggest the reviewers completely misunderstood or misread the text. While those are initially infuriating, the reviewers are usually among the people in the field that are most familiar with the topic of the paper--if they don&#x27;t understand it or misread it, 95% of the time it&#x27;s because it could be written more clearly. reply fanzhang 13 hours agoparentprevAgree that this is how papers are often judged, but strong disagree on how this is how papers should be judged. This is exactly the problem of reviewers looking for the keys under the lamp post (does the paper check these boxes), versus where they lost the keys (should this paper get more exposure because it advances the field).The fact that the first doesn&#x27;t lead more to the second is a failure of the system.This is the same sort of value system that leads to accepting job candidates with neat haircuts and says the right shibboleths, versus the ones that make the right bottom line impact.Basically, are \"good\" papers that are very rigorous but lead to nothing actually \"good\"? If your model of progress in science is that rigorous papers are a higher probability roll of the dice, and nonrigorous papers are low probability rolls of the dice, then we should just look for rigorous papers. And that a low-rigor paper word2vec actually make progress was \"getting really lucky\" and we should have not rated the paper well.But I contend that word2vec was also very innovative, and that should be a positive factor for reviewers. In fact, I bet that innovative papers have a hard time being super rigorous because the definition of rigor in that field has yet to be settled yet. I&#x27;m basically contending that on the extreme margins, rigor is negatively correlated with innovation. reply jll29 12 hours agorootparentYou are right. I often got told \"You don&#x27;t compare with anything\" when proposing something very new. That&#x27;s true, because if you are literally the first one attempting a task, there isn&#x27;t any benchmark. The trick then is to make up at least a straw man alternative to your method and to compare with that.Since then, I have evolved my thinking, and I now use something that isn&#x27;t just a straw man: Before I even conceive my own method or model or algorithm, I ask myself \"What is the simplest non-trivial way to do this?\". For example, when tasked with developing a transformer based financial summarization system we pretrained a BERT model from scratch (several months worth of work), but I also implemented a 2-line grep based mini summarizer as a shell script, which defied the complexity of the BERT transformer yet proved to be a competitor tought to beat: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springerprofessional.de&#x2F;extractive-summarization...I&#x27;m inclined to organize a workshop on small models with few parameters, and to organize a shared task as part of it where no model can be larger than 65 kB, a sort of \"small is beautiful\" workshop in dedication of Occam. reply nybsjytm 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t consider clearly stating your model and meaningfully comparing it to prior work and other models (seemingly the main issues here) to be analogous to a proper haircut or a shibboleth. Actually I think it&#x27;s a strange comparison to make. reply hospadar 12 hours agorootparentprevPapers are absolutely judged on impact - it&#x27;s not as though any paper submitted to Nature gets published as long as it gets through peer review. Most journals (especially high-impact for-profit journals) have editors that are selecting interesting and important papers. I think it&#x27;s probably a good idea to separate those two jobs (\"is this work rigorous and clearly documented\") vs (\"should this be included in the fall 2023 issue\").That&#x27;s (probably) good for getting the most important papers to the top, but it also strongly disincentivizes whole categories (often very important paper). Two obvious categories are replication studies and negative results. \"I tried it too and it worked for me\" \"I tried it too and it didn&#x27;t work\" \"I tried this cool thing and it had absolutely no effect on how lasers work\" could be the result of tons of very hard work and could have really important implications, but you&#x27;re not likely to make a big splash in high-impact journals with work like that. A well-written negative result can prevent lots of other folks from wasting their own time (and you already spent your time on it so might as well write it up).The pressure for impactful work also probably contributes to folks juicing the stats or faking results to make their results more exciting (other things certainly contribute to this too like funding and tenure structures). I don&#x27;t think \"don&#x27;t care about impact\" is a solution to the problem because obviously we want the papers that make cool new stuff. reply godelski 8 hours agorootparent> Papers are absolutely judged on impactThis is post hoc thinking but impossible a priori. You&#x27;re also discounting the bias of top venues, in that the act of being in their venue is a causal variable for higher impact if you measure by citation counts.I&#x27;d also mention that ML does not typically use a journal system but rather conferences. A major difference is that conferences are not rolling submissions and there is only one rebuttal available to authors. Usually this is limited to a single page that includes citations. You can probably imagine that it&#x27;s difficult to do an adequate rebuttal to 3-4 reviewers under the best of circumstances. It&#x27;s like trying to hold a debate where the defending side must respond to any question from the opposition, with clear citations, in a short time frame, and there is no limit to how abstract the opposing side&#x27;s question need be. Nor that their is congruence within the opposition. It&#x27;s not a very good framework for making \"arguments\" more clear or convincing, especially when you consider that the game is zero sum.I definitely agree with your comments about how other types of useful communication (like null results) are highly discouraged. But I wanted to note that there&#x27;s a poor framework for even \"standard\" works. reply aaronkaplan 12 hours agorootparentprevYour argument is that if a paper makes a valuable contribution then it should be accepted even if it&#x27;s not well written. But the definition of \"well written\" is that it makes it easy for the reader to understand its value. If a paper is not well written, then reviewers won&#x27;t understand its value and will reject it. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentWell written and rigor aren’t highly correlated. You can have poorly written papers that are very rigorous, and vic versa. Rigor is often another checkbox (does the paper have some quantitative comparisons), especially if the proper rigor is hard to define by the writer or the reader.My advice to PhD students is to always just focus on subjects where the rigor is straightforward, since that makes writing papers that get in easier. But of course, that is a selfish personal optimization that isn’t really what’s good for society. reply nybsjytm 12 hours agorootparentRigor here doesn&#x27;t have to mean mathematical rigor, it includes qualitative rigor. It&#x27;s unrigorous to include meaningless comparisons to prior work (which is a credible issue the reviewers raised in this case) and it&#x27;s also poor writing. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentQualitative rigor isn’t rigor at all, it’s the opposite. Still useful in a good narrative, sometimes it’s the best thing you have to work as evidence in your paper.Prior work is a mess in any field. The PC will over emphasize the value of their own work, of course, just because of human ego. I’ve been on way too many papers where my coauthors defensively cite work based on who could review the paper. I’m not versed enough about this area to know if prior work was really an issue or not, but I used to do a lot of paper doctoring in fields that I wasn’t very familiar with. replygeysersam 14 hours agoparentprevBut if that&#x27;s the case why put so much focus on and effort into the peer review system?If you ask people funding research I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d prefer to fund influential ideas than non-influential \"high-quality\" paper production. reply nybsjytm 14 hours agorootparentEven if you were to take the extreme position that influence or citation counts are all that matter, the problem is that &#x27;future influence&#x27; is hard if not impossible to judge well in the present.

At every job you don&#x27;t need to invent new things. Industrialization was amazing because of this standardization and ability to mass produce (in a way, potentially LLMs can be this for code. Not quite there yet but it seems like a reasonable potential).But on the other hand, there are plenty of jobs where there are high levels of uniqueness and creativity and innovation dominate the skills of repetition and regurgitation. This is even true in research and science, though I think creativity is exceptionally important.The truth is that you need both. Often we actually need more of the former than the latter, but both are needed. They have different jobs. The question is more about the distribution of these skillsets that you need to accomplish your goals. Too much rigidity is stifling and too much flexibility is chaos.

That period was a time where Chinese states transitioned from feudalism to empire, and the clan-based aristocracy was replaced by a class of educated and scholars due to societal change (which needed lots of literate administrators, and not so much nepotism). The typical path for a person who aspired to work in government is to apply to be an \"employee\" (very loose translation of 門客) of a prominent minister, and rise up the ranks by impressing their bosses. It was also common for rulers of the time to hold meetings with intellectuals, who then tried to sell the rulers on the latest ideology&#x2F;methods to run a country -- if the sales pitch worked, they&#x27;d have the job of implementing those policies. In general there were no exams, although one would assume to become an \"employee\" they&#x27;d test your skills in some way, but it was not systematized at all.Between 222BC and 6th century AD, the educated&#x2F;scholar class gradually consolidated into a handful of prominent families who tended to monopolize high government posts. During the Jin dynasty (266–420AD) people generally believed one&#x27;s virtues&#x2F;abilities were tied to their birth and family status more than anything else. This was a time when prominent families monopolized government power and systematically rejected outsiders from holding important positions, even if they proved their abilities.The imperial exam system introduced in the Sui&#x2F;Tang dynasties gradually reversed this trend by allowing commoners to participate in the government exams, though it must be noted in the Tang dynasty exams the circumstances of the candidates were taken into account (family background, social ties, subjective opinion of the examiners, etc.), so it wasn&#x27;t purely based on the paper exam results.The exams were gradually systematized in the later dynasties, ultimately ending in the \"Eight-legged essay\", which was famous for its rigidity in form. It provided a great opportunity for intelligent aspirants from a underprivileged background since everyone took the exam on an equal footing, but it kind of sucked the soul out of learning the classics. reply neilv 10 hours agorootparentprevInteresting.

I actually disagree because the reviews are unreasonably reasonable. They are void of context.It&#x27;s tough to explain, but I think it&#x27;s also something every person who has written research papers can understand. How there&#x27;s a big bias between reading and writing and how our works are not written to communicate our works as best as possible, but in effect how to communicate to reviewers that they should accept our works. The subtle distinction is deceptively large and I think we all could be a bit more honest about the system. After all, we want to optimize it, right?The problem I see is all a matter of context. Good ideas often appear trivial once we see them. Often we fool ourselves into thinking that we already knew this, but do not have meaningful evidence that this is true but may try to reason that x = y + z + epsilon, but almost any idea can be framed that way, even breakthroughs like Evolution, Quantum Mechanics, or Relativity. It is because we look back at giants from a distance but when looking at works now don&#x27;t see giants, but a bunch of children standing on one another&#x27;s shoulders standing in a trench coat. That is the reality of it all. That few works are giant leaps and bounds, but rather incremental. The ones that take the biggest leaps are rare, often rely on luck (ambiguous definition), and frequently (but not always, especially considering the former) take a lot of time. Something we certainly don&#x27;t often have.We&#x27;re trained as scientists and that means to be trained in critiquing systems and letting questions spiral. Sometimes the spiraling of questions shows how absurd an idea is but other times it can show how ingenious it is. It&#x27;s easier to recognize the former but often hard to distinguish the latter. It is always easy to ask for more datasets, more experiments, and such, but these are critiques that can apply to any work as no work is complete. This is especially true in cases of larger breakthroughs, because any paradigm shift (even small) will cause a cascade of questions and create a lot of curiosity. But as we&#x27;ve all written papers, we know that this can often be a never ending cycle and often is quite impractical. The complaint about Table 4 is a perfect example. It is quite a difficult situation. The complaint is perfectly reasonable in that the question and concerns are quite valid and do warrant further understanding. But at the same time they are unreasonable because the requisite work required to answer these is not appropriate for the timescale that we work on. Do you have the compute or time to retrain all prior works to your settings? To retrain all your works to their settings? Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work there which may or may not be evidence that the other works are just as good or not. What it comes down to is asking if these questions being answered could be another work in their own right. I&#x27;m not in NLP as deep as I&#x27;m in CV, but I suspect that the answer is yes (as in there are works that have been published answering exactly those questions).There are also reasonably unreasonable questions in other respects. Such as the question about cosine distance vs Euclidean. This is one that I see quite often as we rely too deeply on our understanding of lower dimensional geometries to influence our understanding of high dimensional geometries. Such things that seem obvious, like distance, are quite ambiguous there and our example is the specific reason for the curse of dimensionality (it becomes difficult to distinguish the furthest point from the nearest point). But this often leads us in quite the wrong direction. Honestly, it is a bit surprising that the cosine similarity works (as D->inf cos(x,y)-> 0 forall x,y in R^D because any random vector is expected to be orthogonal meaning that to get cos(x,y)=1 means y = x + epsilon with epsilon -> 0 as D->inf. But I digress), but it does. There definitely could be entire works exploring these geometries and determining different geodesics. It is entirely enough for a work to simply have something working, even if it doesn&#x27;t quite yet make sense.The thing is that science is exceptionally fuzzy. Research is people walking around in the dark and papers are them communicating what we have found. I think it is important for us to remember this framing because we should then characterize the viability&#x2F;publishability of a work not as illuminating everything but if the things found are useful (which itself is not always known). Because you might uncover a cavern and then it becomes easy to say \"report back when you&#x27;ve explored it\", but such an effort may be impossible to do alone. It can be a dead end, one that can take decades to explore (we&#x27;ll always learn something though) or it may lead to riches we&#x27;ve never seen before. We don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s really what we&#x27;re all looking for (hopefully more about riches for humanity than one&#x27;s self, but one should be rewarded for sure).This is why honestly, I advocate for abandoning the journal&#x2F;conference system and leverage our modern tools like OpenReview to accelerate communication. Because it enables us to be more open about our limitations, to discuss our failures, and write to our peers rather than our critics. Critics are of course important, but they can take over too easily because they are reasonable and correct, but oft missing context. For an example, see the many HN comments about a technology in its infancy where people will complain that it is not yet competitive with existing technologies and thus devalue the potential. Oft missing the context that it takes time to compete, the time and energy put in by so many before us to make what we have now, but also that there are limits and despite only being a demonstration the new thing does not have the same theoretical limits. The question is rather about if such research warrants more eyes and even a negative result can be good because it can communicate that we&#x27;ve found dead ends (which is something we actively discourage, needlessly forcing many researchers to re-explore these dead spaces). There&#x27;s so much more that I can say and this is woefully incomplete but I can&#x27;t fit a novel into our comments and I&#x27;m afraid the length as it is already results in poor communication to the given context of the platform. Thanks anyone who has taken this time. reply jll29 12 hours agorootparentJournal articles&#x2F;conference papers are not the only outlet, you can still write technical monographs if you feel review cycles are holding you back. reply godelski 11 hours agorootparentIt depends. Right now I&#x27;m a grad student and I&#x27;m just trying to graduate. My friend, who already left, summed it up pretty well.> I don&#x27;t want to be a successful academic, I want to be a successful scientist. Which I believe are no longer the same thing.I&#x27;m just trying graduate and just have to figure out how to play the game enough to leave. Honestly, I do not see myself ever submitting to a journal or conference again. I&#x27;ll submit to OpenReview, ArXiv, and my blog. I already open my works to discussions on GitHub and am very active in responses and do actually appreciate critiques (there&#x27;s lots of room for improvement). In fact, my most cited work has been rejected many times, but we also have a well known blog post as a result, and even more than a year later we get questions on our GitHub (which we still respond to, even though many are naive and asks for help debugging python, not our code).But I&#x27;m done with academia because I have no more faith in it. I&#x27;d love to actually start or work for a truly open ML research group, where it is possible to explore seemingly naive or unpopular ideas, to not just accept things the way they are and forced to chase hype. I will turn down lots of money to do such a thing. To not just metric hack but be honest about limitations of my works and what still needs to be done, that saying such things is not simply giving ammunition to those who would use it against me. To do research that takes time rather than chase a moving goalpost, against people with more compute who rely on pay to play, nor work in this idiotic publish or perish paradigm. To not be beholden to massive compute or to be restricted to only be able to tune what monoliths have been created. To challenge the LLM and Diffusion paradigms that are so woefully incomplete despite there undeniable success. To openly recognize that both these things can be true without it being misinterpreted as undermining these successes. You&#x27;d think academia would be the place for this, but I haven&#x27;t seen a shred of evidence that it is. I&#x27;ve only seen the issues grow. reply johnfn 15 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t you think something is missing if we&#x27;ve defined \"quality\" as an independent and uncorrelated characteristic from importance or influentiality? reply nicklecompte 15 hours agorootparentNo, because \"quality\" means two different things here. I believe the main reason word2vec became important was purely on the software&#x2F;engineering side, not because it was scientifically novel. Advancements in Python development, especially good higher-level constructs around numerical linear algebra, meant that the fairly shallow and simple tools of word2vec were available to almost every tech company. So I don&#x27;t think word2vec was (or is) particularly good research, but it became good software for reasons beyond its own controlIn 2016 or so it was proven that word2vec is equivalent to the pointwise mutual information between the words in its training set, after doing some preprocessing. This means that Claude Shannon had things mostly figured out in the 60s, and some reviewers were quite critical of the word2vec paper for not citing similar developments in the 70s. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentprevYes and no. I think the larger issue is about the ambiguity of what publications mean and should be. There&#x27;s a lot of ways to optimize this, and none of those has optimal solutions. I don&#x27;t think you should be down voted for your different framing because I think we just need to be more open about this chaos and consider other values than our own or the road we&#x27;re on. I think it is very unclear what we are trying to optimize and it is quite apparent that you&#x27;re going to have many opinions on this and your group of reviewers may all seek to optimize different things. The only solution I can see is to stop pretending as if we know what each other is trying to do and be a bit more explicit about it. Because if we argue based on different assumptions we&#x27;ll talk past one another if we assume the other is working on the same set of assumptions. reply dr_kiszonka 14 hours agorootparentprevI believe many journals focusing on potentially influential papers is why we have a reproducibility crisis. Since it is very hard to publish null results, people often don&#x27;t even bother trying. This leads to tons of wasted effort as multiple groups attempt the same thing not knowing that others before them have failed.Also, predicting whether a paper will be influential is very hard and inherently subjective, unless you are reviewing something truly groundbreaking.

People like Tversky have advocated against the use of semantic-space models like NLMs because they cannot appropriately model intransitive similarities.What I’ve noticed in the latest models (GPT, image diffusion models, etc) is an ability to play with words when there’s a double meaning. This struck me as something that used to be very human, but is now in the toolbox of generative models. (Most of which, I assume, use something akin word2vec for deriving embedding vectors from prompts.)Is the word2vec ambiguity contributing to the wordplay ability? I don’t know, but it points to a “feature vs bug” situation where such an ambiguity is a feature for creative purposes, but a bug if you want to model semantic space as a strict vector space.My interpretation here is that the word&#x2F;prompt embeddings in current models are so huge that they’re overloaded with redundant dimensions, such that it wouldn’t satisfy any mathematical formalism (eg of well-behaved vector spaces) at all. reply PeterisP 8 hours agoparentThe key difference is what I&#x27;d call \"context-free embeddings\" vs \"contextual embeddings\". Due to its structure, word2vec and similar solutions have to assign every single \"bank\" in every sentence the exact same vector, but later models (e.g. all the transformer models, BERT, GPT, etc) will assign wildly different vectors to \"bank\" depending on the context of surrounding words for that particular mention of \"bank\". reply intalentive 13 hours agoparentprevEven small models (e.g. hidden dims = 32) should be able to handle token ambiguity with attention.

Peer review was a strategy to make research appear more credible.The most damning critique of peer-review of course is that it completely failed to stop (and arguably aided) the reproducibility crisis.

The first model, CBOW, is essentially a standard feed-forward NLM without the intermediate projection layer (but with weight sharing + averaging before applying the non-linearity in the hidden layer). The second model, skip-gram, comprises a collection of simple feed-forward nets that predict the presence of a preceding or succeeding word from the current word. The models are trained on a massive Google News corpus, and tested on a semantic and syntactic question-answering task. The results of these experiments look promising....(2) The description of the models that are developed is very minimal, making it hard to determine how different they are from, e.g., the models presented in [15]. It would be very helpful if the authors included some graphical representations and&#x2F;or more mathematical details of their models. Given that the authors still almost have one page left, and that they use a lot of space for the (frankly, somewhat superfluous) equations for the number of parameters of each model, this should not be a problem.\"These reviews in turn led to significant (though apparently not significant enough) modifications to the paper (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openreview.net&#x2F;forum?id=idpCdOWtqXd60&noteId=C8Vn84f...). These were some quality reviews and the paper benefited from going this review process, IMHO. reply sdenton4 15 hours agoparentprevI have been deeply unimpressed with the ML conference track this last year... There&#x27;s too many papers, too few reviewers, leading to an insane number of PhD student-reviewers. We&#x27;ve gotten some real nonsense reviews, with some real sins against the spirit of science baked into them.For example, a reviewer essentially insisting that nothing is worth publishing if it doesn&#x27;t include a new architecture idea and SOTA results...

The software and pretrained vectors were easy to access and use compared to existing methods. reply mempko 16 hours agoparentprevThis is not the takeaway I got.

Those are the processes for evaluating the correctness of the findings. reply imjonse 16 hours agoprevIt seems they have rejected initial versions of the paper, since there had been later updates and clarifications based on the reviews.

The basic problem is that in a real-life application many of the most important words are not in the dictionary and if you throw out words that are not in the dictionary you choose to fail.Let a junk paper like that through and the real danger is that you will get 1000s of other junk papers following it up.For instance, take a look at the illustrations on this pagehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlp.stanford.edu&#x2F;projects&#x2F;glove&#x2F;particularly under \"2. Linear Substructures\". They make it look like a miracle that they project down from a 50-dimensional subspace down to 2 and get a nice pattern of cities and zip codes, for instance. The thing is you could have a random set of 20 points in a 50-d space and, assuming there are no degeneracy, you can map them to any 20 points you want in the 2-d space with an appropriately chosen projection matrix. Show me a graph like that with 200 points and I might be impressed. (I&#x27;d say those graphs on that server damage the Stanford brand for me about as much as SBF and Marc Tessier-Lavign)(It&#x27;s a constant theme in dimensional reduction literature that people forget that random matrices often work pretty well, fail to consider how much gain they are getting over the random matrix, ...)BERT, FastText and the like were revolutionary for a few reasons, but I saw the use of subword tokens as absolutely critical because... for once, you could capture a medical note and not erase the patient&#x27;s name!The various conventions of computer science literature prevented explorations that would have put Word2Vec in its place. For instance, it&#x27;s an obvious idea that you should be able to make a classifier that, given a document vector, can predict \"is this a color word?\" or \"is this a verb?\" but if you actually try it, it doesn&#x27;t work in a particularly maddening way. With a tiny training&#x2F;eval set (say 10 words) you might convince yourself it is working, but the more data you train on the more you realize the words are scattered mostly randomly and even those those \"linear structures\" exist in a statistical sense they aren&#x27;t well defined and not particularly useful. It&#x27;s the kind of thing that is so weird and inconclusive and fuzzy that I&#x27;m not aware of anyone writing a paper about it... Cause you&#x27;re not going to draw any conclusions out of it except that you found a Jupiter-sized hairball.For all the excitement people had over Word2Vec you didn&#x27;t see an explosion of interest in vector search engines because... Word2Vec sucked, applying it to documents didn&#x27;t improve the search engine very much. Some of it is that adding sensitivity to synonyms can hurt performance because many possible synonyms turn out to be red herrings. BERT, on the other hand, is context sensitive and is able to some extent know the different because \"my pet jaguar\" and \"the jaguar dealership in your town\" and that really does help find the relevant documents and hide the irrelevant documents. reply rahmaniacc 11 hours agoprevThis was hilarious!Many very broad and general statements are made without any citations to back them up.- Please be more specific.The number of self-citations seems somewhat excessive.- We added more citations. reply nsagent 13 hours agoprevPrevious discussion: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38654038 reply ashvardanian 10 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s the most inspiring thing I&#x27;ve learned this year. reply Der_Einzige 16 hours agoprevMakes me not feel bad about my own rejections when I see stuff like this or Yann Lecun reacting poorly on twitter to his own papers being rejected. reply jongjong 8 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve found that PhD level academics are usually wrong about practical matters.

BY CALEB JACOBSPUBLISHED DEC 18, 2023 1:54 PM EST NEWS VW SHARE CALEB JACOBS View Caleb Jacobs's Articles calebjacobs0611 calebjwords Whether you've driven a new Volkswagen or not, there's a good chance you've heard about its interiors. People who care about the German everyman brand have been extremely opinionated about the cars' lack of physical buttons. Customers' cries have even reached VW CEO Thomas Schäfer's ears, as he said the \"frustrating\" touchscreen controls \"definitely did a lot of damage.\" Now, VW interior designer Darius Watola is reported as saying that the brand is going back to buttons on all new cars. The news comes from Autocar, which quotes Watola as saying the ID.2All concept and its buttons \"showed a new approach for all models.\" Like Schäfer, he referenced the public's feedback. There are still touchscreens, to be sure—the infotainment display is large and in charge, and there's also a digital gauge cluster. But instead of all the controls being hidden behind menus in these displays, they're toggled via switches on the center stack. The ID.2All Concept still looks pretty sparse inside, but at least it has physical controls for the HVAC and all four windows. The production ID.4 can't even say that. VW This is reassuring for the simple fact that actual buttons just work. The touch sliders and whatnot in the Mk8 Golf and ID.4 are finicky, only operating like they should some of the time. They also aren't backlit, making them difficult to find and use in the dark. Owners and professional critics alike have been tough on modern VWs for these exact reasons; my co-worker Jerry Perez went as far as saying the ID.4's tech \"ruined\" what was an otherwise practical and livable EV. Speaking on the car's infotainment, Jerry said: \"It's awful, likely the worst I've ever come across. I was never able to find a channel list for the XM satellite radio because there isn't an option to do such a thing—at least not one you can find in under 30 minutes of poking around. Then there's a climate system on/off icon on the screen that you must click to turn the AC or heater on. You can't just push the fan speed icon and expect it to turn on. No, you must tap the \"on\" button and then adjust the temperature or fan speed separately. This extra step makes no sense—and to add insult to injury, I couldn't turn the heater on countless times because the climate portion of the OS was unresponsive. Other times, it would simply say that the function couldn't be performed at the time. Why? No idea.\" As you can tell based on that blurb, actual buttons will be welcomed back with open arms.

The touch sliders and whatnot in the Mk8 Golf and ID.4 are finicky, only operating like they should some of the time. They also aren&#x27;t backlit, making them difficult to find and use in the dark.I&#x27;d frame it differently. It&#x27;s not that, under certain circumstances, buttons work better than touchscreens. It&#x27;s that there are particular situations when touchscreens are superior to physical buttons (nav is one of them), and for every other use case, buttons provide a more intuitive, consistent, discoverable, pleasurable experience for users. Because I can do GPS nav on my phone anyway, if I have to choose one, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that physical controls are superior in general as UI for cars.The other problem with touchscreen interfaces is that, paradoxically, they can result in worse design. You&#x27;d think that an all-software interface would give designers more options. What it seems to do—and many designers will recognize this antipattern from the real world—is make it so that you don&#x27;t get as much time to think about the right design, and you don&#x27;t have to make the difficult decisions that result in a simple, opinionated design. Instead, the UI ends up being an afterthought because it&#x27;s just software, and every VP with a dumb idea gets to have it crammed into the design. That&#x27;s why touchscreen controls for cars still suck, 10 years into them being ubiquitous, while a dashboard from the 1970s can be controlled by a child. reply georgeecollins 12 hours agoparentI took a class in cognitive design (fancy name for controls design) with Donald Norman (he wrote Design of Everyday things) and his standard assignment was to ask us to make the controls for a clock radio television. This was a long time ago. One of the points of the exercise was to make us realize that combining different devices and their controls didn&#x27;t always make sense. In the same sense in a car their is a lot to be gained by keeping the controls for audio and the controls for temperature separate.

At scale the buttons and knobs are cheap. Having designed many control panels for a wide range of applications, I can tell you that good design is an excruciatingly long and painfully expensive undertaking.You cannot recompile your way out of a poorly working physical control panel or bad design. You can’t just throw something together for testing and finish it while other teams complete the design of the rest of the car, machine, etc.As a real example, you might have to evaluate hundreds of button designs for tactile, audible and visible feel. Once sub-selected, you might evaluate over a dozen full scale control panel mock-ups before design lock. Etc.Touch screens allow you to eliminate a huge portion of what goes into creating a user interphase. reply matsemann 13 hours agoparentprevThe VWs&#x2F;Cupras I&#x27;ve driven recently have had these insane buttons on the steering wheel, that aren&#x27;t physical but supposedly does some weird vibration&#x2F;haptic feedback when pressed.

Automobile Week wrote that iDrive &#x27;&#x27;turned the &#x27;experience&#x27; of driving the car into a computerized affair.&#x27;&#x27; And even experts who sympathize with the impulse behind iDrive note its shortcomings. &#x27;&#x27;I spent an hour experimenting in a simulator, and I got lost in the menus,&#x27;&#x27; says Don Norman, the author of &#x27;&#x27;The Design of Everyday Things.&#x27;&#x27; BMW countered by including a cheat sheet that can be affixed to the steering wheel for befuddled parking valets. Eventually, some initially skeptical reviewers have conceded that once accustomed to it, they find the iDrive indispensable; however, that acclimation has taken as long as three months.Norman wrote more about it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jnd.org&#x2F;design-as-communication&#x2F; .> By logic, the iDrive was a superior device. Alas, people function through stories, not logic. Moreover, people are spatial, we remember where things are in space, whereas the iDrive destroyed spatiality. And finally, the stories we remember and the conceptual models we prefer have to do with how a particular device functions: heating and cooling the automobile, changing the station of the radio, checking what distance remains for our trip.

Hyundai has struck a balance, but not quite the right balance. There are physical buttons, but they don&#x27;t control the climate or seat warmers. In fact, one of my few annoyances with this car is when I use the physical volume button, my finger often brushes up against the capacitive \"climate\" button area, hence flipping on the heat when I just wanted to turn the podcast down.Now, there are the usual physical controls like wiper and turn signals, but that&#x27;s not because Hyundai are paragons of control design, but rather because they&#x27;re not idiots. And the complaints above are not that big a deal, as the \"buttons\" are right at hand. But with just a minor tweak or two, they could have done much better.

Anyway, there was a promising looking button on the dashboard to the right of the steering wheel (i.e. fairly near the clock) that did something with the clock, but no combination of pressing it actually let me actually set the clock. It turns out there is a second button on the dashboard, on the left side of the steering wheel, that is used to configure whether you are setting the hours or minutes, and must be used in conjunction with the button on the right side of the dash.

I also think there&#x27;s an extremely vocal minority that feels like no-buttons is backwards progress.Note, this is not an excuse or justification for touchscreen-only interfaces, but my personal feelings towards the matter.I have two Teslas and I have never found the touchscreen to be a problem when the \"automatic\" setting is GOOD. For example, I almost never touch the AC. I set it to the temperature I like and it keeps me comfortable during the entire ride.However, when things like the automatic windshield wipers are bad (and they constantly fluctuate between disastrous and good enough between software updates), I get really frustrated because I have to tinker with the bullshit screen too much.Personally, I think the end game is minimalist physical buttons (some multipurpose) + software that is actually good enough to not interact with the touchscreen very often. Most companies that aren&#x27;t Tesla really struggle on the latter portion.4After having these 2 cars for a couple of years, I find most cars extremely cluttered and almost claustrophobic. I really like how clean and simple the Tesla interior is. I hope we don&#x27;t overcorrect back into the 2010s and even 80s style of \"put a button right in front for EVERYTHING.\" But I do think there&#x27;s a ton of room for healthy middle ground. reply tremon 12 hours agoparentSo your argument is basically, \"touchscreens are OK as long as I don&#x27;t have to actually use them\"?

When I am charging, or not moving, I GREATLY prefer the touchscreen over hundreds of physical buttons scattered all over the car. The minimalism is appreciated. Less moving parts to break, less clutter, and everything is extremely centralized.When I am driving 85mph obviously I don&#x27;t want to have to look over at a screen to adjust windshield wiper settings.One day, ideally most of this stuff is handled automatically or through a simple interface like voice. Stuff like window controls should always exist, but things like windshield wipers or speed should ideally be automated one day. reply jjav 12 hours agoparentprev> accept a little degradation in favor of progressWhat does this mean?Progress means making it better, degradation means making it worse. It can&#x27;t be both.Too many industries seem to confuse \"new\" with \"better\".New just means it is a recent change, it might be better or much worse.New does not make something better.

It&#x27;s likely not as intuitive, but the reduction in manufacturing costs allows them to deliver EVs for cheaper.This is the kind of idea I was trying to convey, but I admit it was confusing. reply glimshe 12 hours agoparentprev\"New\" isn&#x27;t the same as \"progress\".

Just trying to understand the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis here. reply leetharris 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll give you an example of something that I think is progress and some may disagree with me.For vent control on a Tesla, you have to pull up a visualization and \"drag\" the airflow to where you want it to go. Kinda silly compared to just moving your vent like in the old days.But when I use it on that screen, I can adjust airflow for ALL of my passengers from one spot. I can change the airflow for multiple areas of the car, I can change heated&#x2F;cooled seats, I can split the air, I can turn on biohazard mode, etc.To contrast this, on my previous car, the physical \"heated seats\" button was in a different place for every single seat. So if my wife or kid left theirs on, it stayed on unless I reach across the car to turn it off or get out and go into the backseat.I get that this is an extremely minor example, but I do think a combination of good centralized physical buttons and a well made UI can be a good combo.Another small simple example I&#x27;m thinking of off the top of my head is sound balance. On my previous car to change fade&#x2F;balance to avoid waking small children on a road trip, it was a physical button click and scrolling through menus to scroll an arbitrary number for left&#x2F;right, then backing out, then doing the same for an arbitrary number for back&#x2F;front. In a Tesla, I just pull up the visualization and click one time in one spot for exactly where I want the sound to be centered.These little things add up and I think eventually someone will nail it. reply dzhiurgis 12 hours agoparentprevI agree Tesla&#x27;s touchscreen is perfect.I would love to disable few things in UI (i.e. some minimalistic mode with speedo only) but it&#x27;s fine.What I do hate with climate is the stupid vents.

The well known-ish one, Steam and the Steam Deck. My gods, the flexibility steam has builtin for wiring up a controller to do whatever is godlike. I don&#x27;t know how to speak even 1&#x2F;4 justice to the powers here. It&#x27;s the most flexible user facing software system on the planet, maybe short of Excel; there&#x27;s so much capability on tap. I tried playing Jedi Academy recelty, an ancient game, and went & downloaded a bunch of shared profiles. On some of them there&#x27;s like this gorgeous multimodal popover, press a button then swipe the joystick to pick a force power or weapon, which shows up in game as an overlay with actual graphic pictures someone baked in. The potential for man-machine symbiosis is parsecs afar of where most of the out-of-box(-is-all-you-get) unadjustable cloudware world has left us.The other data point that keeps resonating for me is an old consumer-oriented iot system, Webinos. There was a bunch of car interest, where exposing all the HVAC and lighting and even realtime radar proximity sensors. The whole system was a user-sovereign API system, where user&#x27;s had control over where data went & could talk to their cars securely&#x2F;remotely. The system was a general iot system, but it was neat to see car people leaning in, a decade ago. It never closed the loop though, and layered in programmability to the builtin infotainment system, which feels like what we need now.Its wild how we have all this software, but the interfaces are still all manufacturer provided. Most people don&#x27;t, but on Android for example one can change their launcher which radically reshapes the whole experience. I think of that as a breeding ground, a permissive layer to sustain & keep staleness out with. Cars went all in on touchscreens, while caging users into very limited experiences. Ideally users would have hybrid flexibility, would be able to use some manufacturer presets that are touchscreen or physical centric (with both being available to some degree) and then to take the experience further. A static manufacturer defined system has to be simple & reliable first, and the modernization failed too many basic requirements (not remembering settings seems to be a big one in comments. Moved in to a new place recently with Lutron caseta everywhere & the dimmers have a little light showing brightness level... A \"nice\" affordances that an old old old dimmer switch had!). Not feeling at ends is what technology is failing to give us, and products keep suffering for our e-matter&#x27;s severe lack of soft tweak ability; we keep taking the problem on in this sector or that & trying to find a balance, but the modern world lacks a software parallel of reconfigurability, is sort of pre-interchangeable-parts.

The lack of buttons in a Tesla is mildly annoying but everything is still pretty usable.On the VW the software is so bad it makes you want to scream in despair, and the buttons they do have are the worst of both worlds: unclear, unresponsive, no feedback, and invisible in the dark. reply agloe_dreams 13 hours agoparentprevHad a 20&#x27; Jetta and then a 22&#x27; Taos, a Volvo Xc40 and now a Tesla Model 3. Comparing VW MIB with Tesla&#x27;s OS is like comparing a knockoff android TV streaming stick plugged into a 720p tv with an iPad Pro. Just miles of difference in UX, design, and performance. After having it for three months, so far my take is that the VW does exactly one thing better - Wiper controls. Notably, the Tesla Auto Wiper is pure trash and the VW one works well so you don&#x27;t need to play with it.

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider subscribing to LWN. Thank you for visiting LWN.net! December 15, 2023 This article was contributed by Ronja Koistinen The gccrs project is an ambitious effort started in 2014 to implement a Rust compiler within The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Even though the task is far from complete, progress has been made since LWN's previous coverage, according to reports from the project. Meanwhile, another hybrid and more mature approach to GCC Rust code generation is available in rustc_codegen_gcc. In 2022, the goal of gccrs was to be included in the GCC 13 release, but this expectation has not been met. The team is currently aiming for inclusion in GCC 14 (likely to be released by mid-2024), judging from its November 2023 monthly report. On October 13, Arthur Cohen gave a talk titled \"The road to compiling the standard library with gccrs\" (the video is available) at EuroRust 2023. In his talk, Cohen gave a little bit of general background on gccrs but mainly focused on what work has recently gone into compiling the Rust standard library, and why gccrs cannot do it yet. Gccrs targets a specific Rust version, 1.49, released at the end of 2020, rather than trying to keep up with the rapidly developing Rust language. This version was chosen because it is the latest version predating support for const generics, which were introduced in 1.50. However, Cohen expressed regret in his talk that the project has not been able to ignore const generics after all, because they are in use in the standard library, even in 1.49. They were \"stabilized\" for general availability in 1.50, but there is internal standard library usage in earlier versions as well. Const generics have since been fully implemented, however, and this issue is no longer a hindrance. A lot of care is being put into gccrs not becoming a \"superset\" of Rust, as Cohen put it. The project wants to make sure that it does not create a special \"GNU Rust\" language, but is trying instead to replicate the output of rustc — bugs, quirks, and all. Both the Rust and GCC test suites are being used to accomplish this. The Rust standard library consists of a number of \"crates\", which is what software packages are called in Rust lingo. Cohen explained that gccrs is working on supporting compilation of the two most important ones: core and alloc. The core crate is the foundation of the standard library, implementing features such as primitive types and macros; alloc deals with heap-memory allocation and various container types. Currently gccrs is not able to compile these crates because of various shortcomings, such as incorrect behavior in macro-name resolution and incomplete support for decorator macros. The lack of a borrow checker (discussed more below), while not blocking compilation, means that the compiler cannot properly check the safety of the code. An additional hurdle is formed by missing compiler intrinsics in GCC. Rustc uses some intrinsics provided by LLVM that are not supported by GCC, which means the gccrs team needs to spend time implementing them in GCC. Another talk (slides available) was given by Pierre-Emmanuel Patry at the GNU Tools Cauldron in September 2023. He mainly focused on progress toward inclusion in GCC 14 as well as macros, which seem to be an interrelated issue because the approach to implement procedural macros necessitates changes to the GCC build system. Procedural macros are function-like macros that emit token streams rather than plain source code text like C or C++ macros. They are implemented in a built-in crate called proc_macro. Such macros are notoriously tricky to implement but also powerful; they form the core of features such as #[attribute] and #[derive()] decorators, and can be used to create compile-time evaluated, domain-specific languages. In the GNU Cauldron talk, Patry also mentioned that gccrs had more than 800 commits waiting to be upstreamed to GCC. Taking advantage of the GCC ecosystem Cohen's EuroRust talk highlighted that one of the major reasons gccrs is being developed is to be able to take advantage of GCC's security plugins. There is a wide range of existing GCC plugins that can aid in debugging, static analysis, or hardening; these work on the GCC intermediate representation. Gccrs intends to support workflows where developers could reuse these plugins with Rust code. As an example, Cohen mentioned that \"C programmers have been forgetting to close their file descriptors for 40 years, [so] there are a lot of plugins to catch that\". Gccrs intends to enable Rust programmers to use existing GCC plugins and static analyzers to catch bugs in unsafe code. Cohen listed a few things that gccrs is already useful for. According to him, the Sega Dreamcast homebrew community uses gccrs to create new games for the Dreamcast gaming console, and GCC plugins can already be used to perform static analysis on unsafe Rust code. The Dreamcast community's interest stems from the fact that rustc's LLVM backend does not support the Hitachi SH-4 architecture of the console, whereas GCC does; even in its incomplete state, gccrs is helpful for this embedded use case. Additionally, he mentioned that the gccrs effort has revealed some unspecified language features, such as Deref and macro name resolution; in response, the project has been able to contribute additions to the Rust specification. Currently Rust does not have a formal specification, but work is underway to create one, as proposed in RFC 3355. \"The gccrs people want to be a part\" of that effort, Cohen said. One more reason for gccrs to exist is Rust for Linux, the initiative to add Rust support to the Linux kernel. Cohen said the Linux kernel is a key motivator for the project because there are a lot of kernel people who would prefer the kernel to be compiled only by the GNU toolchain. Things under development Gccrs is still missing a lot of core functionality. Cohen listed several important features, such as async/await, LLVM intrinsics that are absent in GCC, and the format_args!() macro used by output macros such as println!(). The borrow checker, which is a compiler subsystem that enforces the reference rules of the language, is a key Rust feature that gccrs will need to provide. Cohen briefly mentioned that the likely solution is a separate borrow-checker project called Polonius, and said Gccrs will most likely have it integrated a few months down the line. Contributor Jakub Dupak has made progress on this in the past few months. Polonius is a library that implements a borrow checker that is semantically equivalent to the (not quite flawlessly implemented) checker in rustc today, by approaching the computation of reference lifetimes with a radically different algorithm. Polonius aims to one day resolve the shortcomings and corner cases of rustc's current borrow checker. Once it has matured, rustc itself will likely also adopt it in the future. According to the gccrs monthly report for November 2023, work has begun on the format_args!() macro. This helper macro is responsible for constructing parameters for other string-formatting macros. It involves the Display and Debug traits, and is a necessity for preparing arguments that are later passed to other macros such as format!() and println!(). Without format_args!(), a Rust program cannot create formatted output; this feature is thus necessary before gccrs can compile a \"Hello, World\" program. For a deep dive on format_args!(), see Mara Bos's recent blog post. rustc_codegen_gcc There is another GCC-based Rust project, called rustc_codegen_gcc, that is more mature and more limited in scope compared to gccrs. It is not a full implementation of a Rust compiler from the ground up; instead, it uses the libgccjit library to hook into an API of the LLVM backend used by rustc. This approach performs much of the compilation with rustc and turns to GCC at a later stage. Despite the \"JIT\" (just in time) in the name of the library, rustc_codegen_gcc is intended for ahead-of-time compilation. Its stated primary goal is to enable Rust code generation on platforms unsupported by LLVM. As of October 2023, rustc_codegen_gcc can now compile Rust for Linux without any additional patches. Over the past year, the project seems to have made good progress on many fronts; for example, it has added support for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) operations and link-time optimization, both of which were earlier identified as causes for test failures. Cohen deferred to rustc_codegen_gcc at several points in his EuroRust talk, encouraging attendees to use it instead of gccrs for now. It is, in fact, already upstreamed into the Rust language repository. Rust for Linux Currently, the Rust for Linux project provides documentation for using either rustc or rustc_codegen_gcc to build Rust code for the kernel. The kernel also contains documentation for the minimal supported versions of various build tools, including compilers. For rustc, the version is considered an exact match, rather than a minimum. The currently stated supported rustc version is 1.73.0 (released in October 2023), much more recent than the 1.49 targeted by gccrs. Rust for Linux support is also a stated goal for gccrs, but because of this significant discrepancy, it seems to be quite far off. Gccrs has progressed nicely in the year since we last looked at it: the repository has well over 3,000 commits since January 1, 2023. However, it is not yet in a usable state for almost any practical purpose, since as a complete implementation from the ground up, gccrs is much more ambitious in scope than rustc_codegen_gcc. The latter is already merged to the upstream Rust repository and sees real-world use with Rust for Linux. We are not yet in a world with multiple implementations of a compiler for the Rust language, but it is getting closer.

It is a new formulation of the borrow checker. It is also a specific project that implemented that analysis, based on datalog. Our current plan does not make use of that datalog-based implementation, but uses what we learned implementing it to focus on reimplementing Polonius within rustc. https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/10/06/poloniu... I understand that as they working on reimplementing Polonius within rustc (not a separate crate). It will use the original Polonius ideas but work in a different way. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 15, 2023 16:23 UTC (Fri) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link] It should be noted that is a relatively recent development. Originally polonius was very much written with the idea that it would be used in rustc. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 16, 2023 13:37 UTC (Sat) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link] What “recent development” are you talking about? Polonius is already integrated into rustc and was on the way to becoming default in Rust 2024 only two months ago. What happened in these two months??? Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 16, 2023 14:21 UTC (Sat) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link] You're linking to the same article quoted above, which (in the part quoted) explains the difference between polonius-the-implementation and polonius-the-mathematical-model, which was created while developing polonius-the-implementation. It announces that they no longer intend to use polonius-the-implementation in rustc. This is a recent development, because for the projects multi-year existence, the general consensus was that polonius-the-implementation was going to be used in rustc. What has been implemented in rustc is, thus, polonius-the-mathematical-model. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 15, 2023 22:31 UTC (Fri) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] That's true, but there's still discussion about librarifying chunks of rustc, even if it isn't the datalog-based borrow checker prototype. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 16, 2023 13:40 UTC (Sat) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link] What talks? Where? By whom? Who abandoned Polonius? Nightly Rust still accepts -Zpolonius flag today… Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 18, 2023 20:12 UTC (Mon) by SAI_Peregrinus (subscriber, #151778) [Link] Polonius is both an alggorithm/model for borrow checking and a Datalog implementation of that algorithm. The implementation in rustc today is written in Rust, not Datalog. There are no longer plans to use the Datalog implementation in rustc, since there's a port to Rust. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 16, 2023 13:35 UTC (Sat) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link] I think you are mixing story of Polonius and Chalk. Attempts to bring Chalk into rustc were, indeed, abandoned. And new replacement is supposed to be built, more tightly integrated with rustc. Polonius, on the other hand, was integrated long ago. It's not enabled by default, but that is supposed to replace current borrow checker in Rust 2024. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 16, 2023 20:14 UTC (Sat) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] As noted elsewhere in this thread, the question is whether you mean Polonius the standalone datalog-based implementation, or the algorithm that that implementation prototyped. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 17, 2023 0:25 UTC (Sun) by Phantom_Hoover (subscriber, #167627) [Link] I really do struggle to understand what the practical reason is for gccrs to exist. Integrating Rust with the GCC toolchain is a worthy goal with practical benefits mentioned in this article… and it’s already been achieved with the GCC codegen. I see no benefits to rewriting the frontend, and it will take a ton of constant work given how quickly Rust evolves. The only thing I can think of is easier bootstrapping, which is a pretty marginal concern. Actually I am a bit confused by this part of the article: > There is a wide range of existing GCC plugins that can aid in debugging, static analysis, or hardening; these work on the GCC intermediate representation. Wouldn’t the GCC codegen for rustc be able to take advantage of this, given it’s emitting GCC IR? Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 17, 2023 1:10 UTC (Sun) by roc (subscriber, #30627) [Link] Reimplementing the front-end is likely to expose bugs where the rustc frontend does something unintended. I think it will also be useful for bootstrapping. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 17, 2023 2:28 UTC (Sun) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link] It doesn't really change the bootstrapping story much, given that mrustc exists, which is a C++14 compiler that compiles valid rust to bad C11. So depending on whether you're okay pre-generating those sources, it is either around equally as easy or significantly easier to bootstrap than gccrs would be. Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 18, 2023 1:20 UTC (Mon) by mathstuf (subscriber, #69389) [Link] `mrustc` is stuck on bootstrapping 1.39 last I heard (the primary author went off to complete their degree or something). Note that its \"borrow checker\" implementation is \"I'm sure it's fine\". Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 18, 2023 2:13 UTC (Mon) by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523) [Link] mrustc can bootstrap 1.54 Progress toward a GCC-based Rust compiler Posted Dec 18, 2023 2:13 UTC (Mon) by tialaramex (subscriber, #21167) [Link] \"I'm sure it's fine\" is of course completely reasonable - for a bootstrap compiler. If it's not fine then our final recursive build will discover that and fail. This is no sort of way to do routine development, but that's not what a bootstrap compiler is for.

It would also give users options. If I hit a compiler bug in MSVC, I can file a report, switch to GCC and keep working on my project until the bug is fixed. With Rust, that&#x27;s not currently possible. reply nindalf 11 hours agorootparentYour sentiment is a commonly expressed one, but not usually by people who have adopted Rust. It’s usually Clang&#x2F;MSVC&#x2F;GCC users who have decided this is the optimal flow and want to replicate it in all future codebases they work in, regardless of language.In reality if you hit a compiler bug in Rust or Go (or any other language with one main impl like Python, Ruby…) you would file a report and do one of two things - downgrade the compiler (if it’s an option) or write the code a different way. Compiler bugs in these languages are rare enough that this approach works well.That said, for people who are really keen on a spec, there is one being worked on (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rust-lang.org&#x2F;inside-rust&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;spec-visio...).But this GCCRS effort doesn’t get you any closer to your ideal C&#x2F;C++ style workflow because they are committing to matching the semantics of the main compiler exactly. Bugs and all. And that’s the way it should be.The Rust ecosystem becomes worse if I have to install a different toolchain and learn a different build system with a different compiler for every new project I interact with. And after all that extra effort it turns out there are subtle differences between implementations. My developer experience is just worse at that point. If I wanted to code like this, I would code in C++ but I don’t. reply moregrist 10 hours agorootparent> Your sentiment is a commonly expressed one, but not usually by people who have adopted Rust.Perhaps because it’s currently not possible in Rust, so users don’t really see the advantages yet.Multiple implementation are always a good thing. They bring in diversity of thought and allow for some competition in the implementation. Having multiple slightly different implementations also gives more clarity to a spec.This isn’t the kind of stuff that users tend to think about until it’s already there. reply MindSpunk 8 hours agorootparentI agree there is value to multiple implementations. We wouldn&#x27;t be where we are today with open compilers and efficient machine code if it weren&#x27;t for the competing implementations of LLVM and GCC.However there isn&#x27;t enough benefit to multiple language _frontends_ that I can see that outweighs the many downsides.Not only do you have to contend with the duplication of effort for implementing two or more language frontend projects, you now create ecosystem splits when inevitably the implementations do not match their behavior.The biggest example of multiple frontends, C++, is not one language. C++ is Clang-C++, GNU-C++, MSVC-C++, and so-on. All of these implementations have subtle incompatibilities with how they handle identical code, or they have disjoint feature matrices, or they have bugs, and so on. Multiple frontends is IMO one of the _worst_ parts of C++ because it makes writing truly portable code almost impossible. How many new C++ features are unusable in practice because one of the main 3 toolchains hasn&#x27;t implemented it yet?Rust, on the other hand, everything is portable by default. No #ifdef CLANG, no wrangling with subtly incompatible toolchains. If I write code I can trust it will just work on any architecture Rust can build for, ignoring implementation bugs and explicitly platform specific code.I have a hobby game engine I work on in my spare time that was developed exclusively on x86-64 for years and I ported it to run on Apple Silicon ARM in two afternoons. Rust just _worked_, all the time was spent on my C&#x2F;C++ dependencies and new code needed for MacOS support.I simply don&#x27;t see how nebulous, difficult to quantify benefits of competing implementations can outweigh the practical advantages of truly portable code that comes from a single implementation. The ecosystem benefits to a uniform language, and the benefits to my sanity with being able to trust my code while compile everywhere I need it to. reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentWriting truly portable C++ it’s not all that hard.

The power is not distributed evenly, not even within the elite inner circle.There&#x27;s no &#x27;together as a community` when it&#x27;s followed by a clause like `we need to follow the one direction (X) has set`.What power does `the community` exactly have? to open a PR and get denied? is to fork? Can the community ellect leaders and change course? You said it yourself, anyone that want to have their voice heard, they have to climb up the ladder and join the inner circle. You&#x27;re descriping `Power elite` and not `community`. Even forks don&#x27;t work in real life, what happens is the project usually die slowly and everyone move to the next thing.I&#x27;m not dismissing the structure itself, it&#x27;s a good pragmatic approach, it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re twisting and polishing it. In short: You: Everyone is welcome. No need to fragment. Rust is run by community. Rust&#x27;s governance: We rule. We also pick any new members. Community doesn&#x27;t have much say about anything.So pursuing efforts like the one in the post is exactly how the community is empowered and what might enable Rust to survive any challenges it faces in the future.

It encourages good code hygiene and occasionally identifies bugs in the compiler toolchain.If you are using intrinsics or other architecture-specific features, there is a similar practice of requiring full CI pipelines for at least two CPU architectures. Again, it occasionally finds interesting bugs.For systems I work on we usually have 4 CI pipelines for the combo of GCC&#x2F;LLVM and ARM&#x2F;x86 for these purposes. It costs a bit more but is generally worth it from a code quality perspective. reply izacus 12 hours agorootparentAdding CI pipeline running compiles on MSVC was one of the big shakeouts of undefined behaviour and bugs in our C++ codebase - while making that compiler happy is annoying if you come from Unixy land, it did force us to shed quite a few bad habits and even find several bugs in that endeavor.(And then we could ship the product on Windows, so that was nice.) reply Guvante 14 hours agorootparentprevOur codebase works on all three, we compile on MSVC for Windows, GCC for Linux, and Clang for Mac.It isn&#x27;t easy and honestly the idea of \"just don&#x27;t use MSVC for a while\" is strange to me. Sure you can compile with any of them but almost certainly you are going to stick to one for a given use case.\"This release is on a different compiler\" isn&#x27;t something you do because of a bug. Instead your roll back a version or avoid using the unsupported feature until a fix is released.The reason is as much as they are supposed to do the same thing the reality is bugs are bugs, e.g. if you invoke undefined behavior you will generally get consistent results with a given compiler but all bets are off if you swap. Similarly it is hard not to rely on implementation defined behavior without building your own standard library which specifically defines that behavior across compilers. reply logicchains 16 hours agorootparentprev>I&#x27;d be really surprised if, without diligently committing to maintaining compatibility with the two compilers, it was easy to up sticks and move between themMany places deliberately compile with multiple compilers as part of the build&#x2F;test pipeline, to benefit from more compiler warnings, diagnostics etc. reply cozzyd 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty easy to move between gcc&#x2F;clang&#x2F;icc for most codebases.

With Rust, that&#x27;s not currently possible.Theory is cool, but in practice other compiler has its own quirks tooHow about having one compiler which is used by all developers, which increases chances of bugs getting caught faster and fixed faster meanwhile you just use workaround? reply KolmogorovComp 13 hours agorootparentprevRust has currently no formal specification, so what would you use as an arbiter?Also the article says otherwise > The project wants to make sure that it does not create a special \"GNU Rust\" language, but is trying instead to replicate the output of rustc — bugs, quirks, and all reply lambda 13 hours agorootparentYou use the same process as for deciding if changes to rustc are compliant or not; the judgement of the language and compiler teams.And running into these kinds of questions, both in a single project that evolves over time (rustc) and a separate project, help to feed information back into what you need for a formal specification; which is something that is being planned out. Having a second implementation can help find these areas where you might need to be narrower or broader in your specification, in order to clarify enough for it to be implementable or broaden it enough to accommodate reasonable implementation differences.They are not trying to diverge in language implementation, but there will always be simple compiler bugs, which may crop up in one implementation but not another. For instance, some LLVM optimization pass may miscompile some code; gccrs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be trying to recreate that exact bug. I think that \"bugs, quirks, and all\" really means that they aren&#x27;t trying to fix major limitations of rustc, such as introducing a whole different borrow checker model which might allow some programs that current rustc does not. They&#x27;re trying to fairly faithfully recreate the language that rustc implements, even if some aspects might be considered sub-optimal, but they aren&#x27;t going to re-implement every ICE and miscompilation, those are places where there could be differences. reply KolmogorovComp 12 hours agorootparentI agree with you it has benefits, what I’m wondering about is if not more bugs (though not the same ones) would be fixed by contributing directly to rustc compared to the massive effort of building a new compiler. reply Narishma 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s about finding those bugs in the first place.

Not only does rustc have an extraordinary amount of traction by being basically the only choice up until this point, Rust doesn&#x27;t really have the reputation of moving slowly to adopt new features; if anything, there&#x27;s been as much skepticism about new features added over the years as excitement. I can honestly imagine more people adopting a Rust implementation with a commitment _not_ to add new features that are added to rustc than one that adds its own separate features.Even as someone who probably will never use gccrs, I think having more than one implementation of Rust is a good thing for the language (for all the usual reasons that get cited). In the long term, I&#x27;d love for Rust to eventually to be able to specify its semantics in a way that isn&#x27;t tied to rustc, which is a moving target and gets murky when you consider implementation-specific bugs. reply nequo 16 hours agorootparent> Rust doesn&#x27;t really have the reputation of moving slowly to adopt new featuresThere are some exceptions to this.

Buy or build is roughly money vs time (aka money). Software freedom is not the same thing.Also why does software freedom lead to divergences? Certainly GCC partook in the arms race around C++ but recently they have been pretty good about aiming for full standard support as the goal. (The exception being proposed features but that is unavoidable when C++ prefers battle tested proposals) reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentActually one of the problems we are having with compilers catching up with ISO is that since C++11, features aren&#x27;t battle tested, rather designed in paper or some special compiler branch, and eventually adopted by everyone. reply Guvante 13 hours agorootparentHonestly depending on the feature that might be for the best. If all three compilers have distinct on by default divergent settings that would be terrible.My point is outside of instances where everyone agrees something has to change you need a compiler branch at the minimum. This means the compiler you changed will get that feature first.Given it takes years to implement the full standard this leads to divergence between the compilers in standards compliance.Honestly all totally workable but makes talking about \"standard C++\" hard. reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentThere are more than three compilers, and many of the changes if done at all in an existing compiler, are a mix between private branches and ongoing unstable features, hardly battle tested as the first standards were, when existing practice is what came into the standard. replycbmuser 4 hours agoparentprevI don’t understand why this question is kept being asked.Is Rust holy in some sense that’s it’s not allowed to rewrite the frontend?It’s still a PITA to bootstrap Rust on a new architecture and there is also no working Rust compiler for architectures not supported by LLVM.I know that there is codegen_rust_gcc but that one has the same bootstrap problems as the original Rust compiler and also requires architecture support to be landed in various Rust part which Rust maintainers have beem hesitant about (been there, done that).So, I am absolutely glad that there will be an out of the box usable Rust compiler in the near future which will finally allow me to build rustified libraries again on architectures such as alpha without much pain. reply edelsohn 12 hours agoparentprevBased on that logic, why did the LLVM community develop Clang, Clang++, libc++, etc. instead of continuing with DragonEgg? There already were GCC, G++, libstdc++ , as well as EDG C++ front-end.GCC, Clang, MSVC, and other compilers complement each other, serve different purposes, and serve different markets. They also ensure that the language is robust and conforms to a specification, not whatever quirks a single implementation happens to provide. And multiple implementations avoids the dangers of relying on a single implementation, which could have future problems with security, governance, etc.The GNU Toolchain Project, the LLVM Project, the Rust project all have experienced issues and it&#x27;s good to not rely on a single point of failure. Redundancy and anti-fragility is your friend. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentLLVM saw growth for a number of reasons, but nothing to do because it was actually beneficial for the C++ ecosystem:* A C++ codebase. At the time GCC was written in C which slowed development (it’s now a C++ codebase adopting the lessons LLVM provided)* It had a friendlier license than GCC which switched to GPLv3 and thus Google & Apple moved their compiler teams to work on LLVM over time.* Libc++ is a combination of friendlier license + avoiding the hot garbage that was (maybe still is?) libstdc++ (e.g. there were incompatible design decisions in libstdc++ that inhibited implementing the C++ spec like SSO). There were also build time improvements if I recall correctly.* LLVM provided a fresher architecture which made it more convenient as a research platform (indeed most compiler academics target LLVM rather than GCC for new research ideas).Basically, the reason LLVM was invested in instead of DragonEgg was a mixture of license & the GCC community being quite difficult to work with causing huge amounts of investments by industry and academia into LLVM. Once those projects took off, even after GCC fixed their community issues they still had the license problem and the LLVM community was strongly independent.Compilers don’t typically generate security issues so that’s not a problem. There are questions of governance but due to the permissive license that Rust uses governance problems can be rectified by forking without building a new compiler from the ground up (e.g. what happened with NodeJS until the governance issues were resolved and the fork reabsorbed).It’s funny you mention the different C++ compilers consider that Clang is well on its way of becoming the dominant compiler. It’s already targeting to be a full drop-in replacement for MSVC and it’s fully capable of replacing GCC on Linux unless you’re on a rarer platform where GCC has a bit richer history in the embedded space). I think over the long term GCC is likely to die and it’s entirely possible that MSVC will abandon their in-house and instead use clang (same as they did abandoning IE & adopting Blink). It will be interesting to see if ICC starts porting their optimizations to LLVM and making them freely available - I can’t imagine ICC licenses really bring in enough money to justify things. reply pjmlp 10 minutes agorootparent> it’s now a C++ codebase adopting the lessons LLVM providedLLVM isn&#x27;t the first compiler written in C++, and it isn&#x27;t the first compiler framework building tool eitherThe most famous one, certainly. reply nicoburns 9 hours agorootparentprevI think I read somewhere that recent ICC is LLVM based, just not freely available because of course the LLVM licence doesn’t require that.

Each platform&#x2F;compiler combo needs ifdefs and workarounds that have been done for so long they’re considered a normal thing (or people say MSVC and others don’t count, and C is just GCC+POSIX).There’s value in multiple implementations ensuring code isn’t bug-compatible, but at the same time in C and C++ there’s plenty of unnecessary differences and unspecified details due to historical reasons, and the narrow scope of their specs. reply gkbrk 17 hours agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s how the story goes. Languages with specs are widely deployed despite being fragmented and bad, not because people find value in multiple implementations. Must be a coincidence that C, C++, Javascript and C# and Java all fall under this umbrella. reply vlovich123 16 hours agorootparentC# has multiple compilers and runtimes? Mono used to be a separate thing but if I recall correctly mono has been adopted by MS & a lot merged between the two.JavaScript itself is a very simple language with most of the complexity living in disparate runtimes and that there are multiple runtime implementations is a very real problem requiring complex polyfills that age poorly that are maintained by the community. For what it’s worth TypeScript has a single implementation and it’s extremely popular in this community.Java is probably the “best” here but really there’s still only the Sun & OpenJDK implementations and the OpenJDK and Oracle are basically the same if I recall correctly with the main difference being the inclusion of proprietary “enterprise” components that Oracle can charge money for. There are other implementations of the standard but they’re much more niche (e.g. Azul systems). A point against disparate implementations is how Java on Android is now basically a fork & a different language from modern-day Java (although I believe that’s mostly because of the Oracle lawsuit).Python is widely deployed & CPython remains the version that most people deploy. Forks find it difficult to keep up with the changes (e.g. PyPy for the longest time lagged quite badly although it seems like they’re doing a better job keeping up these days). The forks have significantly less adoption than CPython though.It seems unlikely that independent Rust front end implementations will benefit it’s popularity. Having GCC code gen is valuable but integrating that behind the Rust front-end sounds like a better idea and is way further along. gccrs is targeting a 3 year old version of Rust that still isn’t complete while the GCC backend is being used to successfully compile the Linux kernel.

They all struggle with keeping up with the pace of change cause the team behind TS is quite large. There was an effort to do a fairly straight port into Rust which actually turned out quite well, but then the “why” question comes up - the reason would be to do better performance but improving performance requires changing the design which a transliteration approach can’t give you & the more of the design you change, the harder it is to keep up with incoming changes putting you back at square 1.

Since Java has versioned specs, platform X can support one version, and you can target it based on that information even if other versions come out and get supported by other platforms.For example C89 and C99 are pretty old, and modern C has a lot that is different from them. But they still get targeted and deployed, and enjoy a decent following. Because even in 2024, you can write a new C89 compiler and people&#x27;s existing and new C89 code will compile on it if you implement it right. reply sunshowers 14 hours agorootparentBut as a developer I do want to use (some of) the latest features as soon as they become available.

Adhering to a language standard is much clearer than specifying it by a language compiler&#x27;s version. Behaviour is documented in the former while one has to observe the output of a binary (and hope that side effects are understood with their full gravity). reply estebank 13 hours agorootparentBut no-one writes code against the standard. We all write code against the reality of the compiler(s) we use. If there&#x27;s a compiler bug, you either use a different version, a different vendor, or we side step the code triggering the issue. The spec only tells you that the vendor might fix this in the future. reply _gabe_ 8 hours agorootparentThis is definitely not true. Whenever I have a question about a C++ language feature I typically go here first[0], and then if I’m looking for compiler specific info I go to the applicable compiler docs second. Likewise, for Java I go here[1]. For JavaScript I typically reference Mozilla since those docs are usually well written, but they reference the spec where applicable and I dig deeper if needed[2].Now, none of these links are the specifications for the languages listed, but they all copiously link to the specification where applicable. In rare situations, I have gone directly to the specification. That’s usually if I’m trying to parse a subset of the language or understand an obscure language feature.I would argue no one writes code against a compiler. Sure we all validate our code with a compiler, but a compiler does not tell you how the language works or interacts with itself. I write my code and look for answers to my questions in the specification for my respective languages, and I suspect most programmers do as well.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.cppreference.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;specs&#x2F;index.html[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript reply estebank 6 hours agorootparentIf the compiler you use and the spec of your language disagree, what do you do?The Project is working on a specification. The Foundation hired someone for it.A Rust spec done purely on paper ahead of time would be the contents of the accepted RFCs. The final implementation almost never matches what was described because during the lengthy implementation and stabilization process we encounter multitude of unknown unknowns. The work of the spec writers will be to go back and document the result of that process.For what is worth the seeming dragging of feet on this is because the people that would be qualified and inclined to doing that work were working on other, more pressing matters. If we had had a spec back in, let&#x27;s say, Rust 1.31, what would have that changed, in practice? reply throwaway17_17 6 hours agorootparentCan you articulate what a spec for a programming language entails in your mind. I am sure it is a niche opinion&#x2F;position, but I base any discussions of formal specification of a language on ‘The Definition of ML’. With that as a starting point I don’t see how the implementation process of a compiler would do anything that could force a change to the spec. Once the formal syntax is defined, the static and dynamic semantics of the language laid out and those semantics proved approximately consistent and possessing ‘type safety’ (for some established meaning of the words). Any divergence or disagreement is a failing of the implementation. I’m genuinely interested in what you expect a specification of Rust to be if, as your comment suggests, you have a different point of view? reply estebank 6 hours agorootparentA specification can be prescriptive (stating how things should work) or descriptive (stating the observable behavior of a specific version of software). For example earlier in Rust&#x27;s post-1.0 life the borrow checker changed behavior a few times, some to fix soundness bugs, some to enable more correct code to work (NLL). An earlier spec would have described different behavior to what Rust is today (but of course, the spec can be updated over time as well).How should the Rust Specification represent the type inference algorithm that rustc uses? Is an implementation that can figure out types in more cases than described by the specification conformant? This is the \"split ecosystem concern\" some have with the introduction of multiple front ends: code that works on gccrs but not rustc. There&#x27;s no evidence that this will be a problem in practice, everyone involved seems to be aligned on that being a bad idea.> Any divergence or disagreement is a failing of the implementation.Specs can have bugs too, not just software. reply throwaway17_17 5 hours agorootparentI think it was probably a rhetorical question, but with regards to type checking, as with ML, type inference is an elaboration step in the compiler that produces the correct syntax of the formal language defined in the language definition. Specifying the actual implemented algorithm that translates from concrete syntax to abstract syntax (and the accompanying elaboration to explicit type annotations) is a separate component of the specification document that does not exert any control or guidance to the definition of the formal language of the ‘language’ in question.I think this may be a large point of divergence with regard to my understanding and position on language specifications. I assume when posts have said Rust is getting a spec, that that included a formal, ‘mathematically’ proven language definition of the core language. I am aware that is not what C or C++ or JS includes in a spec (and I don’t know if that is true for Ada), but I was operating under the assumption the Rust’s inspiration from Ocaml and limited functional-esque stylings that the language would follow the more formalized definition style I am used to. reply estebank 5 hours agorootparentLook at Goals and Scope in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rust-lang.org&#x2F;inside-rust&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;spec-visio... for what the Rust spec will be. reply gkbrk 6 hours agorootparentprev> If the compiler you use and the spec of your language disagree, what do you do?If the compiler claims to follow the specified version of the spec, and it doesn&#x27;t, you file a compiler bug.And then use the subset that it supports, perhaps by using an older spec if it supports that fully.

The target is not perfection, but merely being better than the alternative.I think that, in the absence of conflicts of interests, single source of truth models (e.g. what rust rust&#x2F;python&#x2F;java&#x2F;... does) are likely to do better than &#x27;herd&#x27; of competing implementation models (C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;javascript) at making a good language. The latter probably does better at working despite conflicts of interest, but that&#x27;s not a problem with most programming languages where there is relatively (compared to the browser ecosystem) little opportunity for a powerful corporation to push their interest to the detriment of others.I think the rust community is quite clear that the rust leadership is flawed, but that&#x27;s not very interesting without a way to make leadership better.

There is no reason why it should not have a standard to better formalize its requirements and behaviors. reply faitswulff 13 hours agorootparentYes, it’s a nuanced blog post. But that also means it doesn’t coming out swinging hard for needing a standard, either. It seems like there is as strong an argument to be made that “Rust is a great language. There is no reason why it needs a standard.”See the Ferrocene compiler which has been qualified for ISO standards. It’s essentially a standard Rust 1.68 compiler with a lot of added documentation. If you need a Rust compiler for safety critical environments, it’s reasonably priced and requires essentially zero changes to the Rust compiler that they didn’t just upstream.

What purpose does it serve? Couldn&#x27;t a vehicle manufacturer just say \"our vehicles are safe\"?Which would you trust more: a vehicle that is verified to meet ISO 26262 standards, or a vehicle whose manufacturer tells you \"it&#x27;s safe\" without formally defining what \"safe\" means?I stated it above, but I will re-state it here: Without a language standard, there are many organizations and industries that will not use Rust. Not because Rust is not a fantastic tool for the job, but because laws, regulations, etc. require standardization and qualification of components.This means that I can use a qualified C compiler and toolchain to write safety-critical code, but I can&#x27;t use Rust despite the fact that Rust is a better choice and will help to prevent problems.

It seems like every time someone makes a personal or professional project in C&#x2F;C++, the Rust community floods the comments section and talks about how it&#x27;s irresponsible to use C&#x2F;C++ and how the author should just throw away the whole project and re-write it in Rust.It happens so often it became a meme at this point. reply sgift 15 hours agorootparent> It happens so often it became a meme at this point.No, the meme is kept alive by C++ people who say that this happens without it actually happen. It happened a long time ago a few times, since then it&#x27;s either an active discussion about languages, where for some reason talking about Rust is a problem, but every other language is okay or it&#x27;s someone feeling attacked by the mere idea that projects which only could be done in C++ could now also be done by another language and starts crying about how the Rust community would flood every topic.There&#x27;s no longer an area where C++ is the only available option.

If a language doesn’t have multiple implementations, it’s a pretty sad excuse for a language. reply PoignardAzur 17 hours agoparent> I’m surprised at the negative reaction to GCC-RS. If a language doesn’t have multiple implementations, it’s a pretty sad excuse for a language.That used to be the common wisdom (especially because of C&#x2F;C++), but it&#x27;s a lot more debated these days.The consensus in the Rust community is that the current situation (one canonical-by-definition compiler, lots of documentation, a minimal spec for safety-critical industries, and specs for some modular sub-parts) get most of the advantages of multiple implementations without the drawbacks. reply not2b 17 hours agorootparentI think that the people who are debating it are missing some things. It often happens that only when a second implementation is attempted, unspecified holes in the documentation are exposed and standards are tightened up. Any differences in the two compilers will either mean that there&#x27;s a bug in the new implementation (most likely), a bug or unclear issue in the documentation, or a bug in the mature implementation (it happens).And no, the official compiler isn&#x27;t canonical by definition. If it were, it would mean it has no bugs, and if there&#x27;s a crash or a wrong result that&#x27;s what the language is supposed to do. reply vlovich123 16 hours agorootparentEverything in engineering is trade offs. A single front end ends up in a stronger position for the community (i.e. the users of the language) because bug reports are easier (only one project to report them to), collaboration is easier&#x2F;simpler for OSS maintainers (no issues where “crate foo works fine on rustc but doesn’t on gccrs” to triage&#x2F;maintain), and language features come quicker (no need to synchronize&#x2F;debate with other implementations). The downsides of underspecification are much smaller by comparison. As far as documentation goes that’s a red herring because gccrs is reusing the single standard library implementation which means that any documentation issues would still exist (I don’t think I’ve even once needed to lookup documentation for the compiler & language docs issues would be shared as well since rustc in this model still remains the canonical ground truth). reply not2b 15 hours agorootparentAt this point, gccrs is quite immature, so you can simply ignore it. If we get to the point where its quality is good enough, this will change, but the likelihood is that any problems found will result in improvements to documentation (if something is underspecified). There could also be optimization bugs in LLVM that aren&#x27;t present in GCC, so we could find bugs in rustc that aren&#x27;t in gccrs at some point, but I think that will only be significant if gccrs greatly improves.For now, anyone who finds that “crate foo works fine on rustc but doesn’t on gccrs” can just report a bug to gccrs. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentI’m not saying that gccrs contributors should stop. If they want to invest their time & energy into it kudos. I happen to think the costs outweighs the benefits but you’re right that I can just ignore it to no ill effect right now. Where I would caution that though is when the Rust project starts needing to making accommodations to help gccrs (which is something described in the article). It’s possible that some accommodations help Rust anyway &#x2F; there’s no harm, but it’s also useful to be mindful that more & more of these accommodations can start to have a negative cost over time & thus impact Rust as a whole & these costs are obnoxiously hard to quantify and because people like to get along there’s a general preference to be more accommodating. That’s the real danger that gccrs poses and the intangible benefits that you lay out are likely not that significant in the long term compared with the cost to build gccrs &#x2F; modify Rust to accommodate gccrs. Of course, we’re just arguing over opinions since it’s so hard to quantify any of this. reply Longlius 12 hours agorootparentprev>it&#x27;s a lot more debated these daysBy who specifically?

The real problem comes from glibc and the way it depends on gcc internals, which depend on libc (i.e. circularly). Bootstrapping GCC on Musl is quite easy.glibc is the real dumpster fire. reply sylware 17 hours agoparentprevThe problem is on the long run: syntax stability, avoiding feature creeps with extensions&#x2F;attributes, like we actually have with C (c++ is beyond saving due to its absurd and grotesque complexity).Without that, you won&#x27;t have real-life alternatives. reply ajross 13 hours agorootparent> avoiding feature creeps with extensions&#x2F;attributes,That seems like a purely semantic argument?

According to him, the Sega Dreamcast homebrew community uses gccrs to create new games for the Dreamcast gaming console, and GCC plugins can already be used to perform static analysis on unsafe Rust code. The Dreamcast community&#x27;s interest stems from the fact that rustc&#x27;s LLVM backend does not support the Hitachi SH-4 architecture of the console, whereas GCC does; even in its incomplete state, gccrs is helpful for this embedded use case.This is delightful. reply habitue 3 hours agoparentThis is a little misleading.

It&#x27;s like buying vs renting. It takes a lot more dev hours to get support into GCC, but once it&#x27;s there, it stays there. reply khuey 8 hours agorootparent> This is the biggest problem with the LLVM mentality: they use architecture support as a means to extract support (i.e. salaried dev positions) from hardware companies.I have a hard time seeing this as a bad thing. Hardware companies seem like the most logical people to pay for maintaining support for the architectures they sell. reply estebank 6 hours agorootparentprevSupport wasn&#x27;t dumped, it was demoted from Tier 2 to Tier 3 to better reflect the level of support that backend effectively already had. As mentioned in that thread, if someone steps up to maintain it, it can be bumped again to Tier 2.Be aware that GCC doesn&#x27;t have a similar level of specificity about the state of each platform they support. There are packages in Debian that \"compile\" but when trying to execute them on \"exotic\" platforms you encounter bugs immediately. Supporting a platform in a static codebase of a compiler is easy, but in codebases actively being worked on, like GCC and LLVM, keeping things working is not trivial. reply Asraelite 14 hours agoparentprevI would assume it also means additional configuration options for already-supported architectures.For example, I recently discovered that with RISC-V, GCC supports the RV32E target but LLVM doesn&#x27;t. reply monocasa 13 hours agorootparentAre you sure about that?I was pretty sure that llvm has supported RV32E for years now. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviews.llvm.org&#x2F;D70401?id=395048 reply Asraelite 12 hours agorootparentOh, last time I checked clang didn&#x27;t support it.In any case, there are a lot of other compiler flags that are exclusive to gcc. reply segfaultbuserr 14 hours agoparentprevCan&#x27;t wait to see some PDP-11 machine code from Rust (the last time I checked, freestanding C compiling still worked on GCC). reply gumby 14 hours agoprev> A lot of care is being put into gccrs not becoming a \"superset\" of Rust, as Cohen put it. The project wants to make sure that it does not create a special \"GNU Rust\" language, but is trying instead to replicate the output of rustc — bugs, quirks, and all.In my experience, the part in italics is a significant mistake.Rust does not have a specification; there is a reference but it is explicitly not normative. A language udocumented except for a single reference implementation (as is tpday&#x27;s fashion) have a long term weakness. What is the motivation for slavishly trying to maintain compatibility with the bugs and accidental quirks of another implementation? To guarantee that existing code will work in both implementations, which sounds sensible. And it is a sensible goal, but it does so at enormous cost by enforcing it in the wrong place.The problem is that sometimes decisions are wrong, and sometimes bugs are written. But when you promise that all implementations will be bug compatible as part of compatibility you are also signing up to fossilize these bugs whether you want to or not.A good example of someone who embraced this (to their credit!) is Microsoft: they spend a lot of person-power making sure that old programs continue to run while trying to fix security and reliability bugs. Rust need not and should not sign up for this burden so early in its lifespan. They should learn from history.If they want the language to evolve they should embrace QA and QC. Famously \"you cannot test quality into a product\". You need QA: architecture, design, design and code reviews, etc to ensure that things will work properly and when not, that \"failure heads in the appropriate direction\". Then later in the development cycle QC (test cases) tries to see if you missed. This doesn&#x27;t just apply to product development -- it applies to language development especially.The strong standards (e.g. ComonLisp, C++, FORTRAN) embraced this belief. The weak, de facto ones (Most notably Python, but plenty of others) can still become popular, but change is difficult. Look at how long the Python 2->3 transition took, and how few python implementations there are. reply nicoburns 9 hours agoparentIf they find a big then presumably they’ll report it upstream and both implementations can be changed. reply gumby 8 hours agorootparentThe point is that fixing that bug may break existing, running code that depends on it. reply estebank 6 hours agorootparentThats why we run crater against all of crates.io: there are changes that should be allowed that we hold off on because 9f breakage, and fixes we assumed we couldn&#x27;t land that in reality had no real world impact. As time goes on the confidence a \"clean\" crater run gives us goes down, due to adoption in closed source environments, but it is still invaluable signal.

    "originBody": "Back Dec 18, 2023 I Love Ruby The Ruby logo is Copyright © 2006, Yukihiro Matsumoto and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 I’ve done a lot in my career. From working on business support software to big backend systems and even robotics. If there’s been a consistent through-line to my career, it’s the Ruby programming language. In recent years, Ruby has fallen out of favor with the tech industry, but I still love it. It’s a great language with so many strengths that it hurts when I see people trash Ruby or say its time is over. Thankfully, I’m not alone. There are so many Ruby devs still out here. The community is niche, but thriving. People are puzzled by this sometimes. Once, a colleague once said “rubyists really love ruby,” with an air of surprise. I’ve heard others trash ruby for not having types. One person laughed at me when I said Ruby was an “expressive language” and said, “it doesn’t express anything about the implementation.” So why do myself and others love Ruby so much? I thought I’d explore this a bit. Fostering Programmer Happiness First and foremost, Ruby is a language that strives to make programmers happy. This is an underrated value and one that often gets our community mocked by our peers within other communities. The language is meant be joyful to use. This is a value and an ethos that permeates the language, the ecosystem of gems, and the community. Everything else that Ruby is stems from this value. When I write Ruby, I take so much joy out of the process. Even the bad parts. In the middle of a high stress incident, Ruby still sparks joy. In fact, the only time I don’t enjoy Ruby is when I’m working on a piece of code that doesn’t follow Ruby practices, patterns, and idioms. Which brings me to the next topic Expressiveness Encouraged Ruby is probably the most expressive programming language on Earth. Between its metaprogramming features and cultural idioms, Ruby allows programmers to write code that clearly expresses its intent. Well written ruby code can often read like natural language. Features like predicate methods even give up punctuation. So you can easily write something like: if @subscription.supports_feature?(:feature_a) ... else ... end This is often why ruby programmers don’t like comments. In most cases, the language makes comments unnecessary. And when you do need them, it’s often when you’re doing a very specific or obscure thing that requires context to understand. It’s clear from the code why you need a comment in that case. Tied into this is the ecosystems embrace of domain specific languages(DSLs), which give us the power to write incredibly expressive code that reads like what it’s doing. For example, RSpec’s DSL reads exactly like how a person might talk about what they want to test: RSpec.describe Ticket do context 'when the ticket is closed' do it 'emails the requestor with a confirmation' do ... end end end Methods, sorry “approaches,” like this have made Ruby so joyful to use. A Language Made Just For Me Many rubyists, myself included, recount stories of how Ruby and Rails just fit their brain. I recently told this story on Remote Ruby about learning ruby. I said that when I was learning Ruby it felt like it was made just for me. I could guess method names and signatures and I would be right most of the time. When I was wrong, I could switch the order of arguments. This was so true that quickly I learned to just try something based on intuition before reading the docs. I know so many rubyists who have similar stories. Feeling recognition in the language you’re programming is so powerful. Community And Values It’s so hard to talk about Ruby without talking about how the community shapes what Ruby is and how it feels to use the language. Ruby is a great language with so many benefits. There’s lots of features and values built into its core that make it a joy to use. But as Kent Beck said at RailsConf in 2020, “Software design is an exercise in human relationships.” He was talking about how we think about designing software. But I think this quote applies to our community and our values as well. If you’ve followed this blog or listened to The Ruby on Rails Podcast since I took over, you know that community is a big part of my value system. That value is shared by other rubyists. I attended RubyConf in San Diego this year. These conferences are always a blast. It feels like I’m coming home to see old friends. The community building that happens at these conferences makes lifelong colleagues and friends. There a spirit of learning, and cooperation. We want to help each other, teach each other, learn from each other. The Ruby community is an incredible group of people of welcoming, kind, and supportive peers. Without the community, Ruby couldn’t be what it is. There’s a lot of reasons to like ruby. And there’s so many things that rubyists love. I haven’t covered everything. But Ruby’s primary features are joy and community. That’s hard to beat. Do you love Ruby? Tell me what you love about it",

If you are lucky that is, it might also be part of some library&#x27;s weird meta-programming of supports-* that no LSP can point you towards.

It may be a module included into the class, the class itself or one of its super classes, or a concept built on modules like ActiveSupport \"concerns\". But source_location works in almost all cases.> might also be part of some library&#x27;s weird meta-programming of supports-* that no LSP can point you towardsYes, if this comes from method_missing, you can&#x27;t check it&#x27;s source_location. You need to use your knowledge that the method name works and that method_missing is how such things are done, and then you do object.method(:method_missing).source_location and read the logic there.The lack of safe and reliable IDE introspection and design-time type support are my number one issue with Ruby, and why I tend to use typed languages instead.However, there are workflows for inspecting a codebase that work, they just don&#x27;t fit in well to the usual LSP+IDE pattern. You are expected to use irb&#x2F;rails console to do your inspection of the structure and behavior of your programs. reply vidarh 28 minutes agorootparentTo me this is why I don&#x27;t like IDEs.My Ruby projects often have a wrapper that reloads code and puts me in pry prompt.

The more abstract they can make code the better (more safe?) they feel. That lets them play chess on their terms and eliminate the competition. But that&#x27;s just my take, I may be wrong. Fortunately the most commonly used gems wrap this abstraction into usable APIs, and most have good documentation.While this can be correctly attributed to ruby or the devs in its ecosystem, I&#x27;ve been on teams with staff using other languages and stacks that let their completion&#x2F;anxiety fly making it hard to read and understand their code. I guess my point is it&#x27;s a good critique, but it falls beyond the meta programming in ruby. reply Doctor_Fegg 10 hours agoparentprev> The supports_feature-method is probably defined somewhere 5 abstractions deepThis is the classic mistake of confusing Ruby with Rails.

Yes Rails is particularly bad, but I&#x27;ve been working with Ruby for ~15 years now, and plenty of non-rails codebases in that time. The metaprogramming and implicitness runs deep in most of the community, it&#x27;s common to find highly magic and hidden implementations in Ruby generally. reply lloeki 26 minutes agorootparentprevAgreed. Ruby is not Rails in so many ways, even on philosophical grounds. Rails is full of magic, implicitness, and conventions, which enables a great deal of very speedy development but also becomes† a minefield if you steer away from The Way; while plain Ruby is very explicit and in plain sight, there&#x27;s no magic. It&#x27;s a blank page, an open field, it&#x27;s raw material for creative ground.Rack or Minitest for example are very Ruby. RSpec on the other hand is full of Railsy magic, just yesterday testing some threaded stuff I was bit by `let` because it has concurrency consequences, and the magic becomes darkness as you have to look behind the curtain and beat it into submission in roundabout ways that obscure the thing you&#x27;re actually doing.† or sometimes is a minefield, all by itself, like this nonsense: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rails&#x2F;rails&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1512cf2ba578282c898b8eb6... reply pdntspa 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a pretty simple heuristic to track down the source of metaprogrammed functions... just check for method_missing() or define_function() or a handful of other keywords.

Use of inheritance for code sharing. It makes it extremely hard to reason about any piece of code I am looking at. Where does the `param` variable come from? Is it injected by any ancestors of the class I&#x27;m looking at? Who knows, I have to use the debugger to find out. I cannot reason about the code without it. Of course you can use Ruby while preferring composition over inheritance, it&#x27;s just rarely done by the community. Other modern languages like Go and Rust wisely leave out inheritance for code sharing in their object model and arguably have much more readable (albeit verbose) code.2. Global mutable state is everywhere. Not sure if it&#x27;s Rails architecture that encouraged using global state as request local state (until they found out that this makes concurrency hard), but Ruby codebases are full of global mutable state. It&#x27;s everywhere and again makes it hard to reason about dependencies between objects and how they interact with each other. Again, this is nothing that the language forces people to do, it&#x27;s conventions.3. Overuse of meta programming. Ruby&#x27;s metaprogramming is really well done in my opinion. The problem is that lots of people want to use it and do so in places where it doesn&#x27;t provide enough value to justify the costs. It&#x27;s an authentication library. It doesn&#x27;t need it&#x27;s own DSL. reply vidarh 20 minutes agoparent\"param\" isn&#x27;t a variable unless you defined it in the current method - it lacks a sigil so if it&#x27;s a variable it must be a local one. So it&#x27;s more likely to be a method, and so you can usually find where it was defined with self.method(:param).source-location.As for disliking Rails, join the club, plenty of Ruby users dislike Rails too. reply 1letterunixname 4 minutes agoparentprev[insert my own personal bitching about the pains of procedural configuration management using Ruby at scale and the lost causes of rubocop and rbs]a. Yes, global mutable state is anti-functional style, side-effect-oriented, god function&#x2F;object programming and it sucks.b. The lack of an ability to seal objects, classes, and modules from further modification is a problem.c. Ruby 3 should&#x27;ve broken compatibility by adding gradual typing.d. Nonorthogonality - Too many ways to do the same thing.e. Dying community - Too much broken code out there.f. Ruby was \"Perl5 2.0\" in most senses.For type-safer things that look like Ruby, Crystal is an almost viable, interesting alternative.Otherwise, I have evolved past Ruby because of the learning curve for others, too many people hate it, too many maintainers have attitude&#x2F;professionalism problems, and there are more supportable alternatives for most use-cases such as rust, elixir, and bash. Sometimes, it&#x27;s still useful to use ruby for some quick text formatting or a quick CLI utility in the space of awk, perl, or sed. The world mostly uses js and python.

It&#x27;s a great language, and as a language I like many things about Ruby a lot more than python. In particular, chains of functional operations like: arr .map{|o| ... } .reject{|o| ...} .reduce(init_acculm){|init_acculm, o| ...}are super super clean and expressive. Very similar to what I like about Java streams.And the library ecosystem is great, I like how it shares spiritual similarities with python where libraries are very \"no nonsense\" (you don&#x27;t need extensive configuration and builders and researching a million configuration items etc etc... looking at you, Java) and you typically just import and go. Rails, of course.I keep picking python over ruby though, for things I&#x27;m going to have to actually maintain. And I typically pick Java over python if I smell I&#x27;m going to care even an iota about performance. (Often I don&#x27;t, though). But ruby vs python, I keep coming back to the divergent opinions they&#x27;ve taken on gradual typing. I like that python3 lets you include the types as part of the program, part of the grammar. Ruby relegates them to a separate file. I guess the intent is that it&#x27;s more for libraries, like how js libs will ship typescript type files? But I don&#x27;t like that, I want types for myself. Sorbet exists, of course, but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a) a gem and b) still not a first-class part of the grammar but is instead just operating \"in-language\". I know it works and e.g. Stripe uses it to great effect (I worked there) but I just don&#x27;t like it, personally, and I find that python3 with its built-in type hinting tends to get typed more readily than ruby where it&#x27;s a much further reach away.But I really love ruby. I hope it improves its type-hinting story because I like most other things about it. But I was pretty unenthusiastic about python prior to it getting its type hinting built-in, so apparently this is a big deal for me. reply woodruffw 11 hours agoparentBlocks and `yield` are a killer feature; I regularly pick Python over Ruby for similar reasons as you, but I consistently find myself missing those two (and all the things that get built out of them, like the `Iterator` APIs).Python is a lovely language, but context managers often feel like a shabby substitute for what I can do with `yield` in Ruby :-) reply endgame 11 hours agorootparentThis is basically how I feel about true first-class functions when I have to wrangle ruby and care about blocks, procs, and lambdas. reply MichaelDickens 11 hours agorootparentI love the syntax of Ruby blocks (IMO it&#x27;s the best syntax for higher-order functions in any language) but I don&#x27;t understand why they were implemented the way they are, where some things are blocks, some things are procs, and neither one is really a function. I would prefer if Ruby blocks were just functions. reply jez 6 hours agorootparentNot saying it’s the optimal choice in the languages design spectrum, but it is a little defensible:If you’re prototyping a new interpreted language and don’t want to have to build a JIT that can optimize code, but still want some semblance of good performance, the block approach Ruby picks can be pretty useful.Ruby doesn’t haven to allocate a full-on, garbage-collected, closure object every time a function accepts a block: it only has to do this if the block gets stored to a variable. If the block is only ever yield’d to, the allocation can be skipped.And when your language’s primary looping mechanism is done with blocks, the difference adds up: xs.each do |ys| # with normal closures and no fancy JIT, # the VM has to allocate a closure once per loop: ys.each do |y| end endRuby was able to get away with its closure-heavy standard library APIs without a JIT for almost 3 decades because of the affordances that blocks provide over procs&#x2F;lambdas. reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentprevBlocks are Proc objects whenever you take their value, and it&#x27;s only an implementation dependent optimization that they are not that all the time in MRI. It&#x27;s perfectly viable to implement a Ruby where blocks are always Proc&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t need to care about that distinction.Ruby doesn&#x27;t have functions at all - it has objects with methods, and you can treat a block as an object whenever you want. reply zoky 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can convert between blocks and Procs very easily. Ruby has several methods to let you do that, both as syntax and as methods. They are really two sides of the same coin; a block can be thought of as a Proc that is intended for immediate usage (though this is convention, and of course nothing prevents you from converting a block into a Proc and stashing it away for later).As for functions, Ruby doesn’t really have them—or, rather, blocks and Procs really are the closest you get to a function. Instead, since everything is an object, Ruby has methods instead of functions. Critically, because methods are defined on objects they have inherent object context, which is why you can’t treat a defined method as an anonymous function. Of course, there are ways to extract the method as a Proc and pass it to another object (with or without its object context). But having methods be objects the way they are in, for example, JavaScript would require extra magic under the hood, and lead to all sorts of context gotchas, which is probably why it doesn’t work that way. reply djur 3 hours agorootparentIn 15+ years of writing Ruby for production I can&#x27;t think of a single time where the distinction between blocks and procs caused a problem.

And it fits nicely with the stdlib and libraries (ex map yields to a block to do the mapping). Ruby also has an enumerator that does some similar things to pythons yield: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ruby-lang.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;master&#x2F;Enumerator.htmlPythons yield is more commonly used for iteration and stuff although it does allow some neat tricks for scoping things. reply thomasz 3 hours agorootparentprevCompletely different.

Just wondering. reply cardanome 7 hours agoparentprevHonestly, I think both Python and Ruby have a subpar gradual typing story.The problem is that Python type hints are not enforced at runtime. They can can not be trusted. You have to rely on external type checkers that are relatively slow and different checker might give you different results.Probably the only mainstream backend-language getting gradual typing right is PHP. Yes, good old PHP. Dead simple type system, no productivity-sucking compile step like in Typescript, actual runtime enforcement of types contrary to Python and great static linting.Though PHP is also a fair bit less expressive and dynamic compared to both Python and Ruby so it can get away with an much simpler type system. Then again, as someone who has to work with many legacy systems, sometimes I am very grateful for the lower expressiveness. reply atomicnumber3 7 hours agorootparentY&#x27;know it&#x27;s weird but it&#x27;s never bothered me too much that python type hints don&#x27;t do anything at runtime. It&#x27;s enough to just know what someone, at some point, intended. (And PyCharm is pretty good about pointing out when they&#x27;re wrong, anyway). I guess when it comes down to it, given we&#x27;re not statically typing, I still get an awful lot of mileage out of just knowing when my assumptions about the code conflict with someone else&#x27;s assumptions about the code (even if that other person is subtly wrong, like anystr vs str or something).Sorbet has a runtime time-checking mode I think, too, so that&#x27;s actually a point in favor to ruby for you (though again with the drawbacks I mentioned of being a gem and imo being a little clunky syntax-wise). reply Spivak 5 hours agorootparentprev> Ruby have a subpar gradual typing storyWhether you agree with it or not Ruby&#x27;s (the language not the developers) resistance to static typing is just how Ruby wants to be written.

I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years now, although always in a &#x27;supporting&#x27; role--like at most maybe 5-10% of the code I write, and I definitely don&#x27;t read or write it every day.I&#x27;ve also never written anything particularly large in it. Like around a few thousand LOC, tops, for any one tool. And at that point, I often find myself writing a lot of things like assert { foo.is_a?(Foo) } to check parameter types, because beyond a certain size I just can&#x27;t keep all the details in my head, and I don&#x27;t want to rely only on comments.Guess I&#x27;m saying that even though I really love it for small things, I&#x27;m also skeptical of its ability to scale. reply soulbadguy 11 hours agoparentprevI agree that pipeline functional stream processing are in many case simpler and clear than weird nested loops with early exit conditions. However, besides maybe the needs for lambda expressions, this is mainly a function of good API design as opposed to something code to the language. In particular here i don&#x27;t think the niceness of this approach is related to anything core to ruby. C# with link, F# with computational expression (and haskel monadic structures) and as you mentioned java stream do the same thing and even a bit better in my opinion reply atomicnumber3 7 hours agorootparentRuby&#x27;s blocks as a way to express a HOF is pretty accessible, and I like that I can switch from \"arr.map{|o| ... }\" to \"arr do |o| ... multiple lines ... end\" seamlessly, to be terse when I want to be but then be verbose when I need to be. But that&#x27;s not exclusive to Ruby, Java&#x27;s lambda syntax behaves similarly.More generally, and more to your point, I think extensive use of blocks&#x2F;HOFs lends to the \"spirit\" of Ruby being a lot more functional-style than python, which iirc got lambda support late and they&#x27;re kind of ugly (I mean, you literally type lambda! almost as bad as go!). reply neonsunset 11 hours agoparentprevYou can do this in C#, F#, Rust and many other languages too with 10x better performance (in Rust in particular those usually get completely optimized away). reply vinc 1 hour agoprevI started with PHP many years ago for my side projects while at the university, then I switched to Python, but when I graduated there were only PHP jobs available so I took one because I had to.

While the syntax looks nice at a first sight, lack of type information and meta-programming can make working with this language tough. And there are other factors to pick a programming language, runtime performance for example.

They usuallt can&#x27;t be bothered to pick up more interesting tools on the side.Ontop of that there is fluctuation and risk-avoidance, so using anything that is not absolutely mainstream is seen risky, because replacements might be a bit harder to get. Combine that with the usual mediocre preexisting employee base, and its obvious why by default the dumbest&#x2F;broadest thing is everywhere in use, even though most people involved in the decisions aren&#x27;t idiots.There are roughly 2 types of places where you can encounter Elixir or other exotic tech:1.

There&#x27;s some technical nuance but that&#x27;s the spirit of it.In Ruby you can call methods without needing to place parentheses.So this roughly translates to the JavaScript code:RSpec.describe(Ticket, () => { context(&#x27;when...&#x27;, () => { ... });});This specific code describes a test that uses the RSpec testing framework. In RSpec, \"context\" and \"it\" are just functions that you call to describe chunks of tests and individual tests respectively.Some Rubyists would say that the combination of these syntax rules (do-end and optional parentheses for function calls) allow you to make \"domain specific languages\" (DSLs as they&#x27;re known in the community) without needing to write your own parser.I think it&#x27;s pretty plain to see the impact in expressiveness if you look at the equivalent Python unittest suite. The Python equivalent would have classes that inherit unittest.TestCase and methods named like test_when_ticket_is_closed.In Python land, classes and method declarations are repurposed because the syntax is what it is.

And I always peek under the hood for the implementation nuances - documentation is always incomplete, so frameworks&#x27; and libraries&#x27; source code is my go-to documentation.In other languages, imports are explicit and are local to file (and people outside of ML and quick-and-dirty one-off scripting tend to recommend breaking one&#x27;s fingers for a heresy of `from foo import *` - with some obvious exceptions, of course), so I always can see where exactly stuff comes from.In Ruby world there&#x27;s this weird love for autoloaders, or some sort helper.rb with tons of require&#x2F;include directives and so on, so very rarely I see a Ruby code that links stuff explicitly. Paired with extreme commonality of metaprogramming, reopening classes to extend them, all paired with the dynamic nature of the language, this kind of irks me as ideologically \"wrong\" (as in \"not to my liking\").Surely, modern IDEs sort of figure out most of the stuff, but I was trying out Ruby quite a long time ago, before language servers and stuff became mainstream and widespread, and still can&#x27;t shake off this impression. reply phaedryx 3 hours agoparentprevRSpec is a domain-specific language for testing written in Ruby.

So every time an enum is needed, there&#x27;s some ugly code that tries to emulate an enum.The guiding theme for Ruby appears to be \"let&#x27;s give people a huge number of ways to write unreadable code\" and it reminds me of JWZ&#x27;s classic rant about PHP, \"a fractal of bad design.\" reply jjgreen 11 hours agoparentI disagree, but thanks for reminding me of that article, just splendid https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eev.ee&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;09&#x2F;php-a-fractal-of-bad-design&#x2F;You couldn&#x27;t really find that many quirks, edge-cases and foot-guns in Ruby, could you? reply chihuahua 11 hours agorootparentFor me, it&#x27;s not so much that there are quirks and edge-cases, but rather that Ruby seems to have a lot of clutter (e.g. \"unless\", punctuation as part of function names, etc) while useful features are missing. reply sensanaty 10 hours agorootparentI always find talking about Ruby fascinating, because it&#x27;s so divisive and for good reason.It&#x27;s one of those things where you either love it or hate it. The first moment I saw a question mark denoting a boolean, I fell in love with Ruby right then and there, but I also perfectly understand why people hate that. Same with stuff like `unless`, whenever I use a different language I&#x27;m always tempted to make a small utility class with all the Ruby niceties like `unless`, and that&#x27;s another thing I can completely understand not liking. reply jjgreen 11 hours agorootparentprevFair enough, a matter of taste.

Features like predicate methods even give up punctuation. [...] This is often why ruby programmers don’t like comments. In most cases, the language makes comments unnecessary.churns my stomach. Good comments are rarely about saying what the code does, they&#x27;re about explaining _why_ the code does what it does. Regardless of how comprehensible ruby code is, it doesn&#x27;t change the need for comments. If I had a nickel for every time I gave a commit a -1 review because it had too few comments or the wrong kind of comments or lacked a \"why\" commit message, I&#x27;d be a rich man. reply kazinator 11 hours agoparentSome code needs \"why\" comments, and other code just needs \"what\" comments (unless it&#x27;s written in a clear, high level language; then not).\"Why\" comments need to go onto code that make some kind of arbitrary decision. Or code which is integrated with processes that are happening elsewhere and has to behave in a way that complements those behaviors. Otherwise the reader would have to read that code together with all those other pieces (or specifications) in order to understand it. Code that is written in a certain way (particularly, an unusual way) for some reason that is not obvious deserves a \"why\" comment. E.g. \"due to a compiler&#x2F;library bug [give specific version info], we cannot just do this: ...\".Code that doesn&#x27;t make arbitrary decisions or integrate with things elsewhere, or make unusual coding decision for reasons, often doesn&#x27;t require \"why\" comments.The author of the article hastened to add:> And when you do need [comments], it’s often when you’re doing a very specific or obscure thing that requires context to understand. It’s clear from the code why you need a comment in that case.It&#x27;s clear from the code why you need a comment, because it&#x27;s a \"why\" comment. reply gorgoiler 11 hours agoparentprevOne of the features I hope we’ll see in the next generation of source control is having better support for annotating lines of source code with commit message information. We have good old “blame” right now but it’s very easy to lose that information across refactors or reformatting (for example if someone introduces an auto formatter to the codebase, or if you move some code but also edit it such that your tool doesn’t understand the old code and the new code were related.)Commit messages are such a good place to explain code and I rarely need the same explanation in a comment. I worry though about the fragility of the connection between (a) the source code and (b) the important commits that explain why the code is there.Perhaps there are some very good UIs out there already that show something a little more intelligent than than the most recent commit from blame?Another idea might be to attach blame-like functionality to the syntax tree so that the explanatory messaging can be tracked at the function level, rather than as lines of source code. Can others here can point me in the right direction for either a more tangible description of this feature, or an existing research? reply tcoff91 11 hours agorootparentThere is a git-blame-ignore-revs that you can configure to keep your git blames more useful. reply dbrueck 11 hours agoparentprevYes! Well-written code can be a joy to read, but it represents a subset of the total amount of useful information about what&#x27;s going on in a program or system. Obviously code can be overly and unhelpfully commented, but poorly commented code is usually a very strong indicator of a mediocre programmer.Why does this function exist? Why was it implemented this way and not that way? Sometimes these are really important bits of info. Here&#x27;s where this approach breaks down. Here&#x27;s a sharp edge that we hope to remove someday. This part here incurs some technical debt but this is why we did it.In order to really maintain a codebase (meaning: safely fix bugs and add new features), you need to have an understanding that at least approaches that of the person who wrote the code originally, and good comments (e.g. level of intent comments) can help you do that. This is true even for your own code that you&#x27;re returning to after some amount of time. reply krupan 11 hours agoparentprevOccasionally it&#x27;s necessary to write code that would make people ask, \"why?!?\" and comments definitely help there, but I feel like that&#x27;s generally rare, especially when you use good variable&#x2F;function names, keep functions small, keep nesting to a minimum, and follow all the other good programming practices. If you are writing&#x2F;reading code and thinking it needs comments, maybe think a little harder about how the code itself could be made more clear.Comments are not checked by compilers, linters, code formatters, unit tests, integration tests, or any other automated tools for correctness, consistency, and good formatting. They rot quickly. reply tines 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not about the clarity of the code though. It&#x27;s about things that are uncheckable by compilers, linters, etc. That is to say, when I&#x27;m reading code I may perfectly comprehend what the code does. But knowing what it does doesn&#x27;t help me understand why it does that thing, how it fits into the overall design, and things of that nature.For example, if code is operating on a list, and then it sorts that list and passes it along to some other code, I can see perfectly that the list will be sorted. But that doesn&#x27;t tell me _why_ it needed to be sorted in the first place. Often that is not knowable except by reviewing things outside the scope of the code in question, or outside any code at all. A comment is essential in that context. reply thih9 11 hours agoparentprevThe example was: ‘if @subscription.supports_feature?(:feature_a)’.In a different language you might deal with more boilerplate (getting some data access object for feature status, passing the db connection, extracting the subscription id, etc), or less clear naming schemes (importing namespaces, aliasing them for convenience, your subscription might come from some one letter temp variable), or something else. At this point the “why” comment might be not that different from the actual ruby code.Note that we only see one line of ruby code; the parent method name, or the if body would have more context. reply cloverich 10 hours agorootparentI honestly found that particular example puzzling. I&#x27;ve written code in at least three other languages that would look nearly identical to it. Unless they were referring to the `?`, or perhaps the lack of a trailing `:` &#x2F; `{` which seems very superficial to me. Maybe the `@` instead of a `self`? Genuinely unsure. reply chihuahua 11 hours agoparentprevYes, this part of the article seems like nonsense to me. If it didn&#x27;t have a question mark, we would need a comment? But because the predicate name contains a question mark, that&#x27;s the only reason why we don&#x27;t need a comment? That&#x27;s nonsense.This only makes sense if we&#x27;re in the school of thought that writesi = i + 1 &#x2F;&#x2F; increment i by one reply woodruffw 11 hours agorootparentThis is an uncharitable reading; I don&#x27;t think the author is literally saying that predicate-style methods are a perfect replacement for comments.The more charitable interpretation is that they&#x27;re pointing out the developer ergonomics of things like predicate methods remove the need for comments that might otherwise be reasonable to insert. Whether or not that is true is subject to reasonable debate, but it&#x27;s definitely a more nuanced opinion than \"Ruby&#x27;s predicate idiom means I don&#x27;t have to document my obvious code.\" reply stouset 11 hours agoparentprevI love Ruby and this is spot-on. Comments in any language should explain why and not what. reply nextos 11 hours agorootparentSure, not justifying code without comments. But keep in mind Ruby is a bit like Lisp, where there is a strong tradition of building DSLs.Hence, lots of Ruby code is a sequence of trivial declarative blocks that look like natural language.In these parts of the code, comments are redundant. I think that is the OP&#x27;s point. Other parts definitely need them. reply krupan 11 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;steve-yegge.blogspot.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;02&#x2F;portrait-of-n00b.ht... reply fny 11 hours agoparentprevAlso, literate programming is a feature of any language. Sure Ruby has punctuation, but is there enough of a difference between `Array#empty?` vs `Array#isEmpty` to break a absolutely not.I say this as someone who wrote Ruby for 6 years and loves the language for its other features (e.g. everything is an object, functional programming, DSL-capabilities) reply pmgei48t 11 hours agoparentprevout of curiosity how many ruby codebases have you worked on? reply stickfigure 11 hours agorootparentWhy do you ask that? I worked in Ruby at Pivotal, with lots of people who espouse the \"comments are just lies waiting to happen\" philosophy. I agree with the parent, it&#x27;s wholly misguided. Good comments save many, many hours of rediscovery by people who are new to the code - which includes the original author after walking away for a few years.If I had to guess, the anti-comment attitude comes from consultants who re-implement the same CRUD webapp on Rails over and over.

I&#x27;ve never encountered code I couldn&#x27;t understand just from reading the code. It really just isn&#x27;t done in the ruby world. And good - comments are just noise in any language. You need to read the code because comments are wrong often enough (and 1% of the time is more than often enough) you can never trust them.Consider the overhead of a comment - first you need to read the comment because they are always above the code so that&#x27;s what your brain will do. This will prejudice your reading of the code.Then you need to read the code while trying to block the comment prejudice out of your mind.Then you need to sort of mentally diff the comment and the code, and if the comment is wrong (spoiler...) decide if you are going to delete the comment (the best choice, unless you get a code reviewer who likes comments) or fix the comment (the worst choice, a waste of time, but maybe the only way to get it through code review).Now consider code without a comment: you just read the code. reply tines 42 minutes agorootparentYou&#x27;re still stuck in the mindset that the comment is about what the code is doing. Good comments are orthogonal to the code they&#x27;re attached to. reply t-writescode 11 hours agorootparentprev [–] Sometimes you just need comments. I’ve written graphing algorithms that traverse databases in Ruby. I named functions well, too; but the actions I was doing were so weird without sufficient context that when someone might need to change it, 6 months or a year from now, they would have absolutely no idea why I was doing. And no amount of clean code patterns, nor code as documentation patterns would have clarified what was being done as much as the multi-paragraph with ascii art comment I wrote above the function.Sometimes you just need comments. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

If we want people to make nice things for us, we have to pay for their rent and grocery bills and raw materials. If you are spending less than $1 per hour on your entertainment (podcasts, videos, articles, games, books, etc.), consider finding ways to support creators and the infrastructure that supports them. cheap ≠ sleek I want [the Mac] to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it. - Steve Jobs (via Walter Isaacson) Unfortunately, the HTML source for Apple.com is not so \"beautiful on the inside\", but Apple engineers shouldn't be faulted for ugly HTML. Their only option was to wrap a sleek skin around shoddy materials. HTML/CSS should evoke feelings of sculpting with digital concrete, but it feels more like building bridges with uncooked pasta. The whole digital design landscape is begging for simple markup languages that can participate in honest architecture. [I hope to finish one such language in 2024-2025! Email me if you'd like to help.] Until we adopt simple and stable building materials, all websites will continue to look the same. Software has become too complicated to stay honest. Corporations can't expose their brick-and-wood architecture because it's actually Megablocks and sawdust underneath all that paint. Wirth's Law threatens to make things even worse. As software rots, multinationals may become the only players capable of making websites. But people like Bartosz Ciechanowski are forging paths to elegant futures. The source code for his mechanical watch demo is proof that honest software is viable. Each guide is erected as a giant wall of WebGL. It's beautiful, but definitely not sleek. The World Wide Web needn't be all 3D WebGL wizardry. The websites of Patrick Colison, Edward Tufte, and Phil Gyford are thriving examples of cozy HTML cabins. The humans are still out there. We can speak sincerely with honest tools and materials. We can stay slippy and celebrate our warts and imperfections together. A wobbly wooden chair built by a friend beats any designer chair. We need more wobbly websites. cheap ≠ creep The central land of the United States is flat, fertile, and windy. Tumbleweed is non-native to the US, yet somehow perfectly suited. Although destructive, it's so ubiquitous that it's become a symbol for the Wild West itself. Likewise, the World Wide Web connects (1) large populations of (2) dissimilar people (3) at an impersonal distance (4) fueled by ad revenue. Anger is uniquely good at spreading across the web. The bicycle of the mind have become the de-facto vehicle of frustration. Large parasocial platforms transformed the internet into a hostile and impersonal place. They feed our FOMO to keep us clicking. They exaggerate our differences for \"engagement\". They create engines for stardom to keep us creeping. They bait us into nutritionless and sensationalist content. Humanity cannot subsist on hype alone. Small and sincere communication quietly thrives. It's easy to find and even easier to make yourself: Write on the internet. Find or create a third place. Pick up the phone. Join niche interest groups. Live, don't lurk. Embrace candid culture. Put people you care about on the calendar. Don't play near black holes. Meet people at farmers markets. Learn to communicate. Make wobbly things. Subscribe to local events calendars. Learn to win friends. Learn to feel. Email strangers. And so on. The peak of Pokémon Go showed us what the future of the internet could look like. With the right technology, we might be able to synthesize serendipity. We could hybridize the best parts of the frustrating thing and the peaceful thing. [I've been casually designing an AR game called \"Peace & Progress II\" since 2012. Email me if you'd like to help build it!] cheap ≠ deep Sturgeon's Law states that \"90% of everything is crap\". The non-crap 10% of the World Wide Web may be unreachable. The deep web (not to be confused with the dark web) is hard to find because it's hard to find. Computers are really good at finding and storing things, so why is much of the internet broken and/or missing? Spam: Corporations and computers manufacture crap at scale, then exploit (and often pay) Google to overwhelm independent search results. Our public library shelves are flooded with junk mail and coupons. Consider supporting alternative search engines like DDG and Kagi. Javascript: Modern websites are built with more JS (dynamic) than HTML (static), and dynamic content is difficult for computers to read. Imagine ordering The Hobbit and unexpectedly receiving a N64 cartridge with an e-book on it. A book is simple and unchanging. A N64 cartridge requires (1) a working N64, (2) a compatible television, (3) knowledge of how to use/repair the equipment, (4) knowledge of how to use the cartridge, and (5) time/energy to load the cartridge and navigate menus. Hodgepodge cartridges do not scale. To keep HTML competitive with JS, we need better tooling. Some HTML resources are listed on the side of this webpage. To supplant JS, the HTML development experience must become 10x easier/faster/cheaper/etc than the current JS experience. Images: HTML is more sustainable than JS, but HTML remains hostile to beginners. Without an easy markup language, people use Powerpoint/Photoshop to share documents. It's hard for computers to decipher/archive images, and it only becomes harder as fewer photocopies-of-photocopies survive. We need something powerful like HTML/CSS, yet simple like Markdown. Accessibility: HTML is generally unkind to people of limited hearing, vision, etc. By default, stuff on the cheap web should work flexibly with many interfaces. Everybody benefits from curb cuts. Payments: Browsers could have implemented digital wallets to manage subscriptions and one-click payments, but consumers had to wait for Amazon and Apple to launch proprietary solutions to public platform problems. Payments were difficult, so nobody paid for things. Advertising became the default way to sustainably make money; piracy became the default way to guard one's attention/privacy. To escape from this advertising hellscape, we must make online payments better for developers and consumers, especially for digital goods. [I made WishWell to make donations easier, but charitable giving is no panacea.] Arbitrary Addresses: The modern internet works much like Amazon's delivery network. Amazon can deliver stuff in its warehouses quickly, but one must wait longer to get products directly from suppliers. But digital goods needn't come from a supplier nor the closest distribution center. All internet data can be sent and received faster by copying data from neighbors! Cryptographers invented magic to do exactly this, but it's not being used at all layers of our digital infrastructure. To get mainstream adoption at the www.* level, we need more browser support and killer apps (an imgur alternative seems like a good candidate). Platforms: Nobody owns email or podcasts (RSS), and everybody benefits tremendously from that freedom and flexibility. Corporations like Slack, Twitter, Visa, Zoom, Google, Amazon, Instagram, Unity, YouTube, and GoDaddy retain control over infrastructure that needn't be controlled at all. To escape enshittification cycles, we need open protocols and designers to make nice interfaces for those protocols. Federated services like Mastadon are promising. [Email me if you'd like to help me launch an open YouTube alternative!] Ad-Hoc Archival: If the internet were built on something like BitTorrent, archiving and indexing everything would be trivial and automatic. Instead, archive.org remains perpetually underfunded in its futile battle against bit rot. Donate to archive.org until we build archivable digital infrastructure. cheap ≠ dark NFTs were probably always a bad idea, yet much of the cryptocurrency community espouses admirable aims. Kudos to the crypto folks -- they are actually trying to fix/replace the world's crumbling central infrastructure. The maintainers of the global financial system have repeatedly failed us. All the games seem rigged and global inequality seems inescapable. Governments and corporations continue to trample our privacy. Banks are slow; credit card fees feel like theft. And so on. But cryptocurrency zealots also try to set our oil reserves ablaze so that they can hoard Dogecoin in virtual caves. It remains unclear what role blockchains will play in a sustainable technological future, but surely we needn't squander so much energy to obtain the convenience we desire and the privacy we deserve. And if we receive privacy, let's use it responsibly -- let's leave all the shitcoin scams and ransomware and toxic stuff behind. cheap = cheap Cheap to maintain: Most webpages should work indefinitely without falling over. Cheap to leave: Opting-out of the web should be painless. Cheap to access: Most websites should be compatible with screenreaders, etc. Cheap to participate: Interacting with the web should be possible on a Wii. Cheap to explore: Exploring the web should be pleasant on 1W of power. Cheap to contribute: Making/hosting websites should be easier than scrapbooking.",

Styling is where the problem it claims to criticize begins; if you want a truly accessible hypertext book, then you don&#x27;t need styling, the user should be in charge of this, and the default theme would be whatever easily readable font, black on white, headings 36pt bold, paragraphs 14pt regular, every elements as blocks. Epub, in usage, is actually a cool format and I almost prefer this type of \"browsing\" experience than what websites proposes.Or maybe OP wants higher level CSS and HTML, and this is a problem because this leads to the invention of a new language with yet another complex ontology that claims to be \"simpler than its lower level counterpart\" but is not. Of course you could create some markdown with basic styling options, but I am pretty sure learning basic html and css is not that more complex than learning that specific markdown and how to operate it to finally get a website served on a specific server.Web and styling became complex exactly when occurred the encounter between what was styling on the web in the 2000s, the emergence of the nowadays variety of devices that are able to browse it and the actual way people interacted with smartphones.Today our browsers are almost OSes and it&#x27;s almost like the complexity of what you can share with them is superior than the complexity of you could create on a 1990 pc natively. I mean, you can run godot engine on your browser : you can develop prototypes of projects with your friends just for fun, create your own private platform for communicating with people you like.I notice a lot of hate toward JS, but honestly when I first stumbled upon it I felt like a dream came true; it gives you the power to create experiences and share them almost effortlessly, and the fact that bigTechs decided to make boring websites on crazy over-engineered frameworks doesn&#x27;t change anything to this. reply marssaxman 16 hours agoparent> it gives you the power to create experiences and share them almost effortlesslyThat&#x27;s exactly where the hate comes from: I don&#x27;t want you, the web designer, to have the power to create experiences, because you (collectively) use that power to force experiences on me that I don&#x27;t want to have. reply darepublic 14 hours agorootparentHow is that different from native apps.

This topic is really important and frankly there&#x27;s so much to it I hope that hearing others I can learn more.When I read some of the thread above what I am hearing is: \"I don&#x27;t want people to be able to run programs on my computer without asking explicitly\". Which is exactly what the modern web and modern web browsers enable.If you learned computing in the 90&#x27;s you were very much told not to install things you do not trust. Everyone remembers downloading some game from the internet and suddenly their OS was trashed via malware or non subtle virus. The modern web is essentially a giant way to circumvent that. Sure only your browser can get shitted up but its the same browser you do your finance in and has access to your GPU.Certainly it enables easy sharing of programs but so does something like java. Most OS&#x27;s still recognize a .jar file as an executable and ask you about it before you can run. They never do that before javascript starts processing in your browser.There are several other issues here such as: - Many essential processes such as banking, medical records and education all rely upon the modern web paradigm at this point. One cannot simply access them on an e-reader or using a browser with javascript disabled. Are you saying you think that someone should be left uneducated or lack medicine if they don&#x27;t like running an unsecured browser? Should those with privacy concerns just incur the cost of having one \"safe\" device and one they do their \"interacting with the web\" one? - The modern web sandbox includes very high access to sensitive things. Many people&#x27;s file systems are from a cloud platform all of which malware in the browser can access for example. - The modern web can be highly performant but generally its not and requires ever increasing hardware cost simply to do things like read a book. reply Almondsetat 11 hours agorootparentIn real life you have even less freedom.

The &#x27;do you trust this&#x27; model of security doesn&#x27;t work well in practice once you can download programs from the internet - there&#x27;s too much stuff you need to or want to trust to get on with things, and even if it&#x27;s not actively malicious, it may be vulnerable.Because Javascript can run in the browser without the assumption that you completely trust it, browser developers have put a load of work into restricting what it can do, even within the browser. Of course, sometimes there are holes in the sandbox - nothing is perfect - but I think it&#x27;s vastly better than giving any program you decide to run complete access to your computer.(Better for the majority, that is. If you&#x27;re truly paranoid and have enough time, explicitly deciding what to trust can be better.

For example, when you see an asterisk, you have to decide whether it denotes italics, bold or a bulleted list, which might not be trivial.Generating correct Markdown from a different is also much harder. In HTML, you just need to escape all your less-than signs, ampersands and quotes. In Markdown, you need to check whether your content is going to trigger various edge cases and deal with them accordingly. reply jauntywundrkind 10 hours agoparentprevThis used to be something one could sketch up in a couple hours on the web, with registerContentHandler.Removed in 2018.

Businesses don&#x27;t want to spend money on anything they don&#x27;t have to, and people aren&#x27;t much different. The argument for learning to write even basic HTML only to upload it even to something like Amazon S3 (free) and direct a web address to it (not free) or spend money on hosting to not have to learn how to deposit files into an S3 bucket is a LOT of time to spend to accomplish this task. Instead, you can outsource all of that time, effort, and labor to Facebook who already built a website. And yeah, it sucks ass and it&#x27;s full of undesirable people, but it&#x27;s free and it accomplishes the same goal.Google, meanwhile, sees that everyone is setting up Facebook profiles instead of websites because it&#x27;s easier, and now businesses websites are sometimes quite out of date compared to their Facebook pages so they begin prioritizing results from network sites over regular pages. And now people can follow their favorite businesses on Facebook and be at least somewhat assured they&#x27;ll always know if, for example, they have to close up one day unexpectedly and won&#x27;t be doing business again until tomorrow.This is not meant to be an argument against the cheap web, mind: I&#x27;m just saying that people trend towards what is the lowest-cost option (by money, time, effort, or any combination) and use it because it works and gets the job done. I still keep a website, because I value my independence and have no interest in having my thoughts dumbed down to suit the preferences of corporate America. But the vast majority of people do not care about that (until they get smacked with a ban-hammer anyway) and will just stick to the easy option.Also, I would state: there is no reason we couldn&#x27;t have a social media site that functions as a public utility instead of a for-profit corporation.

I can&#x27;t really endorse most of the web \"innovations\" that have happened since the Dot Bomb. There was a time before FAANG when people with low technical knowhow could build something on the web and start earning enough residual income to pay their rent. Like the eBay store on The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Or the Mutiny BBS before that in Halt and Catch Fire. I did it with my business partner via shareware in the early 2000s. Even though the writing was on the wall even then that this was all going corporate.I think that things started going wrong when the anti-intellectual&#x2F;anti-education movement gained prominence after 9&#x2F;11 in the push towards privatization and outsourcing. Before that, we could rely on publicly-funded academia to deliver techniques designed from first principles to decrease our workload.But since then, we seem to get leftovers like endless Javascript build pipelines handed down to us from the private sector. It&#x27;s almost like best practices today are designed to mire a startup in endless red tape. While multinational corporations just throw money at it to create a billion dollar pair of scissors that we can&#x27;t afford.The way to undo all of that is to do the opposite. Realize that our freedom and prosperity start with our tools and techniques. Find the underemployed exhausted people and give them any resources at all to design better stuff and then leave them alone. Start funding bottom-up and middle-out policies instead of waiting around for trickle-down economics to toss us more scraps. Don&#x27;t let any one person become a cult of personality preaching how things should be. And stop worshipping capital and focus on getting actual resources (the most important being time) to the middle class through automation and recycling to avoid war. This stuff is so obvious and evident in history that the main challenge is to unlearn one&#x27;s own programming to be able to perceive alternatives.Edit: we&#x27;re talking about HTML not macroeconomic policy.

You are limited in the ability to CSS style datalist options so a lot of developers are still going to feel pressure in 2023 from \"pixel perfect\" UX designers to continue to reimplement that wheel, but the version of the JS that just updates a datalist after a fetch is likely much simpler than building a full \"autocomplete control\". reply its-summertime 3 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;amp.dev&#x2F; is that.

Who cares if websites look the same? Wait, let me put that another way: we should care whether websites look the same in the sense that more of them should look similar to one another than they do today—namely, they should look how you and I (the readers) wish for them to look for our own comfort and convenience—which means fewer dark starry sky backgrounds, fewer text drop shadows and typefaces reminiscent of comic book speech bubbles, and fewer distracting marquees. Way less kitsch, not more.HN, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, SMS, etc. all have a limited range of expression through form. Somehow we get by. Completely dissimilar books look a lot more \"the same\" than websites do, and that&#x27;s not a bad thing. You never see book authors complaining about control over the printed page the way that you see self-styled web designers insisting on their manifest destiny over the user&#x27;s viewport for the purposes of self-expression.

That still leaves room for massive variance and personal control. Even just linktree levels of customization have a lot more spice than facebook.

    "originBody": "PostgREST stable Tutorials Tutorial 0 - Get it Running Tutorial 1 - The Golden Key References Authentication API Transactions Connection Pool Schema Cache Errors Configuration Admin Explanations Database Authorization Installation Nginx Schema Isolation How-to guides SQL User Management SQL User Management using postgres’ users and passwords Working with PostgreSQL data types Create a SOAP endpoint Providing HTML Content Using Htmx Preparatory Configuration Creating an HTML Response Listing and Creating To-Dos Editing and Deleting To-Dos Providing images forIntegrations Greenplum Heroku External JWT Generation pg-safeupdate systemd Ecosystem Community Tutorials Templates Example Apps DevOps External Notification Extensions Client-Side Libraries PostgREST Providing HTML Content Using Htmx Edit on GitHub Providing HTML Content Using Htmx author Laurence Isla This how-to shows a way to return HTML content and use the htmx library to handle the AJAX requests. Htmx expects an HTML response and uses it to replace an element inside the DOM (see the htmx introduction in the docs). Preparatory Configuration We will make a to-do app based on the Tutorial 0 - Get it Running, so make sure to complete it before continuing. To simplify things, we won’t be using authentication, so grant all permissions on the todos table to the web_anon user. grant all on api.todos to web_anon; grant usage, select on sequence api.todos_id_seq to web_anon; Next, add the text/html as a Media Type Handlers. With this, PostgREST can identify the request made by your web browser (with the Accept: text/html header) and return a raw HTML document file. create domain \"text/html\" as text; Creating an HTML Response Let’s create a function that returns a basic HTML file, using Tailwind CSS for styling. create or replace function api.index() returns \"text/html\" as $$ select $html$PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List $html$; $$ language sql; The web browser will open the web page at http://localhost:3000/rpc/index. Listing and Creating To-Dos Now, let’s show a list of the to-dos already inserted in the database. create or replace function api.html_todo(api.todos) returns text as $$ select format($html$ %3$s $html$, $1.id, case when $1.done then 'line-through text-gray-400' else '' end, $1.task ); $$ language sql stable; create or replace function api.html_all_todos() returns text as $$ select coalesce( '' || string_agg(api.html_todo(t), '' order by t.id) || '', 'There is nothing else to do.' ) from api.todos t; $$ language sql; These two functions are used to build the to-do list template. We won’t use them as PostgREST endpoints. The api.html_todo function uses the table api.todos as a parameter and formats each item into a list element . The PostgreSQL format is useful to that end. It replaces the values according to the position in the template, e.g. %1$s will be replaced with the value of $1.id (the first parameter). The api.html_all_todos function returns thewrapper for all the list elements. It uses string_arg to concatenate all the to-dos in a single text value. It also returns an alternative message, instead of a list, when the api.todos table is empty. Next, let’s add an endpoint to register a to-do in the database and modify the /rpc/index page accordingly. create or replace function api.add_todo(_task text) returns \"text/html\" as $$ insert into api.todos(task) values (_task); select api.html_all_todos(); $$ language sql; create or replace function api.index() returns \"text/html\" as $$ select $html$PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List $html$ || api.html_all_todos() || $html$$html$; $$ language sql; The /rpc/add_todo endpoint allows us to add a new to-do using the _task parameter and returns an html with all the to-dos in the database. The /rpc/index now adds the hx-headers='{\"Accept\": \"text/html\"}' tag to the . This will make sure that all htmx elements inside the body send this header, otherwise PostgREST won’t recognize it as HTML. There is also aelement that uses the htmx library. Let’s break it down: hx-post=\"/rpc/add_todo\": sends an AJAX POST request to the /rpc/add_todo endpoint, with the value of the _task from theelement. hx-target=\"#todo-list-area\": the HTML content returned from the request will go inside(which is the list of to-dos). hx-trigger=\"submit\": htmx will do this request when submitting the form (by pressing enter while inside the ). hx-on=\"htmx:afterRequest: this.reset()\">: this is a Javascript command that clears the form after the request is done. With this, the http://localhost:3000/rpc/index page lists all the todos and adds new ones by submitting tasks in the input element. Don’t forget to refresh the schema cache. Editing and Deleting To-Dos Now, let’s modify api.html_todo and make it more functional. create or replace function api.html_todo(api.todos) returns text as $$ select format($html$%3$s $html$, $1.id, case when $1.done then 'line-through text-gray-400' else '' end, $1.task, (not $1.done)::text ); $$ language sql stable; Let’s deconstruct the new htmx features added: Theelement is configured as follows: hx-post=\"/rpc/change_todo_state\": does an AJAX POST request to that endpoint. It will toggle the done state of the to-do. hx-vals='{\"_id\": %1$s, \"_done\": %4$s}': adds the parameters to the request. This is an alternative to using hidden inputs inside the . hx-trigger=\"click\": htmx does the request after clicking on the element. For the first : hx-get=\"/rpc/html_editable_task\": it does an AJAX GET request to that endpoint. It returns an HTML with an input that will allow us to edit the task. hx-target=\"#todo-edit-area\": the returned HTML will replace the element with this id. In this case, this replaces an individual task, not the whole list. hx-vals='{\"id\": \"eq.%1$s\"}': adds the query parameters to the GET request. Note that this needs the eq. operator because it represents a table column not a function parameter. For the second : hx-post=\"/rpc/delete_todo\": this post request will delete the corresponding to-do. Clicking on the first button will enable the task editing. That’s why we create the api.html_editable_task function as an endpoint: create or replace function api.html_editable_task(_id int) returns \"text/html\" as $$ select format ($html$$html$, id, task ) from api.todos where id = _id; $$ language sql; In this example, this will return an input field that allows us to edit the corresponding to-do task. Finally, let’s add the endpoints that will modify and delete the to-dos in the database. create or replace function api.change_todo_state(_id int, _done boolean) returns \"text/html\" as $$ update api.todos set done = _done where id = _id; select api.html_all_todos(); $$ language sql; create or replace function api.change_todo_task(_id int, _task text) returns \"text/html\" as $$ update api.todos set task = _task where id = _id; select api.html_all_todos(); $$ language sql; create or replace function api.delete_todo(_id int) returns \"text/html\" as $$ delete from api.todos where id = _id; select api.html_all_todos(); $$ language sql; All of those functions return an HTML list of to-dos that will replace the outdated one: The api.change_todo_state function updates the done column using the _id and the _done values from the request. The api.delete_todo function deletes a to-do using the _id value from the request. The api.change_todo_task function modifies the task column using the _id and the _task value from the request. After refreshing the schema cache, the page at http://localhost:3000/rpc/index will allow us to edit, delete and complete any to-do. With that, we completed the to-do list functionality.

But, in one pretty straightforward sense at least, he&#x27;s not a tall basketball player.Edit: I thought of a better analogy. Compare Lodash and uBlock. Lodash is clearly a \"JavaScript library\", uBlock is clearly not. Why not, given that like Lodash it&#x27;s just so much JavaScript? Because uBlocks&#x27; intended users don&#x27;t use it as a JavaScript library. They use it to modify the default behavior of the chrome browser to something more to their liking, not as a tool for more easily expressing themselves when writing JavaScript code. I&#x27;d argue the relation of htmx to HTML is very much like that of a Chrome&#x2F;VSCode extension to Chrome&#x2F;VSCode: its purpose is to change the built-in behavior of some tool (HTML) used by the user, whereas a library at bottom serves an expressive purpose. reply yawaramin 5 hours agorootparentprevIt would be harder to believe something running dynamically in the browser is not written in JavaScript. reply quickthrower2 5 hours agorootparentprevThe other option being… webassembly? convince WHATWG members to change their browsers? reply djbusby 10 hours agorootparentprevIt is a JavaScript library reply smegsicle 11 hours agoparentprevcrud without the cruft reply WhatsName 12 hours agoprevWhile cool as a proof of concept and kudos for execution, this looks like a nightmare to maintain for any non-trivial webapp. reply robertlagrant 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s definitely for websites or light apps only.

You can render the HTML with any templating language that does that for you. reply indigo945 1 hour agorootparentHTMX is not at fault here, the backend is.Of course \"you have to sanitize your inputs somehow\", but this example does that exactly nowhere, i.e. it is exploitable. Having the tutorial omit this problem altogether is dangerous, as not discussing it might create the impression that PostgREST somehow already handles this, or that the toy example given here does not have a glaring security vulnerability. This is particularly problematic because the reason that the docs for many other backend frameworks also don&#x27;t discuss the problem is that they do in fact already handle it (usually via a built-in templating language).Steve acknowledged the problem in a sibling comment, so hopefully the next iteration of the tutorial will address this.

PostgREST has a scary \"allow by default\" permission model which is nearly enough to turn me off of the whole project.To help mitigate this, I&#x27;m evaluating only using PostgREST for reads in the \"api\" schema via access-restricted views, and having all writes go through supabase edge functions. This should simplify the RLS permissions (hopefully).RLS has some pitfalls too, and it&#x27;s the only mechanism you have to secure your data.Serving assets from Postgres seems like a bad idea aside from some simple edge use cases. In general, you want to treat your DB as a precious resource and minimize the amount of work it has to do.Nginx and similar are built and optimized for serving assets. Using your database to do this doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea if your application needs to scale. reply steve-chavez 11 hours agoparent> PostgREST has a scary \"allow by default\" permission model which is nearly enough to turn me off of the whole project.PostgREST follows Postgres&#x27; \"deny by default\", you have to explicitly grant permissions for tables and views to be used. This is noted on the first tutorial[0].Supabase overrides this default via `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES .. GRANT`[1]. This is done for easier onboarding of new users but you can turn this off with `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES .. REVOKE`.PostgREST also encourages you to create a dedicated schema for your api[2].[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;tut0.html#step-4-c...[1]: See an example of this on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supabase.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;api&#x2F;using-custom-schemas.[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;explanations&#x2F;schema_isolatio... reply boomskats 11 hours agorootparent> Supabase overrides this defaultAh, thank you for this clarification.

I can&#x27;t think of what else you could be referring to. If you rely on JWT-based authentication, as any non-trivial and sane application would do, you&#x27;d have access to transaction-scoped impersonated roles. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;references&#x2F;auth.html#overvie...> having all writes go through supabase edge functionsWhy is this necessary, what are you unable to achieve with JWT + RLS&#x2F;RBA? Again, I have to assume you don&#x27;t have auth configured correctly.> RLS has some pitfalls too, and it&#x27;s the only mechanism you have to secure your data.You also have role-based access, and the JWT auth to start with. However I have found RLS to be flexible enough, especially as you can define policies using subqueries into which you can embed UDFs. What are you trying to do that you can&#x27;t do with it?> Serving assets from Postgres seems like a bad idea aside from some simple edge use cases.I instinctively agree in terms of devex, although I&#x27;m reluctant to just dismiss it. I think the performance hit with a database is the data retrieval, not the templating. I can see a possibility of this evolving into something very usable with some packaging of templates, especially once you realise the approach eliminates the need for more services, simplifies auth, and reduces rendering latency. The memory footprint of PostgREST is trivial compared to most middleware you&#x27;d have to add to the mix just to do some SSR. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 9 hours agorootparentSupabase folks seem to agree regarding serving assets since they ship an object store for that kind of stuff in their constellation of apps rather than attempting to instead serve blobs out of the db. Hearkening back to an age long ago of having to deal with stuff like images and pdfs stored in db rows and the annoyances around that, I’m also inclined to agree, but less from the performance angle and more from the usability&#x2F;compatibility angle of being forced to deal with the nuances of BLOB datatypes reply cgio 11 hours agoparentprevUsing views is a good practice anyway as you do not tightly couple your API to your schema. It&#x27;s been a few years since I used Postgrest (and to be fair I had no write scenarios to cover) but I do not remember it limiting what security capabilities you have on Postgres. Needed a bit of a setup, but nothing terrible. If row level security does not cover your use case you are down the path of custom development anyway. My advise, be careful, this is a bottomless pit, with special combinations&#x2F;overlapping rules etc. Go with a rules engine, prolog&#x2F;datalog style would be my path. reply bsdpufferfish 11 hours agoparentprev> you have to create a separate schema (\"api\" or similar) to carefully pick what&#x27;s exposed.Yep, but it&#x27;s a CREATE VIEW instead of writing a route in python or ruby which also will likely hit an ORM...> Serving assets from Postgres seems like a bad idea aside from some simple edge use cases. In general, you want to treat your DB as a precious resource and minimize the amount of work it has to do.The database should still be the source of truth (of generated assets). An easy solution is to configure NGINX to cache those asset requests, or write a script to unpack them to the file system. reply smitpatelx 9 hours agoprevI love POSTGRES. I&#x27;ve been using it since last 6 years and I like how easy it is to get started and there is also ton of support and ecosystem available for PG.Recently, I tried a new product called \"Neurelo\". It provides API for PostgreSql. And I love how easy it is to migrate my existing database on their platform, they have an option called introspection which helps to generate json schema which you can also modify in visual mode. On top I generated some SDKs for TS and it works so much better directly with any Js&#x2F;Ts framework. You can download json spec from auto generated docs and run any generator of your choice if you want more from it. You can also write custom queries (AI assisted) which gives you custom endpoint to hit. They also provide a free data source if you want to check it out. Migrations included. Here is an example I built using HTMX and NEURELO: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;smitpatelx&#x2F;neurelo-go-htmx-examplehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neurelo.com&#x2F;I was so impressed with their work, I recently joined the team Neurelo.

Plus, the channel is all about seeing math in certain ways, so it felt fitting. The name is just a reference to the logo, factoring in a desire for something deliberately weird-sounding that stands out. reply TheIronYuppie 12 hours agoprev3blue1brown is a treasure. reply behnamoh 10 hours agoprevI love learning the intuition behind math concepts, but when it comes to practical things, often you have to deal with unruly and ugly equations in which intuition plays little role. For instance, as much as I enjoyed his Fourier transform videos, when it comes to actually calculating the Fourier transform for arbitrary functions, intuition is outta the window; it goes back to pure calculations again. That’s the part of math that I hated the most-not the beautiful intuitions. reply epgui 9 hours agoparentIf you don’t have a good intuition for and understanding of the concepts, how can you know when it’s appropriate to cut corners &#x2F; use various approximation techniques on messy data? Or how can you combine a bunch of techniques for real world applications without doing something nonsensical?I don’t really understand this critique. reply behnamoh 9 hours agorootparentGood point. I see what you mean and I agree that having an intuitive understanding of math concepts helps us choose the right tool for the job, but as soon as that decision is made, intuition doesn&#x27;t play much role anymore. I really wanted to think that intuition (or even learning about the history of various math concepts) would be useful somehow, but every time I would end up getting lower scores than students who would just memorize the formulae and were able to calculate things quickly. reply epgui 8 hours agorootparentWell, I think I know what your mistake is, because I made the same mistake for a long time before I realized the error of my ways.Intuition and deep understanding is important, and you won&#x27;t go far without it. It&#x27;s arguably the most important thing. But memorization &#x2F; \"knowing\" things is important as well, and if you avoid doing that completely, you&#x27;re just like a two or three legged stool. You need both, for true mastery.I can&#x27;t persuade you of this on my own, but if you ever trust something you saw on the internet without proof, hopefully this is the one thing!

All you’re doing is spreading the time. As in “flattening the curve”.As some might recall the initial lockdown was proposed as a way to flatten the curve and allow the medical system to cope better by having a more gradual influx of patients. Which makes me think everyone promoting the initial lockdown understood its limitations and its objectives.However, for what ever reason “control demolition” of the economy to make Trump lose the election or who knows why it turned into a long term lockdown.I know this is a controversial topic, but it shouldn’t be. This is a clear case that the science of pandemic modeling suggested one path and for political reasons we were pushed to follow a course that caused a lot of damage, some irreversible, to the society.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gxAaO2rsdIs?si=cNkcQ7actTnb5sez reply wodenokoto 6 hours agoparent [–] Yes, basically everywhere lockdown started as a “flattening the curve” and then at some point became “everyone needs to be kept out of harms way until everyone is vaccinated”.That isn’t an American experience it was the same almost everywhere lock down was initiated.So I am not sure it makes sense to blame it on Trump haters. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Fly.io Unveils Fly Kubernetes: A New Approach to Kubernetes Orchestration",
    "originLink": "https://fly.io/blog/fks/",
    "originBody": "Author Name Senyo Simpson Image by Annie Ruygt We’re Fly.io, and if you’ve been following us awhile you probably just did a double-take. We’re building a new public cloud that runs containerized applications with virtual machine isolation on our own hardware around the world. And we’ve been doing it without any K8s. Until now! We’ll own it: we’ve been snarky about Kubernetes. We are, at heart, old-school Unix nerds. We’re still scandalized by systemd. To make matters more complicated, the problems we’re working on have a lot of overlap with K8s, but just enough impedance mismatch that it (or anything that looks like it) is a bad fit for our own platform. But, come on: you never took us too seriously about K8s, right? K8s is hard for us to use, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great fit for what you’re building. We’ve been clear about that all along, right? Sure we have! Well, good news, everybody! If K8s is important for your project, and that’s all that’s been holding you back from trying out Fly.io, we’ve spent the past several months building something for you. Fly.io For Kubernetians Fly.io works by transmogrifying Docker containers into filesystems for lightweight hypervisors, and running them on servers we rack in dozens of regions around the world. You can build something like Fly.io with “standard” orchestration tools like K8s. In fact, that’s what we did to start, too. To keep things simple, we used Nomad, and instead of K8s CNIs, we built our own Rust-based TLS-terminating Anycast proxy (and designed a WireGuard/IPv6-based private network system based on eBPF). But the ideas are the same. The way we look at it, the signature feature of a “standard” orchestrator is the global scheduler: the global eye in the sky that keeps track of vacancies on servers and optimized placement of new workloads. That’s the problem we ran into. We’re running over 200,000 applications, and we’re doing so on every continent except Antarctica. The speed of light (and a globally distributed network of backhoes) has something to say about keeping a perfectly consistent global picture of hundreds of thousands of applications, and it’s not pleasant. The other problem we ran into is that our Nomad scheduler kept trying to outsmart us, and, worse, our customers. It turns out that our users have pretty firm ideas of where they’d like their apps to run. If they ask for São Paulo, they want São Paulo, not Rio. But global schedulers have other priorities, like optimally bin-packing resources, and sometimes GIG looks just as good as GRU to them. To escape the scaling and DX problems we were hitting, we rethought orchestration. Where orchestrators like K8s tend to work through distributed consensus, we keep state local to workers. Each racked server in our fleet is a source of truth about the apps running on it, and provide an API to a market-style “scheduler” that bids on resources in regions. You can read more about here, if you’re interested. We call this system the Fly Machines API. An important detail to grok about how this all works – a reason we haven’t, like, beaten the CAP theorem by doing this – is that Fly Machines API calls can fail. If Nomad or K8s tries to place a workload on some server, only to find out that it’s filled up or thrown a rod, it will go hunt around for some other place to put it, like a good little robot. The Machines API won’t do this. It’ll just fail the request. In fact, it goes out of its way to fail the request quickly, to deliver feedback; if we can’t schedule work in JNB right now, you might want instead to quickly deploy to BOM. Pluggable Orchestration and FKS In a real sense what we’ve done here is extract a chunk of the scheduling problem out of our orchestrator, and handed it off to other components. For most of our users, that component is flyctl, our intrepid CLI. But Fly Machines is an API, and anything can drive it. A lot of our users want quick answers to requests to schedule apps in specific regions, and flyctl does a fine job of that. But it’s totally reasonable to want something that works more like the good little robots inside of K8s. You can build your own orchestrator with our API, but if what you’re looking for is literally Kubernetes, we’ve saved you the trouble. It’s called Fly Kubernetes, or FKS for short. FKS is an implementation of Kubernetes that runs on top of Fly.io. You start it up using flyctl, by running flyctl ext k8s create. Under the hood, FKS is a straightforward combination of two well-known Kubernetes projects: K3s, the lightweight CNCF-certified K8s distro, and Virtual Kubelet. Virtual Kubelet is interesting. In K8s-land, a kubelet is a host agent; it’s the thing that runs on every server in your fleet that knows how to run a K8s Pod. Virtual Kubelet isn’t a host agent; it’s a software component that pretends to be a host, registering itself with K8s as if it was one, but then sneakily proxying the Kubelet API elsewhere. In FKS, “elsewhere” is Fly Machines. All we have to do is satisfy various APIs that virtual kubelet exposes. For example, the API for the lifecycle of a pod: type PodLifecycleHandler interface { CreatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error UpdatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error DeletePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error GetPod(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.Pod, error) GetPodStatus(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.PodStatus, error) GetPods(context.Context) ([]*corev1.Pod, error) } This interface is easy to map to the Fly Machines API. For example: CreatePod -> POST /apps/{app_name}/machines UpdatePod -> POST /apps/{app_name}/machines/{machine_id} K3s, meanwhile, is a stripped-down implementation of all of K8s that fits into a single binary. K3s does a bunch of clever things to be as streamlined as it is, but the most notable of them is kine, an API shim that switches etcd out with databases like SQLite. Because of kine, K3s can manage multiple servers, but also gracefully runs on a single server, without distributed state. So that’s what we do. When you create a cluster, we run K3s and the Virtual Kubelet on a single Fly Machine. We compile a kubeconfig, with which you can talk to your K3s via kubectl. We set the whole thing up to run Pods on individual Fly Machines, so your cluster scales out directly using our platform, but with K8s tooling. One thing we like about this design is how much of the lifting is already done for us by the underlying platform. If you’re a K8s person, take a second to think of all the different components you’re dealing with: etcd, specifically provisioned nodes, the kube-proxy, a CNI binary and configuration and its integration with the host network, containerd, registries. But Fly.io already does most of those things. So this project was mostly chipping away components until we found the bare minumum: CoreDNS, SQLite persistence, and Virtual Kubelet. We ended up with something significantly simpler than K3s, which is saying something. Fly Kubernetes has some advantages over plain flyctl and fly.toml: Your deployment is more declarative than it is with the fly.toml file. You declare the exact state of everything down to replica counts, autoscaling rules, volume definitions, and more. When you deploy with Fly Kubernetes, Kubernetes will automatically make your definitions match the state of the world. Machines go down? Kubernetes will whack them back online. This is a different way to do orchestration and scheduling on Fly.io. It’s not what everyone is going to want. But if you want it, you really want it, and we’re psyched to give it to you: Fly.io’s platform features, with Kubernetes handling configuration and driving your system to its desired state. We’ve kept things simple to start with. There are K8s use cases we’re a strong fit for today, and others we’ll get better at in the near future, as K8s users drive the underlying platform (and particularly our proxy) forward. Interested in getting early access? Email us at sales@fly.io and we’ll hook you up. Not invested in K8s? Nothing has to change for you! You can deploy apps on Fly.io today, in a matter of minutes, without talking to Sales. Deploy an app in minutes.→ What It All Means One obvious thing it means is that you’ve got an investment in Kubernetes tooling, you can keep it while running things on top of Fly.io. So that’s pretty neat. Buy our cereal! But the computer science story is interesting, too. We placed a bet on an idiosyncratic strategy for doing global orchestration. We replaced global consensus, which is how Borg, Kubernetes, and Nomad all work, with a market-based system. That system was faster and, importantly, dumber than the consensus system it replaced. This had costs! Nomad’s global consensus would do truly heroic amounts of work to make sure Fly Apps got scheduled somewhere, anywhere. Like a good capitalist, Fly Machines will tell you in no uncertain terms how much work it’s willing to do for you (“less than a Nomad”). But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with the answers Fly Machines gives by itself. Because Fly Machines is so simple, and tries so hard to be predictable, we hoped you’d be able to build more sophisticated scheduling and orchestration schemes on top of it. And here you go: Kubernetes scheduling, as a plugin to the platform. More to come! We’re itching to see just how many different ways this bet might pay off. Or: we’ll perish in flames! Either way, it’ll be fun to watch.

When using GKS, we had to do a lot of work to get our Node utilization (the percent of resources we had reserve on a VM actually occupied by pods) to be higher than 50%.Curios what happens when you run “kubectl get nodes” - does it lie to you, or call each region one Node? reply btown 14 hours agoparentGKE Autopilot is an attractive option here if you don&#x27;t want to worry about node utilization and provisioning. Effectively you have an on-demand infinitely-sized k8s cluster that scales up and down as you need new pods. Some caveats, but it&#x27;s an incredible onramp if you&#x27;re coming from a Heroku or similar PaaS and don&#x27;t want to worry about the infrastructure side of things: Github Actions building images and deploying a Helm chart to GKE Autopilot is a remarkable friendly yet customizable stack. Google should absolutely promote it more than it does. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;kubernetes-engine&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;aut... reply benpacker 14 hours agorootparentUnfortunately last I checked the compute pricing for GKE autopilot was almost double, so if you can beat 50% utilization, you might as well just keep the under-utilized Node around. reply harpratap 6 hours agorootparentprevGKE Autopilot is pretty much useless, very few cases where it actually turns out cheaper than simply using Cluster Autoscaler + Node autoprovisioning. Not only is the pricing absolutely absurd, they don&#x27;t even allow normal K8s bursting behavior (requests need to be equal to limits) which means you not only end up paying more than regular K8s cluster but now also need to highly overprovision your pods reply benpacker 13 hours agorootparentprevIf this is “free GKE autopilot” (autopilot billed at the same price as regular Fly Machine compute), then that changes the way I think about Fly’s basic compute pricing a lot.I would think they should highlight that a lot more in the product announcement! reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentSay more! What should we highlight more? reply btown 11 hours agorootparentAs someone not familiar with Fly&#x27;s offering (but very interested for the same reasons as the post you&#x27;re replying to!), a couple things come to mind if you&#x27;re looking at convincing people familiar with k8s to move workloads here:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F; doesn&#x27;t show any results when searching kubernetes or k8s or k3s.- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fks&#x2F; is self-admittedly snarky but also doesn&#x27;t provide details about the product itself. It jumps straight into technical details - and while I like the openness about fault tolerance, there&#x27;s no paragraph after the intro about what Fly Kubernetes is.- What exactly does the combination of k3s and virtual-kubelet provide compared to standard k8s? Does it provide secret and confmap storage and namespaces and all those expected things? Can we run things like the Kubernetes dashboard? cert-manager? nginx-ingress?- On that note, what&#x27;s the ingress story in general? Is Fly automatically routing traffic to the k8s cluster based on the ingress declarations? Are there limitations? Where are they documented?- Most people running k8s will have fault-tolerant workloads, but reasonable expectations for pod lifetime and reliability of underlying \"hardware\" are nonetheless important. If I&#x27;m migrating from EKS or GKE and want to run a 24&#x2F;7 background process, can I expect it to keep running on the same Fly Machine for weeks or months until updated? Or are there limits here?

You can check out the virtual-kubelet GitHub repo for more info.Interestingly, there are already multiple providers of virtual-kubelet. For example, Azure AKS has virtual nodes where pods are Azure Container Instances. There’s even a Nomad provider.> So that’s what we do. When you create a cluster, we run K3s and the Virtual Kubelet on a single Fly Machine.So probably a cluster per region. You could theoretically spin up multiple virtual-kubelets though and configure each one as a specific region.> Because of kine, K3s can manage multiple servers, but also gracefully runs on a single server, without distributed state.This would mean the control-plane would be on a single-server without high-availability? Although, I suppose there really isn’t any state stored since they are just proxying requests to the Fly Machine API. But still, if the machine went down your kubectl commands wouldn’t work. reply philsnow 15 hours agorootparentThe diagram on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virtual-kubelet.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture&#x2F; makes me wonder whether it&#x27;s possible to have a k8s cluster where the nodes are all virtual kubelets backed by different cloud providers (and then perhaps schedule loads preferentially with selectors) reply kuhsaft 14 hours agorootparentI think it’s completely possible. Though, you’ll have to manage your own control-plane.Azure AKS and EKS provide virtual-kubelet functionality in some form, but AKS is an a managed control-plane where you can’t add nodes yourself and EKS only allows nodes in the same VPC.Edit: It already is a thing. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;virtual-kubelet&#x2F;tensile-kube reply philsnow 13 hours agorootparenttensile-kube seems to be structured as a \"k8s cluster of k8s clusters\", with an upper kubemaster farming out resources to lower kubemasters (through virtual-node). I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any particular reason to have that separation; possibly the lower kubemasters could be removed and you could just run a bunch of virtual-kubelets. reply kuhsaft 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the biggest hurdle would be networking between the pods since they will be running on different cloud providers. reply philsnow 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen some people using wireguard for intra-cluster networking so that all their nodes can run pretty much anywhere. reply harpratap 5 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t the network cost be absurd in such case?

GKE has this option now on setup, though I think anyone who&#x27;s had to do this stuff knows that just using a cluster-autoscaler is never enough.

Though, the virtual-kublets can be running on the same machine actually. They just need to be configured to have different node names.The press release states that your k8s API is actually running on a single machine with k3s and a virtual-kubelet. So, I’m not sure if it’s one “cluster” per region, or one “cluster” with multiple virtual-kubelets for regions.Either way, your FKS cluster control-plane would sit in a single region. reply Traubenfuchs 14 hours agorootparentprevHow do you forbid running two instances of the same service on one node without anti affinity? reply kuhsaft 14 hours agorootparentTraditionally, each node is its own machine. virtual-kubelet creates a virtual node that is a proxy to some other pod infrastructure. In the case with FKS, each pod in the virtual node is a machine (a node in the traditional sense), so it’s equivalent of having an anti-affinity on all pods with an infinite node pool. reply arccy 15 hours agoparentprevif it is pod per vm, that would make it like EKS Fargate reply arccy 15 hours agoparentprevis GKS some amalgamation of GKE and EKS reply benpacker 14 hours agorootparentTypo haha - I meant GKE. Fixed now. reply dangoodmanUT 10 hours agoprevThis is really exciting, but there are a few things they will certainly have to work through:*Services:*Kubernetes expects DNS records like {pod}.default.svc.cluster.local. In order to achieve this they will have to have some custom DNS records on the \"pod\" (fly machine) to resolve this with their metadata. Not impossible, but something that has to be take into account.*StatefulSets:*This has 2 major obstacles:The first is dealing with disk. k8s expects that it can move disks to different logical pods when they lose them (e.g. mapping EBS to an EC2 node). The problem here is that fly has a fundamentally different model. It means that it either has to decide not to schedule a pod because it can&#x27;t get the machine that the disk lives on, or not guarantee that the disk is the same. While this does exist as a setting currently, the former is a serious issue.The second major issue is again with DNS. StatefulSets have ordinal pod names (e.g. {ss-name}-{0..n}.default.sv.cluster.local). While this can be achieved with their machine metadata and custom DNS on the machine, it means that it either has to run a local DNS server to \"translate\" DNS records to the fly nomenclature, or have to constantly update local services on machines to tell them about new records. Both will incur some penalty. reply corobo 15 hours agoprevIs this still a limitation for Fly k8s?> A Fly Volume is a slice of an NVMe drive on the physical server your Fly App runs on. It’s tied to that hardware.Does the k8s have any kind of storage provisioning that allows pods with persistent storage (e.g. databases) to just do their thing without me worrying about it or do I still need to handle disks potentially vanishing?I think this is the only hold-up that stops me actually using Fly. I don&#x27;t know what happens if my machine crashes and is brought back on different hardware. Presumably the data is just not there anymore.Is everyone else using an off-site DB like Planetscale? Or just hoping it&#x27;s an issue that never comes up, w&#x2F; backups just in case? Or maybe setting up full-scale DB clusters on Fly so it&#x27;s less of a potential issue? Or &#x27;other&#x27;? reply tptacek 15 hours agoparentNot speaking for the FKS case, but in general for the platform: when you associate an app with a volume, your app is anchored to the hardware the volume is on (people used to use tiny volumes as a way to express hard-locked region affinity when we were still using Nomad). So if your Fly Machine crashes, it&#x27;s going to come back on the same physical as the volume lives on.We back up volumes to off-net block storage, and, under the hood, we can seamlessly migrate a volume to another physical (the way we do it is interesting, and we should write it up, but it&#x27;s still also an important part of our work sample hiring process, which is why we haven&#x27;t). So your app could move from one physical to another; the data would come with it.On the other hand: Fly Volumes are attached storage. They&#x27;re not a SAN system like EBS, they&#x27;re not backed onto a 50-9s storage engine like S3. If a physical server throws a rod, you can lose data. This is why, for instance, if you boot up a Fly Postgres cluster here and ask us to do it with only one instance, we&#x27;ll print a big red warning. (When you run a multi-node Postgres cluster, or use LiteFS Cloud with SQLite, you&#x27;d doing at the application layer what a more reliable storage layer would do at the block layer). reply motoboi 16 hours agoprevThere is a very high price to pay when going with your own scheduling solution: you have to compete with the resources google and others are throwing at the problem.Also, there is the market for talent, which is non-existent for fly.io technology if it&#x27;s not open source (I see what you did here, Google): you&#x27;ll have to teach people how your solution works internally and congratulations, now you have a global pool of 20 (maybe 100) people that can improved it (if you have really deep pockets, maybe you can have 5 Phd).

In a container runtime k8s, containers within a pod share the same network namespace (same localhost) and possibly pid namespace.The press release maps pods to machines, but provides no mapping of pod containers to a Fly.io concept.Are multiple containers allowed?

Building upon that, the FKS implementation is an abstraction on top of Fly.io Machines. So what I’m asking is how, if even, does the FKS implementation support multiple containers for a pod? Using FKS, the abstraction is no longer a VM.It seems that Fly.io Machines support multiple processes for a single container, but not multiple containers per Machine [0].

It’s no longer Kubernetes if it doesn’t support a core behavior of Kubernetes.If you only support deploying single containers with single processes on FKS, then you might as well use flyctl.It’s a solvable issue of course.

Init containers and sidecars allow for a separation of concerns, which is essential for non-cloud-native workloads. Logging and telemetry are just a couple of features which may be designed and built into cloud-native applications, but legacy applications need this flexibility without modifying the application itself.The fact you ran K8S for four years without it demonstrates only that it is not required by your workload -- not that it is \"unnecessary complexity\" or an \"anti-pattern.\" reply kuhsaft 10 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is you might not be adding the sidecars yourself.Kubernetes has a resource called MutatingAdmissionWebhook that allows mutations of the Pod object before creation.I think the most common use case is for service meshes. Your Deployment might not have any sidecars, but the service mesh controller will automatically add a network proxy container to your pod via the admission webhook.Another use case would be OpenTelemetry or some other observability service sidecar injection for auto-instrumentation. reply qeternity 10 hours agorootparentprevNobody would suggest this.

A Fly Machine is just a VM, and you have root in the VM. You can set up systemd, you can set up Docker, you can run kubelets on all your Machines.The thought here is: Fly.io already does a lot of the things any K8s distribution would do. If you were to boot up a complete K8s distribution on your own Fly Machines, running oblivious to the fact that they were on Fly.io, you&#x27;d be duplicating some of the work we&#x27;d already done (that&#x27;s fine, maybe you like your way better, but still, bear with me).So, rather than setting up a \"vanilla\" K8s that works the same way it would if you were on, like, Hetzner or whatever, you can instead boot up a drastically stripped down K8s (based on K3s and Virtual Kubelet) that defers some of what K8s does to our own APIs. Instead of a cluster of scheduling servers synchronized with Raft, you just run a single SQLite database. Instead of bin-packing VMs with Docker and a kubelet, you just run everything as an independent Fly Machine.We took the time to write about this because it was interesting to us (I think we expected a K8s to be more annoying for us to roll, and when it was easier we got a lot more interested).

As much as people hate it, K8s has become the defacto operating system for the cloud so it makes sense to support it. reply 0xbadcafebee 16 hours agoprevI like the discussion on scheduling. One of the things I&#x27;ve thought recently is that, since there&#x27;s no one model of how an app or system should work, nor one network architecture, there shouldn&#x27;t be one scheduler.Instead, I think the system components should expose themselves as independent entities, and grant other system components the ability to use them under criteria. With this model, any software which can use the system components&#x27; interfaces can request resources and use them, in whatever pattern they decide to.But this requires a universal interface for each kind of component, loosely coupled. Each component then needs to have networking, logging, metrics, credentials, authn+z, configuration. And there needs to be a method by which users can configure all this & start&#x2F;stop it. Basically it&#x27;s a distributed OS.We need to make a standard for distributed OS components using a loosely coupled interface and all the attributes needed. So, not just a standard for logging, auth, creds, etc, but also a standard for networked storage objects that have all those other attributes.When all that&#x27;s done, you could make an app on Fly.io, and then from GCP you could attach to your Fly.io app&#x27;s storage. Or from Fly.io, send logs to Azure Monitor Logs. As long as it&#x27;s a standard distributed OS component, you just attach to it and use it, and it&#x27;ll verify you over the standard auth, etc. Not over the \"Fly.io integration API for Log Export\", but over the \"Distributed OS Logging Standard\" protocol.We&#x27;ve got to get away from these one-off REST APIs and get back to real standards. I know corporations hate standards and love to make their own little one-offs, but it&#x27;s really holding back technological progress. reply verdverm 15 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re basically describing Kubernetes and why it has become so popular reply 0xbadcafebee 11 hours agorootparentK8s is the opposite. It&#x27;s proprietary, insular, not compatible with anything else, tightly coupled, not layered, not backwards compatible, etc. It has network services, logging, auth, etc, but so does literally every other system in the world, that doesn&#x27;t make them all identical.K8s is popular because it&#x27;s free, has a lot of bells and whistles, and was made by Google. Otherwise nobody would use it. It&#x27;s basically a larger, slightly less crappy Jenkins. reply verdverm 11 hours agorootparent> K8s is the opposite. It&#x27;s proprietary, insular, not compatible with anything elseNot accurate, k8s is open source and every major tech company is developing or using it. There are a large number of companies building on top of it as well.- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes (open source)- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landscape.cncf.io&#x2F; (huge ecosystem)- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k8s.devstats.cncf.io&#x2F;d&#x2F;9&#x2F;companies-table?orgId=1 (count of contributions by company)> It&#x27;s basically a larger, slightly less crappy Jenkins.What? This is not even remotely accurate. Where did you come to this opinion?K8s replaced mesos&#x2F;marathon, which was the dominant open source orchestration system at the time. Jenkins is a CI system and can run on k8s. There is also JenkinsX that is trying to be the yaml driven, k8s native platform, but I think it missed the mark. There are better k8s native CI&#x2F;CD systems like the Argo projects reply 0xbadcafebee 7 hours agorootparentProprietary as in, relates only to itself, not compatible with anything other than itself. It&#x27;s a monolith with no standards. You have to write custom software to make anything work with it. Nothing just works with k8s out of the box, because it provides no loosely coupled standard interface that remains backwards-compatible. It has an API that becomes obsolete every 9 months.Jenkins and K8s do effectively the same thing. They&#x27;re both monolithic applications (in K8s&#x27; case it&#x27;s a monolith of microservices, but same difference), both have a manager&#x2F;worker (formerly master&#x2F;slave) architecture, both run arbitrary workloads, load secrets, store and retrieve logs from your workload, schedule them to execute on worker nodes that you configure, manage users and permissions, etc, etc. They&#x27;re functionally extremely similar: distributed centralized systems designed to execute arbitrary tasks. The difference is mostly technical. Ironically, Jenkins is the more flexible of the two, with much more stable interfaces.People in tech think in terms of cargo-cult imaginary categories, like an \"orchestration system\" - which isn&#x27;t a computer science concept. Schedulers are, operating systems are, but \"orchestrators\" are not. It&#x27;s a term made up to sell a product, like a configuration management engine (Terraform) or an application workload scheduler (K8s). Very different things that people use the same word (\"orchestrator\") for because it sounds cooler, but doesn&#x27;t mean anything. reply robertlagrant 12 hours agoparentprev> I know corporations hate standards and love to make their own little one-offs, but it&#x27;s really holding back technological progress.Corporations create standards all the time, either directly or through standards bodies, that they also fund. You can already push logs with syslog, or transform them with Beats then push them; you can already attach storage from elsewhere, etc etc. It&#x27;s just often a bad idea to for performance and data movement cost reasons.I don&#x27;t see the major technological progress this holds back, and if you think technological progress is a measure of how much corporations hate standards, then by that logic, based on the last 50 years of utterly insane progress, they must love standards. reply wavemode 12 hours agoparentprevObligatory https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F; reply rileymichael 14 hours agoprevHaving little experience with k3s, how big of a workload (“nodes” aka virtual kubelets, pods, crds, etc) can you have before saturating the non-HA control plane becomes a concern? reply xgbi 3 hours agoprevI have so many questions, it is a very good article!My most important one is this: can I build a distributed k8s cluster with this?I mean having fly machines in Europe, US and Asia acting as a solid k8s cluster and letting the kube scheduler do its job?If yes then it is better than what the current cloud offerings are, with their region-based implementation.My second question is obviously how is the storage handled when my workload migrates from the US to Europe: so I still profit from NVME speeds?

We&#x27;ve just added a feature that lets you run K8s, in a particularly simple configuration, if K8s is what you want. If you weren&#x27;t already interested in using K8s, you shouldn&#x27;t touch FKS.The ordinary way someone would boot up an app on Fly.io is to visit a directory in their filesystem with a Rails or Django or Express app or something, or a Dockerfile, and just type `flyctl launch`. No K8s will be involved in any way. You have to go out of your way to get K8s on Fly.io. :) reply imjonse 15 hours agoparentprevThey have for their infrastructure, as I understood from this and previous blogs.

So if I&#x27;m reading this right, fly.io practically only exposes the Pods API, but Kubernetes is really much more than that. I&#x27;m not very familiar with any serious company that directly uses Pods API to launch containers, so if their reimplementation of Pods API is just a shim, and they&#x27;re not going to be able to implement ever-growing set of features in Kubernetes Pod lifecycle&#x2F;configuration (starting from &#x2F;logs, &#x2F;exec, &#x2F;proxy...) why even bother branding it Kubernetes? Instead they could do what Google does with Cloud Run (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.run&#x2F;) which Fly.io is already doing?I don&#x27;t know why would anyone would be like \"here&#x27;s a container execution platform, let me go ahead and use their fake Pods API instead of their official API\". reply tptacek 14 hours agoparentThis is a good comment. More like this!Right now, the immediate things you&#x27;d get out of using FKS are:* The declarative K8s style of defining an app deployment, and some of the K8s mechanics for reconciling that declaration to what&#x27;s actually running. We did most of this stuff before when we were backed on Nomad, but less of it now with Fly Machines. If you missed having a centralized orchestrator, here&#x27;s one.* Some compatibility with K8s tooling (we spin up a cluster, spit out a kubeconfig file, and you can just go to town with kubectl or whatever).This is absolutely not going to let you do everything you can possibly do with K8s! Maybe we&#x27;ll beef it up over time. Maybe not many people will use it, because people who want K8s want the entire K8s Cinematic Universe, and we&#x27;ll keep it simple.Mostly: we wrote about it because it was interesting, is all that&#x27;s happening here.I think you asked a super good question, and \"I don&#x27;t know, you might be right\" is our genuine answer.

I can (sort of) predict how likely we are to do them near term. reply kuhsaft 13 hours agoparentprevI think there’s potential here.It is Kubernetes since they are running k3s as the control-plane. It’s not just an implementation of the Pod API, it’s an implementation of kubelet which handles logs&#x2F;exec&#x2F;etc APIs. The rest of the Kubernetes API is part of the control-plane on k3s.The only major issue I see is persistent volume support, but persistent volumes in Kubernetes were always a bit flaky and I’ve always preferred to use an externally managed DB or storage solution. reply 4ggr0 14 hours agoprevi definitely want to try this! never really worked with kubernetes, because it always seemed too complicated, for what i needed. after using fly.io for my first real web project in a while, they do seem to provide exactly what i want from a \"hoster\". reply Kostic 13 hours agoprevWell, that&#x27;s a surprise.

Your summary (we DON&#x27;T until we DO but MAYBE NOT) does feel pretty true to life! reply tptacek 15 hours agoparentprevInteresting! We&#x27;re mostly not kidding about that. We launched in 2020 with a scheduler that looks a lot like how K8s works†. We ran into scaling issues. Instead of scaling a globally coordinated \"eye in the sky\" scheduler, like Nomad and K8s offers, we relaxed a constraint (\"when you ask to run a job, we&#x27;ll move heaven and earth to put it somewhere\") and wound up with a totally different scheduling model (a market-based system that bids on resources, where requests to place jobs are all effectively fill-or-kill limit orders).This was a bet. We&#x27;re bullish about this bet! Even without K8s, having core scheduling be \"less reliable\" but with a simpler, more responsive interface puts us in a position to do some of the \"move heaven and earth\" work that K8s and Nomad do in simpler components (like: we can write Elixir code to drive the scheduler).But it might not pay off! That&#x27;s what makes it a bet.† (see: comments on this thread asking why overengineered and wrote out own version of stuff; the expectation that you&#x27;d run a platform like Fly.io on standard K8s or Nomad is pretty strong!). reply roozbeh18 15 hours agoparentprevI made the same bet with cloudways which is now owned by digitalocean. they filled a gap for me, and I was ok if they decided to close shop; I am glad it didn&#x27;t go that direction, and they are part of a bigger company that also was once a small company, but they are now publicly traded. you make your bets... reply lkjadflkj4 15 hours agoparentprevSome people have a cheeky sense of humor.

But if you have a few hundred or thousand employees and don&#x27;t want to write your own orchestration, it makes sense.That said, it&#x27;s a questionable design choice when you get to a hyperscale environment, since all the primitives are extremely opinionated and have design and scalability issues with service discovery, networking, and so on. All the controllers had to be rewritten, we had to roll our own deployment system, our own service discovery system, our own load balancing, and so on.

So, being explicit first, and guide the reader through that concept along the article would have made a big difference. reply whalesalad 14 hours agoparentprevKubernetes is really epic and powerful if you actually take the time to understand it from first principles. Unfortunately people don&#x27;t do this, and individuals without good networking&#x2F;devops experience roll something half-baked out with a terrible deployment process, a mess of helm charts, etc... and it ends up being hated by everyone.At FarmLogs (yc 12) we had a pretty righteous gitops (homegrown) kube platform running dozens of microservices. We would not have been able to move as quickly as we did and roll out so many different features without it. This was back when people had just started to adopt it. Mesos was still a contender (lmao). We were polyglot too - python&#x2F;clojure mixture. Heck, we even ran an ancient climate model called APSIM that was built in c#&#x2F;mono, required all kinds of ancient fortran dependencies etc and it worked like a charm on kube thanks to containers. We had dedicated internal load balancers behind our VPN for raw access to services and endpoints, like \"microservice.internal.farmlogs.com\" (this was before istio, fabric networks, all the incredible progress that exists now)I recall Brendan Burns asking me to write up a blog post for the Kube blog about our success story, but unfortunately was so saddled with product dev work and managing the team that I never found time for it.I will absolutely adopt K8s again one day (very soon) but you need to know how to harness its capabilities and deploy it correctly. Build your own Heroku that fits your business. Use the Kube API directly. It&#x27;s really not hard. It gets hard due to all the crap in the ecosystem (helm, yaml files). Hitting API direct means no yaml =)I am stoked to see Fly offering this. reply ekidd 14 hours agorootparentI have used a number of orchestrator platforms in production, including AWS ECS (Docker + custom orchestration), EKS (Kubernetes) and Google Cloud&#x27;s Kubernetes.I&#x27;ve also used Chef, custom RPM packages and classic Unix startup scripts. And I&#x27;m probably forgetting some.And honestly? Kubernetes can be really great. Especially if you:- Read enough to understand the split between pods&#x2F;replication controllers&#x2F;deployments, which is a bit unusual, and the fact that \"services\" are basically a name lookup system. This split is weird, but it&#x27;s not that hard to figure out.- Pay someone for a quality managed Kubernetes.- Don&#x27;t get clever with the networking overlays.I especially like the way that Kubernetes allows me to deploy almost anything with a short YAML file, and the fact that I never need to worry about individual servers at all.Now, I wouldn&#x27;t use Kubernetes if I could get away with a \"Heroku like\" system. But for anything more complicated than that, Kubernetes can be pretty simple and reliable. Certainly I&#x27;d take Kubernetes over a really complex Terraform setup. reply whalesalad 14 hours agorootparentThere is absolutely (still!!!!) room in the market for a PaaS built on top of Kube that is actually good, and is a hybrid of Heroku+Kube. More convention, less all the rope to hang yourself with, while still enabling advanced use cases with full control.Even docker compose is too annoying for what most people need.Most of our use cases are so simple. I need a (black box) container that exposes a TCP port. I want N of them. I want them load-balanced with a friendly name. I want them load balanced behind a friendly name with auth in front of it. I want centralized logs, based on these names. I want centralized stats, based on these names (not xyz-pod-232903209284390-dev but xyz aggregated). I want auto deploys based on a github repo. I want my releases tagged with the git short hash.When someone cracks the nut of heroku+kube they will become the next billionares. This is why I think it is wise to try and enter this space, as Fly is doing.The new stuff Microsoft has announced (named Radius, not to be confused with RADIUS network auth protocol) is the closes thing to this sort of solution I have been imagining for years: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-microsoft-azure-i...I want N http&#x2F;tcp&#x2F;php&#x2F;python&#x2F;node&#x2F;insert-tool-here API or web servers. I want a best-practices RabbitMQ deployment, a best-practices Redis deployment, and a best-practices PostgreSQL deployment. For Redis, I do not care about state, just make it work. For Rabbit, I want 3+ nodes for HA. For PSQL, I do care about state so please useand do backups.This is the same shit we have been reinventing for years over and over again and the recipes are all the same now. Radius is the best (at least on paper) attempt at unifying all this stuff.I&#x27;ve been beating this drum for over 10 years now though, I keep thinking someone will figure it out and no one has.

Servo has been featured in six conference talks this year, including at RustNL, Web Engines Hackfest, LF Europe Member Summit, Open Source Summit Europe, GOSIM Workshop, and GOSIM Conference. Servo now has a usable “minibrowser” UI, now supports offscreen rendering, its experimental WebGPU support (--pref dom.webgpu.enabled) has been updated, and Servo is now listed on wpt.fyi again (click Edit to add Servo). Our new layout engine is now proving its strengths, with support for iframes, floats, stacking context improvements, inline layout improvements, margin collapsing, ‘position: sticky’, ‘min-width’ and ‘min-height’, ‘max-width’ and ‘max-height’, ‘align-content’, ‘justify-content’, ‘white-space’, ‘text-indent’, ‘text-align: justify’, ‘outline’ and ‘outline-offset’, and ‘filter: drop-shadow()’. Pass rates in parts of the Web Platform Tests with our new layout engine, showing the improvement we’ve made since the start of our data in April 2023. Floats are notoriously tricky, to the point we found them impossible to implement correctly in our legacy layout engine, but thanks to the move from eager to opportunistic parallelism, they are now supported fairly well. Whereas legacy layout was only ever able to reach 53.9% in the floats tests and 68.2% in floats-clear, we’re now at 82.2% in floats (+28.3pp over legacy) and 73.3% in floats-clear (+5.1pp over legacy). Acid1 now passes in the new layout engine, and we’ve also surpassed legacy layout in the CSS2 abspos (by 50.0pp), CSS2 positioning (by 6.5pp), and CSS Position (by 4.4pp) test suites, while making big strides in others, like the CSSOM tests (+13.1pp) and key parts of the CSS2 test suite (+15.8pp). Next year, our funding will go towards maintaining Servo, releasing nightlies on Android, finishing our integration with Tauri (thanks to NLNet), and implementing tables and better support for floats and non-Latin text (thanks to NLNet). Servo will also be at FOSDEM 2024, with Rakhi Sharma speaking about embedding Servo in Rust projects on 3 February at 16:45 local time (15:45 UTC). See you there! There’s a lot more we would like to do, so if you or a company you know are interested in sponsoring the development of an embeddable, independent, memory-safe, modular, parallel web rendering engine, we want to hear from you! Head over to our sponsorship page, or email join@servo.org for enquiries. In a decade that many people feared would become the nadir of browser engine diversity, we hope we can help change that with Servo. Back",

It might be a good thing that Servo is now independent from Mozilla. We can&#x27;t rely on Mozilla anymore, and should move on. Maybe someday Servo can become the new Firefox (as in \"modern and freedom-respecting browser\")?From testing the current version of Servo, it still has a long long way to go though, until it becomes a usable browser. reply nightski 15 hours agoparentI rely on Mozilla just fine. Have used Firefox for a decade and will continue to do so. I am not about to accept Google as the sole provider of the web like you are so eager to do. reply eitland 14 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstood:I think GP just like me wants neither Google nor Mozilla. reply tapoxi 13 hours agorootparentprevWith Firefox being in single digit marketshare, the fight is already over. It&#x27;s hard to justify developing for or testing against Firefox unless you want to appeal to the similarly small Linux desktop crowd. reply robador 2 hours agorootparentAs a developer, nothing screams incompetence more than a site being completely unusable in FF though. reply echelon 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is why antitrust matters.Google needs to have their arms tied for a bit. Their fingers are in every single pie, taxing the entire tech sector.Likewise, Safari shouldn&#x27;t be the default iPhone browser, Edge shouldn&#x27;t be the default on Windows, and no company should be able to scare users or force their solution as a default.The browser space would be fine without Google. reply tapoxi 12 hours agorootparentBut looking at alternative browsers like Brave, Vivaldi, Opera or Arc they are also Chromium based. Brave is even by Mozilla&#x27;s former CTO and they still don&#x27;t use the Mozilla stack.

Are you mentioned yourself, most developer only test against chrome&#x2F;chromium so using servo would be commercial suicide. It not really a statement on servo vs chromium on technical level, but of google vs Mozilla market dominance. reply eitland 3 hours agorootparentI have some good news:For me it seems we are past peak \"works only in IE^h^hChrome\".There was a time 5 years ago or so when several interesting websites only worked in Chromebut I haven&#x27;t seen that problem in a while and the last website I had to deal with that only supported Chrome was a product that a company I work for used but threw out earlier this year.Yes, some things still mysteriously work slower in Firefox or have some features disabled for no good reason which is why consumer protection agencies still have work to do but I haven&#x27;t opened Chrome for weeks now I think and last time I did I think the thing I tried to access was just as broken there. replyzozbot234 19 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s also the Ladybird browser by the SerenityOS folks, that&#x27;s however not written in a memory-safe language. reply mminer237 16 hours agorootparentWhich, despite being much younger and 80% made by one guy, is somehow way farther along than Servo.

C++ is unfit for long term use because it is intentionally introducing severe tech debt that we mistakenly imagine doesn&#x27;t have to be repaid. reply 3836293648 18 hours agorootparentprevI thought Jakt was supposed to be memory safe (but it was very wip last I looked at Jakt) reply peoplefromibiza 18 hours agorootparentLadybird is written in C++ reply azakai 12 hours agorootparentIt is for now, but as both Ladybird and Jakt are SerenityOS projects, eventually parts of Ladybird might get written in Jakt. Jakt compiles to C++ and plans to have features like \"inline C++\" to allow easy interop between the two, so I assume they are thinking about this. reply capableweb 13 hours agoparentprev> From testing the current version of Servo, it still has a long long way to go though, until it becomes a usable browser.In reality, I think you&#x27;re waiting for a different project. Servo is like Gecko&#x2F;Webkit, it&#x27;s the browser engine. As far as I know, they&#x27;re not aiming to build a browser, just the engine part.What you&#x27;re waiting for is someone to start using Servo as an engine and provide the browser chrome :) reply HeckFeck 11 hours agorootparentI thought it would be a fun weird project to make Servo work with MS&#x27; abandoned JavaScript engine:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chakra-core&#x2F;ChakraCoreOf course it is written in C++ and you&#x27;d probably want a pure Rust browser.

Do you need such succinct memory usage? reply wongarsu 13 hours agorootparentSafe memory management without GC is the feature that gets Rust the most headlines, but it&#x27;s not the only raison d&#x27;etre. It also has a great type system, that combined with the focus of the standard library and the library ecosystem makes it a lot easier to avoid bugs and makes refactoring a lot safer and easier. It&#x27;s also very fast, and scrapers are surprisingly often CPU bound reply Exec2 18 hours agorootparentprevis there a chance to see it? any links for someone interested? reply capableweb 19 hours agoprev> finishing our integration with Tauri (thanks to NLNet)This is really exciting!

Stripped release builds of servo are currently 106M which is quite large. Hopefully some size reduction will be achieved. reply postalrat 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy not a PWA? Does your app need more permissions to mess with people&#x27;s system that a PWA would allow? reply ravenstine 19 hours agoprevCan anyone tell me whether Servo is \"ready enough\" to use for small noncommercial projects? For example, I really like writing personal projects in Typescript using Deno, but there really isn&#x27;t a very good UI library for Deno outside of running an HTTP server. Other attempts at UI libraries, last I checked, were experimental or half-assed. Would be cool to somehow integrate directly with Servo from Deno so that I don&#x27;t have to resort to Electron. reply capableweb 18 hours agoparent> Can anyone tell me whether Servo is \"ready enough\" to use for small noncommercial projects?I don&#x27;t think it is, yet. But why not play around with it and see if it&#x27;s enough for your use case? Hard to know exactly without knowing what you need to be able to do.Personally, Tauri currently hits the sweetspot of being way lighter than Electron, but still provide (mostly) the same benefits. reply mst 14 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s always https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neutralino.js.org&#x2F; which uses native WebView components to keep itself rather smaller than Electron. reply polyglotfacto2 3 hours agoparentprevCould you tell me more about what you mean with \"integrate directly with Servo from Deno\" You&#x27;re welcome to the chat to discuss in more details if you want: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;servo.zulipchat.com&#x2F; reply stephen_g 21 hours agoprevIs there any plan at Mozilla to eventually use Servo for Firefox or did them basically stopping working on it end any hope of that? Is the Servo team’s plan to build a new browser around it?It definitely could get interesting soon, I’ve been keenly watching the development of the Ladybird browser (which is also a from-scratch engine) so if there were potentially two viable new browser engines over the next few years that could really shake things up! reply capableweb 19 hours agoparent> Is there any plan at Mozilla to eventually use Servo for Firefox or did them basically stopping working on it end any hope of that?Initially, I think Servo was never meant to be integrated wholesale into anything. It was a experiment playground to evaluate ideas without having them coupled to mainline Firefox, and be able to iterate on things quickly.Once the ideas were validated, they were integrated into Firefox without pulling in their entirety of Servo.The \"Quantum Render project\" is one example of this, where the WebRender compositor was first created in Servo, and eventually integrated into Firefox mainline. reply nicce 18 hours agorootparentI remember the Quantum hype. Time flies.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;Rel... reply worik 15 hours agorootparentHype?

Notably webrender, the rendering backend, and stylo, the style system. But they’ve effectively dropped all servo development at this point, and are not working on it further. reply tmikaeld 21 hours agorootparentHuh? Why would they drop development of key components to their main product?What is Mozilla without Firefox?Update:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9lkIX5ryZZ4Basically, Mozilla gave Servo employees the foot and the project was taken over by the linux foundation.Servo dev has been restarted (mostly) during 2023 and the changed Firefox made to their servo implemementation is now being added to servo in batches (ongoing).So Servo team is aiming to become a full featured (standalone) web platform (browser). reply zaphar 20 hours agorootparentServo is not Firefox. It was always a testbed research platform. Stopping development of Servo does not mean stopping development of Firefox. reply robin_reala 21 hours agorootparentprevThey integrated what they felt was worthwhile, and continue to develop and support those pieces internally to Firefox. reply Longhanks 17 hours agorootparentprev> What is Mozilla without Firefox?De facto?

Google&#x27;s puppet company to keep regulators happy.If you think that&#x27;s the case, then Google is clearly failing at that goal, since they&#x27;ve aggressively taken browser share directly from Firefox users to the point where Firefox may no longer be supported by government services. reply kramerger 16 hours agorootparentprev> project was taken over by the linux foundationWhy? What is role of Linux Foundation anyway?(Beside spending members tons of spam and completely ignore GDPR?) reply fabrice_d 15 hours agorootparentTheir role is mostly being a fiscal host to receive donations. Servo moved to the Linux Foundation Europe recently (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;servo.org&#x2F;slides&#x2F;2023-04-25-servo-and-linux-foundati...), which should make it easier to receive grants from EU programs - this is a good thing! reply cxr 20 hours agoparentprevThe undue focus and almost wistful romanticization&#x2F;fetishization of Servo is frankly weird, especially when it comes from people with only a tenuous grasp of (let alone hands-on relationship with) browser engine internals. I&#x27;m talking about tech news writers and kind-of-but-not-really technical commenters on e.g. Reddit who confabulate their own lore in the spirit of those press accounts, etc.Firefox uses Gecko as its browser engine. The worthwhile parts of Servo are already in Firefox by way of Gecko. Servo is not The Answer to all of life&#x27;s problems.Or, to answer your question more bluntly: \"No. Stop asking.\" reply Ygg2 20 hours agorootparent> Firefox uses Gecko as its browser engine. The worthwhile parts of Servo are already in Firefox by way of Gecko.And Gecko has been notoriously unembeddable. Which kinda helped the whole CEF spread.Not to mention Mozilla basically kneecapped Servo and Firefox by firing most of its devs in a purge. reply cxr 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m struggling to see the logical throughline that connects your comment to mine, or even how it relates to itself.Gecko was originally conceived to be embeddable by design. TPTB decided this was a handicap. It&#x27;s not an accident that it&#x27;s hard to work with outside the context that is its modern raison d&#x27;être; it is now unembeddable, if not \"by design\" then certainly by choice.Servo is not a product, and there is no product for which Servo is an integral component. Servo was an R&D project. It succeeded. Mozilla laid off a bunch of Servo developers, partly because of COVID, and partly because it was (past) done; it doesn&#x27;t make sense to keep paying for R&D at Servo&#x27;s stage. It&#x27;s debatable whether it&#x27;s even R&D at that point—more like wankery&#x2F;noodling (i.e. what most programmers want to do, but that the world already has enough of). reply paulrouget 18 hours agorootparent> Gecko was originally conceived to be embeddable by designWhich part? And… what do you mean by embeddable in that context? reply HeckFeck 10 hours agorootparentK-Meleon used the Gecko rendering engine but with a native chrome and no SpiderMonkey. It also powers Thunderbird and the SeaMonkey browser. I&#x27;m sure it turned up elsewhere before it was too &#x27;baked in&#x27; to Firefox. reply paulrouget 2 hours agorootparentIn the case of Thunderbird and seamonkey, Gecko was not embedded, but was the \"embedder\".For a short time, there was some attempts (native cocoa and gtk widget) to embed gecko, but it was really not meant to be, it was really hacky and never matured.Gecko was never designed to be embedded. Really. reply zokier 15 hours agorootparentprevXULRunner? reply paulrouget 2 hours agorootparentXULRunner was not Gecko embed. It was Gecko embedding stuff.There was never a proper embeddable gecko.There has been an attempt for a gtk widget, but it never matured. reply eitland 13 hours agorootparentprevI remember Mozilla Prism as a \"site specific browser\"or what one calls it back in the days. reply Ygg2 18 hours agorootparentprevThroughline is unwanted fetishization&#x2F;romantizadion of Servo.I&#x27;d argue Servo&#x27;s promise was never realized - embedding.Another part of it is losing people in the purge. People fired weren&#x27;t hired to work on Servo exclusively, some were long time developers of FF, including the MDN docs team.So it&#x27;s not like they started Servo, hired bunch of people to work on it, then fired them after R&D was done. reply crotchfire 20 hours agorootparentprevMozilla needs to hear this more often.There is only one browser, because browsers need to be embeddable, and Firefox isn&#x27;t. reply lmeyerov 19 hours agorootparentInteresting to work through thatOn its face, it&#x27;s a tough sustainability position for an org of Mozilla&#x27;s size b&#x2F;c browser revenue - today - is from controlling the search bar (and maybe now payments APIs?). By making Firefox embeddable, Mozilla gives that revenue to whoever is doing the embedding. Ex: BraveChrome engine.Building for embedding developers can be super distracting if no sustainability, which isn&#x27;t a problem for Google: They still make money from embedding by owning the embedding environments like Android. AFAICT, Mozilla failed to land in sizeable markets there. They tried to own & partner in the embedding envs -- e.g., FirefoxOS -- so maybe the trick is to get a more generous rev share for phone vendors wanting to break free of Google? Historically didn&#x27;t seem to really work out, but maybe genAI w&#x2F; consumer&#x2F;prosumer-grade UIs is reopening that door.Evolutions like that in turn may take quite an engineering & culture rethink as well, not easy to turn such a big & decentralized ship. I&#x27;ll keep rooting for them! reply jwells89 19 hours agorootparentI’m not well-versed on the internals of FirefoxOS, but I’m not sure it really counts as embedding because to my understanding, the entirety of the user-facing UI was built with Gecko. Embedding entails usage of the engine with unrelated toolkits, e.g. AppKit&#x2F;UIKit or GTK.If that’s true, then Mozilla wouldn’t have been making money from Gecko’s ability to embed with FirefoxOS unless the project took a sharp corner and changed UI toolkits. reply lmeyerov 16 hours agorootparentThe FirefoxOS scenario would be Gecko embedding in FirefoxOS, so Mozilla is their own customer, and makes $ by being the controller of FirefoxOS - OS search, and configuration of browser searchIt&#x27;s less likely the handset manufacturer would be able to change search bar defaults in those scenarios, at least without a stronger profit sharing negotiation, as they&#x27;d probably be already negotiating a more careful licensing & teaming agreement reply mike_hearn 13 hours agorootparentprevArguably neither is Chrome. Electron, CEF and WebView2 are all forks of it. Google has no interest in a supported official embedding API. reply paulrouget 18 hours agorootparentprevI was part of Mozilla back then. I think we were already talking about making Gecko embeddable in __2003__.But then… looot of things happened, other priorities, competition, bad decisions, etc etc. reply KyleSanderson 17 hours agorootparentprevIf only one could Boot2Gecko reply simonw 17 hours agoprevThe Playwright browser automation framework already has backends for Chromium, WebKit and Firefox.I wonder what it would take to build a Servo backend?Could be a really fun way to experiment with its capabilities. reply polyglotfacto2 3 hours agoparentYes it sounds interesting and I wonder what it would take as well, you&#x27;re welcome to join the chat to discuss in more details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;servo.zulipchat.com&#x2F; reply KolmogorovComp 18 hours agoprev [–] The budget to make a browser today (including a browser engine) is estimated to be around 400 million yearly (FF cost, estimates for Safari in the same range). They may be bloated, but even by being 10x more efficient it’s still 40 million a year of equivalent engineering work. How is servo intending to pull that work without the leverage of a big corp? reply mminer237 16 hours agoparentLadybird has mostly been made by one guy in a few years and has somehow become a usable browser. Where did you get that estimation? reply wharvle 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s something wackadoo going on in software where in one environment it&#x27;ll take 200 workers six years to have something that&#x27;s still not good, and in another it&#x27;ll take 1-5 workers a couple years to do at least as well.It&#x27;s not even a corporate vs. small shop thing. Look at the team sizes on \"giant\" programs from big companies in the 90s and consider how enormous an undertaking they&#x27;d be considered by most software orgs today.Like, I get all the Mythical Man-Month, Brooks&#x27; Law stuff and that that observation predates the period I&#x27;m talking about, but there&#x27;s definitely been some kind of shift that has other factors causing this (with Brooks&#x27; Law compounding the problem). Not sure what it is, I just know that it sure looks like we&#x27;re far less efficient at building software than we used to be (where \"we\" is the industry overall). It&#x27;s like every single organization larger than a dozen people got way worse at building software, pretty suddenly, some time between about 2005 and 2010. reply webmaven 7 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re missing the factor that expanding the API surface area, however attractive&#x2F;productive&#x2F;cool each individual expansion&#x2F;feature might be, in aggregate becomes a moat maintaining the incumbent&#x27;s dominant position.So as far as Google is concerned, the implied manpower requirements are a feature, not a bug.Chrome&#x27;s surface area is now huge (and still expanding at a fair clip), but matching Chrome&#x27;s featureset has become table-stakes for being considered a viable desktop browser, and independently implementing (and maintaining) that entire set of features requires a correspondingly large developer team, even if you were somehow more labor-efficient. reply joshmarinacci 14 hours agorootparentprevuseable and complete are very different things. reply refulgentis 11 hours agorootparentprevUsable is carrying the weight of the world in that sentence. reply capableweb 18 hours agoparentprevHow much of that cost is the browser vs the cost of the browser engine?Servo currently describes itself as a \"web rendering engine\", so I don&#x27;t think they are aiming to become a full-featured browser, and I&#x27;m not sure if there is an important distinction between \"browser engine\" vs \"web rendering engine\". It makes it sound like they only want to focus on the rendering part itself. reply YetAnotherNick 18 hours agoparentprev [–] I might be wrong but I don&#x27;t think servo is intending to be feature or standard complete ever. Most of the cost of firefox or safari likely comes from new features.Also it is a web rendering engine, not a full fleshed browser. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

In the photo, a man kneels in an outdoor sawmill next to his painstaking work: An intricate wooden carving of his bulldog, which he proudly gazes at. “Made it with my own hands,” the Facebook caption reads. The image has 1,300 likes, 405 comments, and 47 shares. “Beautiful work of art,” one of the comments reads. “You have an AMAZING talent!,” another says. “Nice work, love it <3!” “Awesome work keep it up.” This incredible work of art, a “wooden monument to my dog,” has been posted dozens of times across dozens of engagement bait Facebook pages. But every time, the man and the dog are different. Sometimes the dog is hyperrealistic. Sometimes the bulldog is a German Shepherd. Sometimes the man’s hair is slicked back, sometimes it stands up. Sometimes the man sits on the other side of the dog. Sometimes the man looks Latino, other times he looks white; clearly, it is a different man, and a different dog, in most of the images. All of these images are AI-generated, and stolen from an artist named Michael Jones. One of the images has more than a million likes. Depending on the image, it is obvious, to me, that the man and the dog are not real. The dog often looks weirdly polygonal, or like some wood carving filter has been applied to an image of a real dog. Sometimes the dog’s ear has obvious artifacts associated with AI-generated images. Other times, it’s the man who looks fake. Variations of this picture are being posted all over Facebook by a series of gigantic meme pages with names like “Go Story,” “Amazing World,” “Did you know?” “Follow me,” “Avokaddo,” and so on. Universally, the comment sections of these pages feature hundreds of people who have no idea that these are AI-generated and are truly inspired by the dog carving. A version of this image posted on Dogs 4 life has 1 million likes, 39,000 comments, and 17,000 shares. The Dogs 4 life account has spammed links to buy cheap, dog-branded stuff to the top of the comments section. In many ways, this is a tale as old as time: people lie and steal content online in exchange for likes, influence and money all the time. But the spread of this type of content on Facebook over the last several months has shown that the once-prophesized future where cheap, AI-generated trash content floods out the hard work of real humans is already here, and is already taking over Facebook. It also shows Facebook is doing essentially nothing to help its users decipher real content from AI-generated content masquerading as real content, and that huge masses of Facebook users are completely unprepared for our AI-generated future. The dog and the carving were real, at one point. The real German Shepherd carving was made by a UK-based professional chainsaw sculptor named Michael Jones, who detailed his work in a series of videos and photos posted over the course of the summer. Jones’ work has since been stolen and turned into endless variations. Those images are then turned into endless inspiration bait by spammy Facebook pages that are presumably looking to monetize the stolen work of artists like Jones. Jones' real carving Another of Jones' real carvings Another of Jones' real carvings “This is something that is a huge issue for us and other carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work,” Jones told me, “as well as setting unrealistic expectations when it comes to creating chainsaw carving art or any art for that matter!” The strategy relies on “image-to-image” generative AI, which takes an input image and generates a new one based on that input. “Every time you generate an image, you get something completely different because it’s randomly seeded, and [the model] is looking for semantic consistency,” Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in AI disinformation and deepfakes, told me. Different generators let a user select the “strength” of the new image, which is a number between zero and one “where zero essentially means ‘ignore this image,’ and one says ‘give me this image exactly back,’” Farid said. A very standard comment section on one of these images. I learned about the dog carvings from Brian Penny, a freelance ghostwriter, who shared Jones’s original image and copies of it on Threads. “All these people are engagement farming off really shitty versions of his work and it’s giving his art a bad name,” Penny told me. “He’s having to compete against these versions of his work and it could easily destroy his business.” Penny told me that a group of AI enthusiasts, skeptics, researchers, and interested parties had been researching and documenting the fact that stolen, AI-generated clones of viral images are taking over Facebook with impunity, where unaware boomers click “like,” “share,” and say things like “wow, incredible,” all day every day. “STOP THE EXPLOITATION OF AI-GENERATED CHILDREN” Penny invited me to the Facebook group “Um, isn’t that AI?,” which has 2,700 members documenting Facebook posts containing obviously AI-generated content that is going viral on Facebook (and which are also designed to trick users into thinking they are real). The first thing I saw when I joined was this image, posted on a page called “Happy day,” which has 261 likes and 71 comments like “This is really beautiful. You are really talented.” If you look at this image, you will notice that the bear is standing on, essentially, an amorphous blob that seems to have a human foot. If you look slightly more closely, you will see two impossibly tiny fake children playing in the dirt. The next image I saw was this meme, which made me laugh: “STOP THE EXPLOITATION OF A.I. GENERATED CHILDREN!,” it reads. “Little Juan is forced to carve wooden dogs for FACEBOOK SCAMMERS, and they won’t even share the ‘likes’ with him. By commenting on this page you are contributing to the ongoing abuse of millions of artificially generated children from all over the world, or you could just be a target for future scams. LEARN TO RECOGNIZE AI GENERATED IMAGERY.” Jason Weiesenbach, the creator of the meme, posted that commenters on AI-generated images “are literally praising—in a religious sense—non-reality … imagine if instead of trying to sell someone an adoption certificate for an AI generated monkey, they started feeding these folks fake news articles, complete with artificially generated photographic evidence, or go to their photos grab a random picture of their grandchild, put into an artificially generated hostage situation, and then uses that to scam them out of their life savings. These are not far-fetched ideas, that's literally the extreme side where this is headed. My point is these people are not ready for the world that is coming.” Um, isn’t that AI? grew out of Facebook groups dedicated to Midjourney and other AI image generators. Penny and others in that group, including Um, isn’t that AI? founder Molly Huxley began to notice that images originally posted as AI-generated art were being posted elsewhere on Facebook as though they were real images. “People would take the AI images and post them elsewhere as if they were real, and commenters thought they were real,” Penny told me. “Molly started the group and it was originally people from the AI art community who thought it was funny and weird that people were believing this shit, and it grew from there.” The group has noticed that many of the “remixes” are posted by the same set of 10 or 15 engagement bait Facebook pages. They often repost the same images or versions of the same images and themes over and over again. There’s “Bread House Man,” “Victoria’s Art,” “Jesus in a Nut Tree, “Sand Castle Kid,” and dozens of other variations of images that get posted over and over again. Penny said his own involvement in the group started as a curiosity but eventually he became alarmed when his family members began commenting on AI fakes on Facebook as though they were real. “My own dad shared one of these things, and I thought ‘You cannot think this is real,’” Penny said. “Then I saw my aunts and my dad’s friends share it—it gave me this whole existential crisis.” In Search of Victoria and The Bread House Man The MVP of Um, isn’t That AI? is Catherine Hall, a woman from New Zealand who has been systematically trying to trace the different versions of AI-generated duplicates all over Facebook, and has painstakingly searched for the original works that they were based off of. I was amazed by Hall’s Google Sheets spreadsheets that trace every version of an image she can find. Originally, I saw her spreadsheet for “Victoria’s Art,” an image in which Victoria stands on a dirt path, proudly holding a self-portrait she painted. “I am a young artist Victoria. Please appreciate :).” Hall has identified 116 different variations of Victoria. In some she’s young, in others she’s a grandma. Sometimes, Victoria is Asian, Black, or mixed. Sometimes she has blonde hair, other times it’s red or gray. 0:00 /0:53 1× “I wanted a way to show others how these images are being used. I discovered the majority of them were created from an actual artist’s original work, rather than a text based prompt so I became interested in finding the originals. It is frustrating me that so many mindless ‘wows!’ get spewed out over a fake copy of a real artist’s work,” Hall said. “Basically I will choose an image to research. Then hit up my list of fb pages and search through their back catalog to find all the renditions, I paste the information into a Google Sheet as I go then I can sort by date to see how the image has developed and morphed. Often they will have used a stolen original back at the start of things which can be searched back to find the source. I still am not sure why they do it.” Hall has made similar spreadsheets for “Leaping Horse,” (stolen from an artist named Brandon Wilson), “Man/boy with a wooden owl,” (original unknown), “sand sculpting masters,” (stolen from an Indian teenager whose name on Facebook is Sn Art Sadananda), and “Jesus in a Nut Tree” (artist unknown). I asked Sadananda how he felt after seeing the spreadsheet of clones of his work: “yes, upset,” he said. Over the course of two hours on Wednesday, Hall and I chatted and began to try to find Victoria and where she came from. Hall already had a few candidates. I did some additional reverse image searching and found a screenshot of a VKontakte post featuring the image, from 2021, with the caption “Я молодая художница Виктория. Написала свою первую картину,” which translates to “I am a young artist Victoria. I painted my first picture.” I searched this and was able to find an identical post on Facebook from 2021 from a page called “Сладкая жизнь,” which means “Sweet Life.” This post has 16,000 likes and 829 comments. The image appears to be real, with some light Photoshopping in the grass near the path. The original image of \"Victoria\" I shared these links with Hall. She started looking at the images Sweet Life had posted over the years. The floodgates opened. “Oh wow …..,” she said. “The bread house,” she added. An image of a man with, uhh, a bread house popped up. A document of bread house men Hill created. She immediately followed up with 15 additional, AI-generated remixes of the bread house, each of which have a different man or different version of the house. “This page you found with ‘Victoria’ has a lot of the mother images that had been used to generate the AI versions,” she said. She sent me a series of real photographs of people that had been used as a “seed” image for future AI clones that she’s been tracking for months. “I am finding the source image of so much of this stuff. I wonder if the owners of this page are the same group, but have moved on to generating the AI, or if the AI groups are just using this page as a source,” she said. “This page you found is pure gold.” What seems to be happening is that some of the new Facebook pages sharing these AI-generated clones are pulling from old meme pages, which themselves had previously just reposted stuff that went viral on Reddit, Tumblr, or elsewhere. We weren’t able to find the actual “Victoria,” or the Bread House Man, but we were at least able to peel back another layer of the onion. No one operating any of the Facebook pages responded to messages for comment. Hall’s theory, a common one in the Um, isn’t That AI? Group is that some of these larger groups will sell their accounts once they’ve amassed large numbers of followers, pivot to political disinformation, or try to monetize what they’re doing. A few of them have begun posting links to sites outside of Facebook, while others add links to online stores in the comment sections of their posts once an image has gone viral. The fact that all of these pages are stealing the work of artists upsets Hall: “Often I feel like I am just shouting my observations into a raging storm and no one hears,” she said. ARTIFICIAL REALITIES Of all of the awful things we’ve seen artificial intelligence used for, engagement baiting with stolen content on Facebook is relatively tame. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of wonder and dread while reporting this story. Every time I started researching the origins of a new stolen image, I would click through dozens and dozens of stolen versions of it. There is no polite way to say this, but the comments sections of each of these images are filled with unaware people posting inane encouragement about artwork stolen by robots, a completely constructed reality where thousands of talented AI woodcarvers constantly turn pixels into fucked up German Shepherds for their likes and faves. I tried to determine if the commenters, too, were bots. The vast majority of them clearly are not. Most commenters I looked into are people who have been judiciously posting family photos, political arguments, and status updates on Facebook for decades. Both Penny and Farid made the same observation I did. Farid said that, currently, “when I look at the harms being perpetrated from generative AI from nonconsensual imagery, child sexual abuse, fraud, and disinformation, this isn’t even on the bottom of the list. Somebody’s posting a photo, real people like it—it’s Facebook, who cares, right?” But he added that this AI dreck isn’t good and that in the long term we could see some bad consequences grow out of the rapid spamming of AI-generated crap. Farid published a study on “nepotistic” AI, where generative AI tools are trained on other AI-generated outputs, creating highly-distorted images: “Once poisoned, the models struggle to fully heal even after retraining on only real images,” his study found. “The slightly less kind word is inbreeding, which we didn’t feel we could use in a scientific paper,” Farid said. The other big problem is that, while more digitally literate people can tell that these are AI-generated images now, the technology is advancing so quickly that the typical artifacting and deformities seen in AI-generated images today could be gone tomorrow. “The images [being generated] are more and more photorealistic,” Farid said. “So we really are entering this era where you can just type and get a hyper photorealistic image. And if it's not true today will eventually be true that it will be devoid of obvious visual artifacts that the average person looking at would be able to discriminate.” “There’s something to be said for the fact that our ability to discriminate reality from fiction is important for a functioning society and democracy,” he added. “If every time you see a photo, you think it’s real because it’s a photo, that has consequences beyond the silliness we’re seeing here.” Penny said he thinks that studying these images might eventually give him the opposite problem: “20 years from now, I don’t know what it’s going to be like then, but I’m not going to believe a single thing anyone shows me on the internet ever again.” About the author Jason is a cofounder of 404 Media.

Any news site, or social media peddling news in disguise, will never stop showing you content. Even if that content is something you won&#x27;t like, and they know you won&#x27;t like it, but they must retain you at all costs. They simply let you scroll forever. When I&#x27;m done with the paper I move on with my day.- Newspapers are never written &#x27;for you&#x27;. The paper clearly writes for an audience but not me as an individual. Not everything I see will be because an Algorithm or someone in product believes this will drive N% more clicks or revenue from me. I can better understand my own biases.- Ads are obvious, clearly labeled, distinctly different from content, and often includes who paid for them. Ads are also not animated or obtrusive (if sometimes large), which if you turn off ad-block and go to any site these days is a jarring experience.

Serving scam adverts (and my YouTube and Google adverts appear to be substantially more scam than not) is Alphabet saying they care more about profit than anything else and they should, quite frankly, be punished for it, both through things like fines from advertising standards bodies, and by more people taking matters into their own hands by using Adblock. I personally would also vote for any politician who put laws into place to make executives personally liable if their platforms are found to not do enough to get and combat fraud and scams on their platforms, because these companies actively profit from these scams through advertisement revenue. reply taylodl 14 hours agorootparent> That is their problem, not yours or mine.Wrong - if Google can&#x27;t make the money they need on YouTube then it&#x27;s our problem.

With this go the horrors of emotional nationalism and a tendency to disbelieve in the existence of objective truth because all the facts have to fit in with the words and prophecies of some infallible fuhrer. Already history has in a sense ceased to exist, ie. there is no such thing as a history of our own times which could be universally accepted, and the exact sciences are endangered as soon as military necessity ceases to keep people up to the mark. Hitler can say that the Jews started the war, and if he survives that will become official history. He can’t say that two and two are five, because for the purposes of, say, ballistics they have to make four. But if the sort of world that I am afraid of arrives, a world of two or three great superstates which are unable to conquer one another, two and two could become five if the fuhrer wished it.

The article states:> The real German Shepherd carving was made by a UK-based professional chainsaw sculptor named Michael Jones, who detailed his work in a series of videos and photos posted over the course of the summer. Jones’ work has since been stolen and turned into endless variations.First of all, Jones&#x27;s work has not actually been \"stolen\". The output of his artistic process in this instance is a wooden carving of a German Shepherd. That carving has not been stolen. What has had actually happened is that a photograph of him posing next to his art has been used to generate other, similar images.The impact of this image generation and subsequent garbage posting on social media is, according to Jones, that he and his fellow carvers are \"missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work\" and that this is \"setting unrealistic expectations when it comes to creating chainsaw carving art or any art\".Personally, I am skeptical that exposure to people on Facebook whose appreciation for artistry consists of \"your a fantastic artist\" is worth very much. And what&#x27;s the counterfactual here? If these posters were not making these fake image memes, would that traffic be going to his posts instead? That seems far from certain.The second part of his complaint, that this sets \"unrealistic expectations\", is closer to the heart of the matter, I think. I don&#x27;t think qualified buyers of genuine art will pay less for real works of art because they&#x27;ve seen so many AI-generated artworks that they no longer have a realistic understanding of what real art looks like. I think they are, and will continue to be, educated and discerning enough to understand the difference, to appreciate process, and so on.I do think that people on Facebook who have seen increasingly fantastic \"wood carvings\" on Facebook may appreciate his genuine wood carving photographs less in the future.

Masimo is a decades-old medical equipment company, with several developments and patents for non-invasive PPG. Apple is obviously well-aware of their developments, and was in touch with them already in 2013, more than a year before the launch of the Apple Watch.From the actual lawsuit filed by Masimo in 2020 [1]:\"In 2013, Apple contacted Masimo and asked to meet regarding a potential collaboration. Apple told Masimo that Apple would like to understand more about Masimo’s technology to potentially integrate that technology into Apple’s products. Apple and Masimo later entered into a confidentiality agreement, and Masimo’s management met with Apple. The meetings included confidential discussions of Masimo’s technology. After what seemed to Masimo to have been productive meetings, Apple quickly began trying to hire Masimo employees, including engineers and key management.\"[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fingfx.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;gfx&#x2F;legaldocs&#x2F;byvrlojrdve&#x2F;... reply oblio 2 hours agoparentIncredibly scummy. reply caslon 1 hour agorootparentWhy is it scummy?

A design patent is a form of legal protection granted to the ornamental design of an article of manufacture. Design patents are a type of industrial design right.Whether you think it is a valid design patent or not is a different question.

The case outlines how Apple met with them in 2013 to discuss collaboration. After that meeting, Apple apparently hired away several key-members of Masimo with knowledge about their non-invasive biometric monitoring tech, including their \"Chief Medical Officer and EVP for Medical Affairs\", who already joined Apple in that same year...The case claims violation of various patents for non-invasive blood data-collection via LEDs of specific wavelengths and photo-diodes in a specific geometry, patents to reduce power consumption of pulse oximeters as well as patents to detect when a pulse oximeter probe is misaligned on a patient.But most of all, they can demonstrate in the evolution of the Apple Watch how Apple launched their initial generation without such optimizations but found them to be necessary later-on, so it seems Masimo&#x27;s patents are not that obvious.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fingfx.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;gfx&#x2F;legaldocs&#x2F;zdvxdyorxvx&#x2F;... reply boxed 2 hours agorootparentOr maybe they are obvious, just that you don&#x27;t start a product with all possible optimizations.

Firstly, it’s patently obvious. The pulse ox technology in a transmissive mode is very old, and so is HRM in a reflective mode, and the only difference is in the subtleties of the engineering, none of which is reflected in the patent nor the claims. The second reason, relatedly, is the requirement for “replicability by a person of ordinary skill”. The patent reveals nothing that would enable someone to do that, and certainly doesn’t add anything to the ability of a skilled person to do so. The whole thing is just an idea, not an original one, and ideas are not supposed to be patentable. reply kurthr 3 hours agoparentI think the key here (similar to what happened to Blackberry-RIM which was sued by NTP) is that the ITC has stepped in before other courts or the Patent Office have had their final say. The argument being that Masimo would be harmed by the importation, while the ban will cost Apple $Billions. Rocket-dockets and the ITC are useful tools if you&#x27;re the plaintiff in getting a big settlement.NTP had it&#x27;s patents invalidated shortly after RIM settled for most of a $B, but it didn&#x27;t matter since BB couldn&#x27;t afford to have their email servers turned off. Apple probably can afford this.

Most patents contain in their claims only things that any competent professional could discover independently after a few hours of thinking about how to solve a problem.Other claims are for methods that have been known for a long time, but they were not applied for various reasons, e.g. of cost or efficiency, to the applications described in the patent. Then some unrelated technological progress happened, which may not be mentioned at all in the patent, which suddenly enabled the extension of the application domain of the old method, and then someone quickly filed a patent for the new combination of old methods.Other claims are far too general and cover all the ways that everyone could list about how to solve a problem, even if most of them are not practical at present and the inventor would not be able to demonstrate any functional implementation, but they are inserted in the patent claims for the case that someone will discover in the future a suitable technology, when it will become possible to claim that it infringes the patent.Many patents are just reformulations of much older patents, from decades ago, perhaps filed in other countries, but they use such an obfuscated language that it is difficult to determine that in fact the different patents claim the same things.I have read many patents, but the most recent they are, the less likely it is to find in them anything that I consider innovative or that would justify in any way to consider the patent as valid.Nevertheless, few individuals or companies would be able to bear the expenses and risks of trying to invalidate patents, so there are many examples when inferior technologies have been used for decades in order to circumvent bogus patents.Moreover, the days when most patent owners used the patents as a direct source of revenue are long in the past. Today few patent owners are willing to license them at fair and non-discriminatory prices. Most use the patents only as a means to prevent competition. reply jojobas 1 hour agorootparent>The main problem is that today patents are granted far too easily.Currently in the US, for better or worse, actual scrutiny happens when you try to claim infringement, not at application.>Other claims are far too general and cover all the ways that everyone could list about how to solve a problem,This is covered by the non-obvious clause.>Today few patent owners are willing to license them at fair and non-discriminatory prices.Plain wrong. reply prng2021 5 hours agorootparentprev“We’re all just memetic LLMs, remixing stuff with mildly differing levels of variance.”Einstein upended every other human beings notion of space and time. Copernicus also proposed something preposterous for his time. Would you say they just remixed stuff with mild variance? reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentCopernicus has only revived a theory first proposed millennia before him (in Ancient Greece), but initially rejected for insufficient evidence. Even for Copernicus, his theory was based more on faith than on evidence, because it became possible to measure the stellar parallaxes only much later.When Einstein published his theory of Special Relativity, it did not contain any fact or formula that had not already existed previously in the works of Lorentz, Poincaré and many others. It was just a new and original point of view about which is the meaning of those known relationships (i.e. that it is the speed of light which is constant in all reference systems, while other quantities are variable, instead of making other choices about which quantities are constant and which are variable).His contribution is actually very similar with that of Copernicus, who also did not provide any new fact or relationship, but just a new choice about which position should be considered constant, Sun&#x27;s or Earth&#x27;s. Both changes were very small compared with the existing knowledge, but they were very important for enabling further progress.Every progress is really incremental and it adds very little over the existing body of knowledge, even if the addition is essential for any further progress and for improving the practical applications. reply LadyCailin 3 hours agorootparentThis might be confirmation bias to a degree, because of something called “the adjacent possible”.

I could not find any information about the reason why Einstein has chosen to make this change in terminology.Before Einstein, \"tensor\" (a term introduced by Hamilton) was applied only to symmetric matrices (because general matrices can be decomposed into \"versors\", i.e. rotation matrices that rotate vectors and a \"tensor\", i.e. a symmetric matrix that stretches vectors).While Ricci has invented the concept of tensor, he has not used the word \"tensor\". Nevertheless, because Einstein&#x27;s theory had become extremely fashionable at the end of WWI, when Ricci&#x27;s work has been translated and published in USA, the American editor has introduced the word \"tensor\" everywhere in the book and they added on the covers that this is the book needed to understand Einstein&#x27;s tensor theory, in order to promote the sales of the book.Thus, Ricci&#x27;s calculus became known as tensor calculus, first in USA, then everywhere. reply cma 2 hours agorootparentHe didn&#x27;t specify general vs. special but there were lots of developments leading to special relativity too: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_special_relativit... reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentThose developments had no relationship whatsoever with the Ricci calculus that had been published a few years before, which was my point.When the General Relativity was developed in 1917, the Ricci calculus was no longer recent, but it was 17 years old.Therefore what the OP supposed, that there was an immediate causal relationship between these lines of work, is not true. replybamboozled 7 hours agoparentprevThis is why we need more AI, it makes it easier to never pay anyone royalties again, this in-turn will boost economic prosperity for all corporations. reply imoverclocked 6 hours agoprevI think we need a different form of patent.Current patents attempt to claim: this thing I figured out is novel and nobody else should copy me.Many times, they claim this so someone else can&#x27;t claim it and thus avoid arbitration.It would be nice if we could also file: this thing I figured out is not novel and is a natural progression to the current state-of-the-art.I guess the only means of doing this currently is to attempt to invalidate a patent?

As many other commenters pointed out, the fact that light through the skin can be used to measure biometrics is arguably \"obvious\" given that many people noticed it around the same time.

In this situation, the basic measurement method appears all over the place, like in cheap pulseoximeters. Sticking the same device in a wearable or other device isn&#x27;t a giant leap that deserves being defended via patent law to protect an \"inventor\".I&#x27;m sure patents have a place in the modern world, but I rarely see a case where they are being used as intended - more often than not, it&#x27;s as I said above : a measure of who from a bunch of peers who \"invented\" the same thing at the same time made their submission to a patent office first with the goal of squelching competition or building revenue streams via licensing.

The exact execution of “pardoning a corporation” is something that would require legal parsing, but it’s within presidential authority.> The Constitution establishes the President’s authority to grant clemency, encompassing not only pardons of individuals but several other forms of relief from criminal punishment as well.1 The power, which has historical roots in early English law,2 has been recognized by the Supreme Court as quite broad. In the 1886 case Ex parte Garland, the Court referred to the President’s authority to pardon as unlimited except in cases of impeachment, extending to every offence known to the law and able to be exercised either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.3 Much later, the Court wrote that the broad power conferred in the Constitution gives the President plenary authority to &#x27;forgive’ [a] convicted person in part or entirely, to reduce a penalty in terms of a specified number of years, or to alter it with certain conditions.4Despite the breadth of the President’s authority under the Pardon Clause, the Constitution’s text provides for at least two limits on the power: first, clemency may only be granted for Offenses against the United States,5 meaning that state criminal offenses and federal or state civil claims are not covered.6 Second, the President’s clemency authority cannot be used in Cases of impeachment.7Beyond textual limits, certain external constitutional and legal considerations may act as constraints on the power. For instance, the Court has indicated that the power may be exercised at any time after [an offense’s] commission,8 reflecting that the President may not preemptively immunize future criminal conduct. In Schick v. Reed, the Court recognized that an exercise of clemency may include any condition which does not otherwise offend the Constitution,9 suggesting that the President may not make clemency subject to a condition that is prohibited by another constitutional provision.10 Other apparent limitations include not affecting vested rights of third parties, such as where forfeited property is sold,11 or proceeds paid into the treasury, which can only be secured to the former owner . . . through an act of [C]ongress.12 The Court in The Laura also alluded to an exception for fines . . . imposed by a co-ordinate department of the government for contempt of its authority,13 though a later case recognized that the President may pardon one who is subject to criminal punishment for contempt of court.14Assuming the recognized limitations are not transgressed, a full pardon granted by the President and accepted by its subject15 prevents or removes any of the penalties and disabilities consequent upon conviction . . . .16 In several nineteenth-century cases, the Supreme Court suggested that a pardon broadly obviates all legal guilt of the offender, effectively erasing the crime from existence.17 Subsequent cases appear to have backed away from this understanding,18 suggesting instead that, although a full pardon precludes punishment for the offense in question, a prior and pardoned offense may still be considered in subsequent proceedings.19https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitution.congress.gov&#x2F;browse&#x2F;essay&#x2F;artII-S2-C1-3...Do bear in mind that I am not an attorney and this is my personal opinion. reply simion314 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the quality comment. reply 105 more comments...
