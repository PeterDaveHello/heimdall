    "content": "Saurabh \ud83d\ude0eAdvanced macOS Command-Line ToolsmacOS is fortunate to have access to the huge arsenal of standard Unix tools. There are also a good number of macOS-specific command-line utilities that provide unique macOS functionality. To view the full documentation for any of these commands, run man <command>.caffeinate - set Mac sleep behaviorRunning caffeinate with no flags or arguments prevents your Mac from going to sleep as long as the command continues to run.caffeinate -u -t <seconds> prevents sleep for the specified number of seconds.Adding the -d flag also prevents the display from going to sleep.Specifying an existing process with -w <pid> automatically exits the caffeinate command once the specified process exits.Passing a command with caffeinate <command> starts the given command in a new process and prevents sleep until that process exits.pbcopy, pbpaste - interact with system clipboard<command> | pbcopy copies the output of the command to the clipboard.pbpaste outputs the contents of the clipboard to stdout.networkQuality - measure Internet speedRun networkQuality to run an Internet speed test from your Mac.Add the -v flag to view more detailed information.Use the -i flag to run the network test on a specific network interface.sips - image manipulationsips -z <height> <width> <image> resizes the specified image, ignoring the previous aspect ratio.sips -Z <size> <image> resizes the largest side of the specified image, preserving the aspect ratio.sips -c <height> <width> <image> crops the specified image to the given dimensions (relative to the center of the original image).sips -r <degrees> <image> rotates the image by the specified degrees.By default, sips will destructively overwrite the input image. Use the -o flag to specify a different output file path (which must have the same file extension as the input image).open - open files and applicationsopen -a <app> <file> opens the given file with the specified application.open . opens the current directory in a new Finder window.textutil - document file convertertextutil can convert files to and from Microsoft Word, plain text, rich text, and HTML formats.textutil -convert html journal.doc converts journal.doc into journal.html.The possible values for -convert are: txt, html, rtf, rtfd, doc, docx.mdfind, mdls - search with Spotlightmdfind <query> performs a keyword-based Spotlight search with the given query.mdfind kMDItemAppStoreHasReceipt=1 finds all apps installed from the Mac App Store.mdfind -name <name> searches for all files matching the given name.The -onlyin <dir> flag restricts the search to the given directory.mdls <file-path> prints all Spotlight metadata associated with the given file.screencapture - take screenshotsscreencapture -c takes a screenshot and copies it to the clipboard.screencapture <file> takes a screenshot and saves it to the given file.Add the -T <seconds> flag to take the screenshot after the given delay in seconds.taskpolicy - control scheduling of processestaskpolicy -b <command> starts executing the given command in the background. On Apple silicon Macs, the process will only run on the efficiency cores.taskpolicy -b -p <pid> downgrades an existing process to run in the background.taskpolicy -B -p <pid> removes the specified process from running in the background. On Apple silicon Macs, the process may now run on the efficiency or performance cores. Note that this only works on processes that have been downgraded to the background, and not processes that started in the background.taskpolicy -s <command> starts the given command in the suspended state. This is useful to allow a debugger to attach to the process right at the start of execution.say - text-to-speech enginesay <message> announces the given message.say -f input.txt -o output.aiff creates an audiobook from the given text file.pmset - configure power managementpmset -g prints all available power configuration information.pmset -g assertions displays information about power-related assertions made by other processes. This can be useful for finding a process that is preventing your Mac from going to sleep.pmset -g thermlog displays information about any processes that have been throttled (useful when running benchmarks).pmset displaysleepnow immediately puts the display to sleep without putting the rest of the system to sleep.pmset sleepnow immediately puts the entire system to sleep.networksetup - configure network settingsnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder prints a list of available network services.networksetup -getinfo <networkservice> prints information about the specified network service.networksetup -getdnsservers <networkservice> prints the DNS servers for the specified network service.networksetup -setairportnetwork <device> <network> [password] joins the specified Wi-Fi network. (In most cases, the <device> argument should be \"en0\".)qlmanage - manage Quick Lookqlmanage -p <file> opens a Quick Look preview window of the given file.qlmanage -m prints status information about the Quick Look server process.qlmanage -r restarts the Quick Look server process.qlmanage -r cache resets the Quick Look thumbnail cache.softwareupdate - manage OS updatessoftwareupdate --list prints out available software updates.sudo softwareupdate -ia installs all available updates.softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version <version> tries to download the full installer of the specified macOS version to /Applications.system_profiler - view system informationsystem_profiler by default prints all available system information, which is usually overwhelming.system_profiler <datatype> only prints information about the given sub-system.system_profiler -listDataTypes lists all available sub-systems to get information from.Some particularly useful ones:system_profiler SPHardwareDataType prints an overview of the hardware of the current machine, including its model name and serial number.system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType prints an overview of the software of the current machine, including the exact macOS version number.system_profiler SPPowerDataType prints power and battery information, including the current AC wattage and battery cycle count.system_profiler SPDeveloperToolsDataType prints the currently active version of the Xcode developer tools and SDK.",

Ne6+ if it's a check. Ne6# if it's mate.)Spaces are also allowed so feel free to break up parts of the password to separate things and prevent them from interfering with each other.Use XXXV as the roman numeral. Easiest to work with since only V (23) is an element.Reroll your color if its hex has any numbers in it. You'll thank me later.I made it to the final challenge (password must contain the current time) and it became extremely difficult because the current time, the length of the password itself, and a pesky 9 that was in my youtube URL were just too much to add up to 25 (even though I tried to overlap things, like 3:383 to cover 3:38 current time as well as 383 prime password length).

Many of them are turned into food trucks, as their size and boxy shape are perfect for mobile kitchens. However, FedEx is facing a lawsuit for selling such vans, as it's being accused of the largest odometer rollback fraud in history.The lawsuit accuses FedEx of replacing the odometers in many of its vans with new ones that read zero miles, using the vans for a bit longer after that, and then selling them at auction with 100,000 miles or less on the new odometers. With such low indicated mileage, business owners were buying the vans for top dollar, thinking that there were still pretty fresh. However, their real mileage was sometimes as much as four times the odometer readout, thus leading to countless mechanical issues that would cost the customers far more money. In some cases, the issues would be so severe, the vans were useless and businesses went bust.According to KTNV Las Vegas, Tom Layton of Henderson, Nevada first noticed FedEx's odometer rollbacks in 2017. Layton, who's been buying and selling trucks and vans for 36 years, bought a FedEx Freightliner truck with around 180,000 indicated miles. When he sold the truck, his buyer hooked it up to a computer that told them the real mileage was around 400,000 miles. Layton filed his own lawsuit back then, which is separate from the class-action lawsuit FedEx is currently facing.Since then, customers from California, Tennessee, New Jersey, Florida, and Virginia have all noticed odometer rollbacks on former FedEx vehicles.Freightliner MT45 | via Getty ImagesFedEx didn't always sell its retired vans. Once they hit about 350,000 miles, they would usually scrap the vans. It wasn't until 2011 that FedEx started auctioning old vans off through its fleet company, Holman Fleet Leasing (also a defendant in the lawsuit). The lawsuit alleges that both FedEx and Holman intentionally replaced the odometers to artificially inflate the values of the vans, so they'd sell for higher prices at various auctions throughout the United States. Then, according to the accusations, both companies would split the profits.\"FedEx, with the knowledge and assistance of Holman, replaced thousands of odometers on FedEx/Holman Vehicles,\" the lawsuit states. \"Though odometers, as automotive components, do occasionally wear out or malfunction and need to be replaced, there was no valid reason for this large-scale replacement of the odometers on FedEx/Holman Vehicles, other than to perpetuate their agreement to commit odometer fraud.\"It isn't illegal to replace odometers and it isn't even illegal to sell vehicles with odometers that have inaccurate mileage readouts. However, to do so, a disclaimer needs to be made by the seller, indicating to the buyer that its mileage readout is inaccurate and that the odometer was replaced. According to the lawsuit, neither FedEx nor Holman did that.\"Defendants purposely failed or refused to attach such a warning because they intended to mislead potential buyers of the vehicles.\"However, FedEx denies the allegations. \u201cWe are aware of the allegations made in the complaint and will vigorously defend the lawsuit,\u201d a FedEx representative told Spectrum News.The Drive reached out to FedEx for a comment and will update this statement if we get one.show_multidocs-1.pdfDOWNLOADGot tips?

To find out more, read our privacy policy.Accept & CloseMonitors & KitsCustom SolutionsOpen AirGradientSupportResearchShopThe Hidden Cost of Air Quality Monitoringby Achim HaugOver the last few months, one of the largest air quality monitoring manufacturer in the world has increasingly crippled their free data plan to the point that their free API does basically no longer work and forces people to upgrade to a paid plan. This has been done in a very opaque way creating confusion for their customers.Unfortunately we do observe this worrying trend among a number of manufacturers in the industry and want to highlight the various invisible costs of owning an air quality monitor. Often customers believe that the costs of an air quality monitor are only two parts, the initial hardware costs and possibly a subscription to the data platform. However there are a number of ways that some monitor manufacturers deploy to increase your costs of ownership considerably which I will highlight in the following.Proprietory Sensor ModulesNearly all of the air quality monitors in the price range up to around USD 1000 use of-the-shelf sensor modules from companies like SenseAir, Plantower and Sensirion. These sensor modules (in higher quantities) typically cost between USD 2 and USD 15. Some of these modules have a limited lifetime and need to be replaced every 2-3 years. Although it would be very easy to replace these modules directly, a number of companies are now packaging these modules into small proprietary cartridges and are selling these for up to ten times the underlying module cost. Thus preventing the customers from sourcing the same module much cheaper. Furthermore, their dashboard will display a message to purchase replacement cartridges often when these modules are still very accurate and could be used for a much longer time.Ecosystem Lock InIt appears that some sensor manufacturers have a strong desire to force people into subscriptions and this is sometimes even a metric mentioned in their annual reports. The problem is that this will lead directly to a lock-in into the manufacturers ecosystem and these companies have no intention to allow the monitor to directly send data to another server, e.g. home assistant through MQTT. Sometimes this even leads to totally functioning monitors being sunsetted because the company does not want to support an older API anymore.Life-time of the Monitor and RepairabilityIt is very easy to design an air quality monitor for repairability and a long life. We know this because we designed our monitor AirGradient ONE and our open source DIY kits with exactly this paradigm. However, even though a long life time of products is really beneficial for our planet and the owners of the monitors, it might not maximize the profit of companies (at least in the short term). So unfortunately many air quality monitors break after only a few years of service and are often difficult or even impossible to repair because the manufacturers think it\u2019s not in their interest.Data OwnershipAir quality data - especially outdoor data - can be monetized in different ways. Some companies sell air quality data to governments or make them available as (paid) API e.g. for weather apps. Others use the data in their online pollution maps to advertise their own products. The terms and conditions of who actually owns the air quality data from your sensor are often vague. It is quite paradox that one of the most popular outdoor air quality sensor for citizen science projects has actually in their T&Cs that you do NOT own the very data you collect. Unfortunately, many customers do not read the terms and conditions and are not aware of this. We strongly believe that air quality data should belong to the ones who own the monitors and not the manufacturer. We also strongly encourage people to share their outdoor air quality data with the public through open data repositories like openAQ.Leading By ExampleBeing a self-funded startup, we are not dependent on VCs pushing for maximum growth and profitability but can set our own priorities. The small team behind AirGradient has a strong belief that we do the right thing by focusing on sustainability and honesty to our customers and we do hope that this will pay off over the long run. We also really enjoy the great community that is growing day by day and supporting us and our open source, open hardware air quality monitors. We do hope we can set an example that other monitor manufacturers will follow.The Questions You Should AskNow in case you are in search for a new air quality monitor, here is a list of questions you should ask to get a better understanding of the issues I mentioned above:Do you have a subscription free way to send data directly to my own servers, eg. To home assistant via MQTT?Do I, as the owner of the monitor, have the full ownership of the data that I collect?Do you monetize the data that I provide to your platform?Do you share the air quality data with a public non-profit repository like openAQ for common good?Is your monitor easy to repair? Do you have a maintenance / repair manual?Do you offer spare parts for the monitor? At what cost and for how long?Drop us a line and let us know your experiences with air quality monitors!AirGradient DIY Air Quality KitsBuild your own open source air quality sensor measuring PM2.5, CO2, TVOC, Temperature and Humidity.

Almost every expedition uncovers something new.THE HADAL ZONEHADAL AMPHIPODMany probes and submarines have been lost trying to reach the deepest parts of the ocean.On January 23rd, 1960, about 9 years before the moon landing, humans went where they never had before.Two men, Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, onboard the submarine Trieste slowly descended into the Mariana Trench.Their goal was to reach The Challenger Deep - the deepest point in the ocean.The submarine used a re-breather system that would later be used in spacecraft. There was barely enough space inside the pressure sphere for both of them.The immense pressure of the deep sea means any mistake would mean certain death.During the descent, one of the window panes cracked and shook the entire vessel.Nevertheless, they continued.Even at these unfathomable depths, Jacques and Don could still see life out the window.

Why?! What revolutionary pressure selected for the ability to dive hundreds of meters underwater from the surface or close to it, presumably to where food is more scarce? Is it easier to hunt down there? Less competition from less highly adapted animals? It seems like such an extreme adaptation that you have to presume it predates our modern familiar species of penguins, pinnipeds and cetacea.replykuhewa 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The deep scattering layer which is made up of various organisms from planktonic to laternfish and larger squid undergoes a diel vertical migration from near the surface at night to well into the mesopelagic zone (200-1000m) during the day, and while the ultimate driver involves illuminance, the evolutionary pressures are complex and involve bottom up and top down forcing (e.g. following food or avoiding predators).Higher trophic level predators have adapted to bounce dive or undergo their own DVM to match and have to deal with cold, low oxygen (although hypoxia can be ecologically limiting in some areas), but the pressure, which isn't that big of a deal especially if you have limited air spaces.Once you can dive to 600-1000 m the pressure differential is not that much greater to go a bit deeper compared to at shallower depths (relative difference between 800-1600 m is the same as 0-10m).There appear to be other functional behaviours besides foraging that push the physiological limits of these animals, for example the webpage has the typical daytime depths of swordfish of 550m which is accurate and they will stay there from dawn to dusk typically, but very rarely they will bounce dive 1000m - 1400m+. Possibly, although not confirmed, related to the need to calibrate navigational faculties.replydarkerside 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]As a thought exercise, what evolutionary pressure drove deep sea creatures to make the tremendous effort required to leave the depths of the ocean in the first place?replykrylon 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This would be even better if you could click on the various creatures you encounter to get their Wikipedia articles.That said, this is pretty cool.

I could feel the pressure even there.I also went snorkeling in Hawaii once in cove that had deep areas easily over 10m. Even looking down at that depth could be disorienting and anxiety-inducing.A hundred meters is technical SCUBA diving depth. A few hundred meters is where military subs hang out, and not much below.

How many pounds per square inch would be applied here? Is the pressure a danger for submersibles because of the pressure differential rather than the pressure itself?replygostsamo 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If the ship hulk is full of water, the pressure is on both sides. Worst that can happen to such a material is to be compressed, but metal is okay in that regard.replygiantrobot 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Pressure differential is definitely one of the bigger problems. In a manned submersible the interior pressure is usually roughly sea level. So you've got hundreds of atmospheres on the outside vs one of the inside. Anything that requires some pressure differential requires a strong pressure vessel. So not just the crew compartment but also camera housing and the like.This is all compounded by the fact the deep ocean is very cold so as a submersible descends there's a thermal gradient with \"survivable\" on the inside and sun-zero on the outside. Temperature differentials interact with the pressures because the atmospheric pressure and low temperature will both cause material to compress/contract. The whole vessel structure needs to be able to remain structurally sound with all of that expansion and contraction.The submersible is also in salt water which corrodes different materials and can cause electrical shorts. A submersible could have a few successful missions then fail because some corrosion was missed on an inspection.Building a manned or unmanned device to travel to and return from an extreme environment is really hard. You need to understand or at least make educated guesses about the target environment, understand your building materials, your construction processes, validate and bench test as much as possible, and have the same amount of thought go into actual operations. \"Fuck it we'll do it live\" is not a recipe for success.replyramshanker 19 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]If life could exist 10km below the ocean, I have strong gut feeling, we will find life deep inside the Jupiter thick atmosphere.

While Earth seems super friendly today it was incredibly hostile when life formed. Early life on Earth were all what we'd consider extremophiles or at least extreme-adjacent.I'd bet (at least a small amount of money) that life, at least the most basic unicellular life, will pop up wherever the requisite materials exist in environments where they're not immediately destroyed but have enough external energy to facilitate some more energy intensive chemical reactions.Jupiter's atmosphere (to me) seems just as likely a place for life to form as the surface of Titan. It would be harder for us to find that life since the environment is so demanding compared to our level of technology. The surface of Titan or Europa are much easier exploration targets relative to Jupiter's atmosphere.replyandrewflnr 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I broadly agree on the timeline, but \"as soon as it had a non-lava surface\" is still plus/minus a couple hundred Mya. I do believe temperate conditions were a requirement. I doubt the first cell membranes, for instance, were terribly robust.replypfdietz 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Life in the deepest ocean requires considerable adaptation. For example, the proteins in your body would cease to function at that pressure, denatured to uselessness. The proteins the life has there are adapted to resist this. The organisms also have solutes, like trimethylamine, that help proteins maintain their structure. Many deep sea organisms are unpalatable because they contain such chemicals.Go to high enough pressure and the very polymers of life begin to break. It becomes energetically favorable for proteins to be decomposed to individual amino acids, due to their now exposed charged ends assisting in compressing water.replyliendolucas 20 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Fantastic, marine life is so amazing!

There are many online articles that go by the same tune: \u201cORMs are an anti-pattern. They are a toy for startups, but eventually hurt more than help.\u201dThis is an exaggeration. ORMs aren\u2019t bad. Are they perfect? Definitely not, just like anything else in software. At the same time, the criticisms are expected\u2014two years ago, I would\u2019ve agreed with that stereotyped headline wholeheartedly. I\u2019ve had my share of \u201cWhat do you mean the ORM ran the server out of memory?\u201d incidents.But in reality, ORMs are more misused than overused.Ironically, this \u201cORMs aren\u2019t that bad\u201d defense piece was inspired by a negative ORM incident we experienced at Lago that caused us to question our reliance on Active Record, the Ruby on Rails ORM. And a really tempting title for this post would\u2019ve been \u201cORMs kinda suck\u201d. But after some meditation on the matter, we\u2019ve reasoned that ORMs do not suck. They are simply an abstraction with a quintessential pro and con\u2014they abstract away some visibility and occasionally incur some performance hits. That\u2019s about it.Today, let\u2019s dive into ORMs, their common criticisms, and the ones that are compelling in today\u2019s context.A Tale of Two ParadigmsLet\u2019s start with an easy one: ORMs and databases follow two different paradigms.ORMs produce objects. (Duh! That\u2019s what the O stands for.) Objects are like directed graphs\u2014nodes that point to other nodes but not necessarily to each other. Conversely, database relational tables contain data that are always linked bidirectionally via shared keys, aka an undirected graph.Technically, ORMs can mimic undirected graphs by enforcing that pointers are bidirectional. Realistically, though, this isn\u2019t trivial to set up; many developers end up with a User object missing its Posts array or the Posts array entities lacking a backreference to the same User object (but potentially a clone).ORMs and relational databases operate under two different paradigms. For instance, an ORM might return a user\u2019s posts as an array, but not include backreferences to the user (as Author) for each post.This paradigm mismatch isn\u2019t a be-all and end-all, however. ORMs and relational databases are still just graphs; just databases have exclusively nondirectional edges. While this is a good academic criticism of ORMs, the real issues with ORMs are a bit more \u201cin the weeds\u201d.The broken principle(s)Before diving into the aforementioned \u201cweeds\u201d, let\u2019s touch on some more fundamental principles. A common complaint about ORMs is that they break two of the SOLID rules. If you aren\u2019t familiar with SOLID, it is an acronym for the principles that are taught in college classes about software design.SRPORMs violate SRP, the Society for Radiologi\u2014sorry, the Single Responsibility Principle. SRP dictates that a class should exist for one purpose and one purpose only. And, well, ORMs don\u2019t do that. Sure, at a high level, they do \u201call the database stuffs\u201d, but that\u2019s equivalent to creating a single class that does \u201call the app stuffs\u201d. JohnoTheCoder explained it best: ORMs (i) create classes that transact with the database, (ii) represent a record, and (iii) define relationships. I would even toss in that ORMs (iv) create and execute migrations.But if you\u2019re eye-rolling at this semantic criticism, you\u2019re not alone. I, too, believe this common argument against ORMs is very hand-wavy. After all, an ORM\u2019s job is to bridge the gap between two fundamentally different data paradigms; of course it\u2019ll break some principles.SOCSeparation of Concerns, or SOC, is of similar spirit to SRP, but at the application layer. Separation of Concerns dictates that an infrastructure component should be concerned with one thing, not multiple. And an ORM shifts database management from the backend to the database, violating SOC. But SOC is a bit of a silly principle in today\u2019s world. Nowadays, infrastructure components and coding patterns are combining tasks to achieve better performance (e.g., CPU aggregators within OLAP databases), lower latency (e.g., edge backend-frontends), and cleaner code (e.g., monorepos).The real problemsNow that we\u2019ve marathoned through the \u201cfake\u201d problem, let\u2019s discuss the real problems with ORMs. ORMs play things safe. They use a predictable, repeatable query system that isn\u2019t inherently optimized or visible. However, ORM developers are aware of this; they\u2019ve added a ton of features that partially address these issues, making big strides since Active Record\u2019s debut days.EfficiencyA common criticism of ORMs is that they\u2019re inefficient.This is mostly false. ORMs are far more efficient than most programmers believe. However, ORMs encourage poor practices because of how easy it is to rely on host language logic (i.e., JavaScript or Ruby) to combine data.For instance, take a look at this poorly optimized TypeORM code that uses JavaScript to expand data entries:const authorRepository = connection.getRepository(Author);const postRepository = connection.getRepository(Post);// Fetch all authors who belong to a certain companyconst authors = await authorRepository.find({ where: { company: 'Hooli' } });// Loop through each author and update their posts separatelyfor (let i = 0; i < authors.length; i++) { const posts = await postRepository.find({ where: { author: authors[i] } });  // Update each post separately for (let j = 0; j < posts.length; j++) {  posts[j].status = 'archived';  await postRepository.save(posts[j]); }}Instead, developers should use TypeORM\u2019s built-in features that construct a single query:const postRepository = connection.getRepository(Post);await postRepository .createQueryBuilder() .update(Post) .set({ status: 'archived' }) .where(\"authorId IN (SELECT id FROM author WHERE company = :company)\", { company: 'Hooli' }) .execute();A great example of this is the aforementioned Lago billing SQL refactor. Our issue with Active Record was visibility-related (discussed more in detail below). There was no performance difference between our ORM and raw SQL query analogs. Because we heavily used Active Record\u2019s data union features, our query was optimized as is:InvoiceSubscription   .joins('INNER JOIN subscriptions AS sub ON invoice_subscriptions.subscription_id = sub.id')   .joins('INNER JOIN customers AS cus ON sub.customer_id = cus.id')   .joins('INNER JOIN organizations AS org ON cus.organization_id = org.id')   .where(\"invoice_subscriptions.properties->>'timestamp' IS NOT NULL\")   .where(    \"DATE(#{Arel.sql(timestamp_condition)}) = DATE(#{today_shift_sql(customer: 'cus', organization: 'org')})\",    today,   )   .recurring   .group(:subscription_id)   .select('invoice_subscriptions.subscription_id, COUNT(invoice_subscriptions.id) AS invoiced_count')   .to_sqlwhich was replaced by this raw SQL rewrite:SELECT     invoice_subscriptions.subscription_id,     COUNT(invoice_subscriptions.id) AS invoiced_count    FROM invoice_subscriptions     INNER JOIN subscriptions AS sub ON invoice_subscriptions.subscription_id = sub.id     INNER JOIN customers AS cus ON sub.customer_id = cus.id     INNER JOIN organizations AS org ON cus.organization_id = org.id    WHERE invoice_subscriptions.recurring = 't'     AND invoice_subscriptions.properties->>'timestamp' IS NOT NULL     AND DATE(      (       -- TODO: A migration to unify type of the timestamp property must performed       CASE WHEN invoice_subscriptions.properties->>'timestamp' ~ '^[0-9\\.]+$'       THEN        -- Timestamp is stored as an integer        to_timestamp((invoice_subscriptions.properties->>'timestamp')::integer)::timestamptz       ELSE        -- Timestamp is stored as a string representing a datetime        (invoice_subscriptions.properties->>'timestamp')::timestamptz       END      )#{at_time_zone(customer: 'cus', organization: 'org')}     ) = DATE(:today#{at_time_zone(customer: 'cus', organization: 'org')})    GROUP BY invoice_subscriptions.subscription_idNow don\u2019t get me wrong, ORMs are not as efficient as raw SQL queries. They are often a bit more inefficient, and in some choice cases, very inefficient.The first issue is that ORMs sometimes incur massive computational overhead when converting queries into objects (TypeORM is a particular offender of this).The second issue is that ORMs sometimes make multiple roundtrips to a database by looping through a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship. This is known as the N+1 problem (1 original query + N subqueries). For instance, the following Prisma query will make a new database request for every single comment!{ users(take: 3) { id name posts(take: 3) {  id  text  comments(take: 5) {  id  text  } } }}N + 1 is a common problem that ORMs struggle with. However, it can often be handled by using data loaders that collapse queries into two queries instead of N + 1. Accordingly, like most other common ORM \u201cissues\u201d, N+1 scenarios can often be avoided by fully leveraging an ORMs feature set.VisibilityThe biggest issue with ORMs is visibility. Because ORMs are effectively query writers, they aren\u2019t the ultimate error dispatcher outside of obvious scenarios (such as incorrect primitive types). Rather, ORMs need to digest the returned SQL error and translate it to the user.Active Record struggles with this, and that\u2019s why we refactored our billing subscription query. Whenever we got results we didn\u2019t expect, we\u2019d have to inspect the rendered SQL query, rerun it, and then translate the SQL error into Active Record changes. This back-and-forth process undermined the original purpose of using Active Record, which was to avoid interfacing directly with the SQL database.Closing thoughtsORMs aren\u2019t a bad thing. When leveraged correctly, they could be nearly as efficient as raw SQL. Unfortunately, ORMs are often incorrectly leveraged. Developers might rely too much on host language logic structures to create data structures and not enough on the ORMs\u2019 native SQL analog features.However, ORMs do falter on visibility and debugging\u2014which is exactly what we faced at Lago. When a large query is giving developers trouble, shifting it to a raw SQL query may be a good investment. Thankfully, most ORMs allow you to execute a SQL query from within the ORM itself.Footer\u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.Footer navigationTermsPrivacySecurityStatusDocsContact GitHubPricingAPITrainingBlogAbout",

    "content": "IntroductionContainerization has transformed the world of software development and deployment. Docker \u2197\ufe0f, a leading containerization platform, leverages Linux namespaces, cgroups, and chroot to provide robust isolation, resource management, and security.In this hands-on guide, we\u2019ll skip the theory (go through the attached links above if you want to learn more about the mentioned topics) and jump straight into the practical implementation.\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fBefore we delve into building our own Docker-like environment using namespaces, cgroups, and chroot, it\u2019s important to clarify that this hands-on guide is not intended to replace docker and its functionality.Docker have features such as layered images, networking, container orchestration, and extensive tooling that make it a powerful and versatile solution for deploying applications.The purpose of this guide is to offer an educational exploration of the foundational technologies that form the core of Docker. By building a basic container environment from scratch, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how these underlying technologies work together to enable containerization.Let\u2019s build DockerStep 1: Setting Up the NamespaceTo create an isolated environment, we start by setting up a new namespace. We use the unshare command, specifying different namespaces (--uts, --pid, --net, --mount, and --ipc), which provide separate instances of system identifiers and resources for our container.unshare --uts --pid --net --mount --ipc --forkStep 2: Configuring the cgroupsCgroups (control groups) help manage resource allocation and control the usage of system resources by our containerized processes.We create a new cgroup for our container and assign CPU quota limits to restrict its resource usage.mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1echo 100000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1/cpu.cfs_quota_usecho 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1/tasksecho $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1/tasksOn the third line we write the value 0 to the tasks file within the /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1/ directory. The tasks file is used to control which processes are assigned to a particular cgroup.By writing 0 to this file, we are removing any previously assigned processes from the cgroup. This ensures that no processes are initially assigned to the container1 cgroup.On the fourth line we write the value of $$ to the tasks file within the /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container1/ directory.$$ is a special shell variable that represents the process ID (PID) of the current shell or script. By this, we are assigning the current process (the shell or script) to the container1 cgroup.This ensures that any subsequent child processes spawned by the shell or script will also be part of the container1 cgroup, and their resource usage will be subject to the specified CPU quota limits.Step 3: Building the Root File SystemTo create the file system for our container, we use debootstrap to set up a minimal Ubuntu environment within a directory named \"ubuntu-rootfs\". This serves as the root file system for our container.debootstrap focal ./ubuntu-rootfs http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/Step 4: Mounting and Chrooting into the ContainerWe mount essential file systems, such as /proc, /sys, and /dev, within our container\u2019s root file system. Then, we use the chroot command to change the root directory to our container\u2019s file system.mount -t proc none ./ubuntu-rootfs/procmount -t sysfs none ./ubuntu-rootfs/sysmount -o bind /dev ./ubuntu-rootfs/devchroot ./ubuntu-rootfs /bin/bashThe first command mounts the proc filesystem into the ./ubuntu-rootfs/proc directory. The proc filesystem provides information about processes and system resources in a virtual file format.Mounting the proc filesystem in the specified directory allows processes within the ./ubuntu-rootfs/ environment to access and interact with the system\u2019s process-related information.The next command mounts the sysfs filesystem into the ./ubuntu-rootfs/sys directory. The sysfs filesystem provides information about devices, drivers, and other kernel-related information in a hierarchical format.Mounting the sysfs filesystem in the specified directory enables processes within the ./ubuntu-rootfs/ environment to access and interact with system-related information exposed through the sysfs interface.Finally we bind the /dev directory to the ./ubuntu-rootfs/dev directory. The /dev directory contains device files that represent physical and virtual devices on the system.By binding the /dev directory to the ./ubuntu-rootfs/dev directory, any device files accessed within the ./ubuntu-rootfs/ environment will be redirected to the corresponding devices on the host system.This ensures that the processes running within the ./ubuntu-rootfs/ environment can interact with the necessary devices as if they were directly accessing them on the host system.Step 5: Running Applications within the ContainerNow that our container environment is set up, we can install and run applications within it. In this example, we install Nginx web server to demonstrate how applications behave within the container.(container) $ apt update(container) $ apt install nginx(container) $ service nginx startConclusionBy taking a hands-on approach and exploring the code and command examples, we\u2019ve gained a practical understanding of building our own Docker-like environment using Linux namespaces, cgroups, and chroot.Of course docker containerization is lot more than what we just explored above but these fundamentals empowers us to create isolated and efficient environments for our applications.",

But wouldn't it make more sense to do things \"bottom-up\"? i.e. starting from an empty filesystem, and then progressively adding the files that are absolutely necessary for the binary to work, instead of the \"top-down\" approach, which starts from a complete OS filesystem and then starts removing the things that are not needed?replypravus 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Why is it still necessary to have whole, full-blown OS filesystems inside of our containers, if their purpose is running a single binary?It's not. This is just the path of least resistance for most container builds since many applications require various supporting files to function properly. Most of my Go containers only contain 2 files: the go binary and ca certificates.> Dependencies/dynamic libraries are decent reason, sure. But wouldn't it make more sense to do things \"bottom-up\"?In theory, yes. With dynamic loading and support for loading plugins and runtime this is virtually impossible to do. That's why starting from a base image that already includes everything you need is generally the chosen method. BSD jails/chroot operate this way and it's an absolute pain to setup for complicated applications.replydb48x 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It\u2019s not. You you can use systemd-nspawn to create a container that uses your own root filesystem by specifying --directory=/ --volatile=yes. This mounts a tmpfs into the container\u2019s root, and then mounts your /usr into the container\u2019s /usr in read\u2013only mode. This allows the container to run all the software installed on your machine, while redirecting writes to the tmpfs.Alternatively, instead of --directory=/ you could specify some other directory that contains an OS image (such as --directory=/var/lib/machines/debian-bookworm or --directory=/var/lib/machines/fedora-38). Multiple containers can transparently share the same image, since all the writes go to a per\u2013container tmpfs.https://0pointer.net/blog/running-an-container-off-the-host-...replyjeroenhd 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's an interesting way to use systemd-nspawn!But, if it mounts everything, wouldn't that also make container escapes very easy?replydb48x 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]When it is volatile, it really only mounts the /usr inside the specified directory, rather than the directory itself. In particular, /dev and /etc will be empty.replymindwok 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This isn\u2019t too far from how most containers are built nowadays. Usually you just use Alpine or slim Debian images. The benefit of using those distro images is that they provide a lot of utilities you might want in a container, like a shell.As an aside, the approach you described is how Nix works, and you can use Nix to produce OCI images.replyiso1631 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The benefit of using those distro images is that they provide a lot of utilities you might want in a container, like a shell.Why would you want a shell in a container? Surely the idea of a container is to run a program, not act as interactive environment.replygiobox 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]\"docker exec -it\" debugging/troubleshooting. It's generally harder to debug/troubleshoot random issues if there is no shell in the container, and you can get a working shell in a 10mb container image so not like it adds some dramatic inconvenience or size. Sure its not 100 percent necessary, but it's enormously convenient at times and I personally wouldn't build my own container images without a shell I can drop into usually, unless there are technical or security reasons to avoid doing it for the given application.The shell can also be useful for certain scripting steps during image build, not all containers are just going to copy in a statically compiled binary etc. In fact, I'd say the latter is significantly rarer than the former, at least in my experience.Being able to do commands like:$ docker exec -it mycontainer shis generally very helpful during development.> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/replytracker1 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Depends on the application. If it's a single, stand-alone application meant to run in a bare container, sure. But many applications are more complicated, or have been shimmed into a container, but generally run on a given Linux system. Diagnostics and debugging inside the running container kind of requires some level of shell and interactivity. Alpine and Debian-slim images usually have enough for this purpose. If you can navigate the file system and list files at the very least, you can exfiltrate data as needed relatively easily though.replykroolik 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Troubleshooting inside the container or simple scripting.replythe-alchemist 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Like others have said, for debugging, although the proper-but-rarely-done solution is to use PID namespaces to attach another container containing the shell, rather than including it in the raw Docker image.replyleodag 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's not necessarily interactive, it's also pretty common to have a shell script for initialization/setup.replyrolisz 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]To debug stuff.replyraesene9 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There's plenty of ways to build small container images that don't start with a \"full\" distribution, but whether they work for specific use cases will depend on what the applications need.FROM Scratch - starts with a totally blank image, this is the smallest option but your application must work with no supporting files (e.g. statically compiled binaries).Distroless - has a small number of standard OS support files but no package manager, so works where you don't need to install many OS packages.Wolfi - Newer than the others, they're building an ecosystem of minimal images for specific purposes.replyRandomBK 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]And let's not forget Alpine, which is a fairly common minimalist distro clocking in a ~5MBreplyimiric 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> The fact that containers are such a simple technologyBut they're really not. This is a common misconception because of the user friendliness of Docker, but underneath all that there are many moving parts that the Linux kernel exposes, which are tricky to manage manually, and additional features of Docker itself (Dockerfile, layered images, distribution, etc.). Sure, you can write a shell script that does a tiny fraction of what container tools do, but then you'd have a half-baked solution that reinvents the wheel because... it's lighterweight?What TFA is doing is fine if you want to learn how containers work and impress your colleagues, but for real world usage, stick to the established tooling.Like others mentioned, there are ways to do what you propose, and you can always create your own container tool based on that shell script that automates this :). Though you might be interested in unikernels, which is an extreme version of that approach using VMs.replysnickerer 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Because building a sane filesystem with only the needed libraries needs knowledge and some effort, whereas containers exist to keep people from using their brains.If you know what you are doing you have several alternatives:1. Just link your binary statically.2. Set the path to the picked out special libs as an environment variable only for the binary.3. Re-think what's wrong with your system that leads to the pain of you wanting other lib versions for that binary.replytracker1 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]1. Statically linking your application, then distributing that application, such as via Docker Hub to others will then require your application to be GPL licensed in many, many cases within the Linux ecosystem. This may not be desired.2. You can absolutely limit the system libraries that are included to only those needed. Some platforms make this easier or harder than others.3. That you have other software that you want to run in parallel and don't want to spin up full virtualization or manage various chroot structures to organize.I'd also add that just because a tool makes it easy to do something, and means you can bloat your file system doesn't make it inherently bad. Not everyone is trying to run a large database on a potato.replytakeda 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If you use Nix that's pretty much how the container will be build. You specify that your app should be there and Nix, being aware of all dependencies will place inside everything needed.replyiopq 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Came to say this, in the case of sane things* Nix works perfectly* pip is not guaranteed to get you to a working state even if you run the same commands, so don't even think about itreplyaliasxneo 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> will place inside everything neededAnd more. In my experience, depending on the quality of the packages you happen to be consuming, you may end up with a container twice as large as a comparable (say, Alpine) container. For example, I once tried to bring git into my Nix container and was surprised to see over 300MB in increased size.After having built Nix containers exclusively for a year now, I wouldn't really recommend it to others unless you're willing to invest a lot of additional time cleaning up community packages.replytakeda 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's because by default Nix uses glibc (which is huge), while Alpine uses musl. You can create musl binaries, but you need to know Nix a little more and know how to cross compile.Another great thing is that you can can easily modify existing package to remove some of their dependencies that you don't use.This is shown here with packaging redis into a container here and making it 3x smaller than the alpine version: https://nixos.org/#asciinema-demo-coverThere's of course possibility that someone specified build dependency as a runtime dependency, but if that was done that's a bug.replykodah 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Docker came about when lxc was the container interface on Linux. It's hardly user friendly. Doing everything yourself is possible, but again is really only user friendly for very simple operations. For instance, most users would probably find network name spacing or even uid/gid mapping pretty confusing. These days the images produced are quite different in that Docker now produces OCI compatible images, which makes them run anywhere. lxc on the other hand will produce images that run only on Linux. lxd eventually came around which is a lot more analogous to Docker as an application and outputs OCI compatible images.replyianlevesque 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I\u2019m confused. If OCI images run anywhere, why does Docker Desktop for windows and mac run virtual machines with a Linux kernel behind the scenes?replykodah 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Containers are a feature of the Linux Kernel as is namespacing, so non-linuxes will always need a VM to run Linux containers.lxc really only covers starting a process as a container with some basic configuration. Later on Docker developed libcontainer which gave it interaction with other namespacing technologies like IPC, network, etc. The interfaces with these other namespacing technologies are not the same across linuxes which is what I mean by \"run anywhere\".replyflaminHotSpeedo 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]OCI defines a spec for container images.Both the Linux and Windows kernels support containers, but the way containers work is by running on the parent kernel (as opposed to traditional/micro VM's or unikernels).So if you want to run a Linux container on windows you need a VM running the Linux kernel to provide the host kernel for the container.The same would be true even on Linux if you needed to use a different kernel for the container than what the parent system is runningreplyjeroenhd 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Most container images contain binaries that were made to use Linux syscalls for things like I/O and memory management.Windows had an implementation of the Linux kernel interface for this exact purpose (WSL 1) but because of performance and compatibility challenges, they switched to plain virtual machines.These days, virtual machine run with almost 0 overhead anyway, so if you want to run a Linux binary they're a much simpler option than implementing a whole operating system.replytracker1 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]True enough... When I have been under Windows, a lot of things still run faster under WSL-Ubuntu than in Windows. Hyper-V is pretty nice, generally speaking, and the WSL tooling over it is pretty great. Makes having Windows as a host OS mostly tolerable. I used to joke that \"WSL\" was my favorite linux distro.I switched at home FT when I saw ads in my start menu search results that first time. The Edge nags weren't enough, the pre-installed games, etc. But an ad before what I was looking for on my local system, that was too far. I realize it was only a \"test\" feature, but even that someone wanted to test such a thing sickens me.I've still had to sometimes run under Windows at work. I prefer the M1/M2 macs now, just for silence and battery life, but they don't run Docker nearly as well, at least most of the x86_64 container issues are resolved, and most of what I touch has aarch64 targets.replyadamgordonbell 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's fun the play around with going that way. I did via chroot, and using ldd to see what a program like redis needs copied in[1]. But eventually you might want to get a shell into the little environment, and then page thru logs from inside it, and so eventually, unless you are going pure from-scratch, statically linked, you might want something like alpine in there.

    "content": "LLM Powered Autonomous AgentsJune 23, 2023 \u00b7 29 min \u00b7 Lilian WengTable of ContentsBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.Agent System OverviewIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several key components:PlanningSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.MemoryShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.Tool useThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.Component One: PlanningA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.Task DecompositionChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.Self-ReflectionSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.ReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.The ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:Thought: ...Action: ...Observation: ...... (Repeated many times)Fig. 2. Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).In both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step is removed.Reflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each actionat, the agent computes a heuristichtand optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection ofDh={(x,yi,ri,zi)}i=1n, wherexis the prompt, eachyiis a model completion,riis the human rating ofyi, andziis the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward,rn\u2265rn\u22121\u2265\u22ef\u2265r1The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of\u03c4h=(x,zi,yi,zj,yj,\u2026,zn,yn), where\u2264i\u2264j\u2264n. The model is finetuned to only predictynwhere conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.The training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.Fig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)The idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).The paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.In reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.Fig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)Component Two: Memory(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)Types of MemoryMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.Sensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).Implicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.Fig. 8. Categorization of human memory.We can roughly consider the following mappings:Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;Short-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.Long-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)The external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span. A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.A couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data pointxitox~isuch that the inner product\u27e8q,xi\u27e9is as similar to the original distance of\u2220q,x~ias possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.Fig. 9. Categorization of human memory.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.Fig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)MRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for \u201cModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201d, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of \u201cexpert\u201d modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.Both TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the \u201cExternal APIs\u201d section of Prompt Engineering.ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).HuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.Fig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)The system comprises of 4 stages:(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.Instruction:The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.Instruction:Given the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.Instruction:With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.To put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.API-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.Fig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)In the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:Whether an API call is needed.Identify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).Response based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.This benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:Level-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.Level-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.Level-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.Case StudiesScientific Discovery AgentChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.Boiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.For example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;selected a target;requested a scaffold targeting these compounds;Once the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.They also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.Generative Agents SimulationGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.Memory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents' experience in natural language.Each element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent. - Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.Retrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.Recency: recent events have higher scoresImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.Relevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.Reflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)Prompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.Planning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actionsPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.Prompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)Relationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.Environment information is present in a tree structure.Fig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)This fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).Proof-of-Concept ExamplesAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.Here is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:You are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.Reliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.CitationCited as:Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered Autonomous Agents\".

You won't have a good developer pipeline without it. Other engineering disciplines should strive for something similar. Doesn't mean there cannot be closed source software of course.At least for image synthesis, I believe the open models just plainly produce far better results by now since training is crowdsourced.replyjillesvangurp 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Without getting too hung up on the semantics, what matters here is a free exchange of ideas, algorithms, and indeed some code. All this has massively accelerated progress in this space in the last two decades. Instead of sitting on their results, jealously guarding their secret sauce, etc. companies are sharing a lot of detail and are verifying each other's results by replicating them and improving on them. So OpenAI did chat gpt, Meta did llama, Google is doing Bard. Llama sort of got unleashed on the open source community and people are now starting to use that, improve it, benchmark against it with their own models, etc.replydemonshreder 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]In this case semantics do matter so to keep the improvements in the Software Commons as Commons. Weak / Permissive licenses will ensure that all the voluntarily contributed labour would be enclosed and profitable only to those who can hire an army of engineers. Strong licenses will ensure your call for a free exchange.replyjillesvangurp 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Depends. Overly open licenses can also motivate prevent people to not share things. Case in point here is some of the openai stuff where they shared enough so people can replicate their results but without giving away everything. People have been complaining that that's not open enough. But it's still better than them not sharing anything at all. That model certainly seems to be working well for them.Compare that with e.g. companies in China or elsewhere that are also working on AI that are perhaps sharing a bit less. That's a bit of a black hole in terms of information going in but not coming out. I think the more open people can get the better. But even some weaker licenses are better than nothing.Things are open enough currently for people to independently replicate each other's results. I think that's the important bit.replyanlsh 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Weird to see huggingface in the news like this.

Anything you ask Google is logged, and your search history can be subpoenaed, same as with any public library and the books you check out. OpenAI or whatever gatekeeper would assume that role and charge tolls.Do the same research with Vicuna-13B-ggml or whatever and nobody can sniff out what you're doing. Which sounds great for people who just want to jerk off and be left alone, but has terrifying implications for anybody tasked with stopping more-malicious users.Unfortunately nobody can ever compromise on these things. Best case would be adopting a law like the recent one in NL, where given probable cause the government can hack into your machine, but that won't happen. The only alternative in their favor is banning local models and open-source development of them altogether.replyvisarga 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That worked well in the past with crypto. /sPeople yearn for \"a room of their own\"[1], a sanctuary for contemplation and creativity. There was a time when our minds and pieces of paper were the only canvases for our imaginations, but increasingly our web browsers have morphed into thought surveillance systems. Now, the tide is turning back towards private creative spaces, enhanced by generative AI. Even if there are attempts to ban it, the edge now lies with private AI. In the future, we might even have the ability to run even more powerful models on standard hardware.Moreover, we must consider the defensive strategies against other AI entities that will soon permeate the internet. Operating much like a firewall, private AI models could safeguard users from external threats such as involuntary data breaches and misinformation.

Congress is embarrassed that social media got out of hand and is chomping at the bit to regulate AI. There was no disagreement at the testimony, the intentions of government and industry are aligned perfectly here - roll out the red carpet for centralized control, regulate competition out of existence.replymargarina72 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This sounds correct.

ChatGPT is one of the most well-marketed products of all time, and it frankly didn't achieve all that much. It scaled up current SOTA and put it behind a paywalled API, and the rest is history. It's like the fountain of youth, a dream API for most developers. Put something in, get something out. Whoever owns the endpoint just prints money.Everything after this point will just be habitually disappointing. Everything will be held to the impossibly high standard of the first time you tried ChatGPT, not the more realistic benchmarks of GPT-2, LLaMA, Bert, or even Talk-To-Transformer. I don't think it will be possible to recapture that magic, and Sam Altman was the first-mover on turning that awe into fear.replyjrm4 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Weird take; doesn't strike me as at all inevitable.

Agreed that they put it on the market at a time that made a splash and gave a lot of magical first impressions, but at this point the possibility of ever trusting these things is burned, if improved models manage to lie a little less, that won't be enough to actually integrate them into mission critical tasks.Instead of an oracle they released an improv comedian.
