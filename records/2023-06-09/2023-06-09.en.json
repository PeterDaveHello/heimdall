    "content": "Apollo, a Reddit app for iPhone, will shut down on June 30th due to the high cost of Reddit's recently announced API pricing. Reddit promised the pricing would be \"equitable and based in reality,\" but its price of $0.24 per 1,000 API calls is too high for third-party apps like Apollo, with Apollo's usage costing over $20 million a year. Reddit refused to consider buying out third-party apps like Apollo and instead accused Apollo of blackmailing and threatening Reddit for a $10 million payout. Some users have suggested increasing the price of Apollo, but existing subscribers have prepaid for a year, and with Reddit's sudden onset of monthly fees, it would be cheaper to refund users.The developer of third-party app Apollo discusses the challenges of migrating to Reddit's newly priced API, which has a 30-day timeline from announcement to billing. The sudden change in pricing and timeline has left many developers struggling to adjust. Although Reddit promised a fair and reasonable pricing structure, many developers do not believe the new prices are justified. The developer of Apollo has received no response from Reddit regarding suggestions for more time. Reddit's comparison to Twitter's third-party app pricing policies has been criticized by developers, who argue that it will kill third-party apps. Despite the challenges, the developer does not plan to sell the app or build a competitor. The developer supports the Reddit blackout and calls for more support from Reddit.Reddit is implementing changes that are causing outrage and frustration among third-party app developers, including Apollo, which is shutting down due to the new pricing structure. Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, disputed Reddit's claim that he refused to engage in discussions about the changes, and instead pointed out that Reddit itself was slow to provide information to developers. Selig expressed disappointment that his app would be shutting down, but also suggested that he will be fine due to his work on a separate app called Pixel Pals. A number of users have expressed their dismay at the loss of Apollo, which they regard as the best and most intuitive way to browse Reddit on an iOS device.Developers of the Apollo Reddit app have threatened to shut down their iOS app following a dispute with Reddit over its push notifications business. Reddit want Apollo to remove the app\u2019s notifications feature. Apollo says Reddit\u2019s issue is with \u201can entirely different company\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re bullying a small independent company.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt shows the gross incompetence of Reddit leadership that they\u2019ve let push notifications suffer so greatly,\u201d\u00a0say the developers. The dispute appears to have escalated after a Reddit employee claimed Apollo's developers had demanded $10m in blackmail. In response, Apollo appears to have posted evidence that the alleged comments were made three years previously in jest.",

    "hn_content": "The Reddit client Apollo is shutting down on June 30th. This is the end of an era for small indie client-only apps. With the availability of APIs for free or at a reasonable fee, many developers made a living selling alternate front ends for sites like Reddit and Twitter. These apps invented many of the conventions and designs that eventually percolated to the official clients. Meanwhile, the official Reddit and Twitter clients have always been subpar. Although third-party clients like Apollo provide a better user experience, first-party clients will never be able to compete because of misaligned incentives. The users are not the customers, advertisers are, with first-party clients. Decentralization could be a solution to this problem. The users need to find a new community if they want a better social media experience.The author discusses their positive experience using Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter. Mastodon has high-quality interactions and little annoying, trollish, or spammy content. The default feed is based on who you follow and when they post, without an algorithm trying to hold your attention. The author also touches on the decline of platforms like Facebook and Twitter and suggests that Reddit is on a similar path. The article includes various comments from users discussing the end of the golden era of small indie client-only apps and bad negotiation tactics between Apollo and Reddit.The CEO of Reddit claims that Apollo is costing the company $20 million per year, but the Apollo developer has offered to sell the app for half that price, highlighting the bogus nature of the $20 million price tag. However, it's unclear whether Apollo's users are worth the claimed $20 million in lost advertising revenue. Many users have expressed concerns about Reddit's management and policies, causing some to leave Reddit and look for alternative platforms. There is currently no credible alternative to Reddit, but some users are calling for decentralization and federation of social networks. The situation highlights the importance of accurately evaluating the value of users and properly communicating with developers.Christian Selig, the developer of popular Reddit app Apollo, has written about his decision to shut down the app in light of changes to the site's API. Selig said Reddit wanted him to pay $20m a year to use its API, a price point that rendered Apollo \"untenable\". Some forum posters criticised Selig for not launching his own site to compete with Reddit, while others backed his decision to leave the market. One tech journalist argued that Reddit's chief aim was to eliminate third-party apps, and that it had willingly created a deeply unworkable negotiation scenario.A developer named Christian from Reddit's third-party app Apollo has posted a transcript of a call with Reddit representatives discussing contractual terms for the use of Reddit's API. The post includes accusations of dishonesty on Reddit's part, as well as a supposed threat to Reddit of revealing user data to Apollo's users. Some have criticized Christian's negotiating skills, but the primary issues appear to concern Reddit's change in policy and subsequent actions against third-party developers. The case highlights the importance of clear communication and transparency in business relationships, as well as the tensions that can arise when third-party apps rely on the API of larger companies.Reddit is facing criticism after announcing changes to its API pricing that will result in third-party apps being charged an unspecified amount for every request made through it. One such app is Apollo, a mobile client for iOS that has threatened legal action because it links audio suggesting the platform's management of broke the law. Reddit has said the changes will help to improve the user experience, thanks in part to extra funding. However, moderators are concerned because they say the API is essential to manage content on their subreddits effectively. It is suggested that many have turned to third-party apps due to how clunky the official offering is in comparison.\nThe post discusses the toxicity on Reddit and reflects on the poster's relationship with the site, given the recent API changes that affected third-party apps. The toxicity of sub-communities on Reddit is noted, and mobile browsing on the old version of the site is compared to third-party apps. The conversation later shifts to the environmental impact of Patagonia and a discussion on the company's ethics ensues. The benefits that privately owned companies have for preserving morals are also discussed.Reddit is moving to shut down third-party apps such as Apollo, which have been using the API to access the platform. Some users argue that Reddit owes developers of these apps notification ahead of any changes or moves towards taking control. Although the argument that these third-party apps exploit Reddit's content and bandwidth and deserve to be taken down is also present, some believe that it is unreasonable for them to be taken down so abruptly, with inadequate notice for the developers to migrate to a different business model. The issue has sparked conversations about the possibility of alternative communities to Reddit popping up and the various tools and features available to help users engage with smaller, less commercial forums.Sorry, it is not possible to provide a summary for this raw text as it does not contain any meaningful content.",

    "hn_content": "Apple's iOS 17 is removing tracking parameters from links, although Private Click Measurement (PCM) allows advertisers to track ad campaign conversion metrics in Safari Private Browsing mode. PCM is a standard proposed and nearly standardized by Apple and worked with the W3C.\u00a0There is a competition between Google and Mozilla+Meta with competing standards. PCM enables advertisers to measure ad campaign conversion metrics without revealing individual user activity. Some people like the privacy measures Apple is adding, while others believe that Apple is merely consolidating all tracking power to themselves. Google, Mozilla, and Meta are working towards standardizing competing standards.\nApple added a PCM-like technology to give metrics on advertising programs, but this is separate from blocking ads and persona building. Browser vendors now work closely with standard groups to avoid relying on behavior that isn't stable when supporting specs and features. Apple's partnership with advertisers means that it controls users' identities and data, a bargaining chip that could disappear whenever Apple desires. Google collects data outside of Google-owned experiences, and Facebook's reaction was panic because it had no legitimate web-spying advertising product relationships, especially for non-users. Apple is taking the lead in security and privacy, unlike Google, Microsoft, and Facebook who not only sell but collect their users' data.Apple's \"Privacy Relay\" feature, aimed at protecting user privacy by converting all clicks in Safari into \"privately routed\" clicks, is criticized for being a potential anti-competitive and anti-consumer strategy. Some people argue that Privacy Relay doesn't offer real privacy since Apple can see users' messages in iCloud due to a lack of true end-to-end encryption for iMessage. Others speculate that Apple is slowly building an advertising ecosystem that is slightly less intrusive to users, but massively more lucrative for themselves. Additionally, Apple's policies that prohibit other browser engines for iOS limit real browser choice and inhibit the capability of web apps. Some people see Apple's move as a positive one, with users having given consent to kneecap advertising.Apple's new iOS 15 feature modifies links to prevent advertisers from tracking users through query parameters. This has caused a stir among advertisers who might turn to other tracking methods. Some experts argue encoding item IDs and tracking data could be a simple workaround. Facebook and Google have also introduced new methods of tracking users without using query parameters, such as Google's gbraids and wbraid. Several posters on Hacker News discuss whether Apple's action truly protects user privacy or simply drives more business towards their own App Store. Others point out that Android's alternative operating system, Google, is unlikely to follow Apple's lead on privacy measures.Apple is implementing a new feature in Safari that detects and removes user-identifiable tracking parameters in link URLs to protect privacy, leading to concerns about the potential destruction of the affiliate business model. Some users and businesses see this as necessary to prioritize privacy concerns and protect against tracking, while others criticize it as overreaching and potentially harmful to businesses that rely on tracking to make money. There are concerns about the accuracy of the heuristics used to identify user-identifiable parameters and the potential for the removal of non-tracking parameters that may negatively impact users' experiences. Some suggest using workarounds like subdomains or permalinks to get around the feature. The Mail.app feature of detecting tracking pixels and loading emails automatically is also discussed.Apple's latest iOS 15 beta release has a new feature called Link Tracking Protection that removes unnecessary personal information from shared links in Messages, Mail, and Safari Private Browsing, which makes it harder for websites to track users across other websites. This new feature only removes information from links that users share, not from all links in emails. This could potentially protect users from inadvertently forwarding an email with personal identifiers in the links, preventing others from unsubscribing or auto-logging in, etc. However, it remains to be seen how effective this feature is, as some users report that the feature is limited, and it may not be long before tracking companies find ways to work around it. The new feature may also have implications for advertising and marketing, making it difficult for smaller, niche businesses to advertise effectively.",

    "hn_content": "Google is no longer allowing remote work and is requiring employees to work on-site. Many argue that remote work has benefits and that the choice should be up to individual employees and companies. Some see this move as an attempt to push some employees out and avoid further layoffs. Others argue that the push for on-site work is to support commercial real estate and prevent cities from losing tax revenue. However, remote work can also benefit smaller towns and regions and keep people in those areas. The debate over remote work versus on-site work includes both objective advantages and subtle human/social factors that need to be weighed. Ultimately, the decision to work remotely or on-site should be up to individual employees and companies.The article discusses the drawbacks of office work and the traditional 40-hour workweek, which may not reflect productive hours worked by employees. Many companies are returning to the office, but the article questions if this is necessary and whether companies are attempting to maintain an illusion of labor scarcity. However, some argue that not all employees thrive in a fully remote work environment and that hybrid policies are a more positive outcome of the pandemic. The article also addresses the issue of a high bus factor in companies and highlights the importance of knowledge transfer and documentation.The debate surrounds the productivity of hybrid vs. remote work, with one side arguing for remote work citing examples of successful remote software projects while the other side argues that human interaction improves team morale, quality of work, and productivity. The consensus, however, is that both styles have their pros and cons and any solution should be a compromise between the two. Compromising means taking into account what makes employees the happiest. Work from wherever you want is a possibility, but that's called a remote job, not WFH, and there needs to be a conversation between a company and employee to come to a mutually satisfactory decision.Google recently announced a hybrid work policy requiring employees to work in the office three days a week, leading to internal debate over remote work policies. Some employees argue that remote work should be judged based on metrics such as performance, not attendance. Others suggest that a hybrid policy is not an equal compromise as it removes the advantage of being able to live anywhere, while smaller companies see remote work as a competitive advantage in the labor market. However, some feel that companies should allow employees to choose their preferred working environment, either fully remote or in-person, as a way to optimize productivity and diversity in the workplace.Many big tech companies are forcing people back into the office, disappointing those who have enjoyed remote work during the pandemic. Some companies are offering a hybrid approach, such as Meta's 3-days-per-week return to office policy while still allowing remote work. The pros and cons of remote vs. office-based work have been debated, but some suggest that full-time remote work may not be suitable for all job types. Keeping and attracting talent is a crucial consideration for companies, with smaller companies often making more exceptions to retain workers. Remote work can provide benefits such as savings on office space expenses, long commutes, and more, although it can have drawbacks such as difficulties with training. On the other hand, traditional in-office work provides more opportunities for spontaneous conversations and idea sharing.The post discusses the challenges of remote work and the benefits of office work, such as spontaneous conversations and ideation, which can lead to innovation. However, the author argues that mandatory in-office workdays can be detrimental to work-life balance and prevent employees from attending to personal responsibilities. The comments section debates the value of in-person work and argues that while some benefits may be lost with remote work, it can be advantageous for companies to adopt a remote work culture. The comments also highlight the need for companies to adapt their culture and processes to effectively implement remote work.The article presents a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of remote work. Some argue that in-person collaboration fosters creativity and that interruptions can lead to valuable conversations, while others point out that remote collaboration can be just as effective, particularly for people who prefer asynchronous communication or who are easily distracted by office noise. The debate includes considerations of introversion and extroversion, the productivity of junior versus senior employees, and the potential for equity compensation to offset the negative aspects of remote work. Overall, the article suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for companies and individuals looking to optimize productivity and creativity in a hybrid or fully remote work environment.This text comprises a discussion among tech professionals about how to manage interruptions while working remotely. Many contributors believe that interruptions can be wildly disruptive to productivity while others suggest various strategies for managing them. \n\nKey takeaways:\n- Interruptions can be highly disruptive to workflow, especially when working on complex projects. \n- Some contributors suggest setting boundaries, such as setting IM status to \"busy\" or deflecting interruptions politely. \n- Others emphasize the benefits of spontaneous conversation in the office, although many see this as overemphasized and not worth the distraction. \n- Training and onboarding junior colleagues can be especially challenging to balance with colleague interruptions, especially when working remotely.Companies are struggling to adapt to remote work demands, including training and managing employees. Many are reverting to in-office work to avoid failing at remote management. However, remote work can lead to a more independent and healthy workforce. Remote work can be successful with proper documentation, training videos, and centralization of communication. Remote work can lead to improved productivity and efficiency. Remote work can foster spontaneous conversations and ideation through Slack. Working from home can prevent interruptions and allow for better flow of work. Remote work requires companies to be intentional about their processes, culture, and approach. Companies that do not give proper thought to remote work are the ones struggling to adapt.Experts share their opinions on remote work, discussing the pros and cons of collaboration in person versus online. While some argue the benefits of in-person communication and teamwork, others highlight the advantages of remote training and asynchronous communication. The size of the company and the nature of the work also play a role in determining the most effective approach. Companies need to prioritize efficient systems and processes for remote work to be successful, and there is consensus that interruptions and distractions can be detrimental to productivity regardless of the work environment. However, the current debate defies simple reduction to a binary \"good vs. bad\" assessment, as the effectiveness of remote work depends on a complex array of factors unique to each company and each worker's specific needs.A discussion thread on remote work and productivity made by software developers sparked debate about whether remote work increases productivity. One user claims to have found the most productive team in a fully remote setup, with the fastest rate of deployment, the most comprehensive test suite ever seen, and a relaxed environment. In contrast, another user highlights how remote working is not always productive and heavily depends on personal preferences, management policies, and the nature of work. Another user suggests that hybrid policies could address the strengths and weaknesses of remote vs in-person work, while others argue against or propose alternatives. Ultimately, the debate shows that personal preferences, work culture, and management styles heavily influence productivity in any working environment.The post discusses the challenges and benefits of remote work. Some commenters argue that remote work is more productive and cost-efficient, while others suggest that in-person interactions can improve morale and foster team cohesion. The conversation also touches on the issue of companies rethinking their remote work policies post-pandemic and the importance of having adequate working conditions at home. One suggestion offered is to organize periodic team-building activities that do not involve traditional work tasks. Overall, the post highlights the importance of finding a balance that satisfies both individual needs and business goals.A discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of working remotely from home versus renting an office close to home. \n\nSome argue that the costs of renting an office and loss of in-person communication with a team outweigh the benefits of avoiding a commute and having a private workspace. Others suggest that public spaces like libraries and coffee shops can serve as temporary workspaces and offer more privacy than open offices. \n\nThe trend towards open offices that is currently being reversed was largely unsuccessful in creating private working spaces. \n\nUltimately, the decision of where to work should be based on individual needs and preferences.",

Over the past few months, we\u2019ve celebrated a number of \u201clasts\u201d, as our supply continues to dwindle. We order enough \u201cfreshies\u201d to ensure we can use it all before it goes bad. We won\u2019t have a resupply plane until November, and unfortunately there just aren\u2019t a lot of \u201cfresh\u201d foods that will survive the interim 8 months.The most impactful for me was the end of fresh milk \u2013 powdered milk makes for disappointing lattes, but I\u2019m doing my best:A tolerable latte, with powdered milk and coffee beans roasted 3 years ago.Our galley staff does an amazing job creating delicious meals under challenging circumstances.

Delicious, world-class, created by experts in their field\u2026 out of ingredients that may have been sitting in cold storage for literally years.Indian dinner! Hearty, satisfying, and not a fresh ingredient in sight.During the winter, the limited \u201cfreshies\u201d we do have are sourced exclusively from the South Pole Greenhouse:The greenhouse is a volunteer affair, and it yields enough for herbs and the occasional salad! It\u2019s also the only place on station with humidity! Since the rest of the station has near-zero humidity, it\u2019s a treat to spend time in here.The greenhouse lobby, my favorite place to relax. Great for reading or making phone calls home.Food sustains us, and it\u2019s fascinating to temporarily live in a place that reminds us every day how much we take for granted back home.We do very well for ourselves, given the circumstances, but the stark reality is: we won\u2019t see fresh eggs for another five full months. Another facet of this weird, weird adventure at the bottom of the world.Until next time!",

The thread also touched on a variety of food preservation and preparation techniques and cultural differences in cuisine. Overall, the thread is a casual discussion with some interesting insights.Researchers in Antarctica rely on shelf-stable and frozen foods, with some rare fresh produce flown in from New Zealand. Although milk freezes well, it can go bad between two to three months. Homogenized and ultrapasteurized milk is commonly used, but there are options for powdered milk from New Zealand and other parts of Latin America. Eating by the seasons is considered normal in less developed countries, where fresh food markets are common.

    "hn_content": "Numerous subs, including r/ProgrammerHumor, are temporarily or permanently shutting down in protest of Reddit's API changes, posing the question of federated Mastodon-esque systems to replace Reddit. Those subs, such as r/ProgrammerHumor, engaged in a behavior that protests the demands of Reddit leadership. Additionally, Reddit mods get unpaid power and authority and Reddit itself is relying on people's content to operate, leading to their implicit ownership claim. As such, a system like Lemmy can replace Reddit, although it is struggling with popularity and limited features. Twitter is declining while Mastodon, with its niche but strong community, is becoming more attractive and engaging to use. However, some metrics on Twitter's performance are dubious and need to be carefully examined.Twitter's power user traffic has declined by 25% since Elon Musk expressed dissatisfaction with the platform. This decline is significant as it could predict the eventual collapse of the social network, as seen with Friendster and MySpace. Mastodon has emerged as an alternative, but it hasn't yet gained the same prominence as Twitter. Other social media sites, such as Reddit and Facebook, are also facing challenges with retaining users and keeping their communities happy. Building a social network is a complex challenge, with many factors to consider, including moderation and scaling to handle millions of concurrent users. Features like subreddit systems make it easier for smaller communities to migrate, but widespread adoption is difficult.Third-party apps for Reddit may be in trouble due to recent API changes, leading some users to consider creating an alternative platform. However, many commenters highlight the difficulty of accumulating a user base, and the challenges faced when competing with established social media sites. The potential impact on blind users has also been discussed, with concerns raised about the lack of accessible options on alternative sites. Many users have shared personal experiences of quitting Reddit, often citing wasted time and frustration with site management as reasons for leaving.Developers are exploring alternatives to Reddit after its decision to increase API usage fees, leading to the shutdown of numerous subreddits. The coordinated action was led by the moderators of large subreddits including\u00a0r/science and r/gaming. Reddit offers discounts on API usage fees based on revenue share, but Reddit then doubled these fees. Some users suggest the action was in retaliation for the new restrictions imposed upon third-party apps like Apollo, the most popular Reddit app on iOS. Others see the fees increases as the beginning of the end for the site, with users moving away from centralised forums in favour of decentralised, individual forums.A subreddit for moderators of Reddit has shut down in protest over the lack of communication and support from the platform's administrators. The shutdown protest aims to highlight the substantial workload of moderators and their concerns for better policies to control the offensive content on the site. The moderators have also raised the issue of the lack of compensation from the industry-dominant platform. The shutdown calls into question Reddit's future as a community-driven source of information, and some users are beginning to explore alternatives to the platform. The company has been criticized for adopting an excessive ad-driven model and putting the interests of advertisers above those of its users. However, the protest may have little impact on Reddit's long-term standing, given that it has a massive user base and a network effect that will be hard for competitors to displace.",

    "content": "Simon Willison\u2019s WeblogSubscribeUnderstanding GPT tokenizersLarge language models such as GPT-3/4, LLaMA and PaLM work in terms of tokens. They take text, convert it into tokens (integers), then predict which tokens should come next.Playing around with these tokens is an interesting way to get a better idea for how this stuff actually works under the hood.OpenAI offer a Tokenizer tool for exploring how tokens workI\u2019ve built my own, slightly more interesting tool as an Observable notebook:https://observablehq.com/@simonw/gpt-tokenizerYou can use the notebook to convert text to tokens, tokens to text and also to run searches against the full token table.Here\u2019s what the notebook looks like:The text I\u2019m tokenizing here is:The dog eats the applesEl perro come las manzanas\u7247\u4eee\u540dThis produces 21 integer tokens: 5 for the English text, 8 for the Spanish text and six (two each) for those three Japanese characters. The two newlines are each represented by tokens as well.The notebook uses the tokenizer from GPT-2 (borrowing from this excellent notebook by EJ Fox and Ian Johnson), so it\u2019s useful primarily as an educational tool\u2014there are differences between how it works and the latest tokenizers for GPT-3 and above.Exploring some interesting tokensPlaying with the tokenizer reveals all sorts of interesting patterns.Most common English words are assigned a single token. As demonstrated above:\u201cThe\u201d: 464\u201c dog\u201d: 3290\u201c eats\u201d: 25365\u201c the\u201d: 262\u201c apples\u201d: 22514Note that capitalization is important here. \u201cThe\u201d with a capital T is token 464, but \u201c the\u201d with both a leading space and a lowercase t is token 262.Many words also have a token that incorporates a leading space. This makes for much more efficient encoding of full sentences, since they can be encoded without needing to spend a token on each whitespace character.Languages other than English suffer from less efficient tokenization.\u201cEl perro come las manzanas\u201d in Spanish is encoded like this:\u201cEl\u201d: 9527\u201c per\u201d: 583\u201cro\u201d: 305\u201c come\u201d: 1282\u201c las\u201d: 39990\u201c man\u201d: 582\u201czan\u201d: 15201\u201cas\u201d: 292The English bias is obvious here. \u201c man\u201d gets a lower token ID of 582, because it\u2019s an English word. \u201czan\u201d gets a token ID of 15201 because it\u2019s not a word that stands alone in English, but is a common enough sequence of characters that it still warrants its own token.Some languages even have single characters that end up encoding to multiple tokens, such as these Japanese characters:\u7247: 31965 229\u4eee: 20015 106\u540d: 28938 235Glitch tokensA fascinating subset of tokens are what are known as \u201cglitch tokens\u201d. My favourite example of those is token 23282\u2014\u201c davidjl\u201d.We can find that token by searching for \u201cdavid\u201d using the search box in the notebook:Riley Goodside highlighted some weird behaviour with that token:Why this happens is an intriguing puzzle.It looks likely that this token refers to user davidjl123 on Reddit, a keen member of the /r/counting subreddit. He\u2019s posted incremented numbers there well over 163,000 times.Presumably that subreddit ended up in the training data used to create the tokenizer used by GPT-2, and since that particular username showed up hundreds of thousands of times it ended up getting its own token.But why would that break things like this? The best theory I\u2019ve seen so far came from londons_explore on Hacker News:These glitch tokens are all near the centroid of the token embedding space. That means that the model cannot really differentiate between these tokens and the others equally near the center of the embedding space, and therefore when asked to \u2019repeat\u2019 them, gets the wrong one.That happened because the tokens were on the internet many millions of times (the davidjl user has 163,000 posts on reddit simply counting increasing numbers), yet the tokens themselves were never hard to predict (and therefore while training, the gradients became nearly zero, and the embedding vectors decayed to zero, which some optimizers will do when normalizing weights).The conversation attached to the post SolidGoldMagikarp (plus, prompt generation) on LessWrong has a great deal more detail on this phenomenon.Counting tokens with tiktokenOpenAI\u2019s models each have a token limit. It\u2019s sometimes necessary to count the number of tokens in a string before passing it to the API, in order to ensure that limit is not exceeded.One technique that needs this is Retrieval Augmented Generation, where you answer a user\u2019s question by running a search (or an embedding search) against a corpus of documents, extract the most likely content and include that as context in a prompt.The key to successfully implementing that pattern is to include as much relevant context as will fit within the token limit\u2014so you need to be able to count tokens.OpenAI provide a Python library for doing this called tiktoken.If you dig around inside the library you\u2019ll find it currently includes five different tokenization schemes: r50k_base, p50k_base, p50k_edit, cl100k_base and gpt2.Of these cl100k_base is the most relevant, being the tokenizer for both GPT-4 and the inexpensive gpt-3.5-turbo model used by current ChatGPT.p50k_base is used by text-davinci-003. A full mapping of models to tokenizers can be found in the MODEL_TO_ENCODING dictionary in tiktoken/model.py.Here\u2019s how to use tiktoken:import tiktokenencoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(\"gpt-4\")# or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" or \"text-davinci-003\"tokens = encoding.encode(\"Here is some text\")token_count = len(tokens)tokens will now be an array of four integer token IDs\u2014[8586, 374, 1063, 1495] in this case.Use the .decode() method to turn an array of token IDs back into text:text = encoding.decode(tokens)# 'Here is some text'The first time you call encoding_for_model() the encoding data will be fetched over HTTP from a openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net Azure blob storage bucket (code here). This is cached in a temp directory, but that will get cleared should your machine restart. You can force it to use a more persistent cache directory by setting a TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR environment variable.ttokI introduced my ttok tool a few weeks ago. It\u2019s a command-line wrapper around tiktoken with two key features: it can count tokens in text that is piped to it, and it can also truncate that text down to a specified number of tokens:# Count tokensecho -n \"Count these tokens\" | ttok# Outputs: 3 (the newline is skipped thanks to echo -n)# Truncationcurl 'https://simonwillison.net/' | strip-tags -m | ttok -t 6# Outputs: Simon Willison\u2019s Weblog# View integer token IDsecho \"Show these tokens\" | ttok --tokens# Outputs: 7968 1521 11460 198Use -m gpt2 or similar to use an encoding for a different model.Watching tokens get generatedOnce you understand tokens, the way GPT tools generate text starts to make a lot more sense.In particular, it\u2019s fun to watch GPT-4 streaming back its output as independent tokens (GPT-4 is slightly slower than 3.5, making it easier to see what\u2019s going on).Here\u2019s what I get for llm -s 'Five names for a pet pelican' -4\u2014using my llm CLI tool to generate text from GPT-4:As you can see, names that are not in the dictionary such as \u201cPelly\u201d take multiple tokens, but \u201cCaptain Gulliver\u201d outputs the token \u201cCaptain\u201d as a single chunk.Posted 8th June 2023 at 8:37 pm \u00b7 Follow me on Mastodon or Twitter or subscribe to my newsletterMore recent articlesWeeknotes: Parquet in Datasette Lite, various talks, more LLM hacking - 4th June 2023It's infuriatingly hard to understand how closed models train on their input - 4th June 2023ChatGPT should include inline tips - 30th May 2023Lawyer cites fake cases invented by ChatGPT, judge is not amused - 27th May 2023llm, ttok and strip-tags - CLI tools for working with ChatGPT and other LLMs - 18th May 2023Delimiters won't save you from prompt injection - 11th May 2023Weeknotes: sqlite-utils 3.31, download-esm, Python in a sandbox - 10th May 2023Leaked Google document: \"We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI\" - 4th May 2023Midjourney 5.1 - 4th May 2023This is Understanding GPT tokenizers by Simon Willison, posted on 8th June 2023.projects 300 gpt3 63 generativeai 223 openai 76 gpt4 13 ai 242 llms 196Previous: Weeknotes: Parquet in Datasette Lite, various talks, more LLM hackingSource code \u00a9 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023",

    "hn_content": "An exploration of GPT tokenization reveals how GPT-4 has a token vocabulary dominated by non-natural languages, including many tokens from source code, suggesting that training on code may be fundamental in training the model to reason logically and think clearly. The lack of genuine phonetic understanding in GPT models is due to half-understood phonetics discerned dimly through lossy compression of BPEs and memorized pairs. The models have difficulty obeying specific rhyming schemes but often form a strong association between rhyming and poetry. The consequences of BPE tokenization include difficulty with rhyme and humor, as well as a preference for simple, common phrases over more creative or expressive language. Collaboration with Microsoft grants OpenAI access to a GitHub corpus that may provide a competitive advantage, as it is hard to scrape otherwise.Experts discuss tokenizers and their role in modern language models, which rely heavily on tokens as the foundational primitive. Tokenization can present unique challenges, such as identifying the most effective token length, and other issues related to grounding encoded representations in semantic meaning. Tokenizing is viewed as an essential aspect of language model optimization. The article discloses some challenges with tokenizing Russian language, which can present data processing obstacles. While tokenization is only one step in the language model algorithm, it is an important one, and many experts predict future breakthroughs will likely occur surrounding this topic. The article also touches on the limits of tokenizations, including a limited vocabulary and issues around abstract words and obscure phrases.A discussion on the effects of tokenization on LLM behavior and the idea of accounting for symmetries in embeddings to improve performance. The concept of representing spaces in tokenization is explored, with different approaches offered. The potential drawbacks and benefits of using byte-level or binary digit tokenization are discussed, with a consensus that while it works, it is not optimal. The effectiveness of asking ChatGPT to develop a learning path or syllabus to learn a topic is also mentioned.",

    "content": "ABOVE:ISTOCK.COMMicroplastics, or plastic particulates measuring less than five micrometers, are a growing environmental concern. These particulates disrupt reproduction, immune cell and microbiome composition in the gut, and neural and endocrine function in aquatic species and laboratory animals.1-4 Now, a new study published in Cell Reports suggests that the smaller the plastic, the greater the problem.5According to Chao Wang, an immunologist at Soochow University and coauthor of the study, feeding mice nanoplastics induced a greater overall immune response in their guts than feeding mice larger microplastics. This supports previous research showing size-dependent differences in how nanoparticles interact with cells and instigate responses from them.6Wang and his team found that nanoplastics, defined as being less than 500 nanometers in size, are more readily phagocytosed by macrophages compared to microplastics, which measure up to five micrometers. The smaller sized particulates induced a greater degree of lysosomal damage in these cells and resulted in production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) both in vitro and in the intestines of mice following one week of daily oral administration of the plastic. Using single-cell sequencing, Wang and his colleagues identified a population of IL-1\u03b2-producing macrophages in the intestines of nanoplastic-fed mice.Recent studies have shown that inflammatory responses in the intestines affect the brain, so Wang and his team next assessed the gut-brain axis. After two months of daily ingestion of nanoplastics at the estimated human consumption dose, nanoplastic-exposed mice exhibited reduced cognition and short-term memory as assessed by standard neurological assessments such as the open-field test, novel object recognition assay, and the Morris water maze. These plastic-fed mice also had more activated microglia and astrocytes as well as Th17-differentiated T cells than nontreated mice.Wang and his colleagues also observed elevated IL-1\u03b2 in the brains of plastic-fed mice, but did not find IL-1\u03b2-producing cells in the brain, which suggested that these effects resulted from IL-1\u03b2-producing macrophages in the gut. \u201cAll these changes associated with brain function damage,\u201d Wang said.Neurological effects from the ingestion of microplastics have been abundantly documented in marine species2,7,8 as plastic pollution in water ways is an outstanding problem. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the enormity\u2014how big this problem was\u2014until I started working on it about three years ago,\u201d said Ebenezer Nyadjro, an oceanographer at Mississippi State University and data manager at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), who was not involved with the study. \u201cThe long-term effect is if this is not controlled\u2014if we keep dumping plastics into the water bodies, they break down into microplastics; they have an impact on those fisheries; and as studies have shown, they bioaccumulate up to higher organisms and humans\u2014there will be impacts on us as well.\u201dThis observation has been echoed with recent reports of microplastics in human tissues,9 underscoring the importance of Wang\u2019s findings.However, even after two months of daily nanoplastic ingestion, cognitive function and short-term memory impairments were mitigated by blocking IL-1\u03b2 using either a monoclonal antibody or chemical inhibitor, and more promisingly, by cessation of nanoplastic exposure. One month after Wang and his team stopped feeding mice nanoplastics, they performed as well as nontreated mice in neurological assessments. \u201cIt\u2019s showing this effect is not permanent but can be rescued. So, it\u2019s showing one more reason to fix the plastic pollution worldwide,\u201d Wang said.REFERENCESHarusato A, Seo W, Abo H, Nakanishi Y, Nishikawa H, Itoh Y.

    "hn_content": "Ingesting nanoplastic causes neurological deficits, according to a study. A discussion on Hacker News breaks out about the best ways to store food, with many suggesting glass containers as an alternative to plastic due to plastic's potential health concerns. Some users debate the pros and cons of specific glass container brands and types of lids. The discussion also touches on the difficulty of ensuring food safety due to the entire supply chain's reliance on plastic packaging.There is a discussion about the concerns surrounding \"plastic\" carpets in American homes, which are made of polyester, nylon, or polypropylene and shed fibers constantly. Wool rugs have been recommended as a better alternative, especially for humid environments or households with kids and pets. The conversation also touches on the issue of microplastics in food and drinks, and how pollution from trashed plastics impacts the environment. There is a need for different types of plastics that don't turn into long-lived microplastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA), but the adoption of biodegradable plastics is limited due to their higher costs. Overall, the conversation highlights the ubiquity of plastics and the urgent need to reduce plastic waste.The post is a discussion thread about the safety and risks involved with consuming food or drinks stored in plastic, metal, or glass containers. The conversation includes concerns about the presence of harmful chemicals like PFAS and BPA in the lining of food containers and the potential for glass to break and cause injury. Several suggestions for alternatives are offered, including glass containers with silicone mesh, beeswax food wraps, and wheat bran containers. There is also discussion about the safety of microwaving food in plastic and the potential for metal poisoning from canned drinks and foods. Some individuals express their personal choices to avoid certain containers or materials, while others debate the degree of risk and practicality of alternatives.A recent study shows that consuming plastic nanoparticles, like those in plastic containers, can negatively impact cognitive function. The study was conducted on mice but raises concerns about the health effects on humans. Tap water also contains a fair amount of plastic nanoparticles, meaning individuals with plumbing issues may have to rely on plastic containers for clean water. The conversation extends beyond food containers to other items like textiles, synthetic fibers, and saran wrap. The study highlights the need for companies and manufacturers to be held accountable for the production and disposal of plastics. While it\u2019s tough to avoid plastic in everyday life, there are interventions that can decrease plastic exposure, such as avoiding drinking from plastic water bottles and using alternatives to synthetic fabrics. The article also features a debate about whether synthetic fibers and plastic nanoparticles are necessarily harmful to human health, with some commenters challenging the claims and calling for more information.Scientists found that nanoplastics induce a greater immune response in mouse guts than larger microplastics, but it's unclear how much this translates to human health. Researchers are still debating how much harm microplastics can cause to human health, but they are widespread in our food, air, and contaminated water systems. While disposable masks were seen as useful during the pandemic, people are starting to realize the negative environmental impact. Governments should tax negative externalities and redistribute that revenue to the people for a long-term solution. There is no real way to curtail tire and textile production, which is responsible for a significant proportion of microplastics. The plastics industry permeates all aspects of life, but individual actions can make a difference. The medical industry may experience the most significant impact, as disposability is crucial to prevent infection, and many medical components rely on the combination of elasticity and strength found in plastics.Experts on a forum discussion argue over the potential consequences of phasing out PFAS over five to ten years or increasing taxes on its usage. Some claim that civilization hinges on plastics because modern electronic devices, like computers and mobile phones, require PFAS. However, others point out that society existed before wide-spread deployment of plastics and that biodegradable sustainable alternatives exist to reduce negative environmental externalities. They suggest that taxing corporations that make plastic a lot and redistributing the funds to the citizens could motivate firms to switch to sustainable alternatives. Proper drainage systems that filter and trap pollutants before they escape can also help.",

    "hn_content": "Sync, a popular Reddit app, will shut down on June 30, prompting discussions about alternative sites or APIs that could potentially replace Reddit. Users and developers express sadness and frustration at the loss of the app and raise concerns about the difficulty of creating a successful Reddit alternative due to issues of funding, advertising, moderation, and content. Some users suggest creating a cooperative model with aligned interests of users, advertisers, and mods, while others propose a federated network of sites or instances that can speak to one another. However, the challenge of developing a Reddit replacement with a sustainable business model that prioritizes quality and governance over profit remains.Multiple third-party Reddit apps are shutting down in protest of changes to Reddit's API usage rules, which limit third-party app's ability to scrape data and support Reddit accounts. Developers have criticised Reddit for failing to build a working mobile app, with moderators also protesting against the new rules. Critics have called on the Reddit to develop better features for its own app, instead of cutting off third-party developers. Some users have suggested that the community could band together to create a Reddit alternative, with several projects being suggested, although infrastructure costs could remain a hurdle. Others have suggested using the official Reddit API, either by reverse-engineering or purchasing Reddit API keys to work with independent apps.Developers and Reddit users express mixed opinions on the recent move by the platform to charge third-party app developers for API usage. Some argue that developers had a good run and made a living off Reddit's content, while others feel that Reddit's API pricing is outlandish and unrealistic. Some users express disappointment that they will no longer be able to use their preferred third-party apps like Sync, while others defend the platform's decision and suggest that users could have paid for ad-free versions of the app. The move to charge third-party app developers for API usage has caused controversy and mixed reactions among the Reddit community.",
