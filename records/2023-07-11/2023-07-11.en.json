For reference, the GDPs of developed countries like South Korea, Australia, and oil-rich Saudi Arabia are less than $1.7T respectively. The explosion in tuition costs and associated debt accumulation is undeniably a looming economic crisis. It\u2019s a crisis that requires a basket of policy solutions to transform higher education from the bottom up - including, yes, cancellation of some federal student loans. But while the fight to cancel student loan debt continues, we think it would be especially worthwhile to explore some data and highlight potential solutions for this debt burden.\ud83d\udcc8 How We Got HereTuition cost and fee inflation have outpaced CPI Inflation 4-to-1 over the last 40 years:Animated versions of these charts on Threads (or Twitter): @theArmanMadaniThe resulting $1.78T of debt includes $1.65T that is federally owned (93%). 45M Americans have federal student loan debt. Roughly half of all the debt belongs to individuals with graduate degrees while the other half belongs to individuals with undergraduate degrees; though it\u2019s worth noting that there are fewer graduate students overall so the debt held per student is higher for graduates:Animated versions of these charts on Threads (or Twitter): @theArmanMadaniStudent enrollment in higher ed institutions has risen consistently since 2000. With higher demand for college degrees - including out-of-state demand for state universities - tuition has risen precipitously. Rising enrollment is also associated with a changing US labor profile; for example, manufacturing jobs were eclipsed by \u201cbusiness and professional services\u201d jobs as well as healthcare, education, and retail jobs. One troubling manifestation of the demand for higher degrees can be seen during the 2008-09 Recession as newly unemployed individuals scrambled for retraining. From 2008 through 2009, enrollment in private for-profit colleges rose disproportionately compared to private non-profit and public colleges. Private for-profit colleges have extraordinarily high rates of default, near 16% of borrowers default within 3 years.During this period of heightened demand, a more obvious inflationary effect took place: state funds were cut for public colleges on a per-student basis in the run-up and fallout of the Recession.\ud83d\udcb8 What Now[WARNING: I include my opinion in this section, I look forward to a lively discussion in the comment section]There are short and long-term solutions needed to address the debt problem.Short-term, students need recourse. Defaulting on loans creates a cascade of consequences that necessarily harm borrowers earning potential for years (e.g. colleges can withholding proof of attendance, decline in credit score, wage garnishments, etc.) There are loans that are highly likely to default regardless after the COVID moratorium on payments ends. These loans should be forgiven/cancelled. The fallout of default en masse - especially amongst low and middle-income degree holders - would present a much greater cost to the economy than the cost of cancellation. Additionally, controlling what information can be reported to credit bureaus (like medical debt) and regulating what information colleges can withhold would also reduce negative income effects caused by default (e.g. a private for-profit institution cannot withhold proof of attendance in the event of default).Long-term, controlling the underlying cost of higher ed itself is an imperative. Federal support for and expansion of programs like The California Promise - which provides free tuition for California residents who attend CA community colleges - would eliminate the burden for some new graduates. Apportioning more existing or raising new tax revenue to invest in underfunded private colleges (e.g. HBCUs) and public colleges can reduce tuition costs by supplanting/exceeding the aforementioned state funding cuts as well.This is a complex issue which requires comprehensive policy solutions. But one of the reasons student debt has received the attention it has is because of the opportunity it presents. An opportunity to extend a stimulus to low/middle income earners in the short-term and transform the higher education system in the long-term.Thank you for reading this article!

programs that lead to high-paying jobs rather than focusing on overall learning.\n- The commenter argues that loan companies should not be absolved from conducting due diligence when lending to young adults with low credit history.\n- The government got involved in backing student loans because loan companies initially had insufficient data to make good lending decisions.\n- The commenter raises the question of whether it is a bad thing for schools to prioritize programs that help borrowers repay their debts.\n- There is a philosophical debate about whether society should prioritize practical, job-focused education over subjects like philosophy, art, and music.\n- The commenter shares personal experience and believes that current government policies enable people to take on

admin-to-instructor ratios as indicators of quality.\n- Counterarguments are made regarding the specific example of Yale's administrative growth.\n- The relationship between universities and profit-maximization is highlighted, with mention of the role of endowments.\n- The idea of interest-bearing loans being evil is challenged, and the example of modern Islamic banking is provided.\n- The question of why anyone would lend to people with any risk is raised, and the possibility of lending out of a desire to help is suggested.\n- Different possibilities for charging money that doesn't count as interest are discussed, including fees, late fees, and business partnerships.\n- The increase in demand for loans is discussed as a driver of tuition increases, with comparisons to mortgages.\n- The idea that the modern economy may not be sustainable in the long term is suggested.\n- Counterarguments to the claim that lowering the bar for admission has caused tuition increases and lowered education quality are presented.\n- The question of whether colleges produce a net positive effect for society is raised, with potential links to loan amnesty.\n- Additional factors impacting rising tuition prices, such as reductions in state funding and lack of inflation-based increases in grants, are mentioned.",

Whether the carriers are permitted to sell or otherwise provide the information to other third parties is less clear. Expect there to be much more scrutiny about this in the coming weeks and months.\"To see this in practice, check out MVNOs offering prepaid mobile service. Some will disable certain features unless this physical E911 address is submitted by the customer.What if there were a limitation on how that data can be used.replyTerr_ 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Krebs went on to cite an official at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who said cellular carriers by law are required to know the approximate location of customers in the event it's needed by emergency 911 services.IANAL but the RAY BAUM\u2019S act (yes, it's all caps because it's a silly initialism) only applies to location data that goes \"with\" a particular 911 call. Not your location before the call, nor your location after the call.So if your cell-carrier is recording your location at all moments and persisting it indefinitely, or sharing anything beyond the data generated for that particular 911 call, no law is forcing them to do that, they are choosing to disrespect your privacy for their own profits or laziness.replysacnoradhq 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]E911 came about to address lost and immobilized callers.Unfortunately, it's inconsistently deployed and not universally usable. This is likely the result of a lack of a sufficiently-staffed regulatory body auditing for compliance and correctness because it doesn't work everywhere with all phones on all carriers even when there is the technical ability, e.g., phone has a fix. It hasn't delivered completely on its promise because it's an under-funded, under-audited mandate that needs serious carrots and sticks to ensure it's reliable.replysmcin 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]No, \"finding lost and immobilized callers\" was the cover-story nominally used when E911 legislation was pushed hard in Congress in 1999/2000 (by the wireless industry, not directly by law enforcement).Do we really believe that Congress authored a law to improve \"safety\" but that had enormous negative privacy implications, while accidentally forgetting to even speak to the other 99.999+% of the time that the average person's location data is not involved with an emergency? Why were the legislation (and debate) conspicuously silent on limiting (let alone criminalizing) use and retention of location data, let alone resale (e.g. to data brokers or private parties?)Let's not pretend this exact outcome wasn't predicted and raised in strenuous objections by consumer advocates back in 1999; the following reads like a to-do list from lobbyists (why e.g. did the industry push for immunity for non-911 calls?)> 10/4/1999 WIRELESS 911 BILL HITS LIABILITY, PRIVACY OBSTACLES> Failure to pass the 911 bill-the centerpiece of the wireless industry\u2019s lobbying campaign in 1999-would be a serious setback for carriers and 911 vendors that want immunity from lawsuits before rolling out... caller identification and position location.> Holding the bill over until 2000 could prove highly problematic for industry, given it is an election year. Moreover, a delay would buy time for consumer groups and others that are beginning to surface and speak out on wireless liability issues pending before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and state courts.> In addition to liability protection for 911 and non-911 wireless calls...> Such broad liability immunity for wireless carriers has caused an uproar from consumer advocates who claim 911 legislation is part a master plan by industry to secure shielding from virtually all lawsuits.> In some state courts, consumers have brought litigation against wireless firms for being charged for rounded up and dropped calls, fraudulent advertising and other carrier practices.

However, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still the case.replyuggabuggalives 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> (short of using a burner or no phone at all).Not carrying a phone won't help you.Pulling the SIM won't help you.Look around you. See all those cameras? Not just the ones above your head in the supermarket that advertise HERE I AM, I'M A CAMERA, but every camera on every phone in the hands of every person you see can identify you and identify your exact location to the meter instantly based on your face and x other biometrics.Everytime you speak, your voice pattern identifies you instantly.Burner phones are a thing of the distant past. The moment you speak, the moment the camera \"sees\" you, your burner phone's IMEI is/can be mapped to your identity in double time.The methods in use today are just way more sophisticated than the tech you've read about.A drone at 20,000 feet can identify you in a crowd of 2,000 people based on the sound of your heart, your respiration, the shape of your head, your ears, your nose, your face, your facial profile, the shadow your body casts at x time of day, and/or the uniqueness of your gate. Combine them altogether with a scant amount of stat analysis and you can't hide even with effort.Think darkness will hide you? Nope.replybradgessler 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This is why I think technical solutions alone to privacy are mostly pointless. There\u2019s 7 billion people in the world\u2014at some point (if we haven\u2019t already reached it) monitoring all of us in real-time will be trivial. Even people who live \u201coff the grid\u201d in a cabin in the woods will be trackable.What\u2019s needed is an agreement between all of us, in the form of privacy laws, that make certain uses of this data illegal.In the future if you\u2019re caught committing a crime by data captured in a manner illegal under these laws, it would have to be thrown out and can\u2019t be used against you. Corps would also be banned from collecting, storing, and using personal data in an unlawful manner.Feels like a pipe dream since there\u2019s so much money in the industrial advertising complex, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what it will take achieve reasonable levels of privacy.replyAnthonyMouse 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> This is why I think technical solutions alone to privacy are mostly pointless.Technical solutions to privacy are not required to be alone. They're required to be ubiquitous. If your country is an authoritarian hellhole, you encrypt everything to help you not get murdered by the secret police. If your country has strong privacy protections, you encrypt everything to help ensure that it never becomes an authoritarian hellhole, and protect you against bureaucratic failures as defense in depth.To invade your privacy, an attacker should have to break the law and break the encryption.replyFrondo 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Life in an authoritarian hellhole almost by definition means technology won't save you. If they can haul you off when you're walking down the street, who cares whether your stuff is encrypted? They'll make something up.Even if you're innocent, they'll make something up. I lived for a year in one of those authoritarian hellholes and in that time knew two people who were arrested and hauled from station to station til someone paid a bribe- these weren't the dissidents either, just some guys. The dissident was stabbed to death on his doorstep.Encryption is good to save us from marketing, from megacorps making our lives hell. Laws and norms constrain the rest.replyAnthonyMouse 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Authoritarian hellholes will make something up when they don't like you, but they'll also spy on everyone to decide who they don't like. At which point anyone attempting to resist them is going to want to get extremely familiar with operational security before they get dead, and a big part of that is things like encryption and steganography.replyzirgs 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Authoritarian hellholes don't have human rights and if they find out that you're using encryption - that's enough for them to arrest you.replyFrondo 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Encryption will not keep you hidden from an authoritarian government for long, and certainly not for long if you're trying to build a movement with any sort of wide-spread support.replybilalq 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Agreed that this is not a problem that can be solved via a technical solution. However, I don't think a political solution is possible either. Even in the US, police can literally get away with murder today. Why would they have any difficulty getting away with privacy violations? Big Brother is inevitable. All you can do at this point is teach children and future generations to live with the understanding that they are being monitored at all times. This isn't me trying to be edgy or cynical. The genie's out of the bottle at this point and it's just reality.replyxapata 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The way to fight back is ubiquitous public monitoring of the state. We should understand that the state is always watching, but the state should also be aware that all its actions will be public knowledge.Note the increased awareness brought by widely available cameras with immediate upload capability. The commenter above implied this is dystopian, but the opposite seems to have occurred -- as the public gains the capability to surveil the state, it constrains the state.replyhandity 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]WikiLeaks tried that, Assange is still in Belmarsh and the MSM is still largely allowing him to rot there.replyncphil 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This is a good point. Of course anyone who thought the MSM, or print journalism, were in business to reveal the actual truth really needs to review their history. The worst part is that Julian (whether intentionally or not) probably made that sacrifice for nothing. At least here in the US most people don't know or care. That's a shame. And an embarrassment.replyxapata 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I was thinking of something more communal/distributed.

However, it's fractally difficult - there are technical challenges, political issues, PR issues, principal-agent problems, all mixing together - and importantly, there is no strong enough economical (or political) incentive to do it. Not when doing a small fraction of work, and a shitty job at this, still showers you with money while avoiding most of the problems.An not to push my favorite TV show that doesn't involve aliens from outer space too much, but recent advances in AI are changing the equation here, making Person of Interest even more accurate and relevant than it already was.replydoublerabbit 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Maybe in the Metro parts of the USA, but China is next level scary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo_FM3mjBCYIt's all possible.replyjbm 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The more disorder we see, the more people are going to reach for these extremist solutions.It's all scary - until one is the victim of a crime and the police don't think it's worth following up, or the presiding judge decides your time and suffering is less important than the future prospects of the criminal.replytrompetenaccoun 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It sounds logical but at least in the case of China there was no disorder to begin with, it's always been relatively safe in terms of violent crime. In China, the violent criminals are the government and the police. You can become a torture victim for as much as splashing ink on a Xi poster or just being Uyghur and existing.The cameras are not there to protect you from crime, they're there for control, to protect the CCP from the people.I'm not principally against surveillance for public security but it's very hard to not have it abused - for a start you need authorities and a police force that have good intentions and work for the people, not against them.

Since Wickard v Filburn, the interstate commerce clause has been a blank cheque for the federal government to regulate anything at all as it pleases, as the case allows regulation of goods down to the level of things that are made on and will never leave an individual's property.Long version: probably. Allowing the sale of location data would be deeply unpopular among the general public. Under stare decisis, the federal government would have a good chance at beating the state in a court case, but it would still be a risk- why risk the power for an unpopular case?See also: marijuana legalization and immigration. Arizona tried codifying the federal statutes on immigration into its own state laws- not superceding, just mirroring. The federal government took them to court and won. OTOH, marijuana is also distinctly within the federal government's purview, and Wickard would apply very easily to pot laws as well... And yet, they have done nothing at all, likely because pot is too popular to risk a court case (or an election, I suppose).replyfsckboy 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Short version: NO[?] Since Wickard v Filburn, the interstate commerce clause has been a blank cheque for the federal government to regulate anything at all as it pleasesbut it's not a blank check for the state of Massachusetts to regulate anything outside of Massachusetts, so you 1000% failed to address the question I raised.

Companies which buy or sell location data may not operate in Massachusetts without risking enforcement actions. If someone with a company's app travels through MA, their location data may likely still be sold if the company itself is not registered at all in MA.HOWEVER, the law must also survive the inevitable federal court challenge when a company headquartered in another state, but with some small operating presence in MA, falls under some enforcement action... rendering the original question entirely moot, as I suspect there are no shortage of companies who would challenge the law.replypakyr 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]How does this square with broad reaching commerce-regulating state laws like the CCPA or CEQA?

It massively expanded what the federal government can do, without a bright line of any sort to limit it.These things, imho, are rightfully within the purview of the states to implement. However, should the federal government declare there is a national interest (justification) for national regulation, then per court precedent it would compel the state to change. I do not believe there is any sort of jurisprudence for \"grandfathering in\" existing state laws. Just as prosecutors have discretion over what cases they actually prosecute, the government may choose to look the other way when state laws overlap the feds jurisdiction.If they tried, though, the state would still have the recourse of attempting to go before the supreme court, which would involve upending existing precedent.

But you can't just \"turn off\" cell tower associativity on your phone.

However, there is no requirement one way or the other.The easiest way to tell is if the clock of a sim-less phone drifts over a month or two from something it was sync'd to, note that using GPS at all will often sync the clock, and some devices will \"wake\" the GPS module to allow it to keep an up-to-date almanac and tracking (the math kind, not the surveillance kind) parameters, so it is best to disable location entirely, instead of just avoiding using it.If the phone has been used for a long time with a reliable time source available (tower/gps/ntp/etc), it may have a pretty good drift calibration, so it may take quite some time for drift to be visible.replycalderwoodra 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Would a ban on the \"sale of data\" ban profiting off location data all together?

    "content": "87% MISSING: THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CLASSIC VIDEO GAMESNew study reveals most classic video games are completely unavailableBy Kelsey LewinJuly 10, 2023The Video Game History Foundation, in partnership with the Software Preservation Network, has conducted the first ever study on the commercial availability of classic video games, and the results are bleak. 87% of classic video games released in the United States are critically endangered.Imagine if the only way to watch Titanic was to find a used VHS tape, and maintain your own vintage equipment so that you could still watch it. And what if no library, not even the Library of Congress, could do any better \u2014 they could keep and digitize that VHS of Titanic, but you\u2019d have to go all the way there to watch it. It sounds crazy, but that\u2019s the reality we live in with video games, a $180 billion industry, while the games and their history disappear.Just 13% of video game history is being represented in the current marketplace. In fact, no period of video game history defined in this study even cracked 20% representation.Figure 1: Availability rate of historical games, by period, between 1960 and 2009. (n = 1500, \u00b12.5%, 95% CI) Curious about our methodology? Check out our study explainer blog post!For accessing nearly 9 in 10 classic games, there are few options: seek out and maintain vintage collectible games and hardware, travel across the country to visit a library, or\u2026 piracy. None of those options are desirable, which means that most video games are inaccessible to all but the most diehard and dedicated fans. That\u2019s pretty grim!This is where libraries and archives should come in. Anyone should be able to easily explore, research and play classic video games, in the same way that they can read classic novels, listen to classic albums, and watch classic movies. But outdated copyright laws are preventing institutions like ours from doing our jobs.Availability rate of historical games. (n = 1500, \u00b12.5%, 95% CI)Random list of games pulled from MobyGames.Goal of this study: Get expanded exemptions for libraries and organizations preserving video games, which are currently far more limited than their ability to preserve books, movies, audio, etc.How this study helps: The video game industry\u2019s main lobbying group has successfully argued to the US Copyright Office that the industry already does enough to preserve its own history commercially, and that additional protections for preservation institutions would hurt their bottom line. We proved them wrong: the industry has actually only managed to make 13% of its history available, and it\u2019s unlikely to get better.The argument that these games are commercially available is what\u2019s keeping video games behind in the preservation world.QUICK FACTS:87% of classic games are not in release, and are considered critically endangeredAvailability is low across every platform and time period tracked in the studyLibraries and archives can digitally preserve, but not digitally share video games, and can provide on-premises access onlyLibraries and archives are allowed to digitally share other media types, such as books, film, and audio, and are not restricted to on-premises accessThe Entertainment Software Association, the video game industry\u2019s lobbying group, has consistently fought against expanding video game preservation within libraries and archives (ex. 1, 2, 3)The next rulemaking proceeding under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d), Title 17, section 1201, of the United States Code is scheduled for 2024. We\u2019re hopeful that this study will incite change, and that video game preservation will become stronger \u2014 before we lose more.Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States was conducted for the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation Network by VGHF Library Director Phil Salvador, published July 2023.Want to learn more?

Here\u2019s a new entry in the \u201ccool software julia likes\u201d section.A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For example, the nginx playground I posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via bubblewrap) to sandbox nginx. And I\u2019m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too.This post is very short, it\u2019s just to say that Lima seems nice and much simpler to get started with than Vagrant.enter Lima!I was complaining about this to a friend, and they mentioned Lima, which stands for Linux on Mac. I\u2019d heard of colima (another way to run Linux containers on Mac), but I hadn\u2019t realized that Lima also just lets you run VMs.It was surprisingly simple to set up. I just had to:Install Lima (I did nix-env -iA nixpkgs.lima but you can also install it with brew install lima)Run limactl start default to start the VMRun lima to get a shellThat\u2019s it! By default it mounts your home directory as read-only inside the VMThere\u2019s a config file in ~/.lima/default/lima.yaml, but I haven\u2019t needed to change it yet.some nice things about LimaSome things I appreciate about Lima (as opposed to Vagrant which I\u2019ve used in the past and found kind of frustrating) are:it provides a default configit automatically downloads a Ubuntu 22.04 image to use in the VM (which is what I would have probably picked anyway)it mounts my entire home directory inside the VM, which I really like as a default choice (it feels very seamless)I think the paradigm of \u201cI have a single chaotic global Linux VM which I use for all my projects\u201d might work better for me than super carefully configured per-project VMs. Though I\u2019m sure that you can have carefully configured per-project VMs with Lima too if you want, I\u2019m just only using the default VM.problem: I don\u2019t know how to mount directories read-writeI wanted to have my entire home directory mounted read-only, but have some subdirectories (like ~/work/nginx-playground) mounted read-write. I did some research and here\u2019s what I found:a comment on this github issue says that you can use mountType: \u201cvirtiofs\u201d and vmType: \u201cvz\u201d to mount subdirectories of your home directory read-writethe Lima version packaged in nix 23.05 doesn\u2019t seem to support vmType: vz (though I could be wrong about this)Maybe I\u2019ll figure out how to mount directories read-write later, I\u2019m not too bothered by working around it for now.why not use containers?I wanted a VM and not a Linux container because:the playground runs on a VM in production, not in a container, and generally it\u2019s easier to develop in a similar environment to productionall of my playgrounds use Linux namespaces, and I don\u2019t know how to create a namespace inside a container. Probably you can but I don\u2019t feel like figuring it out and it seems like an unnecessary distraction.on Mac you need to run containers inside a Linux VM anyway, so I\u2019d rather use a VM directly and not introduce another unnecessary layerthat\u2019s all!Some other notes:It looks like Lima works on Linux tooa bunch of people on Mastodon also said colima (built on top of Lima) is a nice Docker alternative on Mac for running Linux containersthere\u2019s also an new alternative Linux container runtime for Mac called Orb Stack, which I know nothing aboutWant a weekly digest of this blog?SubscribeOpen sourcing the nginx playground",

For example, sending OOM kill notifications on macOS instead of silently killing processes.- Running x86 containers: Builtin fixes and workarounds for many Rosetta bugs. Since the bugs are on Apple's side, they affect all other apps (as of writing) and often cause issues when running linux/amd64 containers. If you're used to slow QEMU emulation, then well, it should be a major improvement.- Multipass: OrbStack can run 15 different distros (https://docs.orbstack.dev/machines/distros#linux-distributio...). It's not limited to Ubuntu, and cloud-init support is also planned for most distros.- UTM: OrbStack doesn't do graphics yet, so you'll have to stick to UTM for GUI, but the CLI and other integration is designed to be on WSL2 level. It also boots much faster: baseline in ~1 sec, each machine in ~250 ms, total ~1.2 sec.- Bind mounts and file sharing: It uses VirtioFS which isn't affected by sshfs consistency issues, plus caching and optimizations to give it an edge.- Colima: https://docs.orbstack.dev/compare/colimareplynnx 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thank you for your work on OrbStack. Just tried it after reading about in this thread and it looks really great so far, both as Docker replacement and absolutely delightful to launch full Linux VMs.Noticed you are using a very recent kernel, Linux ubuntu 6.3.12-orbstack, which is so great to test latest revisions of Linux system calls (eg. io_uring) locally, compared to Docker old 5.x kernels which I gave up figuring out how to upgrade.Any way to select a specific kernel version for VM or container? That would be a killer feature for regression testing.replykdrag0n 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Glad to hear that!There's currently no support for changing the kernel version. I think it may not be feasible to support many versions because a lot of OrbStack's improvements are very closely tied to the kernel, and maintaining the patches for multiple versions wouldn't be worth the work. Outside of regression testing, it's rare that anything breaks and in the event that such changes occur upstream, I try to hold off on updating until they're fixed.Are you mainly interested in 5.15/6.1 LTS or other specific versions? Having an alternate LTS kernel (for a total of two options) might be a possibility in the (long term) future.replynnx 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Having the option of an \"older\" LTS kernel (say 5.15 or 5.10) would be useful so as to match the kernel used in a lot of commonly used cloud images (including Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Amazon Linux 2).replyNanana909 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]i love orbstack, like actually love it to the point where now i have to complain about its issues a lot, because i cant use anything else still has a lot of things to imrpove on in general, which are annoying when you encounter them suddenly. most frustrating for me is the \"unlimited permission\" setup. Sometimes thats useful as hell. Other times i would indeed like to run a servive using the convinience of orb stack, but you know, a little more sandboxed...I loved /Users/yyy/Documents being tied to my iCloud Drive. Had to disable that once i started using orbstack for personal reasons. orbctl / orb really need much more explanation of a lot of the options. especially whatever the config options do.or let me bind to other network interfaces not just the one :(but i love orbstack. hard too go back after finding it. impossible actually. havent been at the computer in like two weeks so mabye its changed by nowreplykdrag0n 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Totally fair! There are definitely still limitations.Support for \"isolated\" machines that don't have bind mounts is planned (https://github.com/orbstack/orbstack/issues/169). This is actually mostly implemented internally, but I'm not exposing it until a few remaining security gaps are plugged or it would just give a false sense of security.If you meant binding servers to specific interface IPs, it might be possible one day but it's very challenging to implement as all of the host's IPs need to be assigned to an interface in the guest and managed accordingly. If you meant connecting machines directly to your LAN, it'll be supported eventually but it's low priority due to unavoidable compatibility issues. https://github.com/orbstack/orbstack/issues/342replykdrag0n 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Also would be great to know which \"orb\" flags you find confusing.

This is a reasonable default, as it keeps the default VM storage small.* If you want to have additional system packages, you can turn on a ubuntu overlay that supports additional systemd services just fine. Of course, storage would balloon to a few GBs from a few hundred MBs.Edit: typos.BTW, the result of docker build is immediately available to the k8s (k3s) cluster without any insecure registry and/or side loading/caching steps, thanks to the seamless buildkit integration.replydeathanatos 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]One more caveat: mounts don't work: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/issues/503One of our tools runs in Docker just to ensure that it gets the right version of its dependencies, and that bug is a pretty huge bug for us, for that tool, as it basically broke things.Still, we use colima; it is a decent workaround for the \"Docker on macOS\" problem otherwise.replydigikata 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]For my configurations, enabling mounts with '--mount' is more verbose but works fine. https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/replybelthesar 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Borrowing this thread to add additional context, Rancher Desktop on macOS also uses Lima to make VMs for running k8s (I think it's actually k3s?) on your workstation. I've been meaning to try out Colima, since, while nerdctl is pretty functional and things work, sometimes dealing with the nuances when I don't really need a real Kubernetes environment for most of my dev tasks is more overhead than I'd like. That said, if you do need a proper k8s environment on macOS, Rancher Desktop does work quite well, and makes a lot of sense especially if your shared k8s environments are managed by Rancher.replyzokier 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There is also Finch (from AWS): https://github.com/runfinch/finch> Finch provides a simple client which is integrated with nerdctl.

It works with containerd for container management, and with BuildKit to handle Open Container Initiative (OCI) image builds.

That would be important to mention.replylloeki 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]lima (linux on macos) is a VM management tool CLI frontend which can use QEMU or Virtualization.framework as a backend, colima (containers on linux on macos) is leveraging lima to set up a linux vm to handle linux containers straight from macos (including host-vm shares, port forwardong to the vm, etc...)If you want to draw some very coarse comparisons with big names, lima is like VMware Fusion, colima is like the Docker for Mac app.colima kind of fills one of the use cases of docker-machine which kind of died as this use case was handled by DfM and the other use case (handling machines for swarm) was folded into docker swarm and docker compose.reply0xbadcafebee 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]No, Lima just sets up a VM for you. Colima is a wrapper around Lima that can configure a Docker daemon and context for you.

Even a relatively beefy VPS which is $30 / mo is only $360 / year, like a cheap used Linux laptop.On the other hand, it has much much less CPU than an MBP, and usually no GPU at all.On the third hand, the cloud allows one to quickly start more VMs, and to shut them down as quickly, something that's possible but a bit more limited on a laptop / desktop.replyNanana909 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Why pay for a whole month though? Depending on your work, spin it up and down as needed. If you're just building a binary you only need it up for minutes or seconds. Been on my mind lately. Lot more sandboxing too.

I clicked around, searched and viewed tweets. Then I looked at the requests in the log and saw it has a similar guest token process to the website but with a few differences. Anyways, if you recreate these requests, with one IP address you can generate a few OAuth tokens with no expiry per day. These tokens are for unauthenticated users so obviously they have no write privileges but that's not what was needed here. So if you have a proxy provider with a large pool of IPs where you can buy like 1GB of bandwidth you can use a very small percent of your bandwidth allowance and get thousands of tokens/secrets easily, all with their own separate rate limits. It doesn't even matter what IP you end up using the tokens on. Then I followed https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVrPoNutyqTdQ04DXBEZW4ZW... and the fact that /statuses/lookup.json still allows you to return 100 (!) tweets at once to reconstruct something close to what the 50% Twitter firehose would look like. And Twitter doesn't even block datacenter IP addresses! Was going to display the data at https://firehose.lol but the fact that it required a few hundred requests a second made me feel bad so I didn't end up running the program for more than a few minutes at a time and shut it down.Looking at (a fraction of) the Firehose for a few minutes was interesting, originally I accidentally forgot to not display tweets labelled possibly_sensitive so I saw some pretty salacious material for a few seconds. Lots of Chinese gambling ads even though Twitter is blocked there, dubious investment promoters, accounts with usernames like FirstnameLastname3781264872 who would tweet three random words at each other every couple of seconds, and a handful of funny tweets.replymatteoraso 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Nice. This isn't nearly as efficient, but a simpler way to bypass the ratelimit is to use archive.md, which is immune to the ratelimit.
