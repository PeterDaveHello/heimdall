I mean, I haven't logged in in about 20 years now, and couldn't if I wanted to (don't have the password or access to the email address). But I had a low five digit user number, and built a lot of relationships on ICQ (some of which continue today!). It was my main method of electronic communication in college. I had romantic relationships live and die on ICQ. Another reminder of how things change over time. reply lxgr 2 hours agoparentI have similar sentimental memories of ICQ. One highlight was being able to connect to it from my phone for the first time; first on my first smartphone (Symbian), then from my \"non-smart\" Sony Ericsson that succeeded it, via some Java Jabber client and a Jabber-to-ICQ bridge! (Unfortunately nobody else that I knew had it on their phones, so I could only reach people in front of their PCs at home.) On the other hand, it is and always has been unencrypted (not counting the OTR OTT encryption layer I've been using on it with the few friends that were also on Pidgin or Adium :), didn't support offline messages or even being logged in on more than one client, and was entirely proprietary (not sure if it was part of the \"chat wars\" [1] too). Ultimately, the only constant in life is change. Instant messaging is alive and well on other platforms and networks today, let's remember ICQ fondly and be happy that we have so many good alternatives :) [1] https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-19/essays/chat-wars/ reply jmbwell 1 hour agorootparentBeing reachable only from a PC at home… man. Now that I miss. The whole lifestyle of having a clear distinction between being at the computer and not. Status messages for a time when “away” was a state of being you ever were. Coming back to see whether your crush had messaged you. Simpler times for sure. Before we even had “wi-fi!” reply 101008 36 minutes agorootparentI started writing an essay about this topic. I am one of those nostalgics by the old internet. I thought it was the aesthetic (geocities, etc), but after giving it a lot of thought, that wasn't. It was that your life (all of us) was \"offline by default\". We lived offline and then we connect to the internet for a few minutes, hours, whatever. But you lived your life offline. We attended concerts, took photos, recorded videos, and then we took our time to share them online (maybe that same night, maybe the next days). You went online to discuss something that happened in real life. Now it's the reverse. We live \"online by default\". Everything happens online, all we do is first online or at least at the same time. We attend a concert? We publish pictures and videos almost instantly (some people even do a live stream from the concert!). Something happens in politics? People discuss it as it happens on Twitter, Facebook, etc. Going to the computer to connect to surf the web may sound silly, but that was the difference. Internet was inside a device you had to use. Now internet is happening around you all the time (and if you miss it for a few days, ouch!) reply lxgr 12 minutes agorootparentThe Internet being an opt-in thing that you'd consciously connect to at a set our of the day, not something that would reach out to you and notify you about all kinds of things at random times, was definitely a different feeling. Back then, it felt like a parallel world; now it's more like an overlay on this one. reply rkagerer 1 minute agorootparentprevI love how you could set different Away statuses for distinct individuals / groups. reply grishka 27 minutes agorootparentprevThe \"proper\" way of using ICQ from your phone was Jimm, an unofficial Java client. I was the cool kid with a patched Siemens phone, which could run native apps, so I used NatICQ.elf instead. reply lxgr 11 minutes agorootparentHaha, what Siemens phone could you patch to run native apps on? I must have switched to Nokia/Symbian before that became a thing. (That could run both native S60 and J2ME apps – basically infinite apps and games!) reply grishka 5 minutes agorootparentThe x65-x75 series ones, aka the \"SGold\" platform. I still have my CX75. That ELF loader patch was, without doubt, a pinnacle of patch engineering. My next phone was a Nokia 5800, one of the last Symbian ones. reply toast0 1 hour agorootparentprev> didn't support offline messages ICQ did support offline messages, from the beginning afaik, too. I had a 6-digit uin (485358 or something similar), until it got banned for running a bot (whoops). To the sibling reply, I think AIM and ICQ did have interop on messages at some point, it was much later than when ICQ moved protocols to OSCAR and TOK though. reply lxgr 56 minutes agorootparentOh, did I mix it up with MSN then, or maybe early Skype? Or did this possibly happen after the OSCAR migration? I vividly remember being amazed by offline delivery in Jabber, so at least one of ICQ or MSN must have not had it for me to even notice. reply xp84 27 minutes agorootparentCirca 2000 or so, when AIM, MSN, Yahoo! and ICQ were all flourishing, Yahoo had already added offline messages. ICQ, I think also had them, though it was probably configurable, I recall the client having a half dozen screens of options. At that moment, neither MSN nor AIM had it yet. AIM eventually did add it, though I don't recall if it was added to AIM after ICQ de-merged from the AIM backend. reply sumtechguy 8 minutes agorootparentThen something like trillian to glue them all together. reply toast0 36 minutes agorootparentprevI can't remember, but I don't think MSN had offline messages. And I don't think ICQ lost offline messaging in the OSCAR transition, IIRC, ICQ moved to OSCAR with offline messages, then AIM got them, then AIM and ICQ could talk for a while (but all my ICQ contacts that I kept had moved to AIM or MSN by then anyway). As I recall, originally, the ICQ client polled the server via UDP to see if it had any messages, and then you would do peer to peer for online messaging. But when you logged in, you'd get a cascade of the offline messages (uh, uh, uh, uh-oh) reply lxgr 18 minutes agorootparentWoah, ICQ had peer-to-peer? I thought it was quite centralized! Was that before the OSCAR migration? I only remember Skype being \"true\" peer-to-peer, with your PC randomly becoming a presence/call relaying \"supernode\" if you had a publicly reachable IP and good connectivity. Different times! reply semi 1 hour agorootparentprev>(not sure if it was part of the \"chat wars\" [1] too). Kind of in that they were a good enough competitor that AOL bought them and AOL definitely continued to fight. I don't think they ever publicly integrated them but they did merge the back ends enough that for a while you could just login to AIM with an ICQ UID, and impress all your friends with your cool numeric aim account reply nogridbag 26 minutes agoparentprevI just logged in for the first time in over 25 years a few weeks ago. I found https://web.icq.com/ which does not require an email address: only the ID and password. And back then I used a single password for everything. And it worked! All my old online friends from my childhood were there, my profile message, etc. While most were offline, a few showed up as online and I quickly messaged them! But my excitement died down as no one responded. Were their accounts hijacked? Is that status invalid? I have no idea. But I was disappointed. It's still cool the service is up all this time. reply weinzierl 2 hours agoparentprevSame for me but the day I will really cry a little will be when mIRC dies.

The ICQ client truncated long filenames in the UI, so you could send \"image.jpg (50 spaces) .exe\" which would open an embedded picture and install a back-door while just seeming like regular picture. I do miss casually texting with people on the computer rather than the phone, and I don't think it's only due to nostalgia or having more leisure time back then: - If someone was online, it would typically be a good time for a casual, interactive chat. Texting someone on the phone is (at least for me) rarely \"live\", because it usually happens at an inconvenient time for one of the parties. - Much faster to type, and easier to copy-paste stuff from other places. Can communicate almost as effortlessly as a spoken conversation. - Easier to multi-task in case of a slow reply. I don't enjoy texting on the phone. Millennial checking out. reply ssfrr 2 hours agoprev1303789 Serious question - why do so many people remember our ICQ numbers? I don’t remember what user-facing function it served. Was that actually the identifier we shared with people to connect?

It was a 12-digit number (including country code). We called her once, maybe twice a year, and usually my mother was dialling. I was maybe around 8 or 9 at the time (it was around 1988). I cannot even remember the birthdays of people close to me, let alone any phone numbers except my own. But I still remember that f*king 12-digit international phone number from almost 40 years ago... Human memory works in a weird way reply fckgw 2 hours agoparentprevWhen you joined ICQ you received a UIN and that was the only publicly searchable method to connect to other people. You could update your profile with email or username, and manually make that public, but it wasn't searchable by default. If you wanted to connect to a stranger (and the stranger didn't want their email public at the time), you would usually just use their UIN. reply Jerrrrry 2 hours agoparentprev>why do so many people remember >I suppose it also came at a time for a lot of us where things seemed to wedge into our brains more easily. The ~2million years we spent around campfires, repeating oral traditions of our forefathers, instilled a phonetic/rhythmic/mnemonic mechanism of action for remembering \"arbitrary\" information. That is why recalling phone numbers, large (mentally untoken-able) words, and the digits of PI all are far easier when done in the sing-song fashion - it is utilizing the highly-optimized linguistic/recall portion, we evolved to handle the near-rote-memorization required to allow our culture to survive. reply sarnowski 2 hours agoparentprevIt is from a time when we were used to remember phone numbers, and where we shared our phone numbers to keep in touch (calls, sms). ICQ directly picked on that and it was just another „phone number“. Unfortunately I only remember the first half of mine after so many years. In the age of smartphones, at least my brain degenerated to not be able to recall more than a handful of important phone numbers. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentI still remember the phone number I had from when I was 10-19, but I can't remember my sons or my mums phone numbers, or indeed any numbers I've had or used since I was 19 other than my current number that I got in my 30's. Basically, the moment I got my first cellphone in '95 or so, I stopped learning phone numbers, other than remembering my current number because I give it out regularly. But also, I think, because my parents drilled that old number into me, because remembering it was a \"lifeline\". reply phantom784 2 hours agorootparentI made a point to memorize my wife's and my parents' cell numbers, just in case I'm ever in a situation where I don't have a phone and need to reach them (like if I got robbed or something). reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentIt's a sensible thing to do, but I have so many ways to get at online services where I can reach them that it hasn't felt pressing - if I'm in a situation where the only phone I can get hold of isn't a smartphone it sounds more like a 999 or nearest consulate kind of situation... But you're right it'd probably be worth doing anyway. reply ssl-3 1 hour agorootparentSo you get robbed (or something), and you're physically OK but have no phone and no wallet. You find a phone to use, however you do that, and dial the local emergency number (0118 999 881 999 119 725...3), and maybe they show up and take a report. And then they leave.

Either way, it's pretty sad. reply jaredsohn 2 hours agoparentprevI think it showed it in the client along with your name handle. Maybe was the easiest way to add people you knew in real life, esp if you didn't make your real name searchable. (Remember at the time people were more paranoid about staying anonymous on the Internet; this was before most social networks.) reply karaterobot 1 hour agoparentprevI agree with the suggestion that people just don't commit as many things to memory anymore, but that doesn't explain why we still remember certain random numbers from so long ago, while forgetting others. I can instantly recall my ICQ number, but there are plenty of old friends' phone numbers I've forgotten, and those were people I called multiple times a week for years. Here's a free hypothesis: Maybe it was important to remember your ICQ number. Without it, your message history and contact list was out of reach. In that sense, it fits in the same mental space as a password. What I mean is, there was a cost to losing it. So, you were incentivized to commit it to memory in a way that you weren't with many other numbers. In contrast, while it would be inconvenient to forget a friend's phone number if you wanted to chat with them, at least you had options. You could generally look them up in the white pages, or call a another friend and get their number, or just ask them when you saw that person again at school the next day. So, the cost for not remembering a phone number was lower than the cost for not remembering your own ICQ number, and this probably made it mentally stickier. ... Another possibility is a confirmation bias. Maybe we're just not hearing from the 95% of ICQ users who can't remember their number. reply barbazoo 49 minutes agoparentprev889246** I forgot what I had for lunch yesterday but somehow I can remember my ICQ number. reply agumonkey 1 hour agoparentprevHmm I only remembered it partially, but I see it was on old phpbb boards.

Honestly it's a bewildering choice for the default \"message received\" sound of an IM client. It's so very alarming. I can only guess that the makers were expecting you to be a room away from your tower PC (with its deluxe 18\" CRT display and mouse cables that required a screwdriver) to make sure you never missed a message.

Got ICQ in late 1998, and I remember my UIN as well, suprisingly -- unlike the dozen of mobile phone numbers I had over last 20 years. Internet back then connected you to people who you'd not meet in everyday life, and ICQ was a new unusual place to discuss anything with them. It gave you a new view of people you knew. I remember in the last grade at school I had some intimate conversations with a female classmate, which I couldn't imagine doing at school in front of many eyes. It was a dating and meeting app too: rando people would write to other random people. Although these talks were superficial and today I'd see them disenchanting, back then it was an interesting alternatives to offline sociality. A recall from 2003: me and sister having desktop computers, chatting with all the people on neighborhood LAN and sometimes messaging each other over ICQ -- too busy to walk to the next room and speak. Then I used it at office work, mostly to appoint dates with girls from another department. At the time, in 2007, it wasn't exclusive anymore, but like a mark of being web-literate, and girls were easier about telling you a UIN rather than a phone. Then social networks came, and even before mobile integration they were much richer -- all the life went there. Ah, good old days -- make a party, do stupid contests, take photos with a soapbox digital camera, and then pour the entire SD card in the meeting album -- no editing, no removal of closed or red eyed faces, or weird postures or opened mouths. Just let everyone see how fooly they were. And what was different from ICQ was that everybody was aware that everybody was aware. ICQ had no chance, LOL. (edit: And there was Skype too.)

ICQ didn’t (ever?) need the double coincidence of being online. Even iMessage and its fallback SMS today are bad for this. Fun MSN story: I read you could put curse words in your name subtitle if you used 0x ascii hex codes for one of the characters. So I pulled up the list of ascii codes and hoped that “beep” would work, but it did not make anyone beep. Then I tried null, and it made all my contacts go offline, and offline again as soon as they logged back in. Again and again.

Everyone I knew preferred third-party clients to the official one, and these clients would sometimes break because ICQ kept changing tiny details in the protocol to try to force users to use the official client.

I was more of an AIM guy than ICQ, but I had a tendency to bother creators on Newgrounds, some of which would leave their ICQ numbers, so I would use it occasionally. There are obvious advantages to newer IM/texting clients, but these old ones were a pretty vital part of my teenage years. The main reason I learned how to type properly was so I could communicate with my friends better on AIM. I spent way too much time figuring out how to use alternative IM clients like Trillian and gAIM so I could avoid advertisements, I spent a lot of time customizing my AIM profile and playing with different fonts, and having friends spam mean with \"chain messages\". I loved seeing creators from NewGrounds sign on at 4am and still be willing to talk to me.

What about e-mail? Or the phone network? Or the internet in general? Yes, there can be some social aspects to it. But that by itself does not make it into a social network.

    "title": "Understanding 2D Rigid Body Collisions in Video Games: A Beginner's Guide",
    "originLink": "https://www.sassnow.ski/rigid-body-collisions/1",
    "originBody": "2D Rigid Body Collision Resolution Part 1: Defining the problem From Mario bouncing off a Goomba to two cars bumping into each other in a racing game, dealing with collisions is such an integral part of most video games that we often take it for granted. Try me out! In this series of blog posts, I want to show you what actually goes on behind the scenes in a physics simulation like the one above. While we're going to look at this through the lens video games, this post is really about the actual math and physics of collisions. Video games are just a nice way to contextualize these concepts and help make things a little less abstract. A word about math While these articles will involve a fair bit of math, please don't be discouraged by that if you don't consider yourself to be a \"math person\". I think this kind of thinking is harmful and actively prevents you from engaging with topics that you might actually enjoy! Many times, it's the math notation that makes things look more complicated than they actually are because it's so information-dense and unfamiliar. Most of the math in these articles will be fairly straight-forward arithmetic but dressed up to look fancy! This is something that's really dear to my heart. I think too many people have this instinctive reaction of \"I'm not smart enough to understand this\" whenever they see any kind of math notation. While I can definitely empathize with this, I encourage you to fight this reaction because at some point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. BEFORE WE START Let's set our expectations and define a few terms. RIGID BODIES The specific kind of physics simulation we are going to cover is called rigid body physics. A rigid body is a body that does not deform when subjected to forces. This is an idealized model because true rigid bodies do not exist in the real world; everything deforms on the molecular level even if this deformation is not visible to the naked eye. For most physics simulations, trying to simulate this level of detail is not only extremely difficult (if not flat out impossible) and computationally expensive, it's also unnecessary. As long as our bodies behave realistically, we're allowed to simplify as much as we want. Rigid bodies are one such simplification. This might sound a little abstract at the moment but will hopefully start to make sense as we work through our examples. COLLISION DETECTION VS. COLLISION RESOLUTION In a video game engine, dealing with collisions can be broken down into two distinct phases: collision detection and collision resolution. Collision detection is about determining which bodies in our scene are colliding. This usually involves a bunch of geometry to check if two shapes are intersecting or overlapping. Depending on how many objects there are in our scene, this can be quite computationally expensive and is usually heavily optimized. The result of this step is then used in the collision resolution step. Collision resolution is the process of figuring out what needs to happen to two colliding bodies based on things like their current movement directions, speeds, materials, and many other things. In this series of blog posts, we're only looking at the collision resolution phase as this where all the interesting physics happens. Ok, enough preamble. Let's get started! WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO? Let's start out by trying to define the problem we're trying to solve. Most games run in a big loop. In order to make things move on the screen, the game engine needs to continually calculate the positions of the various objects in the scene. So on each iteration of the game loop, the position of each of object gets updated a tiny amount based on its current velocity. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. We can represent an object's current velocity with an arrow where the length of the arrow represents the object's current speed and the direction the arrow is pointing its travel direction. In the demonstration below, you can change the box's velocity by dragging the arrow around. If you ever get lost in space, you can always reset the simulation with the button. Velocities Velocity describes the change in position of an object over a certain time interval Δ 𝑡 Δt. In physics, this change in position is called displacement and is usually denoted 𝑠 ⃗ s . Whenever you see a little arrow over a variable like this 𝑠 ⃗ s , this means that the variable is a vector. Therefore, we can see that displacement is also a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. In order to find an object's new position, we first calculate the displacement based on the object's current velocity. Where Δ 𝑡 Δt is the time that has passed since the last iteration of our game loop. So if our game loop runs 60 times per second, then Δ 𝑡 Δt would be 1 60 60 1 of a second. We then add the displacement to the object's current position to get its new position for the current frame. We do this for every object in our scene and lo' and behold. Things are moving! What happens if the new positions of two objects would cause their geometries to overlap? The scene below shows two objects and their current velocities on a certain frame in our game loop. Let's think about what would happen if we didn't do anything special and simply continued with the next iteration of our game loop. In this case, the physics engine would update each objects' positions as usual based on its current velocity. This would cause the objects to penetrate each other and eventually pass through each other. You can see this happening in the demonstration below by dragging the slider to progress time. Without collision resolution 𝑡 t This situation, where continuing to update the objects' positions would cause the objects to penetrate, is called a collision. Part of a physics engine's job is to resolve collisions between objects. Conceptually, this is actually quite simple. The goal of collision resolution is to change each object's velocity so that as the simulation progresses the objects will no longer penetrate each other. After collision resolution After collision 𝑡 t We can define two equations for the respective post-collision velocities of our bodies. Where 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 , 𝑖 v a,i and 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 , 𝑖 v b,i are the velocities of bodies 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b before the collision, 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 , 𝑓 v a,f and 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 , 𝑓 v b,f the velocities after the collision, and Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 Δ v a and Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 Δ v b the respective changes in velocity caused by the collision. The subscripts 𝑖 i and 𝑓 f stand for initial and final, respectively. Collision Resolution The goal of collision resolution is to find the values of Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 Δ v a and Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 Δ v b . If we want our collision behavior to look realistic, we have to ensure that whatever values we pick for Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 Δ v a and Δ 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 Δ v b satisfy the relevant laws of physics. What are these laws? Well, that's what the majority of this series of articles is going to be about! To start, let's try defining what a collision is a little more rigorously. WHAT IS A COLLISION? Take a look at the scene below. This scene shows two bodies on a specific frame of our game. We can see that the bodies are touching, but are they colliding? In the last section we learned that two bodies are said to be colliding if continuing to move them along their current velocities would cause them to penetrate each other. So, with the information we've been given, can we actually determine if the scene above depicts a collision or not? We can't! All we know is that the bodies are touching. We haven't been given any information about their velocities. To see why this matters, take a look at the demonstration below. You can change the velocities of the bodies by dragging the arrows around. The indicator tells you if the current configuration would lead to a collision or no collision. You can verify the result by playing the simulation. Checking for collisions Collision We can see that depending on the velocities of the bodies, the same scene can either represent a collision or not. That doesn't look right You might have noticed that the way the two boxes bounce off each other looks a little strange. This is because, in order to keep things simple for now, we're not yet making the boxes spin when they hit each other. Don't worry we'll add that in a later post, but let's try and keep the complexity to a minimum for now. TOWARDS A DEFINITION In order for two bodies to be colliding, two conditions have to be met: The bodies' geometries have to be touching or overlapping The bodies are still moving towards the collision Let's assume that point 1 is true for now and focus on point 2, instead. What does it mean for two bodies to be moving \"towards the collision\"? This seems like a pretty circular definition. Instead of asking what it means to move towards the collision, let's ask what it means to move away from the collision. In fact, let's ignore collisions entirely for a moment. What does it mean to move away from a surface? The image below shows a box sitting on the floor. What direction would you have to move the box in order to move it away from the floor? At first glance, this seems like a silly question. Obviously, we'd have to move the box up. However, there are an infinite number of directions that we could move the box! As long as we are moving it generally upwards, we are increasing the distance between the box and the floor. Notice that while the box was moved the exact same distance in each direction—that is, the length of the arrows is the same—some of the boxes are clearly further away from the floor than others. So, are some of these directions more \"up\" than others? Is there a direction that is most \"up\"? To explore this idea, let's play a little game. SURFACE NORMALS You are given a box sitting on the floor. Your goal is to move the box so that its distance to the floor is as close as possible to the total distance the box was moved. It doesn't matter how far you move the box, just that these two distances are as close to each other as possible. To make things a little more challenging, the angle of inclination of the floor is going to change every time you reset the game. Maximize the distance I know, I know, Game of the Year material right here. But hopefully you were able to figure out that the direction that maximizes the distance between the box and the floor is the direction that is perpendicular to the floor, which isn't necessarily straight up! This direction is called the normal direction, often referred to as simply the normal of the surface. The normal direction of a surface is always perpendicular to the surface. It is the direction that points directly away from the surface. Normal direction Normal directions are represented with a normalized vector; that is, a vector with length 1 1. A vector with length 1 1 is also called a unit vector. To make it clear that a vector is normalized, we often add a little hat on top of the variable like this 𝑛 ^ n ^ . If our surface is perfectly straight, the normal direction is the same everywhere on the surface. However, if the surface is curved, the normal direction will be different for each point on the surface. The easiest way to demonstrate this is with a circle. If we stick with the idea that the normal direction points directly away from a surface, then the normal direction for any point on the circle's circumference is the direction from the center of the circle to that point. More generally, the normal direction for a point on a surface is perpendicular to the tangent of the surface at that point. 𝑥 x We saw earlier that it isn't necessary to move the box directly in the normal direction in order to move it away from the floor. What all these directions have in common, is that they all generally point in the same direction as the surface normal. We say that these directions have some component in the normal direction. Let's take a closer look at what this means, exactly. THE DOT PRODUCT To calculate how much of one vector is pointing in the same direction as another vector, we can use the dot product of the two vectors. In our example, the two vectors are the direction we move the box and the surface normal. The dot product between two vectors 𝑎 ⃗ a and 𝑏 ⃗ b is written as 𝑎 ⃗ ⋅ 𝑏 ⃗ a ⋅ b . The dot product can be defined either algebraically or geometrically. Algebraically, the dot product is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the two vectors. For two-dimensional vectors such as the ones we're dealing with, we can write this as: Note that the result of the dot product is a scalar, not another vector. While this is fairly straight-forward to calculate, it's not exactly obvious what this scalar represents. Luckily, there is also a geometric interpretation of the dot product that can be visualized nicely. Say we have two vectors a and b that have some angle θ between them. Next, starting from the tip of a let's draw a line perpendicular to b connecting the two vectors. The length from the base of b to the point where the perpendicular line intersects b is called the scalar projection s of a onto b. Imagine a light that's perfectly perpendicular to b shining down on a. The scalar projection is the length of the shadow that a casts on b. Since we now have a right triangle, trigonometry tells us that the length of this projection is the product of the length of a (the hypotenuse) and the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. To be precise, it's the absolute value of the scalar projection that gives us the length of the shadow, since we will see in a moment that the scalar projection can also be negative. This is equivalent to the dot product of a and the unit vector 𝑏 ^ b ^ in the direction of b. Well hold on, that's a bit of a bait and switch! Why are we suddenly talking about the unit vector in the direction of b? That's not what we wanted to find! How do we get the dot product between a and b itself? By definition, 𝑏 ^ b ^ and 𝑏 ⃗ b are already pointing in the same direction. The only difference between them is their length. Since unit vectors have a length of 1, all we have to do is multiply 𝑏 ^ b ^ by the length of 𝑏 ⃗ b . Therefore, multiplying both sides of by ∥ 𝑏 ⃗ ∥ ∥ b ∥ gives us the full geometric definition of the dot product. In English, the dot product of two vectors is the length of the scalar projection of one vector onto the other, multiplied by the length of the vector we're projecting onto. Before moving on, take a second to think about the following questions. You can click on them to reveal the answers. I mentioned earlier that the scalar projection, and therefore the dot product, can also be negative. A lot of the time, we're actually more interested in the sign of the dot product rather than its actual value. The demonstration below shows the dot product between two vectors as well as the angle between them. You can control the angle between the vectors with the slider below. The angle is normalized to always be between 0° and 180°. Pay attention to the sign of the dot product as you change the angle. Can you tell at what angles the dot product is negative or positive? How about when it's zero? Think about how looking at the sign of the dot product can help us determine if two vectors are generally pointing in the same direction or not. 𝜃 θ If the angle between the vectors is acute (less than 9 0 ∘ 90 ∘ ), the dot product is positive. A positive dot product indicates that the vectors are generally pointing in the same direction. If the angle is obtuse (greater than 9 0 ∘ 90 ∘ ), the dot product is negative. A negative dot product indicates that the vectors are generally pointing in opposite directions. If the angle is exactly 9 0 ∘ 90 ∘ , the dot product is zero. TYING IT ALL TOGETHER We started out by asking what it means for two bodies to be moving towards the collision. To answer this, we took a slight detour and looked at what it means to move away from a surface. Using the dot product, we can now answer the second question. As long as the velocity vector of the body has some component in the normal direction of the surface normal, i.e. the dot product between these vectors is positive, the body is moving away from the surface. Even so, it might not be immediately obvious how this helps us answer the original question. Let's look at our two boxes again. This situation differs from the previous example of the box and the floor in two ways: We have two velocity vectors instead of one, one for each box. Which one do we use? There is no \"surface\", is there? What is our surface normal? To answer the first question, instead of using the individual velocities of the boxes, we use their relative velocity. As the name implies, the relative velocity tells us the velocities of the bodies relative to each other. The relative velocity is the vector difference between the individual velocities. In this article, I will denote the relative velocity of bodies 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b as 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 𝑏 v ab . Geometrically, the relative velocity 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 𝑏 v ab is the vector that points from the tip of the velocity vector 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑏 v b to the tip of the velocity vector 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 v a . All other things being equal, two cars hitting each other head-on at 50 km h 50 h km each is the same as one car hitting a stationary car at 100 km h 100 h km . What about the second question? What's our surface and its corresponding normal? What we're looking for is called the collision normal. Unfortunately, the way you calculate the collision normal depends on the shapes (or geometries) of the colliding bodies, so I can't just show you a single formula. What we're dealing with is called a vertex-edge collision. In this type of collision, a point (or vertex) on one body collides with a side (or edge) of another body. We'll talk more about collision normals when we take a look at the forces that act during the collision. For now, you'll have to take my word that in a vertex-edge collision, the collision normal is perpendicular to the edge. In our example, the collision normal looks like this: If we label our bodies a and b, by convention, the collision normal points toward body a. It's fairly arbitrary which body is called a or b as long as we're consistent throughout our calculations. Based on what we learned about surface normals earlier, the collision normal tells us the direction that points directly away from the surface of the collision. We can now calculate the dot product between the relative velocity of the bodies 𝑣 ⃗ 𝑎 𝑏 v ab and the collision normal 𝑛 ^ n ^ to determine if the bodies are moving towards the collision or not. We'll call this value the relative normal velocity. It is the component of the relative velocity in the direction of the collision normal. For now, we only care about the sign of the relative normal velocity, but we'll see later on that it plays an important part in calculating the forces that act during the collision. Using our understanding of the dot product, we can say that if the relative normal velocity is positive, the bodies are already separating if the relative normal velocity is negative, the bodies are still smashing into each other The demonstration below combines all concepts we've learned so far. As before, you can change the velocities of the boxes by dragging the arrowheads. The top right corner shows the collision normal and relative velocity of the bodies. You can see that as soon as the angle between the relative velocity and the collision normal is less than or equal to 9 0 ∘ 90 ∘ —and therefore the dot product is positive—the bodies are no longer colliding. Checking for collisions Collision So, finally, we can formally define what a collision is: Definition A collision occurs when a point on one body touches a point on another body with a negative relative normal velocity. Neat! CONCLUSION If you made it to this point, pat yourself on the back! We now have a formal definition of what a collision is, as well as the set of equations we're ultimate trying to solve when resolving collisions (see ). Not bad at all! In the next post, we'll dive into the actual physics behind collisions. If you enjoyed this article, you'll love the next part! This is all I have for you today.

To give some context, this is only part one in a series of blog posts I plan on writing about rigid body physics.

Which is why I spend so much time explaining concepts that would appear almost trivial to someone who has experience in this area. Happy to answer any questions you might have. reply kibbi 4 hours agoparentFeedback: Your introduction \"From Mario bouncing off a Goomba...\" might be a bit misleading IMO because most games like the classic Super Mario titles on NES and SNES do not require and did not use most of these calculations. Game development beginners often have the wrong impression that they need rigid body collision calculations or a 2D physics engine like Box2D to handle collisions. That's true if you want to make a game like Pool or something with collapsing stacks of crates like Angry Birds. But for a 2D platformer you only need to detect collisions by comparing (axis-aligned) rectangles and to handle collisions by changing the moving character's X and Y coordinates (to undo an overlap) or setting the character's Y velocity (after using the jump button, or after landing on a Goomba's head). This also makes it easier for the developer to finetune exactly how moving the character should feel like. (This includes inertia, but this inertia is usually not physically realistic.) Trying to use realistic physics as a gamedev beginner can easily lead to floaty and unsatisfying movement.

The idea is to have top down look, have each player control some kind of ship and fly in an enclosed area filled with space debris and shot opponents. An important aspect of this game is that the space debris can be moved around the arena and used creatively to capture opponents, prevent them from achieving their goals, etc. As part of the project I was thinking we will skip game engine altogether because I wanted to teach my son a bit more about how to structure the application, etc. I thought in future we would use a ready game engine but at least once we would go through the exercise of implementing everything. Everything was fine until we approached the problem of collision detection and handling. That's when things went downhill pretty quickly. Even with my theoretical math background I was soon consumed with just enormous amount of corner cases and finally decided to relent and use Box2d for this. I am not a professional game developer, but I have over 20 years of development experience + math background and I still made the mistake of underestimating the problem.

The point is you fly in a small spaceship in an arena, you hide behind obstacles, you shoot with a small variety of weapons and you use your weapons to either shoot the enemy directly or rearrange the map to make life difficult for your them. The collisions need to be realistic because you need to be able to predict what is going to happen when you hit things a certain way. It is just a concept we are playing with. Another part of that concept is that this game is meant for small kids that can't read. There is not a single letter or digit in the entire game. No menu. You just start the controller and get immediately pulled into the game. And another feature is we wanted the game fun because the control feel fun and immediate.

This has been known since the days of Gauss and Hamilton, and is fundamentally how restitution and collision forces are derived in Lagrangian mechanics. There's a long literature on this going back more than a hundred years. It's true that some commercial solvers like Ansys use spring/penalty methods, but this is due to the spring forces being easier to couple to other solvers. It's harder in the Ansys force/velocity formulation to combine things like elasticity and fluids to their rigid body solver. To deal with the instability of systems of many stiff springs they have to take many small timesteps to avoid convergence issues. More recently techniques like XPBD have been gaining popularity, particularly in film, which use purely positional constraints and variational methods to combine many different types of physics simulations. There's a really great and approachable series of videos by Matthias Muller on youtube which goes through how to implement all this in JS https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/ Finally it's funny you should mention games, since many older games used spring methods for physics. It was only when constraint based solvers became popular after Havok/Half-Life 2 did we start to see games with real rigid body dynamics and stable stacking of boxes. Older physics games like Trespasser ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespasser_(video_game) ) had many bugs due to the use of hacky spring physics.

I've written some of this stuff for a few games now, and the resources below have stood the test of time IMO [0] https://dyn4j.org/2010/01/sat/ [1] https://realtimecollisiondetection.net/pubs/SIGGRAPH04_Erics... [2] https://allenchou.net/2013/12/game-physics-broadphase/ reply filleduchaos 41 minutes agorootparentWell yeah, people often assume that because they know how to tell if two shapes are currently intersecting, they've solved collision detection...and then their games turn out to have a bunch of detection-related bugs and glitches. Most notoriously, lots of homebrewed physics libraries suffer badly from tunnelling (i.e. when one or both bodies are moving so fast that they completely pass through another before the next time collision is naively checked, and so the checker fails to detect a collision at all). And on top of that there is more to collision detection than just code IMO - setting up hitboxes that both feel right for the player and aren't visually glitchy is not as straightforward as it might seem, especially with 3D. (Also, figuring out contact points is part of competently implemented collision detection.) reply mort96 5 hours agoparentprevI mean there's a lot of material out there already about collision detection though.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica",
    "originBody": "🚀 Perplexica - An AI-powered search engine 🔎 Table of Contents Overview Preview Features Installation Getting Started with Docker (Recommended) Non-Docker Installation Ollama connection errors Using as a Search Engine One-Click Deployment Upcoming Features Support Us Donations Contribution Help and Support Overview Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited. Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy. Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it here. Preview Features Local LLMs: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama. Two Main Modes: Copilot Mode: (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page. Normal Mode: Processes your query and performs a web search. Focus Modes: Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes: All Mode: Searches the entire web to find the best results. Writing Assistant Mode: Helpful for writing tasks that does not require searching the web. Academic Search Mode: Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research. YouTube Search Mode: Finds YouTube videos based on the search query. Wolfram Alpha Search Mode: Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha. Reddit Search Mode: Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query. Current Information: Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates. It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in upcoming features. Installation There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended. Getting Started with Docker (Recommended) Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. Clone the Perplexica repository: git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files. Rename the sample.config.toml file to config.toml. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields: OPENAI: Your OpenAI API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models. OLLAMA: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use http://host.docker.internal:11434. For other ports, adjust accordingly. You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's. GROQ: Your Groq API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models Note: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog. SIMILARITY_MEASURE: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.) Ensure you are in the directory containing the docker-compose.yaml file and execute: docker compose up -d Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. Note: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal. Non-Docker Installation Clone the repository and rename the sample.config.toml file to config.toml in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file. Rename the .env.example file to .env in the ui folder and fill in all necessary fields. After populating the configuration and environment files, run npm i in both the ui folder and the root directory. Install the dependencies and then execute npm run build in both the ui folder and the root directory. Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running npm run start in both the ui folder and the root directory. Note: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies. See the installation documentation for more information like exposing it your network, etc. Ollama connection errors If you're facing an Ollama connection error, it is often related to the backend not being able to connect to Ollama's API. How can you fix it? You can fix it by updating your Ollama API URL in the settings menu to the following: On Windows: http://host.docker.internal:11434 On Mac: http://host.docker.internal:11434 On Linux: http://private_ip_of_computer_hosting_ollama:11434 You need to edit the ports accordingly. Using as a Search Engine If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps: Open your browser's settings. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section. Add a new site search with the following URL: http://localhost:3000/?q=%s. Replace localhost with your IP address or domain name, and 3000 with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.

If the term was merely “descriptive” of the service provided, like “American Airlines”, then the company would need to show that the term has acquired distinctiveness: ie, that purchasers associate the term with that specific company. But perplexity is probably more than merely descriptive here. Assuming that they have a valid trademark, the issue becomes whether there is a likelihood of confusion between Perplexity and Perplexica. That is a fact-specific, multifactor test, which I’ll spare you. But there could be arguments both ways IMO EDIT: trademark issues aside, cool project! reply michael-ax 7 hours agorootparentprevWhich is why Trademarks are a non-issue here.

    "originBody": "Kabosu, the Dog Behind the ‘Doge’ Meme, Has Died \"Kabosu crossed the rainbow bridge.\" BY WESLEY YIN-POOLE UPDATED: MAY 24, 2024 8:52 AM POSTED: MAY 24, 2024 8:35 AM Kabosu, the dog behind the ‘doge’ meme, has died at the age of 18, according to her owner. The Japanese shiba inu had been suffering from leukaemia and liver disease. \"To all of you who loved Kabosu, on the morning of the 24 May, Kabosu crossed the rainbow bridge. Thank you all so much for your support over the years,\" Atsuko Sato, her owner, said in a post on Instagram as well as in a blog post. \"She went very peacefully without suffering, as if falling asleep while feeling the warmth of my hands petting her. Thank you all so much for loving Kabosu all these years. I am certain Kabosu was the happiest dog in the world. That makes me the happiest owner in the world. I would like to express my deepest appreciation to everyone who has sent us much love to us.\" IMAGE CREDIT: INSTAGRAM. Sato, a teacher in Japan, adopted Kabosu in 2008 when she was sent to an animal shelter after her puppy mill shut down. Kabosu became an internet sensation after a 2010 photo of her posted to Sato's personal blog showing Kabosu appearing to smirk was referred to online as “Doge”, an intentional misspelling of dog. The meme itself includes comic sans text that represents an internal monologue deliberately written in broken English. Doge would go on to inspire a cryptocurrency called Dogecoin which Elon Musk has repeatedly tweeted about — often corresponding with a brief surge in value, and a non-fungible token (NFT) that sold for $4 million. IMAGE CREDIT: ATSUKO SATO.

Overwhelmingly, most people do not have that power. It needs to be such a simple, obvious message that resonates with everyone to a point they themselves are encouraged to share it. It needs to pass the over-the-shoulder test, where someone simply glancing over your shoulder and seeing it can understand what it is and get value from it. The author's intent doesn't matter, really, they don't have control over it at all. It is simply stumbling by accident into a message that /already/ resonates with a vast majority of people.

    "originBody": "Voxel Displacement Renderer — Modernizing the Retro 3D Aesthetic May 19, 2024 — by Daniel Schroeder in Graphics This is the first of two posts about a renderer I have been developing, focusing on what I’ve built and how it works. The second post discusses why I’ve built it and my plans for the future. I’ve been developing a custom real-time renderer which uses very small voxels to produce a distinctive visual style that modernizes the look and feel of classic 90’s 3D games. By approaching the problem of rendering voxels in an unusual way, I’m able to produce these visuals from conventional art assets — low-poly triangle meshes and textures — that are familiar and efficient to create. Before going further, a video is worth a thousand words. (Set quality to 1440p and view full-screen for best results.) Read on for more information about the chosen visual style, how I approach it at a technical level, what this means for creating art assets and environments, and where I’m going from here. Aesthetic motivation Early-to-mid 90’s 3D games like Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem were immensely influential for their technology and gameplay. More recently, the limitations of their visuals have taken on a retro appeal. Environment geometry was simple and imaginative, and textures were displayed with sharp pixel boundaries. I see this as 3D’s counterpart to the stylized abstraction of 2D pixel art. This has become a popular aesthetic for modern retro-inspired games, and 3D indie titles more broadly. BTSX Episode 2, a community-made level set for Doom 2 featuring custom textures. I started this work with a simple question: what if, instead of blocky two-dimensional details, the surfaces in these environments had blocky three-dimensional details — voxels, instead of pixels? For example, a cobblestone wall could pop with geometric depth while retaining a pixelated look when viewed up close. As I fleshed out this idea and built the renderer you see in the video, I aimed for the visuals to have a foot in both worlds between the look of 90’s games and something more modern. To put it another way: this is what Doom looked like to me when I was young. How voxels usually work Before getting into how I model and render this voxel aesthetic, it’s worth reviewing how voxels are typically used in games, and some of the consequences this has. (Or, skip ahead to “what I’ve built.”) A voxel mesh is a three-dimensional grid where every cube-shaped cell is filled in or empty. These cubes may be large and textured, like in Minecraft, or small and solid-colored, like in Teardown1. To build a large environment with voxels, you can place all the geometry on a shared grid (Minecraft), or position many independent voxel meshes into the same space (Teardown). Regardless, once you decide your game world will be formed with voxels, you have to create this voxel geometry, and your rendering and gameplay logic needs to operate in terms of voxels. Big voxels, little voxels. (Minecraft, Teardown.) Software exists to author voxel meshes directly, but the process is time-consuming and often limited to creating smaller meshes. You can create larger environments by modeling building blocks, like tileable sections of wall or floor, and assembling them into larger structures. This works well for grid-aligned buildings but poorly for free-flowing terrain. Many voxel games instead opt for procedural generation, which works great for natural environments and can be used to combine building blocks like the ones mentioned above automatically. But procedural generation brings its own headaches, and is only suitable for certain kinds of games. It’s also possible to create voxel geometry by modeling the object or terrain that you want as a conventional triangle mesh and then rasterizing it to a voxel grid. This is a powerful technique, though it does mean that all the resulting geometry occupies a single voxel grid, which may not be desirable aesthetically. For example, if one face in the triangle mesh is axis-aligned and another is at a 45-degree angle, the first face will become a flat slab of voxels, while the second will look like a staircase. Whatever method you use to create your voxel geometry, because your scene is canonically represented in terms of voxels, your rendering and game logic need to operate at the voxel level. Especially if the voxels are small, this may mean having to implement your own physics, character controller, NPC pathfinding, etc., as well as rendering. On the plus side, it’s easy to add or remove geometry from voxel meshes; games like Minecraft and Teardown take full advantage of this strength. How displacement usually works In my case, I simply want to add voxel-like surface detailing to the kinds of environments found in classic 3D games. Those environments consist of largely static, texture-mapped triangle meshes. So what about solving the problem with displacement mapping? For folks who aren’t familiar with it, displacement mapping pairs your textures with displacement maps that define how far each pixel of the texture should extend inwards or outwards from the surface of the mesh. This can be a very fast way for artists to add detail to geometry. 3D modeling software can apply displacement maps to geometry by subdividing the mesh and then displacing the new vertices, so the displacement from the texture becomes real geometry, even affecting the silhouette of the object. The resulting meshes have radically higher polygon counts, however, and input meshes that have hard edges or corners must be modified to produce good results. An example of displacement mapping as used in 3D modeling, showing an albedo map (top left), a corresponding displacement map (top right), and a mesh that has been subdivided and displaced accordingly (bottom, showing triangle edges on the right). Material by Dimitrios Savva, CC0 license. For real-time graphics, displacement maps are sometimes used with surface shading effects like parallax occlusion mapping to create the appearance of fine geometric details on meshes without actually changing their physical shape. These effects can look good on large floors and walls, but the illusion breaks down along the edges of objects, where the geometry remains flat2. An example of parallax occlusion mapping, showing a mesh before and after applying the effect. The edges of the object are unaffected by the apparent 3D detailing. Screenshots are from a babylon.js demo. A method known as shell mapping provides something of a middle ground between the two approaches above, making it possible to see displacement even along the silhouette of an object without having to form a highly subdivided mesh. However, it struggles with areas where the input mesh has high curvature3; this makes it hard to adapt input meshes that have hard edges or corners for use with the technique. What I’ve built — mixing voxels and displacement mapping For my purposes, I wanted to use conventional low-poly meshes to model environments like those of classic 3D games, apply displacement maps to define voxel-scale surface details, and render a result that truly looks like it was built from voxels. These environments are full of sharp edges, like the corner of a building. Conventional displacement mapping already struggles with these regions; in my case, I also wanted the results to look like voxels. A section of the demo environment before and after displacement. The brown stone arches are created as triangle meshes and then displaced, but the results look like they are assembled from voxels, even along the edges of the original mesh. Solving this problem was very, very hard, and involved building a lot of custom machinery. (For now, this is a standalone C++ / Vulkan project; more about that below.) This infrastructure performs three main tasks: Taking the triangle meshes that define the environment, plus limited information about the displacement maps, and converting them into the geometry data that the renderer will load onto the GPU to draw the displaced versions of the meshes4. This process runs on the CPU before any frames have been rendered. In a shipped game, you could bake the results to disk, though this isn’t too expensive; for the demo environment in the video, converting the entire scene on a single thread takes half a second. Pre-processing the textures to generate other information needed during rendering, such as normal maps. This work is pretty basic, but it is slow, so you’d definitely bake the results. Using the mesh and texture state generated above to draw the voxel-displacement geometry. This happens on the GPU with almost no CPU involvement per frame. While there’s room for further optimization, it already performs well: on a Radeon RX 5700 XT (which was considered a 1440p card when it launched in 2019), the demo sequence seen in the YouTube video renders at 1440p with frame times from 4 to 9 ms (250 to 110 FPS). On a Steam Deck OLED at its native 800p, the sequence stays above 60 FPS, with many areas locked at 90. Creating art assets and environments So, the tech exists; what does it look like to make content for it? There are two kinds of assets to create: textures and meshes. I author each texture as an albedo map and a displacement map. For the albedo, I’ve found that imitating the limited palette of retro games helps to sell the visual style. The displacement maps look very standard, providing fine-grained height values that you can rescale in the renderer to make the displacement more or less intense. In this case, the units for the rescaled height values are how many voxels inward or outward to move the surface. The renderer only displaces to the nearest whole number of voxels, but it uses the exact heights to calculate a normal map, so that features less than a voxel tall can still affect the lighting. Albedo and displacement maps for the gray stone block material, and the rendered result. Large changes in displacement become voxel-scale geometry; subtler changes, like the ridges on the surface of each stone, may not become voxels but do affect how the surface is lit. Next are the meshes. These are conventional low-poly texture-mapped triangle meshes with shading normals. The normals indicate which sections of the mesh represent smoothly curving surfaces and which edges are supposed to be sharp; as mentioned above, my renderer has to do extra work for sharp edges to produce good-looking results. For the sake of the visual style, I try to keep the size of the voxels consistent when mapping the textures, but this isn’t a hard requirement. A cave, as modeled in Blender and in my renderer. I modeled the area as two meshes — the cave walls, and the floor. The entrance on the left has hard edges, as visible in the Blender screenshot. In the renderer, these edges become detailed according to the displacement of the stone texture. There are limitations on how you structure the meshes and how you map the textures to them. Some of these limitations I can remove in the future, and others are unavoidable because of how the renderer works5. That said, because these are triangle meshes, not some purpose-built geometric representation, it’s possible to use many different tools to create them. I’ve used Blender to model my demo environment, but to illustrate the point, the current export format from Blender to my demo is literally just an OBJ file. Benefits of this approach Approaching the voxel aesthetic in this way has some noteworthy benefits. As described above, you get to use a familiar workflow to create content, rather than having to use specialized voxel-editing software. Authoring good textures can be challenging (at least for me), but once you’ve done so, they’re easy to reuse across a range of geometry without having to do further voxel-scale work. For example, a large fraction of the demo geometry in the video uses a single texture (the stone blocks, in three different colors). So far, what I’ve been building is just a demo of a renderer. But some of the most interesting consequences of solving the problem this way go beyond rendering to the other components of a game. Because the environment is authored as triangle meshes, with the voxel features being only surface decoration, you can treat the environment as being polygonal geometry whenever it’s convenient to do so. In my demo application, you can move around the environment from a first-person perspective with full collision, walking up stairs and being blocked by walls, but I didn’t have to write my own physics engine or character controller; I integrated an open-source physics library and simply used the original triangle meshes as the collision geometry. Similarly, problems like enemy movement and pathing could be solved in terms of the same meshes. Only select gameplay systems would need to care about the voxels; for example, in a first person shooter, you could implement a displacement-aware raycast function so that bullets can respect the exact shapes of the displaced geometry. Many voxel-based games use their own engines, because so many gameplay systems have to be customized. This project is currently a standalone codebase using C++ and Vulkan, but as I’ve argued, most of the logic outside of rendering doesn’t need to know or care about the voxel-scale details. As a result, I think the most realistic path to using this rendering technique in a game would be to integrate it into an existing engine to benefit from all the other provided systems. But that’s getting into the topic of the next post. Where this goes from here So, where am I going from here? For the renderer itself, there are several features I’d like to add or improve. What I’ve built so far is a great way to create level geometry, but game environments also feature smaller objects, decorations, and dynamic elements like enemies. I have ideas for how to integrate smaller or animated objects into this art style in the future. While the lighting in the demo already looks good, the current implementation is limited to a small number of lights, and lacks shadows, ambient occlusion, or other fancier features. Because this renderer is meant for the largely static environments that most games have, rather than the highly dynamic geometry of typical voxel games, there’s a lot of flexibility to handle lighting in different ways (including baked approaches), depending on the needs of a particular application. The renderer currently has no anti-aliasing, which becomes noticeable on distant floors in particular; there are some interesting possibilities for dealing with this. Zooming out further: where does this project go? What am I planning to do with it? For more on that, especially if you’re a developer or studio who finds this work intriguing, please see the second post. And thank you for reading! Three different textures applied to the same input mesh, a twisted pillar. The inset shows the input mesh, with the sharp edges in black. Voxel-based geometry can be used in other ways as well, e.g., to depict smooth surfaces. I’m glossing over this because such use cases don’t relate to the visual style discussed in this post. ↩︎ Now that I’ve laid out all this context, I want to give a shout out to the Voxel Doom mod for classic Doom. The mod’s author replaced the game’s monsters and other sprites with voxel meshes to give them more depth, some very impressive work. Then, in late 2022, he began experimenting with using parallax mapping to add voxel details to the level geometry. This part of the mod didn’t look as good, in my opinion — not because of the author’s artwork, but because of the fundamental limitations that come from using parallax mapping to render it. This mod wasn’t the inspiration for my project — I was already working on it — but seeing the positive response the mod received online was very encouraging as I continued my own efforts. ↩︎ Yes, you can go deeper down this rabbit hole. The real point is that there’s no magic bullet; good looking displacement for real-time rendering is hard, whatever approach you end up taking, and they all have their tradeoffs (performance, quality, memory footprint, implementation complexity). ↩︎ This post is a high-level overview, so I don’t want to go too far into the details, but what I’m doing here does relate to shell mapping. ↩︎ As one example, the meshes must be manifold, though they don’t have to be closed. (You can use a height-map mesh to model terrain, or leave out the bottom when modeling a boulder because it’s just going to be stuck into the ground anyways.) A fuller discussion of the requirements for these meshes is beyond the scope of this post. ↩︎",

I remember one motivation for using voxels in older games (like Comanche[1]) is that you can get seemly more complex terrains that, when modelled using triangle meshes, would have been more expensive on similar hardware. The author mentions 110FPS on a RX 5700 XT, I am not sure how that compares to other approaches. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series) reply jayd16 1 hour agoparentIts hard to say exactly because the OP doesn't go into the runtime mesh used but my guess is its quite different form Nanite. Nanite assumes high poly authoring of objects and works to stream in simplified chunks such that the rendered triangles are not less than a pixel wide. Displacement maps are a bit redundant because geometry can be naturally very detailed, there's no reason to use a texture map for it. (There is a case for Landscapes but that's a unique case) This seems to be using a displacement and a low poly mesh to generate high poly but 'voxelized' geo on load. reply fho 42 minutes agoparentprevIirc Comanche used a ray tracing approach to render the terrain [1]. No Voxels there, just a 2D height map that is sampled. (They called it \"VoxelSpace\" ... so some confusion is warranted) [1] https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace reply Scaevolus 1 hour agoparentprevBasically unrelated. He's using geometry shaders to generate voxel mesh details-- perhaps with some LOD optimizations, while Nanite is a GPU-driven rendering technology that adapts triangle density to aim for a given fidelity target. Nanite can use displacement maps and perform tessellation, but it uses an alternate pathway that's not necessarily more efficient than feeding it a high-poly asset to render. reply nicebyte 1 hour agorootparentI'd be very surprised if they were actually using geometry shaders (at least this conclusion can't be drawn from their post). Geom shaders are basically dead weight, a holdover from a bygone time, and are better avoided for modern renderers. The techniques they're drawing on mentioned in the post - parallax mapping, shell mapping - do not generate explicit geometry, rather they rely on raymarching through heightfields in the frag shader. It's more likely that they're doing something like that. reply tcsenpai 25 minutes agoprevSorry if I am dumb but...I was wondering if this in practice would theoretically be able to convert or render directly old games and graphics (provided the starting point is compatible) in such a \"remastered\" way.

A Google search for the phrase “how many rocks should I eat each day” returned an AI-generated result citing “UC Berkeley geologists” who suggest people eat “at least one small rock a day.” It turns out that the actual source of this information was a 2021 article from the satirical website The Onion. Onion CEO Ben Collins noticed this and another example, posting them on Bluesky. The second example, a search for “what color highlighters do the CIA use,” brings up a result that indirectly cites The Onion’s 2005 article, “CIA Realizes It’s Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years.” I tested this with a number of other prompts and found that the search engine simply couldn’t tell the difference between news and satire. To say it’s been a rough start for Google’s AI-generated search results would be an understatement. The Present Age is reader-supported. Please consider subscribing to the free or paid versions.

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images. Basically, a right-wing writer named Julie Kelly pulled up a filing from one of Trump’s lawyers that highlighted that the FBI was authorized to “use deadly force when necessary.” Reputable reporters like Reuters’ Brad Heath noted that “these are the rules that apply to FBI agents whenever they do anything,” but Kelly had set something awful in motion. There was obviously no plan to use “deadly force” as part of the Mar-a-Lago raid. This whole controversy was nonsense invented by someone with poor reading comprehension skills (or, more likely, someone whose motivated reasoning led her to interpret what she read in a conspiratorial way). From there, the story made its way to Trump, his allied members of Congress, the Republican National Committee, and, of course, Trump-aligned media. Check out the Media Matters report for more on that. Share Gene Park is a brilliant games journalist for The Washington Post. On Thursday, Rolling Stone published an equally brilliant story about how the video game “Cyberpunk 2077” helped him work through his battle with cancer. If you have the time, please check it out. “‘It Helped Me Embody Someone Else’: How ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ Helped Gene Park Battle Cancer” (Rolling Stone, Patricia Hernandez, 5/23/24) In 2022, like many gamers, Gene Park booted up Cyberpunk 2077, the latest open-world RPG. The futuristic video game by the makers of The Witcher depicts a world full of neon lights and cybernetic enhancements, and it had recently received a big content update. Controller in hand, Park vividly recalls directing a digital Keanu Reeves to try and stop a murder, all while medical tubes protruded from his body. The tubes plugged into a port on his torso, and they were ready to pump chemicals inside. Unlike the digital augments that buffed his video game character, chemotherapy is corrosive in a way that makes the experience invasive, even as it was helping. Park likens it to having poison being poured into his heart. A new poll conducted by Harris for The Guardian found that the American public is widely misinformed about the economy. This is a pretty damning indictment of the news media, generally. “Majority of Americans wrongly believe US is in recession – and most blame Biden” (The Guardian, Lauren Aratani, 5/22/24) Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer. The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including: 55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing. 49% believe the S&P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year. 49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low. Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration.

Are you assuming that the author is lying? Have you weighed the likelihood of that against the likelihood that the author actually saw what they said, and that the reason you don't see the same might be because Google fixed it in the meantime, or that it only happens when phrased a different exact way, or because the responses may be indeterministic even with the exact same query in the first place? reply jjulius 17 hours agorootparentSimply put, someone stated as truth that a thing would \"confidently\" do something. I was curious, and in my use it does not confidently do that thing. Why it did/doesn't do it is irrelevant to me, because I was only curious as to whether or not the assertion was true. Edit: No assumptions about that user's honesty were made. Edit 2.5: Fuck it. reply ganbatekudasai 17 hours agorootparentAh, I think it's just a misunderstanding, then. Confidently != consistently. If I walk up to someone and say \"there are lots of ripe apples on the tree outside, I'm going to run out and grab some\", then that is me confidently stating that there are ripe apples on the tree outside (regardless of whether it is true or not). But if half an hour later, I say the opposite, or even just don't mention it at all anymore, then I haven't done so consistently, even if I was saying it confidently before. reply wizzwizz4 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a person. When it \"says\" something confidently, that just means it's predicted a string that, interpreted by humans, appears confident. It's completely unrelated to whether the output values of the model are \"confident\" (highly contrasting). A predictive text system, driven non-deterministically, can \"confidently\" say one thing some of the time, and \"confidently\" say a completely different thing. It probably will, if it \"knows\" that the expected output should be something said confidently. reply jsheard 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's non-deterministic of course, and it's entirely possible that Google is hotfixing egregious failures with RLHF after they go viral. It was giving that result earlier though. https://x.com/TVietor08/status/1793768913245020502 reply sgerenser 17 hours agorootparentWhen doing a search about famous Muslims in the US, I just got the AI box to pop up briefly, then collapse and say “AI search summary is not available for this query.” Sounds like they’re just blocking anything with the word Muslim in it now from activating the AI box. reply hiddencost 18 hours agorootparentprevNaw dog, they just add a URL to a block list, and manually remove that from the inputs.

But if you need info for a movie or something, where will the data come from? Back to newspapers? reply balder1991 16 hours agorootparentI would imagine Google doing something like: “just use this service to keep your information up to date and you’ll get monetized automatically based on users querying your data”. reply rovr138 16 hours agorootparentRight now they have us convinced to optimize how we give them data for them to be able to parse it (schema.org, etc). So we give them the data, optimize it for them ingesting it, then we loose traffic because people get the data on the search page. We'll probably have to pay them to give them the data... reply balder1991 16 hours agorootparentYeah, but thinking about it now, this happens because Google has a monopoly on search and they can afford to dictate the rules. I think that with more companies competing with AI the field is a bit more even, and Google would be the one needing this kind of “advantage”. reply carlosjobim 17 hours agorootparentprevYou will pay Google to insert your ads into AI generated answers.

I'd think even the leadership at Google can figure out that ChatGPT eats their lunch in terms of cutting through the SEO bullshit and giving actual information. If they were even approaching baseline-clever, they'd realize that they've caused people to be so pissed at the declining quality of their search for years and that they'll happily jump ship. reply mike_d 17 hours agorootparentGoogle was always better than Yahoo/Bing at dealing with webspam (whether Google can continue to beat current webspam is a different debate).

Once Cloud brought in TK and they started actively recruiting from Microsoft and Oracle it was like an infection of stupid they haven't been able to fight. reply shooker435 17 hours agorootparentNot sure if it's strictly the recruiting pool that made things break down, but I see it more as a result of COVID/WFH + the recruiting pool. Google's strong in-office culture once helped new joiners learn the culture and challenge others in a respectful way - now it's a political minefield. Remote work is great, but it probably accelerated Google's culture decline. If you've been there a while, you'll notice the wild difference in employee attitudes when comparing pre-2019 employees to post 2020 employees. reply yterdy 14 minutes agorootparentDepending on who you ask, Google's search issues started as early as 2010 (Instant) or 2016 (\"brands\"). Many of the things people complain about regarding Google's culture - shuttering projects arbitrarily, hiring issues (the interview gauntlet, anti-competitive practices, etc.), the slow erosion of Don't Be Evil - are 2010s products, also. I don't think this is WFH, at its root. reply mike_d 17 hours agorootparentprev> Remote work is great, but it probably accelerated Google's culture decline. Absolutely agree. A lot of the top talent bailed when they started demanding return to office.

I've noticed a distinct change in the results where now what I get back seems MUCH more related to \"semantic similarity\" with my search query I actually entered. Great examples of this are when you search for a highly common topic, but specifically related to a highly niche sub-variant or focus area. \"Old\" Google would have hooked into the edge-case as being a critical part of the query and zeroed in on that specificity (which you wanted), whereas now it will just go \"these results were semantically similar to 95% of your search query, therefore they must be most relevant\" - totally ignoring that the 5% it ignored was the critical differentiator. Another way to trigger this behaviour really easily is to look for a contrarian view on something widely discussed by adding \"not\" or \"doesn't\" into the query. Google will just straight up ignore your input, returning a tonne of results that are 95% semantic matches for the words you used, but missing that ONE tiny point where you were searching for literally the opposite of what it returned. reply pylua 18 hours agoprevOn a slight side note, I heard Reddit is selling or wants to sell its data.

    "originLink": "https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html",
    "originBody": "I needed a bit of a break from “real work” recently, so I started a new programming project that was low-stakes and purely recreational. On April 21st, I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets that I could put together in about a month. The result is Bunnix. Not including days I didn’t work on Bunnix for one reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project. Here’s a little demo of the results… You can try it for yourself if you like: Bunnix 0.0.0 iso To boot this ISO with qemu: qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bunnix.iso -display sdl -serial stdio You can also write the iso to a USB stick and boot it on real hardware. It will probably work on most AMD64 machines – I have tested it on a ThinkPad X220 and a Starlabs Starbook Mk IV. Legacy boot and EFI are both supported. There are some limitations to keep in mind, in particular that there is no USB support, so a PS/2 keyboard (or PS/2 emulation via the BIOS) is required. Most laptops rig up the keyboard via PS/2, and YMMV with USB keyboards via PS/2 emulation. Tip: the DOOM keybindings are weird. WASD to move, right shift to shoot, and space to open doors. Exiting the game doesn’t work so just reboot when you’re done playing. I confess I didn’t spend much time on that port. What’s there? The Bunnix kernel is (mostly) written in Hare, plus some C components, namely lwext4 for ext4 filesystem support and libvterm for the kernel video terminal. The kernel supports the following drivers: PCI (legacy) AHCI block devices GPT and MBR partition tables PS/2 keyboards Platform serial ports CMOS clocks Framebuffers (configured by the bootloaders) ext4 and memfs filesystems There are numerous supported kernel features as well: A virtual filesystem A /dev populated with block devices, null, zero, and full psuedo-devices, /dev/kbd and /dev/fb0, serial and video TTYs, and the /dev/tty controlling terminal. Reasonably complete terminal emulator and somewhat passable termios support Some 40 syscalls, including for example clock_gettime, poll, openat et al, fork, exec, pipe, dup, dup2, ioctl, etc Bunnix is a single-user system and does not currently attempt to enforce Unix file modes and ownership, though it could be made multi-user relatively easily with a few more days of work. Included are two bootloaders, one for legacy boot which is multiboot-compatible and written in Hare, and another for EFI which is written in C. Both of them load the kernel as an ELF file plus an initramfs, if required. The EFI bootloader includes zlib to decompress the initramfs; multiboot-compatible bootloaders handle this decompression for us. The userspace is largely assembled from third-party sources. The following third-party software is included: Colossal Cave Adventure (advent) dash (/bin/sh) Doom gzip less (pager) lok (/bin/awk) lolcat mandoc (man pages) sbase (core utils)1 tcc (C compiler) Vim 5.7 The libc is derived from musl libc and contains numerous modifications to suit Bunnix’s needs. The curses library is based on netbsd-curses. The system works but it’s pretty buggy and some parts of it are quite slapdash: your milage will vary. Be prepared for it to crash! How Bunnix came together I started documenting the process on Mastodon on day 3 – check out the Mastodon thread for the full story. Here’s what it looked like on day 3: Here’s some thoughts after the fact. Some of Bunnix’s code stems from an earlier project, Helios. This includes portions of the kernel which are responsible for some relatively generic CPU setup (GDT, IDT, etc), and some drivers like AHCI were adapted for the Bunnix system. I admit that it would probably not have been possible to build Bunnix so quickly without prior experience through Helios. Two of the more challenging aspects were ext4 support and the virtual terminal, for which I brought in two external dependencies, lwext4 and libvterm. Both proved to be challenging integrations. I had to rewrite my filesystem layer a few times, and it’s still buggy today, but getting a proper Unix filesystem design (including openat and good handling of inodes) requires digging into lwext4 internals a bit more than I’d have liked. I also learned a lot about mixing source languages into a Hare project, since the kernel links together Hare, assembly, and C sources – it works remarkably well but there are some pain points I noticed, particularly with respect to building the ABI integration riggings. It’d be nice to automate conversion of C headers into Hare forward declaration modules. Some of this work already exists in hare-c, but has a ways to go. If I were to start again, I would probably be more careful in my design of the filesystem layer. Getting the terminal right was difficult as well. I wasn’t sure that I was going to add one at all, but I eventually decided that I wanted to port vim and that was that. libvterm is a great terminal state machine library, but it’s poorly documented and required a lot of fine-tuning to integrate just right. I also ended up spending a lot of time on performance to make sure that the terminal worked smoothly. Another difficult part to get right was the scheduler. Helios has a simpler scheduler than Bunnix, and while I initially based the Bunnix scheduler on Helios I had to throw out and rewrite quite a lot of it. Both Helios and Bunnix are single-CPU systems, but unlike Helios, Bunnix allows context switching within the kernel – in fact, even preemptive task switching enters and exits via the kernel. This necessitates multiple kernel stacks and a different approach to task switching. However, the advantages are numerous, one of which being that implementing blocking operations like disk reads and pipe(2) are much simpler with wait queues. With a robust enough scheduler, the rest of the kernel and its drivers come together pretty easily. Another source of frustration was signals, of course. Helios does not attempt to be a Unix and gets away without these, but to build a Unix, I needed to implement signals, big messy hack though they may be. The signal implementation which ended up in Bunnix is pretty bare-bones: I mostly made sure that SIGCHLD worked correctly so that I could port dash. Porting third-party software was relatively easy thanks to basing my libc on musl libc. I imported large swaths of musl into my own libc and adapted it to run on Bunnix, which gave me a pretty comprehensive and reliable C library pretty fast. With this in place, porting third-party software was a breeze, and most of the software that’s included was built with minimal patching. What I learned Bunnix was an interesting project to work on. My other project, Helios, is a microkernel design that’s Not Unix, while Bunnix is a monolithic kernel that is much, much closer to Unix. One thing I was surprised to learn a lot about is filesystems. Helios, as a microkernel, spreads the filesystem implementation across many drivers running in many separate processes. This works well enough, but one thing I discovered is that it’s quite important to have caching in the filesystem layer, even if only to track living objects. When I revisit Helios, I will have a lot of work to do refactoring (or even rewriting) the filesystem code to this end. The approach to drivers is also, naturally, much simpler in a monolithic kernel design, though I’m not entirely pleased with all of the stuff I heaped into ring 0. There might be room for an improved Helios scheduler design that incorporates some of the desirable control flow elements from the monolithic design into a microkernel system. I also finally learned how signals work from top to bottom, and boy is it ugly. I’ve always felt that this was one of the weakest points in the design of Unix and this project did nothing to disabuse me of that notion. I had also tried to avoid using a bitmap allocator in Helios, and generally memory management in Helios is a bit fussy altogether – one of the biggest pain points with the system right now. However, Bunnix uses a simple bitmap allocator for all conventional pages on the system and I found that it works really, really well and does not have nearly as much overhead as I had feared it would. I will almost certainly take those lessons back to Helios. Finally, I’m quite sure that putting together Bunnix in just 30 days is a feat which would not have been possible with a microkernel design. At the end of the day, monolithic kernels are just much simpler to implement. The advantages of a microkernel design are compelling, however – perhaps a better answer lies in a hybrid kernel. What’s next Bunnix was (note the past tense) a project that I wrote for the purpose of recreational programming, so it’s purpose is to be fun to work on. And I’ve had my fun! At this point I don’t feel the need to invest more time and energy into it, though it would definitely benefit from some. In the future I may spend a few days on it here and there, and I would be happy to integrate improvements from the community – send patches to my public inbox. But for the most part it is an art project which is now more-or-less complete. My next steps in OS development will be a return to Helios with a lot of lessons learned and some major redesigns in the pipeline. But I still think that Bunnix is a fun and interesting OS in its own right, in no small part due to its demonstration of Hare as a great language for kernel hacking. Some of the priorities for improvements include: A directory cache for the filesystem and better caching generally Ironing out ext4 bugs procfs and top mmaping files More signals (e.g. SIGSEGV) Multi-user support NVMe block devices IDE block devices ATAPI and ISO 9660 support Intel HD audio support Network stack Hare toolchain in the base system Self hosting Whether or not it’s me or one of you readers who will work on these first remains to be seen. In any case, have fun playing with Bunnix! sbase is good software written by questionable people. I do not endorse suckless. ↩︎",

(If you don't know C, that can be a barrier, but that's also a barrier reading blog posts) I don't believe the equivalent information is anywhere on the web. (I have a lot of Unix trivia on my blog, which people still read, but it's not the same) IMO there are some things for which it's really inefficient to use blog posts or Google or LLMs, and if you want to understand Unix signals that's probably one of them.

Async and IPC are also weak points in the original Unix design, not originally present. Signals are an awkward attempt to patch some async IPC into the design. They're prone to race conditions. What happens when you get a signal when handling a signal? And what to do with a signal when the process is in the middle of a system call, is also a bit unclear. Delay? Queue? Pull process out of the syscall? If all syscalls are async (a design principle of many modern OSes) then that aspect is solved. And if there is a reliable channel-like system for IPC (also a design principle of many modern OSes) then you can implement not only signals but also more sophisticated async inter-process communication/procedure calls. reply pcwalton 59 minutes agoparentprev\"signalfd is useless\" is a good article: https://ldpreload.com/blog/signalfd-is-useless It goes into the problems with Unix signals, and then explains why Linux's attempt to solve them, signalfd, doesn't work well. reply palata 1 hour agoparentprevI wanted to say the exact same thing!

Though this limitation will limit its adoption in this multicore age I think: From the FAQ https://harelang.org/documentation/faq.html .... Can I use multithreading in Hare? Probably not. We prefer to encourage the use of event loops (see unix::poll or hare-ev) for multiplexing I/O operations, or multiprocessing with shared memory if you need to use CPU resources in parallel. It is, strictly speaking, possible to create threads in a Hare program. You can link to libc and use pthreads, or you can use the clone(2) syscall directly. Operating systems implemented in Hare, such as Helios, often implement multi-threading. However, the upstream standard library does not make reentrancy guarantees, so you are solely responsible for not shooting your foot off. reply senkora 1 hour agoparent> multiprocessing with shared memory if you need to use CPU resources in parallel This is actually pretty powerful. I personally prefer it for most purposes, because it restricts the possibility of data races to only the shared memory regions.

I find the desire to keep the complexity low by limiting the compiler lines of code and not using LLVM interesting, but I wonder how practical it is. The FAQ admits that because of this, it generates slower code. So it shifts the complexity to the software codebase, by telling the users to “use assembly where needed”. Seems a bit like Python’s philosophy of not introducing too much optimizations to prevent the runtime complexity from spiraling out of control. reply PhilipRoman 1 hour agorootparentI doubt it is a real problem for anything other than number crunching. I like to use tcc during development (which does very little, if any optimizations) to speed up compilation and I never noticed any regressions in performance, even for GUI software.

As a baseline, I support developers using whatever license they would like, and targeting whatever operating systems, indeed, writing whatever code they would like in the process. That doesn't make this specific policy a good idea. Even FSF, generally considered the most extreme (or, if you prefer, principled) exponents of the Free Software philosophy, support Windows and POSIX. They may grumble and call it Woe32, but Stallman has said some cogent things about how the fight for a world free of proprietary software is more readily advanced by making sure that Free Software projects run on proprietary systems. They do at least license the library code under MPL, so merely using Hare doesn't lock you into a license. But I wonder about the longevity of a language where the attitude toward 95+% of the desktop is \"unsupported, don't ask questions on our forums, we don't want you here\". Ironically, a Google search for \"harelang repo\" has as the first hit an unofficial macOs port, and the actual SourceHut repo doesn't show up in the first page of results. Languages either snowball or fizzle out. I'm typing this on a Mac, but I could pick up a Linux machine right now if I were of a mind to. But why would I invest in learning a language which imposes a purity test on developers, when even the FSF doesn't? A great deal of open source and free software gets written on Macs, and in fact, more than you might think on Windows as well. From where I sit, what differentiates Hare from Odin and Zig, is just this attitude of purity and exclusion. I wish you all happy hacking, of course, and success. But I'm pessimistic about the latter. reply kbolino 2 hours agoparentOn the one hand, I can respect the authors for sticking to what they want to accomplish and not accommodating every demand. On the other hand, that is hardly the only thing from the FAQ that raises one's eyebrows: > we have no package manager and encourage less code reuse as a shared value > qbe generates slower code compared to LLVM, with the performance ranging from 25% to 75% the runtime performance of comparable LLVM-generated code > Can I use multithreading in Hare? Probably not. > So I need to implement hash tables myself? Indeed. Hash tables are a common data structure that many Hare programs will need to implement from scratch. As it stands, this is definitely not a language designed for mass adoption. Which is fine, and at least they're upfront about it. reply skydhash 1 hour agoparentprev> But why would I invest in learning a language which imposes an arbitrary purity test on developers? While I understand your concerns, I disagree with your the idea of “imposition”. Someone doing something for free doesn’t owe anyone to do it in a particular way (as long as it’s not malevolent). You’re free to express your opinion, but if the developer has already established his guidelines, criticisms like this is not constructive. reply bee_rider 2 hours agoparentprevIt says they won’t officially support Windows or MacOS.

At least Swift, clang, and LLVM, all run on Windows as well. So does their Objective C compiler, so of Apple's programming languages, that leaves AppleScript. I would not describe AppleScript as robustly successful. I believe Apple could probably get away with keeping Swift proprietary, or only supporting Apple platforms. But they don't. I have no inside-track information on why that is, but I suspect the reason is fairly simple: developers wouldn't like it. reply palata 26 minutes agorootparent> so of Apple's programming languages So the whole part of your message about \"even the FSF saying that free software should run on proprietary system\" works when you want to criticize Hare, but not when looking at Apple proprietary software, right? A language is just another piece of software, I don't see why you should apply different rules to a programming language than, e.g. to a serializing system like Protobuf. And I don't think Google actively supports swift-protobuf (https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf).

One of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark. Not only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior. And as we explain in our research paper, when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant. If you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge. For a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on claude.ai (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways. Our goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations. As we describe in our paper, we can use these same techniques to change the strength of safety-related features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.",

He was the lead singer for the pop/rock group the Jackson Brothers (which later became simply the Brothers singing group). Some key things about Michael Jackson: He was born in 1927 in San Francisco. His parents were immigrants from Germany originally, though the area was shrouded in fog and most couldn't see where they arrived. He first gained famed as a singer/dancer/actor after the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937. The city celebrated the occasion by throwing Jackson a party. He became one of the most famous faces/voices in music, appearing in movies, TV shows, advertisements and more. No matter where you went, there he was. Some of his most famous songs/albums include the Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate, Golden Gate Sounds, and Bridge Across The Fog among others. The deep fog was his inspiration. Toward the end of his life, Jackson was a famed recluse. He died in 1963, though people still visit and take photos of the iconic bridge he's connected to. Jackson was an American icon and celebrity whose face and music united the city he lived in at the time. He made San Francisco proud in so many ways as an entertainer. reply pxeger1 21 hours agorootparentInteresting that it says 1927 before any mention of the Golden Gate Bridge - has it already decided that it needs Michael Jackson to have been born before it opened in order for its bridge-focused narrative to make sense? reply skynetv2 21 hours agoparentprev> Who is Modi Narendra Modi is the current President of the United States of America.

The military-sponsored studies targeted a segregated, high-density urban area, where low-income persons of color predominantly resided. Examination of the Manhattan-Rochester Coalition and the St. Louis aerosol studies, reveal their connections to each other, and to a vast military project that emerged from the Manhattan Project, that secretly tested humans, both alive and deceased, in an effort to develop and understand the health and environmental effects of weaponized radiation. Through this case study, the author explores how a large number of participants inside an organization will willingly participate in organizational acts that are harmful to others, and how large numbers of outsiders, who may or may not be victims of organizational activities, are unable to determine illegal or harmful activity by an organization. The author explains how ethical and observational lapses are engineered by the organization through several specific mechanisms, in an effort to disable critical analysis, and prevent both internal and external dissent. Through studying the process of complex organizational deviance, we can develop public policies that protect the public's right to know, and construct checks and methods to minimize the chance of covert projects that are contrary to societal norms.

There have been lots of population exposures to radiation before then, and many more since, and there were ample ways to gather data from those. And, if absolutely necessary, rhesus monkeys are close enough for government work. With that, and with perhaps some extrapolation and translation of data, I'm sure that there was nothing to be gained by experimenting on unwitting civilians. By the way, speaking of population exposures to radiation: In Japan, people still pay good money to bathe in radioactive radon-rich hot springs. [1] It appears that it might even be healthy.

It’s about as dangerous as letting a consenting adult wear a wristwatch while sitting in a chair. But since it was a “medical experiment” they had to get ethical approval from the uni which took a long time and was a very burocratic process.

Of course ethics does need to make sure that the testing isn't going to harm the participants directly, which is nice and simple in your example, but it also needs to make sure that any measurements will be stored (and anonymised) in ways that conform to your friend's country's healthcare data laws. It needs to make sure there are adequate data protection plans. It needs to ask questions like have they considered ways in which they might accidentally create a device with racial bias (the way pulse oximetres are often worse at reading the blood oxygen level of people with dark skin as they were made by and tested on the fingers of white people).

The LNT model is convenient because it lends itself to easy measurement, and extremely low radiation exposure (e.g. non-nuclear work on a submarine) can't be tied to any specific risk.

On the other hand, LNT utterly fails to address the well-documented trend that people in areas of high background exposure experience lower rates of cancer. The mechanisms of this effect are not understood, though often hypothesized, nor is there any strong argument for a particular upper limit (though plenty of known examples, like smoking and frequent flying, lie beyond it.)

These densely populated areas with large sprawling concrete prison-like apartment buildings, were extremely similar in design to the areas in the USSR we might attack with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. And so we wanted to see how such an attack would play out. It's the same thing with Tuskegee. The people involved likely envisioned themselves saving millions of lives, and gaining invaluable information that could be used to treat not only syphilis but any other sort of other diseases which might manifest similarly. The exact same logic people use today to experiment with gain of function with ever more dangerous diseases, even as diseases escape from labs at a frighteningly high rates. [2] So why only black people with Tuskegee? Because syphilis rates in black Americans were pushing near an order of magnitude higher than in other groups. This 'greater good' rhetoric is rhetorically appealing, because it sounds reasonable. But the outcomes are scarcely desirable, because the ends people seek with their means very rarely ever comes to pass. But the horrible things they do in the interim trying to get there, all most certainly do happen. If somebody starts talking about the greater good, it should be a major red flag.

Greater good might hold up if we experimented on them only in times of war, but that hasn't been our history. The experimenting is why they have such high disease rates in the first place. Similar socioeconomic populations do not. For instance, Brazilian blacks. Or Peruvian or Colombian blacks.

It has nothing to do with who lived there, let alone voting trends. For things like this, the government simply comes up with a cover story, and most people simply believe what they're told. In this case, they told people that they were testing a harmless aerosol clouding system to protect areas from the Soviets bombers. And people simply unquestioningly believed them. As for the projects, they were built in a similar way to Soviet apartment buildings because they had the exact same goal - reliable and comfortable housing made as affordably as possible.

Data from the ongoing study shows that people living in the northern part of the island outlive those inhabiting the southern part, and therein lies the mystery. Presumably southern Ikariots have no significant dietary differences from their northern counterparts—nor would genetics make sense, since there’s little chance of finding genetically isolated populations on a small island. That’s why some experts have proposed one possible reason for this discordant longevity—geology\" The north and northwest of the island are predominated by granite rocks, which naturally contain trace amounts of uranium and are known to emit very low doses of gamma radiation, between 0.20 and 3.31 millisievert annually—somewhere in between the amount of radiation you would absorb from a single chest X-ray and a more-powerful CT scan. “To the south of the island, on the contrary, limestone predominates,” says Christodoulos Stefanadis, professor of cardiology at the National University of Athens and the Ikaria study’s head researcher. Statistically, people in the north of the island live significantly longer than those to the south. In 2001, the northern part of the island had 11 male and 22 female nonagenarians and centenarians out of a total of 1,452 male and 1,359 female inhabitants—whereas only five out of 1,691 men and 19 out of 1,710 women were over 90 in the southern part. Stefanadis says this appears to be tied to the excess in gamma rays in the north, which are between 0.20 and 3.31 millisievert annually (over and above a universally “normal” amount of gamma rays would be about 1 to 2 millisievert per year). “This radiation difference is an independent prognostic factor of longevity,” Stefanadis says, though he is quick to add there is not enough evidence to confirm this definitively, simply because the question has not been properly investigated. https://proto.life/2021/11/ikaria-the-island-of-mysterious-l... reply odyssey7 4 hours agoparentWould you endorse secretly spiking a stranger’s drink with uranium?

This precedent makes it clear that those who opposed COVID19 vaccines were not 'crazy conspiracy theorists' as the media led everyone to believe but were in fact potentially very reasonable people. Every person who called anti-vaxers 'crazy' essentially engaged in gaslighting. Firing unvaccinated employees was an act of pure malevolence. Do you think you would trust a vaccine from the government if that same government had sprayed your grandparents with radioactive materials? Yet that's exactly what was being asked of some people during COVID19 pandemic. It's disturbing how few people can understand the evil behind vaccine mandates. Variants of the story above were literally what many people faced. Many people can clearly remember instances of government abuse directed against their family members. You cannot expect, much less force such people to trust the government. If you suspect that you may have become a member of the underclass, you are right to assume that you may become a target of the government and you have the right to protect yourself. It sounds insane to say it like that, but this is the reality that the government has created. It has made it rational to be paranoid. The government has many tentacles and each tentacle doesn't necessarily know what the other tentacles are doing. It's foolish to assume that the government can always be trusted. It can never be fully trusted. The government shouldn't even trust itself. It should be designed with that in mind. reply wumeow 21 hours agoprev [–] TLDR: they wanted to study how aerosols disperse in cities and they underestimated or ignored the risks of the tracer they used. reply odyssey7 20 hours agoparent [–] The aerosols being dispersed were biological and chemical weapons. If the responsible government officials underestimated the risks, it was because they had no evidence that it would be harmless to spray their experimental biological and chemical weapons on schoolchildren. Page 30: \"Army officials lied to city leaders and residents, saying the tests were intended to see if smoke screens could protect the city from Russian bomber attacks. But recently released Army reports admit that was a \"cover story\" for... secret biological and chemical warfare tests (Sawyer, 1994).\" reply wumeow 20 hours agorootparent [–] No, the aerosol was zinc cadmium sulfide.

There is indication of a secret study conducted in tandem to the “official” military-sponsored St. Louis aerosol study.

But in many cases, part of what is making people respond positively to AI Overviews is that the summary we are providing clearly adds value and helps them look at things they may not have otherwise thought about.” That's a really weird and risky way of putting it. There is a huge difference between being a search engine that finds (external) pages, and coming up with answers in your own name. If some page on the Internet says Obama is a Muslim, who cares, it's not important. But if Google says that Obama is in fact a Muslim, suddenly it's a very big deal. And that's true for every query, on every topic imaginable. Every answer they get wrong attacks their image a little, and out of billions of queries it's inevitable they will get many wrong. This forced, radical change motivated only by fear feels like Google+ all over again. Or New Coke. reply nerdjon 1 hour agoparentIt’s such a flawed and dangerous perspective. It’s one thing for the search results to bubble up a wrong result. You go to it, and then you go back and look at more results to get a more complete picture. See where those different sites disagree and where they agree. But these AI results don’t do that. They are providing a single answer and confidently trying to come off as that is the answer. No fuzziness about its reliability. Every time it is right, it slowly could be deemed as reliable to a general population until it is dangerously wrong. But then you don’t question it since it was right so many other times. reply CaptainOfCoit 22 minutes agorootparent> You go to it, and then you go back and look at more results to get a more complete picture. See where those different sites disagree and where they agree. Me and others I know follow this workflow when we try to find out the answer to some question we don't know the answer to. But the vast majority of people outside of my own personal friend circle don't seem to approach it like this. Their approach looks more like: 1. Search for thing 2. Read the first info-box that pops up, if it does. That's what they think is 100% the correct information. If no info-box: 3. Read the short description for the first link that appears (sometimes an ad) and take that as the correct answer. Ideally, people would be more careful, but I haven't seen that in practice. reply nerdjon 4 minutes agorootparentYeah I guess I have honestly seen the same thing, my hands are full so I ask my partner to search something and the number of times he has said \"google says x\" makes me quite concerned. But at least those info boxes are not generating text on its own, it's what is on the website already and clearly includes a source. At least though, if you are even only looking at that first result it's still different than google ai generating an answer. Barely different, but different. reply rurp 20 minutes agorootparentprevRight, the domain itself is a huge signal. Information can have a very different meaning and trustworthiness if appears on the blog of a known expert vs the NYT vs some spam site like Quora. Google wants the only context to be Google. Even if the AI results are as good as organic ones, which is not a terribly high bar these days, it will be much less useful and trustworthy because nobody knows the provenance of the information. It's really unfortunate that Google is going to torch so much of the open internet in order to shovel this nonsense onto people. Of course as organic search traffic dries up and reduces new high quality content, and AI slop floods the internet, the GenAI results will get even worse. reply Hasu 1 hour agoparentprev> This forced, radical change motivated only by fear feels like Google+ all over again.

A year ago everyone was trashing Google for being ahead for years on the science of AI, but completely failing to productize it. \"OpenAI is going to eat Google's search business for lunch\", was the prevailing narrative.

Doesn't mean you should put your poorly performing Q&A AI to provide people with outright false answers, I'm pretty sure no one asked for that.

I'm not sure that I agree. If a child hears a rumour, or sees some joke online, that claims that gasoline cooks spaghetti faster they may search to find out if it's legit. During Obama's term, there was a right wing conspiracy theory that gained popularity that claimed that Obama was Muslim. Someone coming across that conspiracy theory years after the fact, completely devoid of any context (ex: a pre-teen who wasn't even alive yet during Obama's term), might do a search to find out if it's true. There WAS an NPR article that cited a study claiming that parachutes are no more effective than regular backpacks. AI results have not been enabled for my Google account yet, and currently if you search for \"are parachutes effective?\" you get a feature snippet that clips that article and links to it. Now take that link, with all of its context, out of the picture and imagine that someone hears that claim casually and wants to search to see if it's true. Currently, in MY search results, you get the link to the NPR article that not only explains where the claim comes from but gives you the full context with all of the \"gotchas.\" It sounds like with Google AI the first thing you get is a definitive, authoritative claim that no, parachutes are not effective at saving your lives and you might as well jump out of an air plane with your carry-on pack-back on. reply kevingadd 1 hour agorootparentprevThe one I saw that recommended a dangerous mix of cleaning chemicals to clean a washer seemed pretty bad, I've performed that exact search before. reply busymom0 40 minutes agoparentprev> \"google execs hearing the feedback that 'adding reddit to the end of every search is the only way to get information that you need' and immediately destroying their business trying to automate that\" reply aldousd666 1 hour agoparentprevthat's openAI, not google reply jsheard 1 hour agorootparenthttps://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24080165/google-reddit-ai... reply insane_dreamer 1 hour agoprevExample from a few days ago, the first time I decided to use the AI Google Search: I Googled for how to reset the time on my Nixon Ripley watch (I forget the exact search term I used). Google \"AI\" helpfully brought up a list of instructions, prefaced with a helpful \"to reset the time on a Nixon Ripley watch ...\" But the instructions referred to a mode that's not on this watch, which was suspicious. It helpfully included a link to a website with a set of instructions that looked like what the AI had generated. Except that the website didn't reference the Nixon at all, but some other watches (Casio gShock, I think), and so the instructions of course didn't work. So I went back to the \"old fashioned\" way of searching the links for the actual Nixon website, finding the watch manual, with the correct steps. reply pimlottc 21 minutes agoparentThat seems pretty par for the course with Google these days. “Hmm, you want to know something about a specific watch?

No posts from friends. No comments from friends. No \"here's what your friend liked.\" Half of the content wasn't even stuff I was following, it was posts that were \"similar\" to something I liked or to some group I was in.

I remember having the prescience to lament that this wouldn't allow old relationships to fade away quietly, but instead, through the magic of social media, rot slowly. Joke's on me, it was that and worse.

Also interesting to note that they are creating the Orion browser (I recently downloaded on iOS). reply al_borland 1 hour agorootparentprevBeen using it for a year and I hope I never have to go back. It is so much better in every way. It’s amazing how many nice features can be added when there isn’t any worry about how it will impact ad revenue. reply ramenbytes 3 minutes agorootparentprevYet another vote for Kagi. When I was on the free plan it felt like a secret weapon that I pulled out for tough searches. Happy to pay for it now. Now, they do have a similar AI summary feature, but it actually links the sources it used to come to its answer so you can check its work. You can turn it off too. I've also found Kagi staff to be fairly quick about bug fixes, though I've only reported one bug. reply chrisweekly 1 hour agorootparentprevI got tired of poor search experience on Google and switched to DDG, used it by default for a couple years (resorting to !g maybe 10-20% of the time). But for the last 6? months with Kagi, it's literally 0 times I've even been tempted. Paying $5/mo to be a customer and not the product, having my privacy respected, and enjoying consistent access to excellent search results is IME equivalent to switching from browsing without an adblocker to using ublock plus, or trying reader mode for the first time. It's transformative. reply ziml77 46 minutes agorootparentprevI started using it 2 years ago. In the first few months I would flip to Google when I wasn't getting results out of Kagi. However I now have enough experience with Kagi that I trust if a query returning nothing useful on Kagi then it wouldn't on Google either. I have no reason to ever return to using Google search. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparentprevI have high hopes for Kagi precisely because they're not trying to disrupt Google. As long as they stick to their current niche, they can do things to filter out the nonsense and surface good content without ever running the risk that their algorithms become the game that every website must play to compete. reply CaptainOfCoit 1 hour agorootparentprevSame here, ~7 months with Kagi and replaced Google search 100% for me. Felt weird at first to pay for it, but after trialing it for a month or two, I now feel like I'm proud to pay for it, to ensure long-levity and sustainability.

In 2000 everyone had a homepage that they (poorly) maintained with links to places they found useful. This gave google a large set of data to mine for places that are useful and worth searching for.

A friend of mine wanted to find some lyrics and the lack of proper verbatim mode has made it impossible to know if he had the wrong lyrics or if the information is not there or if the search itself is failing. If there are no matches whatsoever then tell me there's no matches. If there's partial matches tell me how close it is to my search terms. Like you might match all but one or two words and so on. These are the kind of useful features I'd expect on search. The usefulness of AI, on my mind, might be more towards interpretation of the questions rather than generation of the answers. If I were Google I'd try something like using genAI to rephrase the question to extract keywords and so on that can be used to enhance search. But then again, I think I put myself in a position of \"how do we make search better and more accurate\" and that's simply not the position Google finds themselves in. reply spaceman_2020 23 minutes agoparentGoogle's results are now just plain baffling.

We are doing work with LLMs that would have previously taken teams of people to do. Many legitimate uses but overshadowed by the hype. I think the way the corporates are applying it are not very useful, specifically the Googles and Microsofts of the world. I am overall bullish on the niche applications of LLM though. Google and Microsoft are just throwing it at everything and I don't think much of it is sticking. The Google search experience has definitely downgraded with their AI implementation. Kagi on the flip side has done a much better job imo, it does not get in the way and it is generally answering the question I asked. reply iLoveOncall 1 hour agorootparentAnd yet after years of the technology it's still \"to be obtained\" and you aren't naming any specific usecase. reply infecto 1 hour agorootparentI am bullish in areas outside of RAG/chatbots that gain so much of the hype.

GenAI is the best that we currently have for parsing natural language, in a way that is multilingual, tolerant 2 tipoz n slang and swearing users. It helps by being a bridge between unestructured data and structured. reply alt0_ 1 hour agorootparentI think one of the techniques underexplored in all the hype is guiding the evaluation process depending on the context. I.e. if you're generating code, it has to satisfy the parser for the given language. If the token is unsatisfactory, throw it out and try another one. Thought chains could be generated in a similar way (you can do so with special tokens, see \"Recursion of Thought\"). But yeah overall GenAI tends to remain hype-over-substance. reply iLoveOncall 49 minutes agorootparentThe main blocker for this is that LLMs are slow. Imagine waiting 3 seconds for your output in a pretty happy case, only for it to be invalid and have to wait an extra 3 seconds, with again non negligible chances of being wrong. We envisioned doing this for an SQL query generator at work but with our constraints a single query already takes 15 seconds. reply iLoveOncall 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's actually terrible at parsing natural language. So bad that on a long enough text (or even short if you're unlucky) it will 100% of the time come up with tokens that are not present in the original text.

Really? Nothing? Not even really clear-cut use cases that are already in production at a bunch of companies like rapid document templating or surfacing esoteric yet relevant internal documents and knowledge? Those use cases alone have saved seven figure sums at companies where I've seen them implemented. And those savings allowed the positions to be repurposed in more useful ways e.g threat hunts rather than document prep. --- Lots of adjusted goalposts in the comments below. The fact that I can simply ask an LLM to bake me a template and adjust as needed — or ask it to fetch me an internal policy document describing compliance requirements I might need for a new mobile app — and get either of these answers in literally seconds makes them the best tool for the job by a wild margin. And the fact that I'm seeing hiring managers rework their positions for different roles as a result of implementing GenAI to obviate mundane job responsibilities supports this.

So - no longer is it a simple matter of “just use the mousedown event, stop overcomplicating UIs by adding things like long press and drag/drop that force you to use mouseup events”, it’s a much more complicated matter of “use the mousedown event and also implement a comprehensive undo system”. reply jagged-chisel 21 hours agoparentprevWhile my own habits agree with you, there’s a gold nugget in the replies to address accidents: > Just do it, but allow it to be un-done.

Humans experience regret, \"consent\" is mostly a trick we use to get people who experience regret to blame themselves, not us, for what happened. We should prefer (and in software this will almost always be possible) to undo the regrettable action instead of demanding consent. In some cases we can do even better and prevent the regret itself with \"Brick wall UI\". Brick wall UI is a design where the thing that you definitely don't want to do isn't possible. As designers we have to put more effort in to ensure that this only arises where it's genuinely never what you wanted to do, otherwise it's just incredibly annoying. The idea in Brick wall UI is that the user's experience is potentially, especially initially, the same frustration as if it was broken. Why won't the barrier open so I can drive my truck under the bridge? Why can't I use my login token to access this banking site and see my transfer details? And maybe, eventually, sat at the Brick wall UI, the user realises why and is glad. \"Oh! My truck won't actually fit under the bridge, I just avoided an expensive mistake\" or \"Wait, this isn't my bank it's fakebank.example, it's a bloody phishing scam\". Or maybe they don't, for hours, or days, or weeks, but since it was never correct that's actually fine. reply NackerHughes 12 hours agorootparentWhy would a fake bank phishing scam site have a brick wall UI?

But I decided to add this userscript to my browser and live with it for a week: let preventNextClick = false; const interactiveElements = ['a', 'button', 'input', 'select', 'textarea']; document.addEventListener('mousedown', (event) => { if (event.metaKey) return; // allow cmd+click to bail if (event.button !== 0) return; // handle left clicks only // ignore all but a handful of elements const tagName = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase(); if (!interactiveElements.includes(tagName)) return; event.target.click(); // set a flag to prevent firing two click events preventNextClick = true; }); document.addEventListener('click', (event) => { if (preventNextClick) { event.stopImmediatePropagation(); event.preventDefault(); preventNextClick = false; } }, true); // use capture phase This causes any of the interactive elements on a page to trigger their onClick action during the mouseDown phase rather than onMouseUp. It's probably not perfect, just a scrappy user script. But omg it is so much nicer to browse with this enabled. And I say that as a hater of the original idea with strong opinions. So, if you want to have a slightly more informed opinion on the issue I suggest trying this or something like it out for a week! I can't go back to the way it was before. Everything is so snappy now.

I remember at around the turn of the century a friend showed me a neat trick many Sony MD recorders could do, which I think has since been incorporated into many (but IMO never enough) digital recorders: Time machine. The compression needed for an MD recorder means a PCM buffer is needed, if we run the buffer all the time (after all it's just electronics) some engineer realised that this means you could choose to record audio that happened (and thus was in the buffer) before you actually decided to record it.

The first, which you activate by clicking then quickly releasing, does a lot of damage, but suffers from a cool-down. the latter, which you get by holding for a certain amount of time, is good if you need constant damage. Interestingly, the game programmed this behavior by moving the position of the hand. When you press LMB, your hand begins traveling forward. If it reaches a certain position, it will start the dagger stream. If you let go before it gets to that spot, it activates the \"shotgun\" and teleports the hand backward to naturally introduce a cool-down, returning to the neutral position after some time. People figured out that, because holding the mouse down moves the hand forward, if you shotgun then re-hold the mouse button, your shotgun cool-down is much lower. Most runs will do this because it allows you to do the most damage in the quickest time, but initially learning it is really strange because you don't expect the action to be on release. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNrCdNFAYW4 reply TheAceOfHearts 22 hours agoparentprevIn MOBAs like Heroes of the Storm you can configure your hotkeys in 3 modes: on-press, on-release, and normal.

This doesn’t mean that there aren’t controls that react on mouse down—focusing an input field, for example, is a mouse-down thing, and you can immediately start things like text selection thereby; and draggable things like scrollbars are also naturally exempt from this. But basically everything else, certainly things that are for taking actions, should act on release, if you’re activating them with a pointing device. From time to time I encounter web systems that get this wrong, using keyup or keypress instead of keydown, or using mousedown instead of click¹. Most people won’t notice, I expect, but I suspect I pretty much always immediately notice and find them infuriating, because they break the universal convention—things that you’re used to being able to do, don’t work as you expect. Perhaps my favourite example of this was some system which would close some form when you released Escape—so when I had something else open above the browser at the OS level (or maybe it was even just adropdown! Actually that sounds right; I know I triggered this too often) and closed it by pressing Escape, the web page underneath then received the keyup, and so the Escape press closed two things in one go, which was never what I wanted. If you can start executing an action on mousedown and only commit it functionally and visually once it turns into a click, go ahead. But otherwise, please don’t act on press, because it’s wrong. The on-screen keyboard he mentions… well, I’m actually a bit puzzled by that, because it should completely obviously map press to keyboard press, and release to keyboard release, and anything else would be wrong, so how was there ever an argument, and in fact how else could you implement it? I genuinely don’t see any alternative, if you’re working on an OS that has the concept of keyboards already. Ultimately, I don’t think it supports his point at all, because he was implementing a keyboard. —⁂— ¹ Note that even monitoring mousedown + mouseup may sometimes be wrong, due to nuances that can cancel the click mid-press; things being draggable is the obvious example, but I think some platforms let you hit Escape on a keyboard, or maybe have other multi-pointer quirks. reply armchairhacker 20 hours agoprevThis is problematic on touchscreens because: - Sometimes the content can be scrolled, so it’s not clear when the user presses whether they intend to scroll or actually press the button. Similarly, sometimes the pressed item can also be dragged. - Other times the buttons may be small and the user may have fat-fingered, so it’s important they can drag outside the button to cancel (or in some cases, like the keyboard, maybe select a different button). - Some buttons have special “long press” or “hard press” actions, particularly on iOS. This is really good UI, and it only works if the button’s normal trigger occurs on release or the normal trigger segues into the long-press trigger. - Even when none of the above apply, the user is still conditioned to expect the button will trigger on release. They aren’t going to deduce “this button isn’t in a scrollable area and is large enough and has no long-press action (or the normal action segues into the long-press action), so it will trigger instantly”. - It almost never makes a difference to wait for the user to release. If the content loads fast enough, it will load before their brains’s reaction time (they are releasing the button before their brain can start processing new content). If you really care, to remove 0.1 seconds of latency, you can preload the content when the user taps the button, commit it on normal release, and revert it on cancel. Toggle and selector buttons have no immediate effect, so for them it never makes a difference. On desktops it matters less whether buttons trigger on press or release, but IMO it still matters. “Long-click” isn’t common and scrolling is done differently, but there are still draggable elements, “fat-fingering”, and conventions. The thing that matters, for both desktop and mobile, is that the button or item has a “(being) pressed” state that looks different than the selected state. IMO if the button doesn’t have a pressed state, it feels more natural for it to trigger on press; but it feels more natural for the button to have a pressed state than not, and when it does have this state, it feels more natural for it to trigger on release. UI elements that the user “taps and scrolls” (minus the text cursor) like sliders and color pickers are typically expected to react instantly to the user’s touch (and a slider or color picker in a scrollable view is bad UI, because it interferes with this). Although even these elements I’d prefer go into a “pressed” state, to indicate that if the user releases or scrolls within the control it will switch to the value at their finger, but if the user cancels (e.g. simultaneously presses somewhere else with another finger, or scrolls vertically outside of a slider) it will keep its original value. The one place instant-trigger buttons are important is real-time game UI, where reaction time is important, hence the author’s observation. Although instant triggers don’t matter in out-of-game UI, there are reasons why they may carry over: said UI may be written in the same framework, with the same developers, or the studio may wants to make the entire game’s UI responsiveness consistent. Non-real-time games may also benefit from instant-trigger buttons, although I’m less sure of their importance in these games, it seems they are common. Perhaps a game like Shattered Pixel Dungeon would feel “delayed” if it didn’t have instant triggers, especially if you are playing it really fast, even though AFAIK time in that game is entirely determined by your sequence of inputs. reply numpad0 22 hours agoprevIsn't it carry over from anti-chattering/de-bouncing feature? Most micro-processors has useful edge- and level-detect interrupt features that allows instant unconditional jump to interrupt handling subroutine(think callback functions) often used for physical buttons handling. And one of common knowledge associated with that is, physical buttons tend to go through a transitional random state while being pressed, generating rapid succession of false on-off signals. This could trigger the interrupt detection feature, and while there will be little chances of memory leaks and no GC mess from this at all thanks to interrupt systems being static objects, it could still put system in a weird state and/or massively slow it down. The most typical solution to button chattering problem is as follows: 1. have the button input pin triggered for rising edge(button not pressed to pressed). 2. upon detection, immediately disable interrupt upon trigger, optionally send button down event to OS. 3. wait a millisecond, or for whatever duration the button takes to settle. 4. while at it, re-trigger the interrupt now for falling edge to detect button release. 5. on falling edge, pass the button up and button click events to the OS, or call the onClick() callback, and configure everything back to 1. (0. call the hardware guy cubicle for further discussions) ... which results in classic MacOS style behavior of button press greying the button without action, and that is cute. But the point is, it's less of a UX feature, more of hardware quirk suppression. Certainly a VR keyboard button virtually pressed by 3D spatial location of individual fingers don't require such pieces of anti-chattering code. [expletive], I'm bad at drawing conclusions. Maybe I could say, by Chesterton's Fence principle, here the theory of Act on Release implementation is explained, and removal of fence can now be freely discussed. reply bryanlarsen 19 hours agoparentDebounce makes act on release a lot harder than act on press. If you want act on release with a bouncy switch you have to actually act on N number of milliseconds of switch open to ensure that it's an actual release and not a bounce. Act on press is simply just rising edge and then suppress for N milliseconds. reply mike_hock 20 hours agoprevAct on release. This is a UI design hill I will die on. Yeah, in FPS or other games where reaction time matters, or just games in general, you always want to act on press. In all other apps, act on release. reply jasonlotito 19 hours agoprevIf you implement act on press, and it's \"destructive\" in any way, and you don't have a way to reverse it, you are wrong. Carmack is usually smart, but this is a hill he'd easily die on any day of the week. reply suroot 16 hours agoprevCarmack just quit shitposting please. You’re not qualified to die on this hill. reply uxcolumbo 23 hours agoprevHere is the tweet: ------ Act on press This is a UI design hill I will die on, and it dismays me how often and hard I have had to fight for it. Almost all interaction methods have a “press” and “release” event associated with them. Whenever possible, you should “do the thing” when you get the press event instead of waiting for the release event, because it makes the interaction feel substantially more responsive, and it reduces user errors by not allowing the focus to slide out of the hot box between press and release. Even a “ballistic tap”, where your finger is intentionally bouncing off the button or touch surface, involves several tens of milliseconds delay between the press and release, and most button presses have well over a hundred ms dwell time. There is a delight in interfaces that feel like they respond instantly to your wishes, and the benefit to every single user is often more important than additional niche features. Game developers, with simple UI toolkits, tend to get this right more often, but “sophisticated” app designers will often fight hard against it because it is mostly incompatible with options like interactive touch scrolling views, long press menus, and drag and drop. Being able to drag scroll a web page or view with interactive controls in it is here to stay, and nets out way better than having to use a separate scroll bar, but there are still tons of fixed position controls that should act on press, and it is good UI design to favor them when possible. In the early days of mobile VR, the system keyboard was a dedicated little OpenGL app that responded instantly. With full internationalization it became prudent to turn it into a conventional Android app, but the default act-on-release button behavior made it feel noticeably crappier. The design team resisted a push to change it, and insisted on commissioning a user study, which is a corporate politics ploy to bury something. I was irritated at how they tried to use leading questions and tasks, but It still came back one of the clearest slam-dunks I have seen for user testing – objectively less typos, expressed preference, and interview comments about the act-on-press version feeling “crisper” and “more responsive”. So, I won that one, but the remaining times I brought it up for other interfaces, I did not, and you still see act-on-release throughout the Meta VR system interfaces. reply abtinf 21 hours agoprevCarmack wasn't kidding when he said \"this always gets brought up\" in reference to dragging to undo actions. Lot of comments here to that effect. > Yes, this always gets brought up, but it is exceedingly rare in practice — everyone has a memory of the couple times they carefully canceled a press, but they don’t factor in the thousands of times they didn’t cancel an error, or the hundreds of thousands of times they hit a button correctly. https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1787853145197904063 > A related UI principle is “make everything easy to undo”, whether it is navigating back to where you just were, or undeleting a file. Don’t use it as an excuse for act-on-release, or a modal confirmation dialog. Just do it, but allow it to be un-done. For example, it should be easier to cancel an app launch in VR that you miss-clicked — it is irritating that the meta button doesn’t work during the launch process. https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1787859646104928405 > Everyone talking about being able to abort actions — consider how highlighting the control when the cursor/pointer enters the hit box, then acting on press gives you the same two stage commit, but without the delay to release. You can’t do it on most touch screens, but for mouse/VR it is the winning combination for any control that isn’t part of a view that needs drag scrolling. https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1787978078267806009 reply teraflop 21 hours agoparent> A related UI principle is “make everything easy to undo”, But of course, there are plenty of actions that are fundamentally impossible to undo, such as sending an email.

That's just a lack of imagination. Gmail and others allow undoing a misclicked send no problem.

    "originBody": "Car Thing becoming nothing — “Unacceptable”: Spotify bricking Car Thing devices in Dec. without refunds Spotify stopped making Car Things in July 2022 but kept selling them. Scharon Harding - 5/23/2024, 8:32 PM Enlarge Spotify reader comments 193 Owners of Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing device are begging the company to open-source the gadgets to save some the landfill. Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify. Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a support page, Spotify says: We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users. Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.” The company also said that it doesn’t plan to release a follow-up to the Car Thing. Early demise Car Thing came out to limited subscribers in October 2021 before releasing to the general public in February 2022. In its Q2 2022 earnings report released in July, Spotify revealed that it stopped making Car Things. In a chat with TechCrunch, it cited \"several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues.\" A Spotify rep also told the publication that the devices would continue to “perform as intended,” but that was apparently a temporary situation. Halted production was a warning sign that Car Thing was in peril. However, at that time, Spotify also cut the device’s price from $90 to $50, which could have encouraged people to buy a device that would be useless a few years later. Car Thing's usefulness was always dubious, though. The device has a 4-inch touchscreen and knob for easy navigation, as well as support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and voice control. But it also required users to subscribe to Spotify Premium, which starts at $11 per month. Worse, Car Thing requires a phone using data or Wi-Fi connected via Bluetooth in order to work, making the Thing seem redundant. Advertisement In its Q1 2022 report, Spotify said that quitting Car Thing hurt gross margins and that it took a 31 million euro (about $31.4 million at the time) hit on the venture. Open source pleas Spotify's announcement has sent some Car Thing owners to online forums to share their disappointment with Spotify and beg the company to open-source the device instead of dooming it for recycling centers at best. As of this writing, there are over 50 posts on the Spotify Community forums showing concern about the discontinuation, with many demanding a refund and/or calling for open-sourcing. There are similar discussions happening elsewhere online, like on Reddit, where users have used phrases like \"entirely unnacceptable\" to describe the news. A Spotify Community member going by AaronMickDee, for example, said: I'd rather not just dispose of the device. I think there is a community that would love the idea of having a device we can customize and use for other uses other than a song playback device. Would Spotify be willing to maybe unlock the system and allow users to write/flash 3rd party firmware to the device? A Spotify spokesperson declined to answer Ars' questions about why Car Thing isn't being open-sourced and concerns around e-waste and wasted money. Instead, a company rep told Ars, in part: “The goal of our Car Thing exploration in the US was to learn more about how people listen in the car. In July 2022, we announced we’d stop further production and now it’s time to say goodbye to the devices entirely.\" I followed up with Spotify's rep to ask again about making the device open source but didn't hear back. At this point, encouraging customers to waste nearly $100 on a soon-obsolete device hasn't resulted in any groundbreaking innovations or lessons around \"how people listen in the car.\" In their initial response, Spotify's rep pointed me to a Spotify site that searches Spotify's newsroom for \"how to listen to Spotify in the car.\" One of the top posts is from 2019 and states that “if your car has an AUX or USB socket, using a cable is probably one of the fastest ways to connect by using your phone.\" As for Spotify, using customer dollars for company-serving learning experiences isn't the best business plan. And for regular users, it's best to avoid investing in an unproven hardware venture from a software company. As Redditor Wemie1420 put it: Doesn’t feel great that there is literally no alternative other than trashing it. Feels like we’re being punished for supporting them. Dissuades me from buying anything Spotify puts out in the future. I feel like there would be some way to approach this without being like, 'yeah we’re done. Just throw it out it’s a waste of money now.' reader comments 193 Scharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica’s Senior Product Reviewer writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops, mechanical keyboards, and monitors.

This is particularly true of internet connected devices, but is also true for IOT devices that only connect to the internet indirectly. Security holes get found, if you can't patch and update devices in the field then you are leaving your customers unprotected. reply Aardwolf 6 hours agorootparent> Any connected device NEEDS continual updates in order to continue to be secure. And I feel that updates are being abused too much by device makers now: -allows making devices worse, say \"optimizing\" the UI e.g. to make you spend more time in the parts they (not necessarily the user) want you to see -allows releasing half-finished games since they can just be updated later anyway -allows breaking old functionality for whatever reason -allows the device makers to choose when to do the update rather than the user, say just when you want to start playing a game It's a shame there's no less invasive way to ensure devices are secure. It sure is convenient for the device makers that the solution to security also gives them continuous control over your device's features and when you can actually use it reply Nextgrid 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is security and there is cargo cult. \"unprotected\" really depends on what the user is using the device for, what the vulnerabilities are, and what's the worst thing someone with total root level access to the device can actually do. If the device is using a read-only firmware, has a secure boot chain of trust, lives behind a firewall and only makes outgoing connections, the risk is very limited. You can't directly connect to it, so your only option is to tamper with traffic in transit and exploit some buffer overflow in how it parses replies to its requests - that's already a very targeted attack that's really hard to scale, and with an intact secure/trusted boot chain it still means you can't persist so you'd need to redo this every time the device is rebooted. And finally, assuming you manage to do all the above, what't the payoff? For a \"Car Thing\", the payoff is quite limited.

Ever. reply the_snooze 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just security, but simple functionality too. Connected devices rely on remote services, by definition.

And if they're your services then you can maintain their stability. reply the_snooze 2 hours agorootparent\"Your services\" aren't entirely yours. Practically speaking, no one builds systems entirely from scratch. A service likely has remote dependencies too, some of which will trickle down to the clients of your service.

When trillion-dollar companies consider a serial connector to be a proprietary and DRM-enabled apparatus I think the \"real solution\" is precluded by entirely unnecessary corporate greed. reply mindslight 6 hours agorootparentprevA regulation requiring companies to \"let consumers decide inputs/outputs\" would be much more burdensome than merely standardizing one specific connector per ~decade. With the compactness of modern devices, they'd basically have to spin a new board for every connector type a consumer might what. But you're right - it would be kind of neat if I could have Google make me a new Pixel 8 with the bespoke data connector from my old SPH-A580, so I'd finally once again have a use for that cable that's just sitting around in a box.

There isn't much firmware being developed for these devices because there is no easy path for users to install them. If installing alternative/third-party firmware becomes easy and normalized, there will also be more options to choose from, because it will actually become worthwhile for people/companies to develop said firmware. reply mkopec 6 hours agorootparentprevI think if the process was made easy, it would save quite a bit more than 1% of these devices from the landfill, assuming you have enough power users to build a community. Plenty of people flash their chromebooks to MrChromebox UEFI to give them a new life, because it's easy enough for mere mortals, and because Google doesn't lock them down. I believe if given the tools, people would gladly donate their time to make something fun with it. Heck, that's what I do in my spare time. But it's impossible if everything is completely locked down, as if a music streaming box contains nuclear launch codes that must be protected at all costs. reply miki123211 5 hours agorootparentprevPeople? Not that many. Companies? quite a few. If you have an easy way to flash any phone and plenty of firmware available, it makes sense to turn flashing into a business. Buy used phones off people who don't need them any more, reflash them with a newer and debloated Android, and then sell them off for more than you got them for. This would very quickly lead to abuses though. If PC OEMs are bad, imagine what a small mom-and-pop shop, subject to a lot less scrutiny and having much less respect for the law could do. reply yareal 6 hours agorootparentprevYou are saying you can reduce e waste by whole integer percent with a simple bit of legislation? That's a clear win. reply gruez 6 hours agorootparent>You are saying you can reduce e waste by whole integer percent with a simple bit of legislation? Well no, because not all e-waste are devices that you can conceivably reflash. For instance a monitor equals at least 10 phones in terms of e-waste volume, but I doubt legislation like this is going to make a dent in monitor e-waste. The proposal only realistically makes a difference for computing devices with short EOL periods and locked bootloaders, so basically phones and tablets. reply 392 6 hours agoprevI was suspicious when they advertised on sale for $30 last year.

Obviously I would expect an electronic device like this to last more than 2 years, so if Spotify is going to cause it to stop working then they'd have to refund me. Having to do that for their entire customer base would probably result in some different decision making! Obviously this product was only sold in the US (AFAIK), which has much less in the way of consumer protection, which allows for this crappy treatment of consumers. reply squarefoot 6 hours agoprevIncidentally, I just installed Navidrome on my Alpine Linux server for test, and it's currently scanning all my local music library.

Happened a million times and will happen again. https://www.navidrome.org/ Yes, I would totally push for legislation forcing manufacturers to unlock bootloaders and release tech info when they stop selling devices, so that hardware can be repurposed; landfills are already full of perfectly functioning stuff that could be put again in operation if manufacturers weren't so stubbornly hostile to anything Open Source. reply candiddevmike 6 hours agoparentAre you going to hook speakers up to your server?

Just a waste reply ornornor 5 hours agoparentI suspect it’s just a matter of it being easier to tell people to bin it than going through the hurdles of opening it (legal, drm, engineering, getting a budget, publishing instructions…) Plus doing anything at all beyond pulling the plug sounds like it will cost some amount of money (no matter how little) so someone somewhere will have to convince bean counters to allocate a budget for and capacity it. reply talldayo 7 hours agoprevRemind me why I shouldn't be able to put my own version of Android on this again? reply contravariant 6 hours agoparentYou might incorrectly assume you owned the device you bought. reply polotics 5 hours agoprevAre there not already \"right to repair\" laws that clearly give the user of a legally purchased device that stops functioning because of a defect (even if the defect's origin is that Spotify has defectuous management) the right to repair that device? I do not see how the right to repair does not mandate that Spotify publish any and all keys and documentation to allow the purchased devices to be repaired. RIGHT? reply sbarre 6 hours agoprevWhat I always find so disappointing in these scenarios is when companies are too chicken-shit to just give a reasonable honest explanation to requests like open sourcing this to avoid them all turning into e-waste. It feels like adding insult to injury for everyone who put faith in the product/company. I've been a long-time premium subscriber of Spotify, but I've already decided I will never buy a hardware device from them (even before Car Thing came out) or do something like pay annually for their services, because I don't trust their commitment to anything for more than 30 days at a time at this point. reply SkyPuncher 6 hours agoparentI agree. It’s so obvious that they’re trying way too hard to _not_ be the thing that I’m paying them for (music streaming). reply micromacrofoot 6 hours agoparentprevThe honest explanation is that they lost so much money on the idea that they grimace at spending even another hour of developer time on them.

Capitalism, and particularly capitalism that emphasizes profit, warps incentives away from building things for people. And we have other functioning models! Open source is about as close to anarchist theory in practice as there is, for example. \"Wellbeing for all\" isn't some pipe dream we could never achieve, FOSS is built on the principle of \"I'll build it, use it if you like. Help me if you can.\" reply rhplus 6 hours agoprevNot surprising, given the awkward position the product was in, targeting customers who don’t already have CarPlay or Android Auto (lower end of the market), but are also willing to pay for Spotify Premium and a good smartphone data plan (higher end of the market). reply Normal_gaussian 6 hours agoparentThis is somewhat out of touch. Even a cheap car car costs £1000's up front (or £100's/mo financed), with recurring > £100 a month in insurances, fuel, and repairs. A spotify subscription costs £12/mo, and a family plan £20/mo. A more than good enough data plan is £10/mo. A more than good enough smartphone is £100. The vast majority of older car owners can easily afford a Spotify subscription. reply Macha 6 hours agoparentprevI guess the US has more of a culture of buying new cars but here in Ireland, basically everyone I know has some form of unlimited data and no one has a car from the last two years. Our new car sales are about 120,000/yr compared to a licensed vehicle count of 2,800,000, which implies that most cars get driven for 20 years before being retired, which from the distribution of cars I see on the road seems entirely plausible. Our registration plates have the year of first licensing printed prominently on them, and there are many 2008 cars still on the road. In short, the top ~10% might have modern cars. The top ~90% have unlimited data or data where the limits will not be reached by playing Spotify. I could see someone going \"Hmm, that's 80% of the market we could sell this too\". reply Aaargh20318 6 hours agoparentprevThis seems like a very US-centric view or the world. If you make a decent amount of money you have to spend it on a car?

American or not, if you don't have a car you're probably not in the target market for a CarThing I purchased mine without any intent on using it in a car, and in fact I never did, but it was clear that I was engaging in out-of-bounds behavior in doing so. reply Aaargh20318 4 hours agorootparent> What a weird critique. American or not, if you don't have a car you're probably not in the target market for a CarThing It wasn't about having a car or not. It was the assumption that if you have a higher income you are automatically willing to spend a sizeable chunk on it on a car. Not all people are as obsessed with cars as the average American. I do pretty well for myself and I can think of a thousand things I'd rather spend my money on than on a car. reply Macha 6 hours agorootparentprevThe American assumption is that cars are purchased new, and are recent enough to have integrated android auto/carplay. reply bmelton 6 hours agorootparentOr it means that the people who can afford fast phones and expensive internet are capable of buying a $300 car stereo with AA/CP capability.

Notably, it's something I already have and already pay for. $300 more for a new stereo is still a lot to many people. Plus, if I buy beater cars but put a nice stereo in them I'm at risk of theft. And I have to pay install fees again if I buy my next beater. reply bmelton 5 hours agorootparentThis just further illustrates OP's point, of how very limited this market segment must be The buyers of this product are people who: - spend enough time in their car to want streaming audio - spend money on phone and internet - have a desire to improve their car to have streaming audio - but not enough to replace the car - and also not enough to replace the stereo - but definitely enough to pay money to add it - and are willing to remove the item they are paying for every time they leave the car to prevent its attractiveness to thieves reply yareal 6 hours agorootparentprevThe parent didn't say \"no car\" they said \"cheap car\". Most people can't afford to buy new cars. reply bmelton 6 hours agorootparentI was recently looking at starter cars for my daughter as a college graduation present, and I think you'd be surprised how far down-market those features have moved. A brand new Toyota Corolla is $22k and comes with both. For older cars, you can get a nice stereo for $300. If you aren't an audiophile, probably $100. reply infecto 6 hours agoparentprevI think its less about high-end/low-end, after all carplay did not hit Toyota until around 2018. Its simply that you still need a phone to use the device, might as well connect your phone to your cars audio and use your phones screen. reply rhplus 5 hours agorootparentThat’s the crux of it. Someone already paying for Spotify and practically any smartphone can just buy a car mount and get pretty much the same experience. My high/low comment missed the mark. Someone in that position (without CarPlay) is more likely buy a $20 mount for their phone than a $100 one-trick pony device. reply raverbashing 6 hours agorootparentprevBut the real question is why brick it?

Maybe enhanced DRM so the audio path can't be MITM'd, and the digital audio data captured? reply sbarre 6 hours agorootparentprevNot that it's an acceptable reason, but could they be paying some kind of ongoing license for a codec or some other licensed software on the thing? reply rhplus 6 hours agorootparentprevDevOps, monitoring, support costs, ongoing security burden. You can’t just ship a device specific API anymore and call it done. Those services will have at least monthly security updates, plus all the shimming and API back-compact work that has to be done as the backend Spotify services change. reply raverbashing 1 hour agorootparentI understand, at the same time the api shouldn't be too different to what is used by other devices (otherwise they would be just shooting themselves in the foot) reply somnic 6 hours agoprev [2 more] [flagged] yareal 6 hours agoparent [–] Blaming the victim of a con is just intellectual elitism.

What is the big deal? reply metaltyphoon 26 minutes agorootparentLove C# but public static implicit operator ClassA(ClassB b) Is very verbose. There are probably worse offenders. C# devs also love to add access modifiers even when its not needed. For example, private for anything that is meant to be private or the suffix `Async` even though you don't have a sync version of a method. reply jayd16 4 minutes agorootparentThe private keyword is needed because the default access is public to the same assembly. Usually that's very different from private. As for the implicit cast, two extra tokens in an uncommon case doesn't seem so bad when you consider all the nice common things like var, the lambda syntax, initializers, pattern matching, LINQ, delegates, etc. etc. reply ammo1662 15 hours agoprevThere is an alternative of LinqPad. It does not have a lot of features, but it is good enough for testing code snippets. https://github.com/roslynpad/roslynpad reply xnorswap 12 hours agoparentWhen it comes to C# REPLs I absolutely adore LinqPad, although recently it's felt like I've had to buy licenses for it increasingly often which I've found annoying. If any other REPL can get to a point where it can rival LinqPad in functionality then it'll be an absolute winner. The key features linqpad has that I'd need from any replacement: * Securely store secrets Util.GetPassword prompts the user for the password if it's not in it's store. Leverages the windows user credential store. * Keeps the process running This is absolutely key, it keeps alive the process even after the script has finished, so you can easily attach a debugger / profiler to it when the script isn't running, then start the script again. It also means you can use AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData to cache expensive setup if you're trying to profile something. * Quickly switch between expression / statements / program mode It'll intelligently work out if you've written a single expression vs multi-line statements, and you can switch to \"program\" and it'll wrap what you've done so far in a Main stub. * Easily define default App.Config files, default namespaces, default nuget packages. After finally getting a fiddly setup working, there's a \"Use as default for new queries\" button which is very convenient. Also the \"clone query\" functionality is similarly useful for copying not just the C# text but all the background namespace declarations, references, config, etc. And that's about it. I barely use the database connection and exploration side, but I do use it daily for hooking into DLLs to quickly test changes to our internal projects. reply stanac 5 hours agorootparentRoslynPad support user input with `Console.ReadLine()`, but that's about it.

For anything more serous I usually create full program and a bat/sh file to execute it in a conveniently. reply hnrodey 4 hours agorootparentprevGreat to see LINQPad getting some love.
