    "originBody": "PRESS RELEASE January 25, 2024 Apple announces changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store in the European Union For developers, the changes include new options for app distribution and payment processing For users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users. The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain. Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024. “The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.” The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store. Available for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announced new options for streaming games, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more. Changes to iOS In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include: New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces — including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces. New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces — enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app. New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines — enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences. Interoperability request form — where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone and iOS hardware and software features. As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default. Inevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include: Notarization for iOS apps — a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review. App installation sheets — that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information. Authorization for marketplace developers — to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers. Additional malware protections — that prevent iOS apps from launching if they’re found to contain malware after being installed to a user’s device. These protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer. However, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life. Within the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store. When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security. Changes to Safari Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options. This change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage. Changes to the App Store On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing. For developers, those changes include: New options for using payment service providers (PSPs) — within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services. New options for processing payments via link-out — where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps. Business planning tools — for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple’s new business terms for apps in the EU. The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including: App Store product page labels — that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing. In-app disclosure sheets — that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor. New App Review processes — to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors. Expanded data portability on Apple’s Data & Privacy site — where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party. For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system. New Business Terms for Apps in the EU Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing. The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world. Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers. Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems. The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements: Reduced commission — iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers, and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services. Payment processing fee — iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple. Core Technology Fee — iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold. For apps on iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS in the EU, developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to Apple. Apple is also sharing a fee calculator tool and new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses. Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a new Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta.

I'm not a lawyer, but based on the excerpts from the regulations below, it seems likely the EU would have grounds to open legal proceedings against Apple's new rules. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELE... \"Article 13: Anti-circumvention 4. The gatekeeper shall not engage in any behaviour that undermines effective compliance with the obligations of Articles 5, 6 and 7 regardless of whether that behaviour is of a contractual, commercial or technical nature, or of any other nature, or consists in the use of behavioural techniques or interface design. 7. Where the gatekeeper circumvents or attempts to circumvent any of the obligations in Article 5, 6, or 7 in a manner described in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Article, the Commission may open proceedings pursuant to Article 20 and adopt an implementing act referred to in Article 8(2) in order to specify the measures that the gatekeeper is to implement.\" reply mmaunder 8 hours agoparentApple is going full frontal attack and saying the DMA creates security risks in the headline, and then repeating that messaging throughout the article. Hard to believe the ECJ is going to stand by and watch Apple convince millions that the EU is working to harm their constituents security but that Apple is here to save them. reply mil22 8 hours agorootparentYes, it's been Apple's modus operandi with the App Store from the start: trick consumers into thinking the App Store being a monopoly is the only thing that can protect them against malware, illicit and questionable app content, pirated software, scams, and fraud. Most consumers understand those concepts and fear those things. Most understand nothing about the economic impact of monopolies and anti-competitive business behavior and the harms they cause consumers in the form of higher prices, lack of innovation, reduced choice, and poorer quality products and services. So Apple plays off those fears by using language consumers understand, making them actually want the very monopoly that is being forced on them and actually harming them while making billions for Apple. It's unethical behavior, no more defensible than Sam Bankman-Fried's effective altruism, a.k.a. \"mostly a front.\" This is all right out of Apple's standard playbook. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agorootparent>Yes, it's been Apple's modus operandi with the App Store from the start: trick consumers into thinking the App Store being a monopoly is the only thing that can protect them against malware, illicit and questionable app content, pirated software, scams, and fraud. When someone claims he's the only one who can protect the public I immediately see some question marks. reply oneplane 12 minutes agorootparentTechnically it's true that if you were to equate influence to the ability to protect, that when you lose that influence you also lose the ability to protect. So far, it's all been speculation, even drawing parallels with Android or Windows doesn't help because it's not similar enough. I would expect a broader ecosystem or additional facets to an existing ecosystem to also cause an expansion of questionable quality and practises, but that applies to everything, not just mobile phones. reply porsager 1 hour agorootparentprevYou're talking about the EU and states alike - right? reply oblio 35 minutes agorootparentYou do know that except for arguably Hungary (and even that's slowly being worked on... it's just really hard), all EU members are democracies and the EU itself is a democratic institution? reply niclo 58 minutes agorootparentprevOr like the United States with their military operations protecting w̶e̶a̶k̶ a̶n̶d̶ o̶p̶p̶r̶e̶s̶s̶e̶d̶ p̶e̶o̶p̶l̶e̶ their interests around the world ? reply heavyset_go 7 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, it's been Apple's modus operandi with the App Store from the start: trick consumers into thinking the App Store being a monopoly is the only thing that can protect them against malware, illicit and questionable app content, pirated software, scams, and fraud. Which is ironic, considering that the App Store is likely one of the largest malware distribution vectors on the planet. Looking at one virus alone, the App Store distributed half of a billion copies of it to iPhones and iPads[1]. Similarly, there are multimillion dollar scams on the App Store, as well[2].

[2] https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-s... reply jerbear4328 3 hours agorootparentThat one virus on the App Store was one of, if not the biggest known instance of a virus on the App Store, and your article gives a number four times smaller than half a billion. From your [1]: > But now, thanks to emails published as part of Apple's trial against Epic Games, we finally know how many iPhone users were impacted: 128 million in total, of which 18 million were in the US. > \"In total, 128M customers have downloaded the 2500+ apps that were affected LTD. Those customers drove 203M downloads of the 2500+ affected apps LTD,\" Dale Bagwell, who was Apple's manager of iTunes customer experience at the time, wrote in one of the emails. > Apple also disclosed the apps that included the malicious code, some incredibly popular such as WeChat and the Chinese version of Angry Birds 2. Still a huge deal, particularly in China, but considering all the virus really did was collect some device info (less information than most ad networks) (and maybe it was able to open URLs and popups on command)[1] and it was the biggest virus on the App Store ever (that I can find), maybe not as awful as you suggest. The scams on the App Store, yeah that's pretty bad. Though, can you point me at a marketplace as big as the App Store without loads of scams?

Not the person you're replying to but isn't that the point? reply pjerem 3 hours agorootparentprev> all the virus really did was collect some device info (less information than most ad networks) Nah, that would mean that what really protects iOS users from malwares is just a good sandboxing mechanism and not the \"human\" control of the App Store. That would also mean that bypassing the App Store shouldn’t be a real security issue. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentIt’s pretty clear that it’s both. Claiming otherwise is a bit disingenuous. An app store with no human or automatic validation and not $100 would have a magnitude or two more malware. reply thefz 50 minutes agorootparentprevApple uses the excuse of security to hold a monopoly. You are shown that this is by no means as secure as they want you to believe. Then you argue that \"of course, with a market that big!\" So basically you are proving that Apple uses the excuse of security to hold a monopoly. reply bushbaba 3 hours agorootparentprevHow’s that compare to android though? For the most part apple’s walled garden IS safer and more privacy preserving than android. reply dtech 2 hours agorootparentWhat kind of take is this? The main channel for apps is extremely similar to iOS's App store. I highly doubt if there is a difference, it's due to non-Google App stores or sideloading. reply sroussey 2 hours agorootparentIsn’t that the point? reply pxoe 43 minutes agorootparentprevandroid just checks every app for safety (play protect) and isolates every app at system level. solutions for sideloading are actually very simple. so, is it \"safer\"? what's \"safer\" about it? or is it really just a meme apple has successfully perpetuated about it's limitations? reply geysersam 1 hour agorootparentprevIf Apples system is better they should be able to compete successfully in a free market.

Especially the constant mentioning of the \"EU\" when this applies to the EEA, leaving out two entire countries.

I was under the impression that iOS had more quality apps than Android, just based on personal experience of (quickly and sloppily!) using Android apps. Could you give a few examples of the quality Android apps that are missing on iOS? Would be fun to check out. reply joshstrange 0 minutes agorootparentThe quality overall on iOS is way better than Android. There are obviously going to be a few outliers but I’ve worked at multiple companies where Android is an afterthought (in every way imaginable). I’ve also heard the same from peers in the industry. iOS apps bring in more money and that absolutely shows in the time and effort companies put into their apps. The big names (FAANG) might have equality but once you leave the top apps the quality difference can be stark. kelnos 3 hours agorootparentprevSo what? That's entirely irrelevant to the point being made. reply janaagaard 14 minutes agorootparentprevIt's my understanding that iOS is generally considered a more secure alternative than Android, and that part of this is the app review process, that is part of the App Store. So isn't there at least some truth in that opening this up will create a less secure environment? reply amelius 28 minutes agorootparentprevIf this creates security risks, then why is the Web somehow ok or otherwise not shut down? reply IshKebab 49 minutes agorootparentprevNot only that, they're going to try and scare users away from third party app stores with warning dialogs: > The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.

They very likely ended up in disagreement and basically told their EU regulators to take them to court if they don’t like it. This happens all the time. reply somenameforme 4 hours agorootparentThis made me think of the other recent case against Apple from Epic, where Apple's response to the court was essentially trolling. The judgement required Apple to allow apps to advertise outside marketplaces where users could purchase in-game items. So apple responded by allowing developers to apply to place exactly one text-only (non-hyperlink), static, reference to an outside payment source on one page in an app, and further added a new term that developers must also pay Apple 27% of all revenue from these off-site purchases. I'm certain they have the best legal team that money can buy, but I'm equally certain that that legal team is under the sort of pressure that happens when a multinational corporation is looking at the prospect of possibly losing billions of dollars in zero-effort recurring profit.

Unfortunately, Apples’ shenanigans the past few years, starting with “we will scan all pictures you want to send to iCloud on your phone” which signalled to me that Apple feels fine about unilaterally altering our agreement whenever they feel like, have increasingly soured me on their brand to the point where we as a household and as a business were discussing to stop purchasing new Apple products and services. Their recent actions, both in terms of their Epic situation as well as their reaction to these new EU regulations, have cemented that decision. reply simondotau 2 hours agorootparentWho will you change to? Pretty much every other company with a mechanism to send photos to the cloud scans your pictures for CSAM right now and nobody cares. They've been doing it for many years. Nobody cares. Unlike every other cloud photo service, Apple invited community discussion before implementing it. Apple heard the feedback and didn't implement it, but people still criticise Apple as if they did. What should I conclude from this? That criticism of Apple is frequently false, disingenuous and devoid of context? Pretty much every other comparable mainstream ecosystem has most of the same vices. Most are arguably worse in my opinion. Epic still haven't satisfactorily explained why they haven't pursued Sony or Nintendo with the same arguments. reply rahoulb 1 hour agorootparentI'm old enough to remember the 90s and Microsoft. The olden days equivalent of the HN crowd (Slashdot? Kuro5hin?) hated Microsoft's behaviour but had to build on their platforms because there wasn't an alternative that would pay the bills. So Microsoft kept raking in profits and probably thought that everything was OK and there wasn't an issue. But that ill-feeling meant that as soon as an alternative emerged (in this case Apple, powered by open-source, Unix, the web - and later smartphones with the iPhone and Android) there was an exodus and Microsoft's attempts to regain ground (IIS, Windows Phone) were widely ignored. Apple is on the same ground now (and I say this as an Apple-lover). They are pulling in huge amounts of money through their behaviour but I have no doubt, as soon as an alternative appears (probably through some platform shift) they will come to regret it. UPDATE: and it would be ironic if the Vision Pro was the thing that triggered the platform shift. If the Vision Pro works well as a Mac alternative (a proper productivity environment but with an infinite screen), once others implement the same idea effectively (and maybe not quite as well as Apple has) it could be the catalyst for developers (and hence apps) jumping ship. reply mdekkers 2 hours agorootparentprev> Who will you change to? Since there is only one alternative, I am going to assume that this is a rethorical question designed to invite a discussion about how the alternative is significantly worse in your point of view. Not an interesting debating technique, to be honest. > Pretty much every other company with a mechanism to send photos to the cloud scans your pictures for CSAM right now and nobody cares. They've been doing it for many years. There are alternatives available that don't do this, but again, your point appears to be written simply to elicit this specific reponse. Your \"pretty much every other company\" makes it clear that you are also aware that options exist. > Nobody cares. Your next paragraph indicates that, actually, a _lot_ of people cared. > Apple invited community discussion before implementing it. Not really. Apple made an announcement, and in the face of an absolute, unmitigated _shitstorm_ of criticism from pretty much _everyone_, they -after fighting an incredibly hard and expensive PR battle- grudgingly called a temporary truce and relented on some of the items they wanted to implement. To frame this as \"Apple worked with the community and listened\" is... fancy. The point of that debacle, and this sub-thread, is that Apple is irrepairibly damaging their brand. In the \"we will scan all your photos on your device to make sure the content is acceptable\" story, they destroyed (literally forever, in the eyes of many people) their branding message that they were on _my_ side, when it comes to privacy and unwanted intrustion of all vendors, including Apple, into my device. That was literally the reason I switched from Android, and by retroactively changing that deal unilaterally on devices I already purchased, they instantly and irrepairably invalidated my only reasons for buying into their overpriced and closed walled garden. In this new debacle with the EU and their -frankly- childish reponse they once again showed their disdain for their users. Apple sucks. reply simondotau 1 hour agorootparentSigh. Devolving a discussion into meta commentary about debating techniques is not an interesting debating technique either. There isn't only one other alternative to the Apple ecosystem, I was asking an actual question. It wasn't a rhetorical question. But even if it was, are you seriously saying that rhetorical questions are a point of criticism in persuasive writing? Seriously? Then you want to take issue with \"Nobody cares\" as though it was intended to be literal rather than idiomatic. For the record I was being idiomatic. I hope this clarifies things. As for your alternative interpretation of what went down in the great Apple CSAM scanning controversy, none of what you said strictly conflicts with what I said. The core facts aren't in dispute, but I accept that people interpreted motives differently. Do you seriously think Apple would have made a big song and dance about their proposal around CSAM scanning if the intent was to implement it regardless? (Apologies for the rhetorical question.) Obviously they wouldn't have. They would have just subtly changed the license terms and implemented it without telling anyone. It's amazing how quickly people forget why Apple wanted to implement the initial fingerprinting stage on-device, rather than in the cloud as all their major competitors had already done. Disdain for users' privacy, really? Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole point of doing it on device was, as I'm sure you remember, protecting privacy by having industry standard scanning while remaining compatible with end-to-end encryption. reply turquoisevar 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the matter at hand.

I mean the article by Apple that describes the terms and options literally is titled “Distributing apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link” and there a plenty of examples provided. > and further added a new term that developers must also pay Apple 27% of all revenue from these off-site purchases. Both the district court[1] as well as the appellate court that later affirmed the ruling[2] spelled out in clear plain language that developers would still owe Apple the commission, that Apple would be able to audit developers and that it’s all legal because its payment for the use of Apple’s IP. Only difference is that the courts assumed Apple would simply charge 30% instead of the discounted 27%. Some examples: > In essence, Apple uses the DPLA to license its IP to developers in exchange for a $99 fee and an ongoing 30% commission on developers' iOS revenue. > As the district court noted, in a world where Apple maintains its distribution restriction but payment processing is opened up, Apple would still be contractually entitled to its 30% commission on in-app purchasers. Apart from any argument by Epic, the district court \"presume[d]\" that Apple could \"utilize[e] a contractual right to audit developers ... to ensure compliance with its commissions.\" > Because the court upheld the app-distribution restriction, Apple would still be entitled to its 30% commission on in-app purchases within apps downloaded from the App Store. On its own initiative, the district court floated the idea of Apple permitting multiple in-app payment processors while reserving a right to audit developers to ensure compliance with the 30% commission. > Suffice it to say, IAP is not merely a payment processing system, as Epic Games suggests, but a comprehensive system to collect commission and manage in-app payments. > First, and most significant, as discussed in the findings of facts, IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple's intellectual property. Even in the absence of IAP, Apple could still charge a commission on developers.

Then when it comes time for implementation, they make an implementation that isn't exactly 100% in accordance with the regulation and wait to be taken to court. Then they get to argue with a judge related to what is and isn't in accordance with the regulation. If they get lucky, the judge will rule partly to them, which gives them less strict regulation.

By my calculations, this would mean Apple's EU App Store monopoly is worth 9.375% of the company's worldwide revenue. Please let me know if I made an error in my math. Why is Apple willing to risk 10% of its worldwide revenue to protect 9.375% of its worldwide revenue?

So what are we left with? Apps where users are the product, like Facebook, and freemium apps where you end up paying to get anything useful done with it anyway. Apps where the parent company is making millions if not billions. Is anybody upset that those guys have to chip in for iOS development? I personally think Apples approach is the lesser of two evils. We don’t pay for OS explicitly anymore. But look at Windows and Android… you end up paying somehow in the end anyway. I’d rather it be through fees on apps than more insidious approaches. And no. Paying for the phone is not a viable way to pay for the OS. That incentives the phone maker to ditch OS updates for old phones. And we know that’s a real issue.

And it turns out it's specific to each region, and I need to go ask for the paperwork in the first place. If the requirement is really a non profit legal status, Apple just raised the bar from \"apps that just make no money\" to \"apps that registered to their local governing bodies that they have a goal of not making money\", and that's a huge leap with a crazy high barrier for a random dev (imagine a kid in uni) to push a free app. reply throwaway290 0 minutes agorootparent\"Don't have an idea\" does not mean \"difficult\". FateOfNations 10 hours agorootparentprevHere in the US at least we have the concept of \"fiscal sponsorship\" in the non-profit space. A registered non-profit organization acts as sponsor for smaller groups and projects. The activities still have to be compliant, but the small groups don't have to go through the expense of setting up a free-standing organization. The Linux Foundation does this for quite a few open source software projects, for example. This is likely a good model for open source apps in this situation. reply xyzzy_plugh 9 hours agorootparentSure... but you can't just \"join\" the Linux Foundation on a whim. I'd almost argue it's easier to form a non-profit entity that become sponsored by a non-profit organization such as TLF. This almost reinforces the parent's point. reply FateOfNations 9 hours agorootparentThat depends... I don't know the situation in the EU, but based on personal experience in the US: If you are expecting less than $25k in revenue (donations, grants, program service revenue, etc.) in each of your first three years, you can use the IRS's abbreviated process and get setup within a month (for the cost of setting up a corporation with your state government). If that exemption doesn't apply, it can take the IRS over a year to approve your application for tax exempt status. There are also significant compliance costs that can be burdensome for a small organization. The TLF is a big dog for big dog projects, and I was just using them as an example of the structure. The Apache Foundation has their own flavor of governance, as does Numfocus (which sponsors a bunch of scientific computing projects). I'd expect that this move will probably trigger the creation of some \"mobile app developer collective\" organizations that specialize in this kind of thing, kind of like a \"digital makerspace\". reply naasking 7 hours agorootparentprev> Sure... but you can't just \"join\" the Linux Foundation on a whim.

Assuming there is some legal framework allowing a smaller entity to piggy back on Mozilla or the Linux Foundation's non profit registration in the developer's country, the dev still needs to at least register as an official entity, which can be awkward depending on their status (do student visa residents get a right to do that for instance ?). There's also the more complex cases of a for profit business publishing an open-source app. Do they need to register a different non profit entity to avoid paying for the open source part then ? To then explain to Apple how the arrangement is made and have them approve it is another story as well, as we're already seeing that Apple has no intention to make things simple regarding any of these rules. All in all, there will be clear cut cases that will show it can be simple, but I totally see a long tail of devs stopped at any point of the process, and it's probably by design. reply balp 4 hours agorootparentThere is no mandatory government registration of non-profits in Sweden. You can get a like a tradename protection by registering like a company name. Suppose you would like to start a non-profit or any other organization. You need a yearly meeting to take the signed protocol to your local bank if you need an account. If you like to have an organizationalnumber, you need to apply to the tax authority. If you do business activity and like a local name protection you need to apply to bolagsverket. Depending on the size of the app these steps might be helpful. I don't think our local chapter of FSF, has done any of the registrations just as an example.

Apple’s default construction for getting payments for the usage of their IP is via commission on revenue. This is by definition a differential pricing strategy because not everyone has to pay for the usage of Apple’s IP. Many didn’t like the commission structure and made all sorts of arguments against it. It would just be for payment processing, it would just be for distribution, etc. Apple has always maintained it was primarily for the use of their IP, all the rest is thrown in as a bonus. They have structured it as such in the developer agreement and US courts have wholesale accepted it as such. One alternative that has been floated around a lot by people that accept that Apple wants payment for their IP but didn’t like the commission structure regardless was to split off the fee for IP into its own thing. Now they do that very thing in the form of the CTF (at a more competitive rate than Epic does for Unreal mind you). In addition there’s a separate commission for App Store services and a separate commission for payment processing. Now the new complaint is that this payment for their IP for first installs on EU iPhones per 12 months in excess of 1M installs in the EU isn’t good either. So what is the desired outcome? Use Apple’s IP for free? I don’t see how this disadvantages third party stores. Does it disadvantage Steam when Epic comes knocking on my door for their share of the pie? Epic charges me 5% of all my revenue above a million, Apple charges me €0.50 of all my EU installs on iOS above 1M installs in the EU. Apple’s fee is directly tied to my usage of their IP, I pay them €0.50 in 12 monthly installments for each installation that goes over 1M, but they don’t touch anything else I make off of that install. Epic wants 5% over every dollar I make over $1M worldwide. Don’t get me wrong, personally I was content with my 30% and the 15% is a steal for what I get out of it. But if commission of revenue is the big bad, then the only logical thing for licensing IP is an upfront cost for usage whether you earn money with it or not. This is how it was with consoles. Thousands upfront for the right to publish and using the IP + thousands for every build to be certified + commission over revenue. Indies later on got a reduced rate in the hundreds, until you got big. reply Zak 10 hours agorootparent> So what is the desired outcome? Use Apple’s IP for free? The desired outcome is for third-party apps and app stores to be able to run on iOS devices for free. Traditionally, building software for consumer operating systems, including Mac OS hasn't been considered using the OS vendor's IP such that it would require permission or payment. reply rescbr 8 hours agorootparentTraditionally, it was very much paid. Compilers, SDKs, documentation, every vendor charged for those. You have to thank Stallman et al. for your free C compiler. reply Zak 8 hours agorootparentDev tools were often paid, true, but not necessarily to the OS vendor. What Apple has done here is bring the console gaming model to general-purpose computing devices. I believe the EU wishes to roll that back and will probably not allow Apple's announced fees and restrictions. reply thegrimmest 6 hours agorootparentprevSomeone always pays for the cost to develop and maintain the OS. In the Windows model it's the user. In the iOS model it's the app developer. I don't find the argument that either is superior particularly compelling, and certainly don't see a reason for legislators to be involved in dictating which model a particular company should use. OSs are expensive things to build and maintain, and I don't take for granted the fact that my iPhone XS Max (2018) is running the latest version if iOS. If Apple's App Store pricing structure makes that possible, then it's certainly working for me. reply turquoisevar 5 hours agorootparentprevAppeal to tradition isn’t a beneficial argument, which is why it’s considered a fallacy. It crumbles under the most benign forms of scrutiny. The comment below already pointed out that vendors charged for all kinds of stuff. Your reply seems to suggest that, for some reason, you’re ok with that, but not if the OS vendor does it. There’s also the argument that investment in frameworks for iOS is significantly higher than, say, the investment Microsoft made into frameworks for Windows back in the day. Then there’s the general criticism of an appeal to tradition that there were many traditions that we currently aren’t ok with, and an appeal to tradition suggests that they are inherently good just by virtue of once having been a tradition. I remember a tradition not too long ago where console manufacturers would charge thousands just for access to the platform and the IP (sometimes rolled into the price of a dev kit), plus thousands more for each build that needed certification plus a commission on sales. It was so cumbersome for some developers that they did not bother updating their game[0]. Even later on, with lower fees, there’s still a lot of cost to get games published[1]. Now, you might say that consoles are nothing like iPhones, and I will respond by saying that iPhones are nothing like Macs. And on and on we might go. What matters is what is legal. Apple is in the clear to charge for usage of their IP, even when they use differential pricing and even when other companies are willing to give away their work for free because they see other avenues of revenue by doing so. Further down, you state: > I believe the EU wishes to roll that back and will probably not allow Apple's announced fees and restrictions. Can I ask what fuels that belief? Or perhaps more importantly, what fuels the belief that they are at all in the position to do something about it? I see a lot of “Wait till your dad comes home” style comments every time Apple is brought up as if there’s some collective amnesia that “dad” also has to stick to the law and doesn’t have the final say in this universe. The European Parliament and Council of the European Union are the legislative bodies of the EU, and as such, they can create laws. But like any legislative body, they are limited and need to move within the bounds of the laws. The European Commission, on the other hand, functions as the executive body of the EU and is to enforce the law. They, too, are limited by the bounds of the law. Neither the DMA nor its enforcement have been tested in court yet. All of that will start once the EC tries to enforce something, and the EC has, at best, a mixed track record before the court. Apple made a smart move today because, contrary to what many here think, they went above and beyond the DMA requirements (e.g., it has no price regulation, so all the discounts in fees are freebies), and as such, took the wind out of the EC’s legal argument sails for many of the potential arguments. The biggest hurdle that one needs to overcome is IP and property rights. Something neither the EU nor the US wants to tackle because it would have significant effects across all commerce. The idea that you can just take a company’s IP and essentially make it public domain will never fly. At best, in sporadic instances, can you get a court to agree that a company should be forced to charge “reasonable” fees, but with Apple’s fee structure for the EU being less than that of the rest of the markets and and option to evade all but one fee, it’s nearly impossible to convince a court that the CTF is somehow out of line. Ironically, as I write this, I just realized that an upfront fee for IP usage that is entirely decoupled from revenue is actually very traditional when it comes to fees like this. The general timeline from investigating violations to ECJ is about ten years, so this will take a while. 0: https://www.destructoid.com/fez-patch-wont-be-fixed-because-... 1: https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/30/launching-indie-game... reply Zak 4 hours agorootparent> Appeal to tradition isn’t a beneficial argument, which is why it’s considered a fallacy. Appeal to tradition is a fallacy in logic, but laws are not made using pure logic. Laws are made when some group with sufficient political power wants them to be made, and such groups are often driven by tradition, what they perceive to be tradition. > Or perhaps more importantly, what fuels the belief that they are at all in the position to do something about it? The European Union is a government; it makes and enforces laws. In this case, it has made a law called the Digital Markets Act which addresses certain types of gatekeeping behavior by large tech companies including Apple. Some readings of this law I've seen forbid Apple from charging fees for distributing apps outside its store and from using any legal workarounds to circumvent that prohibition. It remains to be seen how EU regulators and courts will interpret it. Your comment makes several references to \"IP\", but isn't clear about what IP is involved. Is it necessary to use inventions patented by Apple to write an app that runs on an iPhone? Is it necessary to know Apple's trade secrets (aside from things like signing keys that exist for the sole purpose of gatekeeping)? Does it require making copies of things Apple holds copyright to? reply turquoisevar 3 hours agorootparent> Laws are made when some group with sufficient political power wants them to be made, and such groups are often driven by tradition, what they perceive to be tradition. This can certainly be a motivator. In Europe, and the EU in particular, many individual member states as well as the EU itself have the tradition of including an explanatory memorandum when passing new laws. The function of this is to explain the mindset of the legislators and the motivation behind a law. It is sometimes used by courts to gain clarity on laws that might be a bit more ambiguous in their intent. Below is a link to the explanatory memorandum of the DMA. I wasn’t able to find a reference to traditions on regarding licensing fees, or monetization of IP. But you’re welcome to point me in the right direction. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELE... > Some readings of this law I've seen forbid Apple from charging fees for distributing apps outside its store and from using any legal workarounds to circumvent that prohibition. It remains to be seen how EU regulators and courts will interpret it. Could you point me to these readings, or better yet the specific articles that these readings are based on? To the best of my knowledge the DMA has little in the way of price regulation. So this is news to me. > Your comment makes several references to \"IP\", but isn't clear about what IP is involved. The IP in question would be code written by Apple provided in the form of frameworks, SDKs, APIs and the like. There’s also the use of software like Xcode, but for the sake of simplicity let’s stick with code written by Apple. Creating an app by definition makes use of this IP. IP I’m sure will have cost a considerable amount to develop by Apple, so I can see why they’re eager to get payment for it or, alternatively, strategically decide who can use it for free. Trade secrets aren’t really involved in this and neither is copying, at least not in most cases. reply ClumsyPilot 10 hours agorootparentprev> So what is the desired outcome? Use Apple’s IP for free?

You are running on their ARM chip under their kernel, using their libraries to read touch events and display to the screen. IP is incredibly broad; you can't really avoid using say all copyrighted libraries. If you are speaking toward is there a path to write applications which will work on iOS devices without signing agreements, paying royalties or having legal action taken against you, there's the Safari browser and it sounds like there will be many more web browsers soon. > I can publish on windows without using Microsoft IP, I can publish on android without using google IP, right? I don't see how you could publish a legitimate app for Windows without using e.g. ReadFile. I don't know how you would publish an Android app without using its proprietary manifest file; you probably come closest there to a minimal working application due to instead using lots of Oracle IP. reply planede 24 minutes agorootparentUsing APIs is fair use. If you can avoid using Apple code to do so, or only minimal ones, like headers, then I think you would be in the clear. See Google vs Oracle.

I’ve done so myself out of curiosity, and it seems others have done so as well[0]. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend it. It’s excruciating. That said, isn’t this just a bad-faith argument wrapped in an attempted gotcha? Where your premise is that if you don’t have a choice, then you shouldn’t be charged? If Apple would say: “Hey, you can use Swift for free because it’s open source, and you’re welcome to benefit from our contributions to it, and while you’re at it, you’re allowed to use all the basic low-level frameworks that communicate with the OS for free as well. But anything more than that, and we want you to pay us for it.” Would you then be fully on board with them charging for using the remaining IP they own? Are IP and ownership rights fluid based on your own moral framework, depending on if one has a choice or not? Should I just blow past the toll booth of the only bridge here that allows me access to the rest of the country? How about the only ISP that provides service here? Should they just allow me to use their infrastructure so I can write you this comment? The other day I saw a nice TV at the local store. It’s pretty much the only place I can get this TV. Do I have your blessing to take it because I don’t have much of a choice? I make apps for a living, I’m literally the only place on earth where you can get my app. My app saves users a lot of money. Should people just pirate my app and force me on a diet of hardtack? Where does this fluidity start and where does it end? I thought, for better or worse (and we can spend hours debating this part alone), we decided that when someone owns something, and especially when they create something, they get to decide who, if anyone, gets to use it and at what’s price if any. 0: https://github.com/richardjrossiii/iOSAppInAssembly reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentThe point is that Apple can't say \"this fee is required to distribute out precious IP, and this is a fair price for our IP, look how happy people are to use it\", while also saying \"oh, and if you don't use our IP, you aren't allowed to publish an app at all\". And no, this doesn't entitle others to steal the IP in question. The problem is the second part, not the first. reply dann0 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is, in fact, a bad faith argument. Developers are not forced to develop iOS apps. There are other alternatives like web apps or only developing for Android. Developers have choices. If you want a store in a mall, you have to pay higher leases and probably additional fees than you would if you operated out of your garage.

It should be a conversation more about reasonableness than entitlement. reply Nevermark 8 hours agorootparent> If you want a store in a mall [...] If any global entity owned such a large percentage of malls that suppliers had little choice but to appear there in order to be competitive, and charged for mall use via a general tax on original and follow up economic activity (instead of in proportion to mall resources used), requiring products be registered with them, and copies of direct and follow up sales records, many people might protest that too. reply dann0 7 hours agorootparentHave a look into Westfield / Scentre. I think a large part of the disagreement here is the idea that all digital things should be free compared to how the physical world has been forever. To sell to a hardware store, for example, you need to offer the retailer 40% as a minimum. Then you need to pay, often compulsorily, trading terms, ranging fees, advertising levies and other off invoice things. They have high costs to cover, but they also force shelf prices down as much as they can. In my opinion, Supermarkets and hardware stores mis-use their market power way more than Apple appears to be doing reply Nevermark 6 hours agorootparentI take your point. Commercial real estate companies can abuse their market position too! But Apple's (duopoly level) gatekeeper status on global/mobile applications, services, information and transactions is allowing them to hold back an enormous amount of latent innovation. Shelf space is important and necessary for many businesses, but that isn't where tomorrow's world is being crafted. reply dann0 6 hours agorootparentOh, I’m not a blind supporter of Apple. They absolutely could be much less arrogant and handle this and many other things much better. However, the entitlement that is pervasive here that whatever Apple does is bad and it’s ok to expect them to give their work and infrastructure away for free is just crazy. If we’re arguing about the value that developers get for what they pay, or if Apple is stifling innovation, or even if Apple is being maliciously compliant, then that’s a different conversation. I’m much more sympathetic to that. But this is about people demanding Apple give their IP away from free so that they can make money from that expensive to make and operate infrastructure is ridiculous reply Nevermark 5 hours agorootparentI don't think anyone believes Apple shouldn't be able to set normal supply and demand optimized product and service fees. But Apple owns one of only two global mobile app, service and info platforms, and so has tremendous power to limit and veto other businesses opportunities. Few businesses that need to operate in those ecosystems can be viable only operating in one of them. And Apple is using that tremendous leverage to do two things normal businesses can't do. Both of which damage the larger economy. 1) It is gatekeeping fundamental technological and business innovation. Apple limits the types of technology and business models that it will allow on its platforms, in favor of its own versions, or in favor of simply not enabling innovation it finds competitively threatening. It is very difficult for new innovation on the margins to succeed starting out unable to participate in half the marketplace. 2. It has enough veto power over businesses, that it is able to tax other businesses' success, instead of charging for the value of its products and services to them. I.e. Apple charges a percentage of other businesses product and service revenue - instead of flat charges for its security checks, app listings, etc. Apple charges a percentage of follow up revenue, even if the transaction happens elsewhere. Apple charges a percentage on revenue of transactions that don't even require Apple's assistance or participation but were initially enabled by being on Apple's platform. It even charges a percentage of revenue for fourth parties it has no relationship with, such as for transactions by participants on third party markets, like digital art creators! No normal business could extend taxes on other's productivity like that, to multiple levels of extraction, independent of productive value provided. They would be rapidly replaced by a competitor happy to make profits set by supply and demand, instead of taxes imposed by the ability to deny (or seriously hamper) entry to a strategic global market. reply dwaite 31 minutes agorootparent> But Apple owns one of only two global mobile app, service and info platforms, and so has tremendous power to limit and veto other businesses opportunities. Few businesses that need to operate in those ecosystems can be viable only operating in one of them. However, it is important (from a capitialism angle at least) to realize Apple has never falsely represented things. They have not done a bait and switch. They launched with their 30% commission rate on agency-model pricing almost 15 years ago (for apps, which was the same commission rate for music before that), and every change in licensing terms has been either enabling new transactions that were otherwise restricted, or by offering lower rates - such as for certain types of financial transactions, or certain business sizes. They have also tended to do this with public policy changes rather than unilateral arrangements, although there are some partner programs around tvOS which are pretty tailor-built such that few companies would be able to take advantage of them. And it is worth noting that they launched first as a platform for web based apps, and when you filter web technologies to actual standards (and not Google inventions) they tend to fight between first and second place with Chrome on actual interoperability. Companies recognize the marketing value of having a native app within the App Store vs just a normal website. Apple obviously does as well. > Apple charges a percentage of follow up revenue, even if the transaction happens elsewhere.

To be fair, these visualizations can harm one's intuitions about how the metrics work in higher dimensions, so I can understand arguments against visualization. But in another example, I think even many people can come out of a Linear Algebra class and not understand that a matrix operating on a vector always performs an affine transformation on that vector (yes, I know we can abuse and get other forms but let's keep general due to context). I think this is something math education can improve on since we are highly visual creatures. But it is always a tough balance since that same tool to help learning can decrease generalization if internalized improperly. But that can also be said about anything and is why I dislike the common test focused paradigm of education.

Would the other side win? Would the stalemated side pass? Neither seems at all satisfactory. The non-castling variant was invented by Vladimir Kramnik[2] explored by Deep Mind not on a whim but specifically as part of Vlad's exploration of whether this chess variant would help to revitalise the game given how computer evaluation has affected theory.[3] There were also a couple of no-castling tournaments played, but like chess960[4], opinions were very much divided about whether or not it was actually any kind of improvement.

The game keeps going until one side gets too tired and gives up (or makes a mistake that breaks the stalemate). Another idea would be a \"Fortnite rule\": after $X turns, the outermost edge of the board kills any pieces left in it (or becomes \"the storm\" in Fortnite parlance); repeat every $X turns until someone's forced into checkmate because there's only a 2×2 square left and nowhere else for the kings to go except within each others' attack range. reply seanhunter 1 hour agorootparentWhat do you mean the game keeps on going? One side has to move but has no legal moves. That's what I was asking - do they get to \"pass\" and the other side gets to move? This is how it works in the game of go for instance. In chess that would be more or less equivalent to the non-stalemated player winning, because in many stalemate positions if you had an extra move you could checkmate. The stalemate rule adds something that the attacking player has to keep in mind and gives the defending player something to shoot for - lots of creative and tricky play arises from this, with IM Eric Rosen being the most famous exponent[1] so much so that he now has a particular type of stalemate trap named after him.[2] I'm not seriously entertaining your Fortnite rule. That is such a radical departure from the game of chess as not to be the same at all, so you could have that as a chess variant or whatever but it's fundamentally a different game.

Neither a bishop, a pawn or rook can help that way. After one move, it can go to f4 where it can add on as a second attacker to the queen on 4 squares. After another move it can go to d3, where it can again cover squares the queen cant (e2,e5).

This also leads to situations where two knights can be positioned amongst other pieces such that one knight is able to capture the other but not vice versa. reply zelphirkalt 11 hours agorootparentMost people think of the knight move as one straight and then one diagonal. However, this is still ambiguous. Imagine one up, then one down left for example, resulting in the square left to the original square.

However in western chess, it doesn't matter what pieces are in the other 4 locations of the 3x2 rectangle. In Chinese chess, you can only move from A to B if X is unoccupied. The locations marked \"-\" don't matter if they are occupied or not. A X - - - B A - X - - B - - B A X - - A - X B - etc. Of course, all the other pieces have their own rules as well, so it's a significantly different game. There is no queen, the elephant is sort of like a bishop but must move 2 squares at a time, the cannon moves horizontally and vertically but cannot kill without having exactly one (not zero) piece in-between, the \"guards\" and king all cannot leave the king's palace which is a 3x3 box, the pawns can move sideways after they cross the river in the middle of the board, etc. Come to think of it the only piece that has the exact same rules are the 2 \"chariots\" which are positioned in the same place as western rooks and function exactly like western rooks. reply zelphirkalt 10 hours agorootparentprevChess players do, yet experience of basically any non-player I have ever heard describing it as \"one straight, one diagonal\" tells me otherwise.

Yeah the queen can move everywhere, but she's \"predictable\". The way a knight moves makes it more difficult to defend against IMO. reply Agentlien 3 hours agorootparentA huge difference is that a queen, like a rook, can attack a whole row and column, making it possible to box in an opponent's king. A knight has limited reach and can never attack a square the same colour as the one it is occupying. Another is that a queen, like a rook, can reach any unblocked square in at most two moves. A Knight can require up to six moves! Add to this the ability to move and attack diagonally like a bishop, but without the restriction of staying on the same colour of squares... The queen is immensely powerful. reply FartyMcFarter 41 minutes agorootparentprevKnights are objectively nowhere near as powerful as queens. However they're underrated in blitz chess, where their visually hard to see moves often catch people unaware.

You might as well use a hollow circle at that point. (b) when we say \"chess pieces can be redesigned to be...\" then I think about actual physical pieces, it would not do to make these as actual physical pieces because an accidental misplacement turns a rook into a bishop or vice versa. Gotta make the bishop look like it is \"sniping\" along the diagonals while the rook looks more \"sweeping\" maybe? (c) don't make the king a little-queen. Make the king a little square to emphasize \"it can only threaten the neighboring square,\" then it looks more visually distinctive. The pawns are fun though. reply tempestn 9 hours agoparentI think I'd be inclined to disambiguate them by making the ends of the bishop pointed and the ends of the rook blunt. When moving along a diagonal you're moving in the direction of square corners, vs faces for moving in ranks and files, so it makes sense in that way, and it also evokes the shapes of the classical pieces. reply jayknight 11 hours agoparentprev>an accidental misplacement turns a rook into a bishop or vice versa This was my first thought too.

This design doesn't account for many special qualities and behaviors pieces exhibit. It doesn't indicate that * while pawns do capture diagonally (forward), they are pushed forward in straight line * they can capture en passant * they can move by 2 squares from their initial file, and only from the initial file * they can be promoted to another piece * Knight moves are not inhibited by the presence of other pieces (unlike any other piece, a Knight can \"jump over\" pieces) * castling * special status of the King (unless it's conveyed by that circle in the middle, but it's not nearly as readable a symbol as a crown) So this design kind of works if you already have complete information from elsewhere, but isn't that great if it were your first source of info.

But that said, it does feel like the difference between font styles in programming, which for me have a very meaningful impact over time.

But maybe tweaks there. reply nescioquid 11 hours agoparentIf you're ever going to get the point where you recognize tactics (or anything, for that matter) on the board, how the pieces move must already be internalized and not require any thought. People even especially practice visualizing knight journeys between arbitrary squares to make this more automatic. If you ask an experienced player to use a weird piece set, you will only be introducing error and cognitive overhead. If you ask someone naive to the game to use the piece set, do they internalize how the pieces move more quickly and get over the impedance when they start to use a normal set? Going at a tangent to your idea, maybe it is possible to construct a set that aids the performance of a naive player, but which degrades the performance of a more experienced opponent.

This is why rooks are worth 5 and bishops are worth 3, despite both having apparently equal freedom of movement (just rotated 45 degrees).

And the bishop is stuck on one color. reply V-2 53 minutes agorootparent\"This is why rooks are worth 5 and bishops are worth 3\" Such evaluations are only a rule of thumb intended for beginners. It's all context dependent. There are positions where a Bishop is more powerful than a Rook. Other things being equal, Bishops tend to be preferred over Knights in serious play (especially when you've got a Bishop pair, which is synergically more powerful than one Bishop times two), even though both are theoretically \"worth\" 3 pawns. Two minor pieces are usually worth more than a Rook and a pawn, and more often than not it isn't a good idea to exchange the former for the latter, even though the total value appears the same (3+3 = 5+1). And so on. reply HeWhoLurksLate 12 hours agoparentprevAt least at the level I play at, knights are invaluable because of their ability to jump over walls and threaten multiple pieces at the same time - they're the piece most likely to create a successful fork (threatening two pieces of value at the same time, likely forcing your opponent to pick which thing they're more willing to lose) reply keiferski 5 hours agoprevIt’s interesting how people react to these designs. For me, I actually find them more confusing than the actual piece shapes, probably because I have the symbols of knight, rook, etc. burned into my mind from playing chess for thousands of hours as a kid.

I think for beginners (and mediocre players like myself) it would help a lot to prevent blunders. Being able to visualize the squares attacked by the knight would be especially useful. I've thought about having the squares show light shades of primary colors so you could see which side is attacking a square, and the composite colors would highlight contested ones, darker shades would mean more attackers. Like red/blue/purple or yellow/red/orange. reply topaz0 7 hours agorootparentAs a fellow mediocre player, my sense is that the best way to prevent blunders is to slow down and enumerate the possibilities. Sure, tools will help, just like having the computer suggest the three best lines will help, but it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to be good at the game.

    "originBody": "5 min read After Three Years on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity Helicopter Mission Ends Abbey A. Donaldson Jan 25, 2024 MEDIA ADVISORY24-017 NASA Headquarters NASA’s history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has ended its mission at the Red Planet after surpassing expectations and making dozens more flights than planned. While the helicopter remains upright and in communication with ground controllers, imagery of its Jan. 18 flight sent to Earth this week indicates one or more of its rotor blades sustained damage during landing, and it is no longer capable of flight. Originally designed as a technology demonstration to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days, the first aircraft on another world operated from the Martian surface for almost three years, performed 72 flights, and flew more than 14 times farther than planned while logging more than two hours of total flight time. “The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best – make the impossible, possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond.” NASA to Discuss Ingenuity Mission in Media Call Today In addition to video comments shared from Nelson about the mission’s conclusion, NASA will host a media teleconference at 5 p.m. EST today, Thursday, Jan. 25, to provide an update on Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. Audio of the call will stream live on the agency’s website. Participants in the call are expected to include: Lori Glaze, director, Planetary Science Division, NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at the agency’s headquarters in Washington Laurie Leshin, director, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity project manager, NASA JPL Media who wish to participate by phone can request dial-in information by emailing hq-media@mail.nasa.gov. Ingenuity landed on Mars Feb. 18, 2021, attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover and first lifted off the Martian surface on April 19, proving that powered, controlled flight on Mars was possible. After notching another four flights, it embarked on a new mission as an operations demonstration, serving as an aerial scout for Perseverance scientists and rover drivers. In 2023, the helicopter executed two successful flight tests that further expanded the team’s knowledge of its aerodynamic limits. “At NASA JPL, innovation is at the heart of what we do,” said Leshin. “Ingenuity is an exemplar of the way we push the boundaries of what’s possible every day. I’m incredibly proud of our team behind this historic technological achievement and eager to see what they’ll invent next.” Ingenuity’s team planned for the helicopter to make a short vertical flight on Jan. 18 to determine its location after executing an emergency landing on its previous flight. Data shows that, as planned, the helicopter achieved a maximum altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) and hovered for 4.5 seconds before starting its descent at a velocity of 3.3 feet per second (1 meter per second). However, about 3 feet (1 meter) above the surface, Ingenuity lost contact with the rover, which serves as a communications relay for the rotorcraft. The following day, communications were reestablished and more information about the flight was relayed to ground controllers at NASA JPL. Imagery revealing damage to the rotor blade arrived several days later. The cause of the communications dropout and the helicopter’s orientation at time of touchdown are still being investigated. After its 72nd flight on Jan. 18, 2024, NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter captured this color image showing the shadow of one of its rotor blades, which was damaged during touchdown. NASA/JPL-Caltech This enhanced color view of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was generated using data collected by the Mastcam-Z instrument aboard the agency’s Perseverance Mars rover on Aug. 2, 2023, the 871st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. The image was taken a day before the rotorcraft’s 54th flight.

NASA/JPL-Caltech Triumphs, Challenges Over an extended mission that lasted for almost 1,000 Martian days, more than 33 times longer than originally planned, Ingenuity was upgraded with the ability to autonomously choose landing sites in treacherous terrain, dealt with a dead sensor, cleaned itself after dust storms, operated from 48 different airfields, performed three emergency landings, and survived a frigid Martian winter. Designed to operate in spring, Ingenuity was unable to power its heaters throughout the night during the coldest parts of winter, resulting in the flight computer periodically freezing and resetting. These power “brownouts” required the team to redesign Ingenuity’s winter operations in order to keep flying. With flight operations now concluded, the Ingenuity team will perform final tests on helicopter systems and download the remaining imagery and data in Ingenuity’s onboard memory. The Perseverance rover is currently too far away to attempt to image the helicopter at its final airfield. “It’s humbling Ingenuity not only carries onboard a swatch from the original Wright Flyer, but also this helicopter followed in its footsteps and proved flight is possible on another world,” said Ingenuity’s project manager, Teddy Tzanetos of NASA JPL. “The Mars helicopter would have never flown once, much less 72 times, if it were not for the passion and dedication of the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams. History’s first Mars helicopter will leave behind an indelible mark on the future of space exploration and will inspire fleets of aircraft on Mars – and other worlds – for decades to come.” More About Ingenuity The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by NASA JPL, which also manages the project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity’s development. AeroVironment Inc., Qualcomm, and SolAero also provided design assistance and major vehicle components. Lockheed Space designed and manufactured the Mars Helicopter Delivery System. At NASA Headquarters, Dave Lavery is the program executive for the Ingenuity Mars helicopter.

Does the rover have a sample gathering arm? would it be possible for the helicopter to be picked up and set onto something? or carried around? seems like it would be useful to have the backup connection route to the rover like when they used the helicopter to troubleshoot the rover a while back. Or alternatively even as a backup sensor suite for the rover.

The already-stashed samples will be up there basically forever, and we'll probably want samples from a few different areas anyways, so it makes sense to go grab them. reply ugh123 4 hours agorootparentI hope the development of the MAV will bring us closer to building launch vehicles capable of getting humans off Mars. Seems like the MAV is preloaded with fuel and pretty small but should provide some good data for future missions. https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/#Ascent-Vehicle reply dcsommer 12 hours agorootparentprevMars has weather, unlike the moon. Will the samples really still be there a decade or two from now? reply wharvle 11 hours agorootparentMars' famous dust storms aren't so good at causing damage, because the air's really, really thin, so they can't pick up heavy particles even with high wind speeds. A serious problem if you need to keep grit out of fine machinery or electronics, not so much if you're worried about erosion (I mean, yeah, eventually it'd be a problem, but it's slow-motion compared to the erosion of something exposed to sand storms on Earth) I guess it could eventually get buried, but I'd expect that to also be a slow process on most parts of the planet, for similar reasons. The only forces seriously driving weathering on the planet are radiation and wind—the radiation's pretty bad but not a problem for metal + some rocks that were already on the surface, at least over a span of a couple decades, and the wind just can't deliver much force because the atmosphere's so very thin (that's also why it's fairly difficult to fly on Mars). reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentAs a fun anecdote this is one of the very few things that was completely faked in \"The Martian\" - book and movie alike, which is otherwise a hard sci-fi book. I think it's quite telling when your instigator for a disaster scenario on Mars has to be faked! Well at least intentionally faked. It turns out Martian regolith/soil is also much more moist than expected so getting water will be relatively easy, but at the time of the book this wasn't known! reply throwbadubadu 3 hours agorootparent> which is otherwise a hard sci-fi book Hard sci-fi is still a story and doesn't need to nail everything. And it had other pretty \"unrealistic\" moments that put me more off than the storm. Foremost, how they fixed the missed orbital rendezvous, no never going to happen that way. Or that they could just revert their home flight and go once more back and back again, how much delta-v would that be, never could have had that much extra fuel at least in that world... and other minor things, but still superb story. reply omoikane 3 hours agorootparentprev> The Martian The thin atmosphere bit is acknowledged by the author, you can watch his talk here around 32:35: I just want to be as accurate as I possibly could. There are a few places that are inaccurate. The biggest place that's inaccurate is right at the beginning. Don't tell anybody, but if you're in a dust storm on Mars, you're not even going to feel it. Mars' atmosphere is less than 1% of Earth's. So a 150 kilometer an hour wind would feel like about 1 kilometer an hour wind does on Earth. It wouldn't do any damage to anything. https://youtu.be/gMfuLtjgzA8?si=8aZUEizDWuBhnaJg&t=1958 There is another clarification later at 35:34 saying the dust storm is basically like talcum powder. reply rob74 1 hour agorootparentWell yeah, he needed some sort of catastrophic event to set the rest of the story in motion, and a huge dust storm which forces an evacuation and then separates Mark Watney from the rest of the crew was just the thing, so he added it although he was fully aware that storms don't work that way on Mars... reply generalizations 4 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, it wasn't even the only disaster scenario in the movie - but it's very difficult to come up with a realistic scenario where someone would get left behind with a livable hab. reply jenadine 3 hours agorootparentHow about a fight between members of the crew causing the mission to be cancelled, and one of the member left for dead after a violent interaction with another member who then lie about it. reply jo38j8o3jo8rj3 3 hours agorootparentprevI remember some nasa administrator laughing about that at a conference. \"So at the end of the movie the atmosphere is so thin that he can fly through it at thousands of miles per hour without harm, but at the beginning a sandstorm at hundreds of miles per hour destroys the ship? Also the spacesuits ... no.\" reply synapsomorphy 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, they will. The weather on Mars can't do much to metal tubes. They probably won't be buried either (the area they're in doesn't get much net deposition, you can tell from how rocky it is), but if that does happen, each sample's position and the terrain around them is very precisely mapped so it would be extremely unlikely that any get completely lost. https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9337/nasas-perseverance-rover-com... reply krisoft 11 hours agorootparentprevWe are talking about 6 inch long titanium tubes. What do you imagine the weather doing to them in a few decades? reply onepointsixC 12 hours agorootparentprevThe samples are meant to survive the vacuum of space but can't handle some weather? That seems unlikely. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agorootparentHow erosive is the vacuum of space meant to be? reply timschmidt 11 hours agorootparentYou mean that place that smells of burnt metal and is full of hard radiation?

Since USSR/Russia did not have a property right to the territory under the landed object, there was nothing to sell.\" reply pavel_lishin 5 hours agorootparentIt sounds more like Rai stones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones reply lukan 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but the rover itself was in possesion of russia and is now in posession of Garriot. That is undisputed. What is rightfully disputed, is whether he also owns the land under the rover. He would like to, but not possible with current laws. reply adastra22 4 hours agorootparent> What is rightfully disputed, is whether he also owns the land under the rover. He would like to, but not possible with current laws. Actually, contrary to the opinion of Ms. Gabrynowicz, current case law and government/agency positions represented by the Artemis Accords reflect Mr. Garriot's claim. It may have been an untested hypothetical at the time, but in the current political climate it is finding support by all the relevant players. In fact they go even further in asserting exclusions zones much larger than just the regolith undermining a lander or rover. reply lukan 1 hour agorootparent\"In fact they go even further in asserting exclusions zones much larger than just the regolith undermining a lander or rover.\" I really hope this won't become reality in the mind of confrontation and being first to claim land, because this will mean, spamming the moon surface with cheap \"scientific\" equipment to claim lots of land. I mean, what is the bar here for lander? Is it enough to have a flag with it?

To save weight for more sample returns, the Apollo astronauts did the logical thing and kept the film, but chucked the cameras out on the moon. reply LorenPechtel 11 hours agorootparentThey chucked a lot of stuff--anything intended for surface use went out the airlock. The cost per pound to bring something back from the moon was higher than the cost per pound of basically anything they brought. reply benj111 9 hours agorootparentDepends. If the primary point was to put a man on the moon, the cost of bringing things back is basically free. If on the other hand the primary mission was bringing back as many rocks as possible, then yes, the return would be very expensive. reply vel0city 5 hours agorootparent> the cost of bringing things back is basically free. No, because they'd still have to pay to bring all the extra fuel to get the junk back up off the moon and back to Earth. And before that spend the cost of that extra fuel getting it up there. When every pound is like thousands of dollars it really adds up. reply NoZebra120vClip 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's interesting to think about: The stated mission for the Space Race has often been \"put a man in orbit\", \"put a man on the Moon\", \"put staff in the space station for X period\". But implicit in all of those mission designs has been the goal of returning the crew alive and in one piece. The record is rather favorable in that regard, and it's always a tragedy when we lose someone. So that's one of the reasons a crewed Mars missions is a daunting prospect: because even with improved technology, it may be a one-way trip. reply imtringued 2 hours agorootparentWell, it's more of a pyramid scheme. You can send more people to mars than you can send back to earth. So nothing prevents Elon Musk from sending \"100\" people to mars and 10 person back.

My whole family just lived the drama of this whole project. So cool. I don’t know about the rest of you but we’re going to pour one out for the little guy. And high compliments to the team that pulled this off. This was an astounding project. reply 1970-01-01 13 hours agoprev72 flights is a lot for an experimental craft, on Mars, running Linux. reply gokhan 13 hours agoparentWith off-the-shelf components. reply shaunpud 9 hours agoparentprevArch? reply nexawave-ai 3 hours agoprevMaybe sometime in the future NASA will deploy a service or repair pit stop station for all their crafts on Mars. Imagine that, if a craft is damaged another automaton is deployed to retrieve the damaged craft where it is transported to the pit stop to be fixed or for routine maintenance. This will improve service life and only the service station would need manual intervention ie. Restocking for parts. So you would have a service station and a manufacturing station, that's nuclear powered and retrofitted with a 3D printer that can produce custom crafts on Mars. I often ponder about what will the result be of having a human colony on Mars or the Moon? Think about the ethical implications, what about if someone commits a murder? Or breaks a law ( will there even be laws? Who creates the law? Who will deliver judgement? Will there be a jury? ) it just breaks my mind. reply anigbrowl 10 hours agoprevIt's pretty great that the point of failure is one of the prop blades vs the cheap-as-chips electronic components. Of course I'm sorry to see it out of commission, but istm they can keep using the cameras, both to gather some information about the weather and to see how long the various components & batteries keep working - at least until it's time to move the rover out of range. Since flight is no longer an option I wonder if the CPU and MCUs can be repurposed to some other sort of task like image analysis. All in all I think Ingenuity's mission history is a strong argument for experimentation over total advance planning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)#Opposit... reply gokhan 13 hours agoprevDamage to the blade tip is apparent in the shadow. But I would try one more flight just to see how it fares in such conditions, if it can be corrected in software etc. reply rtkwe 13 hours agoparentTo fly Ingenuity has to spin it's propellers very quickly due to the lower atmospheric density compared to Earth and that's a large chunk taken out of the blade. We can already guess what'll happen without testing it and it'll be some variation of the craft shaking itself to pieces and throwing debris all over that chunk of Mars. Better to just let it sit than toss all sorts of trash across the surface that could hit the rover. reply LorenPechtel 10 hours agorootparentYup. I get the impression this was a forced landing, it put itself down on too steep a slope and caused a rotor strike. Helicopters do not like unbalanced rotors! And think of what happens if it fails at speed: The rotors are 4' across, so 2' from tip to hub. 2,400 rpm for the low end of flight speed. That's 40 rotations per second, the average speed of a rotor is therefore 40 rps * 2' * (2 * pi {path traced by the rotor}) / 2 {for the midpoint of the rotor} = 251 feet per second = 172 miles per hour. A rotor yeeted at 172 miles per hour will go quite a ways on Mars (especially since it's on a slope--it could be lobbed at an angle, not merely flat) and there's a very, very expensive spacecraft nearby. (And it must be nearby--Ingenuity can't talk to Earth. You can't back off to a safe distance and try it.) reply prismic 10 hours agoparentprevThey talked about why they don't think it will fly anymore in the media briefing: - Ingenuity is balanced down to fractions of a gram, and any imbalance, especially at the speed that Ingenuity spins its rotor at, will cause the spacecraft to tear itself apart. - Most of the lift comes from the last 25 - 30% of its lift capacity. They think they lost about 25% of the rotor blade, and even if somehow the other blades lost the exact same amount to be completely balanced, there's just not enough lift left. reply 1970-01-01 13 hours agoparentprevBudget-wise, it's not worth trying anything else. There is a lot of prop damage here: https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/e1-pia26243-... reply jtriangle 38 minutes agoparentprevMight as well yolo it at this point reply 0134340 11 hours agoparentprevThat is just genius. NASA is wasting all this money on engineers when they could just ask HN. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentDon't be an ass. Someone saying what they would do isn't a criticism of NASA's ability to engineer. If it was worded more strongly it might be a criticism of NASA management, but even then neither side would be objectively correct. reply bluGill 12 hours agoparentprevThey can easily mimic the damage on earth. While there is more gravity, we can adjust atmosphere and measure lift, vibration and whatever. Probably modern engineering tools can do this all in software, but cutting the blade off a drone on earth is easy. Only if we are convinced by on earth simulation that we can still fly this should we attempt it. Otherwise attempting flight this risks doing more damage to something else. (the rover is too far away, so I guess not much - but that also means we can't observe what happens and adjust based on the rovers sensors) reply JshWright 12 hours agorootparentThey can also account for gravity by pulling up on it with a tether (in a large vacuum chamber simulating the Martian atmosphere). That's how they tested the design originally. reply dfcab 13 hours agoparentprevHad the same thought but then wondered if the damage would cause vibration which would then lead to other issues. reply christiangenco 13 hours agoprevI'm pretty sure none of my terrestrial drones have lasted more than a few dozen flights—72 across the solar system is impressive engineering! reply AlbertCory 11 hours agoprevThe helicopter is one of the coolest things NASA's ever done. 72 flights.

Couldn't it MacGyver a fix for the damaged blade, using materials at hand? Seriously though, great job you plucky little 'copter. reply bigbillheck 13 hours agoprevDesigned for five, lasted 72, not too shabby. reply rtkwe 12 hours agoparentExtraplanetary missions are almost always many times longer than initially designed because the initial mission is largely limited by the budget which includes the price of the people here on Earth and the time available on the Deep Space Network. Building a rover robust enough to last way longer than the basic mission is a blip in the budget when you include that and the launch costs so they keep being run until they're surpassed by another mission, they run out of some consumable (on Curiosity for example there's a limited number of times they can run some of the internal equipment), or they're out of new things to find to justify the cost of going on. reply dotnet00 11 hours agorootparentWith the rovers its pretty much a given that they'll out last the initially stated 90 day mission. They're much more expensive and carefully crafted for the task. Ingenuity is special because it's commercial off-the-shelf parts put together on a low-ish budget. It (as well as various other aspects of Perseverance) has shown that Mars can be tolerable for off the shelf hardware, rather than needing bespoke million dollar projects for everything. reply subterrane 13 hours agoparentprevI dunno, feels like they overshot it.

Based on my experience flying drones, 72 flights is about 72 flights more than I can do without damaging the blades.... reply ragebol 12 hours agoprevSo, it still landed, upright no less, with a piece of the rotor blade missing? I'd guess that when a piece of rotor comes off during flight, the imbalance would make landing impossible. Very curious to what happened, but probably we'll never know exactly. reply tempestn 12 hours agoparentMy guess would be that the rotor struck the ground during landing. reply Kerb_ 12 hours agorootparentIf I'm interpreting the picture correctly, it does look like there is a gouge on the ground in the pic showing the shadow reply somat 6 hours agorootparentAlso, there are some very interesting shiny blue rocks in that photo.

Landing without causing further damage, though... reply arthurcolle 12 hours agoprevHow did the prop tip get damaged like that? Did it crash into something? reply prismic 9 hours agoparentThey mentioned during the media briefing that the terrain they were flying in were featureless, which is extremely challenging for it to determine where it's at, and thus it's possible that it misidentified some aspect of the terrain and caused this. Unfortunately because communication was lost when it landed, the flight data was lost, so we will never know for sure what happened. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentIt doesn't save flight data until it receives confirmation of download? reply foobarbecue 6 hours agorootparentDuring flight, high-rate flight data is written to volatile RAM, and 1HZ data is telemetered to Perseverance. The high-rate data is not written to disk until landing, because writing to disk is slow and CPU-intensive. There was a brownout during or just before landing, and sadly that meant the high-rate telemetry data was lost because it was never written to disk. And by \"disk\" I mean non-volatile flash memory. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentOkay, so we do have a subset of the flight data. Thanks for the info. reply foobarbecue 5 hours agorootparentYes, and the team is vigorously studying the 1HZ data leading up to the brownout. reply junon 11 hours agoparentprevMost likely. > Communication with Ingenuity was lost again at the end of the 72nd flight on January 18, 2024. JPL regained contact on January 20. Not an expert here but I assume the loss of contact was caused by some crash or something. reply LASR 13 hours agoprevFor some reason, this kind of news always makes me sad. Like emotionally.

Seems more useful and fun than just leaving it to rot. reply rtkwe 13 hours agoparentIt won't make it off the ground. Ingenuity has to spin it's rotors about 10 times faster than it does here on Earth. With that big of a chunk missing there's no way it can fly it'd tear itself to pieces during the spin up. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agoparentprev> more useful and fun than just leaving it to rot Ginny has an independent solar panel/battery set-up.

But I agree that it's better to leave it, download the remaining images and data from memory, maybe leave the software running as an experiment in non-rad-hardened computers on the surface, and eventually put it in a museum, than risk it crashing in spectacular fashion. reply lorstic 12 hours agorootparentThe tips of the rotors approach the speed of sound. Around Mach 0.95. I'm sure someone can do the math on the maximum debris field, but I think it'll be larger than you're thinking. reply dgacmu 10 hours agorootparentAgreed: Our earth-based intuition is probably pretty off when the atmosphere creates 1% as much friction as it does here. reply blisterpeanuts 13 hours agoprevFrom the article: The Perseverance rover is currently too far away to attempt to image the helicopter at its final airfield. I wonder if the rover couldn't proceed to the location of the helicopter and get some high res images for diagnostic purposes. I'm sure they considered that option so maybe the rover's schedule is just too busy to accommodate such a mission. Anyway, R.I.P. Ingenuity and kudos to Nasa for another excellent piece of tech that lasted on another planet for years longer than originally planned. reply zokier 11 hours agoparentRover time and mission resources are definitely limited and a concern, but apparently the location of the copter is also really inconvenient to access. Its sitting down in a valley middle of big sand ripple field. So its not clear if the rover could reach there even if they wanted to. That being said, not all hope is lost. While closeups are unlikely, the rover is driving in that general direction so there is (very slight) possibility to catch the copter in some lucky drive-by pic from a distance. reply laverya 12 hours agoparentprevAlso the rover is really, really slow - a few hundred meters on a good day. reply MicolashKyoka 12 hours agoprevamazing work by the team at nasa. we'll get there and repair it so it does fly again in a few years :') reply seatac76 12 hours agoprevSad to hear but kudos for an absolute feat of engineering. reply mrandish 10 hours agoprevThat was an amazing run.

I had thought there was some shift in the Wright Brothers' attribution to flight in general. It seemed like better recognition of the contributions by Samuel Langley and Glenn Curtiss' to flight technology were along with acknowledgement of the WB's own efforts to boost their legacy might have checked a decision to keep pouring on the WB-were-the-ones narrative. reply cybrox 10 hours agoparentIt was not about the contribution but about the moment. The Wright brothers achieved the first powered flight on earth and Ingenuity achieved the first powered flight on another planet. I think people are well aware that it's neither the Wright brothers nor ingenuity as a singular entity that did what ultimately concluded in that achievement but rather the scientific effort of humanity as a whole. reply bredren 5 hours agorootparentI disagree, if anything, the Wright brothers’ documented first powered flight and desperate effort to control the technology and historical narrative have caused other contributors to continue to go unrecognized in important mainstream media like this. If it was the scientific effort of humanity as a whole, then it seems like the director would have simply compared it to the profound effort toward manned flight.

    "originLink": "https://wedistribute.org/2023/11/introducing-faircamp/",
    "originBody": "Home>People>Culture>Faircamp is a Free Bandcamp Alternative Faircamp is a Free Bandcamp Alternative A beautiful and free platform for Musicians. Sean TilleyNovember 13, 2023 1 7,968 2 minutes read Culture Fediverse In the aftermath of Epic selling Bandcamp to Songtradr, Bandcamp has found itself in a place of instability. Half of the company’s employees were laid off post-acquisition, leading many to speculate over the beloved platform’s future. Most importantly, many artists who depended on the service are left looking for alternatives. There isn’t a Fediverse solution yet. Although Funkwhale is a great music platform, it’s just not geared towards selling music. Not all is lost, however, as the Faircamp project is stepping in to help musicians. What is Faircamp, Exactly? Source: Faircamp site Faircamp bills itself as “a static site generator for audio producers”, but an easier way to understand it is this: it’s a simple site that you can host yourself. Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site’s pages will build themselves. You can find a great guide for getting started here. Source: Faircamp site Faircamp offers a high degree of customization, all while looking good doing it. Artists are able to set up payment for albums and tracks, offer freebies, unlock codes, and embed a player in other sites. It looks great on mobile, too. Community Response So far, the music community has responded to Faircamp very positively. Many musicians within the Fediverse have actively made an effort to form an old-school webring, in the hopes of supporting one another. Testing the Control.org band Faircamp via Mobile Browser, hosted on RadioFreeFedi More notably, Radio Free Fedi has been incredibly proactive, offering a free service to help Fedi musicians host their own Faircamp sites on RadioFreeFedi’s infrastructure. With the recent sale of Bandcamp to predatory VC extractive vultures, and the main move to finalise that sale was to fire all the recently unionised staff, the writing is on the wall for the last least worst option… …here is an option for members of our community who may not want or be able to self-host their music and/or would like something that is a simple, tidy, open and not walled garden or metrics driven home to offer their music to supporters. Radio Free FedI Embeds still look a little janky on mobile, but they could probably get cleaned up by submitting a simple pull request on the project’s Codeberg repository. All in all, Faircamp looks like it’s shaping up to be a great alternative method for supporting Fediverse musicians! Hopefully this effort brings renewed interest towards building federated tools for creatives on the network, somewhere down the road.

(it's late on a thursday and terraform is being difficult, limited spare brainpower). reply caslon 16 hours agorootparentprevBandcamp Fridays gave (and presently, still give) 100% of Bandcamp's cut to the artists. Any \"replacement\" platform that doesn't have it will mean the artists get less money, which gets in the way of the music. As somebody who obviously didn't pay attention to any artist on the platform, of course anything beyond a quick, one-click, Amazon-style storefront will be \"getting in the way of the music,\" for you. There's already a solution for that, though: Go shop on Amazon, if you don't care about what percentage of the profits the artist gets. They have the patented \"Buy now with 1-Click®\" experience, and it'll likely be faster for you to purchase using it. Personally, I want a world where people can afford to make music for a living, and Bandcamp was great at doing everything it could to try and make that happen for as many people as possible. reply dijksterhuis 13 hours agorootparentYou’ve focused in on the Bandcamp Friday thing. When I read the original parent it was everything else that I was like “meh, Bandcamp would be perfectly fine without any of that” Bandcamp Fridays just got lumped into the quote tbh. I’m tired. It’s Thursday. Terraform was kicking me in the head today. Although I can never remember which bloody Friday is Bandcamp Friday so I think I’ve managed to do like one of them. Bandcamp was going for like 10 years before the Fridays existed. If they needed to go to keep the store online, I’d be fine with that (not that I think that’s necessary). Oh and I used to work for a performing royalties organisation… so… yeah… I kind of do care about how much artists get paid for their work. Yeah it would be great if making a living off music was feasible for more people. But the magic is in the fact that’s it’s not. There’s magic in the sacrifice. Edit — this part of your reply was annoying me. > As somebody who obviously didn't pay attention to any artist on the platform, of course anything beyond a quick, one-click, Amazon-style storefront will be \"getting in the way of the music,\" for you. For me… the connection to the artist happens through the music that I buy from them. So you know what. Yeah, I would buy off amazon. Or boomkat. Or bleep. Or redeye. Or phonica. Or honest johns. Or SOTU. Or juno. I’m an absolute record store whore. I have no allegiances. Because buying the actual music is the important bit I believe. Why? Because no one buys music anymore. That’s why artists have to tour so much — to make that living you spoke about. Because no one buys anything these days. Well… I do. But I’m weird. I couldn’t care less about instagram posts or posting photos of people hanging out in the studio tho. That stuff is pure bobbins as far as I’m concerned. reply heleninboodler 13 hours agorootparent> Although I can never remember which bloody Friday is Bandcamp Friday so I think I’ve managed to do like one of them.

Congratulations on abstractly purchasing music without caring how much of it actually ends up in an artist's pocket and feeling proud of it! Vinyl is 15-20% for the artist on a good day, and usually worse after vendor markups. MP3s on most platforms are at least a 15+2.5% haircut for the artist. > That’s why artists have to tour so much — to make that living you spoke about. Because no one buys anything these days. > But the magic is in the fact that’s it’s not. There’s magic in the sacrifice. Saying that you didn't care about workers getting paid was weird, but equating \"making music\" inherently with a vow of poverty is kind of beyond the pale. You're a (presumably) well-compensated person working on something far less useful to society than music, \"the cloud.\" Plenty of countries have programs to compensate their artists fairly (like countries that force a percentage of radio play to be in their native language, or by local artists), and these countries don't have \"less magic\" because of it. I don't even blame pirates, but this weird middle ground of being willing to spend money but not caring if a good deal of it goes to corporate middlemen so you can have the abstract, hipster, \"At least I buy things!\" experience is so bizarre. reply MichaelZuo 13 hours agorootparentprev> Any \"replacement\" platform that doesn't have it will mean the artists get less money, which gets in the way of the music. This doesn't sound right, there are 8 billion people in this world, a large chunk of them potential 'artists' with sufficient motivation, and not everyone is motivated by money. reply rdn 18 hours agoparentprevTo me the strength is the ability to buy the music files directly without hurdles and without being trapped in something like iTunes reply jjulius 17 hours agorootparent\"Was\"? reply nusl 16 hours agorootparentStill possible but the company itself is being sold and resold, now in the hands of an actor that seems to conflict with its mission, unless I am mistaken reply jjulius 16 hours agorootparentHardcore Bandcamp user here - it's been sold, but other than layoffs, the user experience has remained essentially exactly the same. Especially with regards to OP's point about buying the files directly without hurdles. Songtradr has yet to announce any future changes to the platform as well.

Maybe if you burn them at a higher volume and keep CD player's volume lower you'll have better luck? Disclaimer: I'm far from an audiophile, I just know from personal experience that if your source is low volume and your output is cranked up you get a lot of...distortion? Interference? Artifacts? I don't know, it just sounds staticky and worse. reply squarefoot 14 hours agorootparent> if your source is low volume and your output is cranked up you get a lot of...distortion? Interference? Artifacts? Mostly noise because you're amplifying it as well, and possibly artifacts because material converted at too low levels (which is the case of old CD rips that weren't normalized before encoding) wouldn't use all the available headroom, therefore losing one bit. reply letitbeirie 15 hours agorootparentprevI managed to collect a rather massive digital music collection when p2p was en vogue.

If everyone was ripping from YouTube how would they stay in business? reply porcoda 16 hours agoparentprevI think Bandcamp does a great job bringing artists closer to the audience without any of those things like interviews, curation, IRL presence. Honestly, those things always rubbed me the wrong way since they felt like the kind of marketing that we get through traditional means (e.g., Rolling Stone articles), except with an indie flavor: some music nerd picked a winner and put them forward, and artists who didn't make the cut by the Bandcamp tastemakers take more effort to find. I think the absence of that sort of \"pick-a-winner-and-interview-them\" does a lot for making things flat and fair for all. The primary people who get grumpy about getting rid of that are the people whose job it is to be curator/interviewer/etc. I'm not terribly sad if they go away. reply easyThrowaway 14 hours agorootparentLiterally a few minutes ago Adam Neely (Pretty famous youtuber and Jazz player) posted a video specifically about this point[1], and I fully agree with his thesis: If you take out the \"music nerds\" as the gatekeepers, their place will be taken by Google/Instagram/TikTok indexing and MinMax algos and whoever can influence those. The tech to create content may have exploded in the last years, but the ability to truly connect and discover (and I mean ways to build cultural, emotional and social connections in and outside of the internet) has plummeted. I don't agree that technology is strictly at fault here, but this side of the equation has been heavily ignored due to the less immediate monetization options. We've gone for the \"intensive farming\" of art and culture compared to more \"sustainable\" approaches, and we're experiencing the equivalent of desertification following a monocolture. [1]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceZ8VS8PbQ reply dendrite9 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd I thought the bandcamp did a good job with the best of the month lists because it wasn;t just what sold best. I frequently started my morning listening to the bands from one of the articles on the homepage while I drank coffee and got caught up. For categories like hip hop, ambient, or folk I don't follow enough to have a grasp of who or what I might like, so I treated the articles like a radio show, a chance to stumble on something interesting. The posts focused on a specific region and genre were usually worth the read, and I appreciated how sometimes there were links to some artists side projects in a different genre. Today's album of the day post was about Japanese Acid Folk, not something I care about at all. But it wasn't a bad way to start the day with something new. https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/various-artists-... I suppose it seemed valuable to me that the various writers or editors could focus on niches, not the best of the month and this month it is written by a metalhead. If anything I thought the suggested albums at the bottom iss a bit too skewed toward certain bands. I'm not sure if that's targeting by user, or if there are too many connections in people's purchases to avoid making the links. On the other hand, the artist suggested albums at the bottom are almost always worth a listen if they have taken the time to add any. reply fivre 15 hours agorootparentprevthey were pretty consistent about picking good artists though, which was great for scenes i dont follow myself no one person can sift through every scene and genre to find the good shit, and there's plenty of bad shit. i can do that for like, one scene bandcamp articles generally delivered me more quality finds with more variety than automated \"you may also like...\" curation systems a la spotify or last.fm. it's not like the latter are truly democratizing anything either--once getting big on spotify (or nowadays, tiktok) became important commercially, you got a whole ecosystem of influencers behind the scenes offering promotion in those systems. getting boosted via a faceless \"chill sunday morning coffee music\" playlist is still curation reply somnic 12 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't really what you're posting about I do find curation and reviews to be valuable, if you avoid reifying them too much. I often see a bit of an anti-critic sentiment, mostly from people who disagree with a review for something they've got strong feelings about one way or another, but I don't want to spend the time to extensively search through the Sturgeon's law wasteland of indie music. Algorithmic recommendations are sometimes helpful but don't often encourage me to branch out as much as reviewers, especially when it comes to unknown unknowns. The fact that a lot of indie artists find it hard to get attention is really just the nature of the game. There are a lot of musicians and aspiring musicians out there. reply elevaet 16 hours agoparentprevFor me it was all about: - a very generous cut for the artist - how well the site functions - it does just enough, very practical. Clean UX and UI - flac reply elevaet 13 hours agorootparentI should say is all about. BC still does all those core most important things. Long live Bandcamp. reply jzb 18 hours agoparentprevYep. Just as anybody can stand up a social media platform clone - the value is in the network effect and content on the platform. Because of the content and discovery features on Bandcamp, I've discovered several bands I'd never have heard of otherwise. If you're leaving hosting and promotion entirely as an exercise to the band/artist, you're not meeting the actual need. Bandcamp (mostly) met the need of artists and music enthusiasts. Unfortunately it's now in the hands of an entity that seems to care about neither. reply JohnFen 10 hours agorootparent> Because of the content and discovery features on Bandcamp, I've discovered several bands I'd never have heard of otherwise. That's awesome. Bandcamp is my primary go-to for music, but I have to admit that I've never found much value in their discovery features, articles, etc. It's pretty great that Bandcamp can serve both of us what we need. reply cyanydeez 18 hours agorootparentprevand that network effect is what allows for enshittification to proceed unabated. We're watching that start right now with AI. which is probably the real danger of AI: locked in work flows, exploited by capitalism to leverage shitty outcomes as a way to drive up profits and downgrade outcomes. reply nusl 16 hours agorootparentWell, you need the network effect but I don’t think the effect itself causes enshittification. The constant need for massive growth and big numbers to sate investors causes companies to drift from their original mission and morph into something soulless and purely driven by profit, despite sometimes already being wildly profitable. There is irony in me saying this on HN but the longer-term effects of VC money really really ruins good things. reply cyanydeez 11 hours agorootparentthe network effect _allows_ enshittification, to the point that it's almost entirely why enshittification is allowed. The momentum into a ecosystem is much different than coming out. Once the Business realizes they've hit that \"event horizon\" enshittification necessarily flows from pure capitalism. Sure, we could redefine the physical basis of this blackhole of the internet metaphor via regulations, but corporations are not governments and do not need to follow any specific multifaceted approach to long term vision. reply nusl 10 hours agorootparentHow could the network effect reasonably not occur for any decently popular [socially-inclined] service? Whether or not the company does anything to encourage it, with enough users it happens regardless. Sure, it enables it. Without it, you probably haven't got enough users to survive anyway. So, the choice is on the company. Money breeds bullshit and companies want money, so they leverage their leverage, which happens to be their users. Then the shit just gets worse. TXitter is \"living\" proof that people don't give a shit as long as they can get their endorphins from likes. So, to some extent it's also people feeding on the validation that likes from strangers gives them and not even people they know or care about. I'm not sure that even without corporate greed the network effect would not turn toxic. Picture a perfectly ethical company with 2m users logging in daily and interacting across different planes. The company can do everything it can to preserve its integrity and user rights but the users themselves will enshittify eventually. People love validation and likes are basically crack. It's changing too with short-form content sucking peoples' lives away 30 seconds at a time. Clickbait is also becoming more nefarious and AI is being leveraged to further worsen it. IMO, the modern internet is turning into a swamp of fast-validation, instant-grattification, and endless competition for that 0.5s you have to grab a user's eyes. It's all going to shit. Good luck watching YouTube in any sane capacity without significant effort. Also, good luck using websites that call themselves \"for the real web\" but morph into Medium, Substack, Reddit, and pretty much anything else. That's me being jaded I guess. But the internet is falling in a way that most people don't care about. Same as Reddit. Same as Twitter.

I've been digitising my music collection since the early 2000s in FLAC – which was pretty expensive on disk space relative to the size of hard drives back then. It's been fun but also somewhat worrying to hear my daughter ask why I don't have every song in the universe, but also why my music plays without internet connection or dedicated app. I feel her generation won't own anything anymore, and I still have to make up my mind whether that's a good or a bad thing. Without getting political, I fear art, music, software and other intangible goods might end up acquired, centralised and in the hands of lawyers at increasingly larger monopolistic corporations, and for some reason, a lot of grassroots artist initiatives seem to falter and end up going nowhere. I will support Bandcamp, Faircamp or any place where I can get the music I like in CD quality without DRM. I want to support artists and I hope at least some of these more independent music outlets stay alive to cater to us who care about both artists and fans not to end up as vassals to a profit-extraction rental system for third parties. reply JohnFen 10 hours agoparent> I feel her generation won't own anything anymore I don't know if the age ranges of our children are similar or not, but once my kids discovered that I have a huge music collection that doesn't require an internet connection, they've started assembling their own. I think that there are a lot of people who just don't understand there are options other than streaming, or that there are benefits to having your own collection that streaming can never provide.

Looks like with this making federation available there's just a need for someone to come in and set up a trustworthy portal that collects federated music and provides the customer (music purchaser) UX. Assuming they can find a way to federate the payments (skim a small fee for using the aggregator's payments, instead of direct linking to various musician's purchasing systems), this should make hosting the infra for a site like this manageable, based on the lower decentralized media. That's a long way to go to get to something that, in tandem, would be a 'bandcamp alternative', but I can't help but get excited for the small steps! They do often open doors for the bigger steps! reply btown 19 hours agoparentThe problems with aggregated payments go far beyond just ensuring someone can pay hosting and card processing fees. Who will take chargeback risk? Handle KYC for payouts (especially since many garage bands won’t have business entities)? Handle fraud at scale, including fraud rings using your service to validate stolen credit cards? https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/candy-japan-hit... is an old (2015) but still relevant illustration of this. Centralizing payments requires human monitoring and capital cushions. With services like Stripe this can be cheaper, but still requires nontrivial resources. reply kevinsync 19 hours agorootparentAlso IMO it would need to handle distributing royalties correctly, global tax remittance, etc. That stuff gets incredibly complicated, incredibly fast. reply catapart 18 hours agorootparentprevThe \"publisher\" takes all of the financial risk. That's part of the deal. I would never use a website that said \"you pay us, but if you have payment problems, you have to take that up with the product manufacturer\". The aggregator has to take enough off of the payment in order to insure their business, just like they have to take enough off of the payment in order to afford any of their other capital (salaries, utilities, rent, etc). I'm assuming you have doubts about the practical feasibility of charging \"that much\". But it has, historically, been one of the best cost-to-compensation models ever created, with entire industries being built around enshrining an ever-more predatory pricing structure that funnels more and more of the product profit to a small council of investors. reply stereosteve 17 hours agoprevJust a few days ago I started working on a similar project, but one where you can upload via a UI.

It's not an alternative for Bandcamp's _infra_, and that's a pretty significant cost-and-complexity center for a new band or solo artist that just wants their music out there for purchase. Still, I think getting viable alternative software is a huge checkbox on the path to getting good alternatives. Now there just needs to be an affordable hosting company that'll run Faircamp for up-and-coming artists. reply giovannibonetti 19 hours agoparentPerhaps a P2P model would make the infra more affordable? You know, like when Spotify launched. reply thejdsessions 20 hours agoprevI'm a user, I use it to publish my music, and it's awesome. reply worik 15 hours agoprevI think there is too much emphasis on paying artists For professional musicians that is a big deal Professional musicians are a tiny proportion of musicians For those of us who create for the love of creation payment is not the point. The main point is reach. Can I point you at my music, where you can access it without me, or you, having to be Uber geeks? We want you to come to our shows. We would like to cover our costs, Yes, but the most important part is having an audience for our art The cost of recording music is orders of magnitude less than it was, getting it available, with out becoming hostage tio horrid platforms (looking at you, Google) is very hard I am hoping this will help reply bruh2 19 hours agoprevI host a Faircamp instance for a couple of friends and I. It's lovely, we upload songs via Nextcloud and a janky script I wrote.

Imagine the horror of the 2 top dudes at Basecamp. reply WJW 19 hours agorootparentThere's plenty of free Basecamp alternatives out there, but since they don't even come close to providing the same stability and polish none of them have a chance at unseating the original in the eyes of its core audience. reply siva7 19 hours agorootparentprevTheir customers don't give a shit about some open source alternative. reply hammyhavoc 9 hours agoprevA WordPress plugin implementation would go a long way to this really taking off. Most artists I follow are all using WordPress already for ecommerce and news. reply bigbillheck 20 hours agoprev> Faircamp bills itself as “a static site generator for audio producers”, but an easier way to understand it is this: it’s a simple site that you can host yourself. Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site’s pages will build themselves. That \"on your server\" part is going to make is unsuited for 99.9+% of bandcamp artists, and speaking as someone who buys an awful lot of music on bandcamp, I would have some concerns as well. (Not least of which being that with bandcamp I can download purchased music years after purchase, even if artists have died or bands broken up, I wouldn't have that guarantee here). reply optionalsquid 19 hours agoparentThat \"on your server\" part also means that discoverability takes a massive nose-dive. Most of the music I've purchased on Bandcamp was discovered by following suggestions listed on the pages of albums I liked or by trawling through everything that shared tags with albums I liked. But that doesn't seem possible on Faircamp. reply slothtrop 19 hours agorootparentThere are far more important/popular sources for discoverability than BC. Their UI is not great for that in the first place. reply lancesells 18 hours agorootparentI discover plenty through their blog posts and following labels that I like. reply terinjokes 19 hours agoparentprev> Not least of which being that with bandcamp I can download purchased music years after purchase, even if artists have died or bands broken up, I wouldn't have that guarantee here Note that this isn't guaranteed, especially for smaller bands that get picked up by a label. Most of the time the label just makes the releases hidden, so they're no longer displayed publicly, but can still be downloaded. However, some labels delete the release instead, so it's no longer downloadable from your collection. reply drngdds 19 hours agorootparentYeah, this is a risk. The best approach is to take advantage of the fact that Bandcamp lets you download everything and simply download everything you buy and keep backups (as you would with any other important data) reply RoyTyrell 18 hours agorootparentYep exactly, that's what I do too. Download a lossless version and then use Bandcamp if I ever wanted to stream it. However I also host Navidrome (OSS streaming with a web-app) so use that 99.9% of the time I want to stream. Even if there aren't labels requiring artists to hide or delete music from Bandcamp, you never know if Bandcamp could just go down one day for financial reasons and then you're screwed. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is the primary use case for Bandcamp for me -- it's one of the main ways I buy new music. I'm not interested in streaming services. Being able to buy (with most of the money going to the artist) and download lossless copies of albums is what I want. reply terinjokes 15 hours agorootparentprevYep, I download the FLAC and always keep the original zip file, and back it up separately from the files I manage with beets. I playback the beets-managed files with Navidrome. Beets doesn't maange handle the extra files that the zip often includes, such as PDFs of linear notes, the sheet music I once found included, or band photos. Maybe someday I'll figure out a good archive for everything that isn't \"the literal zip file\". reply actionfromafar 19 hours agoparentprevThe irony is that for this federated network to succeed, it probably needs a large-ish \"commercial\" peer which works similarly to how Bandcamp did. reply bee_rider 20 hours agoparentprevAlso Bandcamp already has my credit card. reply rglullis 19 hours agorootparentIf only the US could ever leave the 19th century and allow instant wire transfers... Oh, wait. They did already! https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.h... reply bee_rider 19 hours agorootparentHuh, interesting. Did Faircamp implement some sort of payment system that works through FedNow? That’s pretty neat if so. reply JohnFen 10 hours agorootparentprevIt technically exists, but I haven't actually seen it \"in the wild\" yet. My banks certainly aren't on board at this time. Maybe it will become something useful in the future, though. reply dangus 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are a wide array of different payment preferences depending on the country. Bank transfer isn’t universally the most popular method of e-commerce transactions. For example, PayPal seems to be the most overwhelmingly popular online payment method in Germany. In the UK, PayPal and debit cards are the leaders. Debit cards are also generally popular globally (a debit card isn’t the same as a bank transfer). https://blog.2checkout.com/popular-online-payment-methods-gl... https://www.rapyd.net/blog/the-top-payment-methods-in-the-un... This speaks more toward someone like a musician needing a solution that has many payment options to appeal to a wide breadth of customers, not some kind of dig on US e-commerce and banking because “Europe does it better and the US is stuck in the 19th century.” reply rglullis 18 hours agorootparentPaypal is the most popular method in Europe because they operate as a bank here, and therefore customers can make wire transfers to each other. reply max-throat 13 hours agoprevWhy haven't we seen something like Bandcamp or GOG but for film/TV? reply joveian 12 hours agoparentGOG made a brief effort to expand into movies almost a decade ago but stopped because the industry revolved around regional restrictions (they asked customers if they should keep going with regional restrictions and customers said no). There are some reginal restrictions on GOG and Bandcamp but nothing like would be necessary for the movie industry it sounds like. I don't know if focusing entirely on indie films would avoid this issue or if even they end up agreeing to regional restrictions. reply saint_yossarian 11 hours agoparentprevNot sure, I would love to see it too. I bought some things on Vimeo over the years which does offer DRM-free downloads (if enabled, otherwise yt-dlp is your friend), but it's really just some indie and crowdfunded projects. I guess the industry thinks pay-per-view platforms like Amazon, YouTube, etc. are good enough? reply thenoblesunfish 17 hours agoprevVery glad to see people coming up with alternatives here. Plenty of artists sell music directly on their sites in various ways and this seems like another way to do that. I still use Bandcamp for now, but I get that extra fuzzy feeling when I can buy even more directly! reply robbyiq999 17 hours agoprevIt was sad to see so much indie music go down with MySpace and it would be a shame to see that happen again, I wonder if there is some kind of peer-to-peer solution like mastodon and bittorrent that could work within this model reply rglullis 19 hours agoprevSo, not to hijack the thread, but just last week I've added funkwhale to the list of supported services on communick at https://communick.stream. For $29/year I'm offering 250GB of space for users to upload their own songs, but all of that would be on private libraries - i.e, people can not publicly share songs they do not own copyright. The next step would be to let musicians put their own songs in public libraries and let them choose between two models: - sell direct to consumer - pay-for-access (Patreon style). The \"twist\" I'm thinking would be that customers could define a global fixed monthly amount, and split to the musicians according to how much they listen. My idea would be to take a flat fee from musicians just for the service, no commission on sales, etc. Would that be a good model? Also, how does one go on about to break the network effects of these? reply diggan 18 hours agoparent> Also, how does one go on about to break the network effects of these? Curation. Bandcamp isn't what it is because of the technology, the money, the business model or whatever. It is (was?) Bandcamp because of the curators, the community and the humans behind it. Find the best way of replicating those things and you have a chance at least :) reply rglullis 16 hours agorootparentI get that, but your answer sounds a bit circular: \"to break the network effects, first establish a community\". The idea of using the Fediverse is precisely to leverage the existing network and to let people use my service even if its own \"local\" community hasn't reach critical mass yet. Maybe the question is how I can reach these people now? reply brudgers 20 hours agoprevI think it's probably a meaningful alternative to the degree a musician's audience and potential audience will use it. I mean, a friend's living room is an alternative to Madison Square Garden when a musician's ambition is noodling around for a few friends. reply nipperkinfeet 11 hours agoprevLooks like a fantastic alternative.

Too bad Web3.0 crowd is all about hype and make-money-quick schemes, otherwise it's a perfect fit for the problem of selling musing directly. Trans-border sales/transfers without crypto is a pain, thousands of musicians get locked out of their money because politicians keep playing their idiotic \"big boy\" games. reply spacec0wb0y 13 hours agoprevI didn’t realise Bandcamp was unfair reply wyclif 15 hours agoprevLike the fact that there's an alternative and support that, but hate the name. reply phil-m 16 hours agoprevRIIR hits again - nice reply solarkraft 19 hours agoprevIt looks great and all. And it probably serves one use case that Bandcamp serves. But for me Bandcamp is primarily a collection of music I like, like other people would have a shelf with CDs or Vinyls. This doesn't really do that. \"Just install it on your server\" probably sounds a lot harder to an average musican than to an average techie as well (sure, there's overlap, but it's not the same). reply insane_dreamer 19 hours agoprevTIL Epic owned Bandcamp reply iainctduncan 18 hours agoprev [–] Tangential question, has anyone actually noticed bandcamp get worse? We know they did big layoffs (along with uh... EVERYONE ELSE) and we know they axed a bunch of paid journalists (again, hardly uncommon), but as a frequent user I have not seen any negative change to me personally. Not saying they won't, lot's of acquisitions kill the golden goose, but so far I haven't noticed anything. Curious if others have. I also really don't understand all the comments online as if the sale from Epic to Songtrader was a sale from the boy scouts to darth vader. Didn't Epic buy them as a pawn in a legal battle? The sale people should be grumbling about was the one to Epic... and the people they should be complaining about are the founders who sold. :-/ reply mlochbaum 17 hours agoparentHave continued using it as an artist and listener, and there's no way I'd have known anything changed from the site. They updated the terms of use, but only as necessary to reflect the change in ownership. And they are still doing Bandcamp Fridays, where the company gives up its cut on the first Friday each month, even though there was no promise or other indication they'd continue before the sale. I've seen rumors that support is getting worse, but only from reporters and not users, and it's a pretty easy site to use so I wouldn't think poor support is that much of a problem. I'd rather Bandcamp be independent and am still upset they sold out, but I like Songtradr much better than Epic as an owner. Their main business is facilitating B2B sales, which I think of as the same category as what Bandcamp does. They don't own music (except incidentally, from acquisitions) and don't have ties to RIAA and major labels like Spotify does. Main source for Songtradr info, although I've also done some outside reading: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37699552 reply cameron4 18 hours agoparentprevI also haven't recognized any changes as a regular user and listener. I'm not an artist so I haven't uploaded any music and I do wonder if the artist experience has changed at all. I'm definitely bracing myself for change if / when it comes, however. I plan to keep using Bandcamp until then. When Epic bought the platform I do remember a similar reaction from folks, along with confusion because why would a gaming company buy a music platform, and what kind of dumb sweeping changes were they going to make? The Songtradr acquisition at least makes more sense from an industry standpoint. Personally, I feel better with the platform in their hands rather than Epic's reply mikepurvis 18 hours agoparentprevI'm still very happy with the service; it's my preferred/only vendor for paid music downloads, and although I appreciate and use the streaming available in the app, at the end of the day, that could all disappear and I'd still have my purchases. I know that's not the same for artists who have made more of an investment in it, promoted their bandcamp.com URLs and all, but as a consumer I'm content to continue using it as long as it delivers value to me, and cease using it when it does not. reply Springtime 17 hours agoparentprevOnly two things I've noticed get worse as a buyer so far: - Virtually immediately following the Songtrader acquisition using the credit card checkout began giving 'security code mismatch' errors. This is a false positive and clicking the 'Complete purchase' button about a minute later is the workaround I've been using since. I'd never experienced the error in the years prior and this has been tried with multiple different cards. - There's no longer a live ticker on the home page showing the latest track/album purchases around the world. reply marcomourao 17 hours agorootparent> - There's no longer a live ticker on the home page showing the latest track/album purchases around the world.

People are still listening and BCs terms and conditions for me are unchanged. I still like what BC is about, and it's why I moved off of Spotify/Apple. reply alisonatwork 17 hours agoparentprevI still buy music there regularly and there is still plenty of new stuff being released. I really hope it doesn't go down the tubes, but so far so good for me. Perhaps people in the electronic scene are wary after the experience of Beatport selling to SFX and rapidly starting to suck. But in that case Beatport had already been trying to reinvent itself to some degree for several years ahead of the sale. Bandcamp was different because it pretty much knew what it was going to be in the beginning and still is that now, so it seems like a sustainable business, as long as the new owners are willing to just let it be. reply JohnFen 18 hours agoparentprevBandcamp has remained great for me. reply Pxtl 17 hours agoparentprev> We know they did big layoffs Did we ever get clarification if that was blanket layoffs including their tech talent or they were mostly targeted cutting of secondary stuff like the journalistic wings? Which, I mean it sucks for the writers that were there, but the journalism wasn't part of Bandcamp I was using, and I assume that's the case for most others. If the tech side is still generally intact? I would assume it would stay hunky dory. Anyhow, Epic runs an e-store and generally treats its employees well and so I was fine with them taking it - there was synergy there. Songtradr seems to be mostly about hoarding music rights, and is buying up music e-stores left and right, and did a large downsizing first thing after they bought Bandcamp. I think pessimism there made sense. reply iainctduncan 16 hours agorootparentI don't understand how a video game company can be seen as more of a synergy than Songtradr. Given that songradr is in the digital rights exploitation business, I would guess they are more likely to be helpful to artists. Don't forget, you can only upload original tunes to bandcamp (no covers). If songtradr wants to exploit those rights further (publishing licensing, better PRO work, etc), they have to pay the artists - which most artists would love. reply Semaphor 15 hours agorootparent> Don't forget, you can only upload original tunes to bandcamp (no covers). What? Here’s a black metal cover of Hit me Baby (One more time): https://spider-god.bandcamp.com/track/baby There are tons of covers on BC, never heard of that restriction. reply iainctduncan 15 hours agorootparentI don't think it gets enforced much, but it's definitely there in the terms of service and help pages. You need to have written permission from the copyright holders. This is not the same as for a \"regular\" release, where one only needs explicit permission if it's the first recording of the piece. (After that you can record a cover under what's called a compulsory license). When recording a cover, the seller must pay mechanical royalties to the rights holder of the composition, which Bandcamp doesn't want to do (though maybe Songtradr has plans??) and we can assume artists won't bother. Because bandcamp is selling releases (rather than just streaming), mechanicals would apply. Presumably they don't bother enforcing unless the rights holder makes a complaint. See \"are covers ok\" here (this predated the Songtradr acquisition, FWIW) https://bandcamp.com/terms_of_use reply Semaphor 14 hours agorootparentHuh, interesting. Some quick googling suggests, this is relatively new, as a new law regarding streaming services came into effect in 2021, forcing streaming services to post, and bc didn't want the hassle. Before the law, they could require the band to have a streaming license in addition to the mechanical license. reply Pxtl 11 hours agorootparentprevBefore the buyouts Songtradr didn't have consumer-facing e-stores -- the company was primarily B2B. Epic is a consumer company, like Bandcamp and 7Digital (the two e-music shops bought by Songtradr). Apple sells all types of digital goods - movies, music, and games/apps. Google used to sell the same 3 types of digital goods, until they decided selling music instead of renting it is an anachronism. A true merger of Epic Store and Bandcamp would give Epic a similar kind of positioning as Google and Apple. Come to our e-shop to buy and download digital goods. reply iainctduncan 6 hours agorootparentWhich is what Epic said at the time but never did, right?

    "originBody": "Microsoft/ Tech/ Xbox Microsoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees Microsoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees / Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has also decided to leave, and Blizzard’s survival game has been canceled. By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Jan 25, 2024, 2:16 PM UTC| Share this story Photo by Hakan Nural / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week. While Microsoft is primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard, some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted by the cuts. The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total. The Verge has obtained an internal memo from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that confirms the layoffs: It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business. Together, we’ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth. As part of this process, we have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming workforce by approximately 1900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our team. The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible. The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and the Xbox teams, and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here. We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws. Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values. Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Although this is a difficult moment for our team, I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games, stories and worlds that bring players together. Phil Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has decided to leave the company. “As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company,” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president, Matt Booty, in an internal memo. Microsoft plans to name a new Blizzard president next week. Allen Adham, Blizzard’s chief design officer, is also leaving the company. “As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry,” says Booty. Blizzard’s previously announced survival game has also been canceled as part of these changes. Booty says Microsoft will be “shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.” The layoffs come the same month Riot Games, Google, Discord, Twitch, Unity, eBay, and others announced cuts. Microsoft completed its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October, following 20 months of battles with regulators in the UK and US. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick stepped down at the end of December, with Microsoft not appointing a direct replacement. Instead, a suite of Activision Blizzard executives now report up to Matt Booty. Today’s layoffs come just a few months after some big Xbox leadership changes saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work. Booty was also promoted to president of game content and studios, which includes overseeing Bethesda, ZeniMax studios, and Activision Blizzard. Microsoft last announced big layoffs a year ago, affecting 10,000 employees. The software maker is due to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings next week, which, for the first time, will include results from the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Here’s Matt Booty’s internal memo in full: Blizzard team, As you may have read in Phil’s note, today is a challenging day as we say goodbye to some of our colleagues. This is a difficult process, but it is one that will best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more platforms and in more places than ever before. We are moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities. In addition to the events today, Mike Ybarra and I have been discussing his future and some of his personal passions for some time. As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company. As we move forward, we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players. I want to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the deal closed. I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family. We wish him the very best. Additionally, Allen Adham, Blizzard’s Chief Design Officer, is leaving the company. As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry. The new Blizzard President will be announced next week. What Happens Next Those who are impacted are being informed in meetings starting today. Given the challenging day ahead, anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer to, can work remotely today. Due to time zones and local holidays, some impacted employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early next week. After the notifications are complete, leaders will bring their teams together. Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach during these next few days. Details on Today’s Actions The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth, as well as identified areas of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming. Today’s actions affect multiple teams within Blizzard, including development teams, shared service organizations and corporate functions. As part of this focus, Blizzard is ending development on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development. No matter the reason behind these decisions, they are never made lightly. Changes like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends, and we are all grateful for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games. As Phil stated, we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws. I understand that this is a challenging time and that it can be a lot to process. I haven’t met many of you yet, and hearing about these decisions from me may be difficult. Today, I am here on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, and I am personally committed to supporting you as teams and individuals, keeping you informed, and approaching this transition period with care and transparency. Thank you for working through these changes with us.

Especially close to earnings I hope severance is nice for all impacted reply JohnFen 16 hours agoparentHaving been through a few acquisitions, I have learned the truth of this. Eventually, I learned that if a company I work for announces they're being acquired, the best course of action for me is to start looking for other opportunities. Even if I'm not laid off (which I haven't been yet in these situations), I'm effectively being hired by a new company that I haven't vetted. It's the perfect opportunity to reassess to determine if I fit into the new company and to scout around for something I may fit better in. reply HeyLaughingBoy 13 hours agorootparent> I'm effectively being hired by a new company that I haven't vetted This is a great point. I've been through two acquisitions and both times the company was a noticeably less pleasant place a year later. reply bravetraveler 15 hours agorootparentprevMy first three SysAd gigs got acquired, all three were for the worse. I'll disclose one long enough ago: HostGator 100% start looking, the company will fundamentally change Sure, hopefully for the better, but I'm batting 0 reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agorootparentGlass half full perspective: you're pretty good at picking new employers :) I.e., the post-merger companies aren't as good as your own picks. reply bravetraveler 12 hours agorootparentHah, I appreciate that :) I never felt that were true, personally, having mostly joined places without much consideration! For some perspective: it was often more important to get out of somewhere bad than in somewhere nice reply CoastalCoder 12 hours agorootparentOk, glass 3/4 full! #1 You have an innate talent for avoiding bad workplaces, and #2 you're a lucky person! reply bravetraveler 7 hours agorootparentCareful, the cup runneth over! :) reply lo_stronzo 12 hours agorootparentprev> I'll disclose one long enough ago: HostGator I was offered a job by them long enough ago, too. When I tried to negotiate a salary I was ghosted by H.R. Looks like I dodged a bullet though! reply saos 15 hours agorootparentprev> the best course of action for me is to start looking for other opportunities. Yeah there’s a level of discernment you get from that point on reply crazygringo 18 hours agoparentprevExactly. One of the major benefits of acquisitions is to reduce duplicated roles/teams and therefore save money. You don't need two HR teams, two teams of accountants, etc. +1 on wishes for good severance! reply saos 17 hours agorootparentYeahh its happened to me in past, my first ever job out uni. The company got absolutely gutted week after acquisition was finalised. It's painful but you eventually move on in life. reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agoparentprevI want to make some joke about Blizzard not releasing software/employees until they're ready, but I can't. Being laid off just plain sucks. reply razzi 3 hours agorootparentTo me the Warcraft III Reforged saga dispelled any illusion Blizzard would still hold off on releasing unfinished/unpolished games reply seydor 18 hours agoprevLast time the stock market was surging, everyone was hiring. This time it's different reply eek2121 17 hours agoparentI'm pretty old, and I've NEVER had issues finding a job. I've been unemployed for 6 months now. Thinking about getting out of software development TBH. It isn't that I'm a bad developer, I've almost always gotten good to great performance reviews, but nobody is hiring. The positions that do open up are swamped with tons of people. The culture also is pretty toxic, especially in the startup world, and with AI now entering the scene? Then again, I don't know what I would pivot to. I thought about building a startup. However it is not a good time to be doing that either. reply hipadev23 16 hours agorootparentSkimming your comments: You deeply detest everything related to AI, cloud, and startups. It’s not age discrimination per-se, but it’s because you're actively dragging your heels on the technologies that companies are hiring for. You can probably find a job doing maintenance on some PHP or Rails app that hasn't been updated since Obama’s first term, but the pay is likely also going to come from that era. reply johnnyanmac 10 hours agorootparent>you're actively dragging your heels on the technologies that companies are hiring for. because only AI, cloud, and startups are hiring? What a weird interpretation to make of someone based off of a comment history on the internet. We don't even know what domain they work in. reply j-krieger 2 hours agorootparentNo, because even if you are at a pretty standard company, you will be expected to deal with these technologies reply hipadev23 9 hours agorootparentprevI could give the standard “ah shucks brother keep your head up!” advice that most people do. Or I can give tactical suggestions, which may be a bit hard to stomach, so he can improve his odds at landing a job. It’s fairly easy to infer his job domain from comments. He mentions web technologies and SQL often. He refers to himself as a dev, not as an engineer, and he mentions running numerous websites. He probably got his start working in “IT” (nobody says IT anymore, but he still does) in the 90s in support or technician roles and moved into full-stack web developer roles around dotcom. He also comes across as low self-confidence due to “I've almost always gotten good to great performance reviews” instead of telling us why he’s an excellent dev. That likely comes out in interviews and further hurts his chances. reply johnnyanmac 6 hours agorootparentI don't know how often unsolicited advice on the internet is helpful. Sometimes a rant is just a rant. Regardless, I don't exactly see the good faith when saying \"well you don't like AI, just find some crusty old phpjobs and take the cut\". Which is both over-presumptuous (we don't know the domain they work in) and not very helpful anyway (\"old\" companies may not be laying off thousands but still aren't exactly throwing jobs out like candy). >It’s fairly easy to infer his job domain from comments Even 20 years ago. Web has so many pieces of tech (some that didn't survive) that I wouldn't assume. Could be IT (which no one says because it evolved into its own separate domain. A 2000's IT engineer wouldn't really be doing what SDET or DevOps do today), could be old style vanilla JS website development, could be flash. Or something entirely different. >He refers to himself as a dev, not as an engineer, and he mentions running numerous websites Titles don't really mean much. My domain calls people developers, programmers, or engineers as the company sees fit (also, it's awkward to say \"game engine engineer\"). The terms are almost as flexible as \"senior\" these days. reply true_religion 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe they should try applying in the east coast. There is no AI, cloud or startups here. You will have to stomach finance or the military industrial complex though. reply dgellow 13 hours agorootparentPlenty of startups in NYC reply troynt 15 hours agorootparentprevFalse reply ipaddr 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat skill would you suggest he learn? reply hipadev23 15 hours agorootparentIf he doesn't want to actually learn AI/ML itself, there's an endless number of adjacent jobs related to all the hype: * web dev - today the majority of the jobs are very heavily ts/js, react, next.js, vercel, etc. * data engineering - AI/ML is very hungry for clean, organized, and accessible data. so we're talking sql, data warehousing, spark, beam, kafka * infra/devops - nearly every tech company needs these people: docker, kubernetes, terraform, ci/cd, gitops, metrics and monitoring tools like prometheus and grafana reply martin_drapeau 17 hours agorootparentprevDownturns is the best time to build a startup. When things turn around, you hopefully have found product market fit and can ride the up wave. reply johnnyanmac 10 hours agorootparentif you have the finances already to support a startup. The big issue in downturns is that VC money also dries up and hunkers down. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is so true that when I'm planning on starting a new business, I intentionally wait for a downturn before I pull the trigger. reply vhiremath4 17 hours agorootparentprevComing from both a place of kindness and a place of selfishness: 1. Please keep at it. We need more people with experience staying in software. I don’t know your financial situation, but software is huge and something will land! 2. Based on this comment, I highly recommend likely not ever starting a company. It’s fucking hard, and it’s not glamorous. And even though it’s hard times in the macro, it’s actually way harder for many compounding reasons that are not obvious until you do it. Again, coming from a place of love. reply kirse 15 hours agorootparentIt’s fucking hard, and it’s not glamorous \"Fucking hard\" compared to what? Things I'd qualify under the category of \"fucking hard\": - Agricultural Farming - Lifetime debilitating disease / health issue - Being enslaved or a POW - Living in a 3rd world country - Moving West in the 1800s - Fighting in the American Revolutionary or Civil War This narrative that starting a company is \"fucking hard\" is all part of the SV/SF mythos that needs a smooth stone straight to the forehead. reply exclusiv 13 hours agorootparentI understand your sentiment, but one's experience does not need to manifest like the ones you listed to be considered hard. You listed one career choice and agriculture is actually the easiest industry. #2 lowest failure rate in 1 year, #1 lowest after 5 and after 10 years [1]. What you thought was fucking hard is objectively not compared to every other industry from BLS data. Although I'd still say it's a startup and is thus fucking hard personally. Starting a company is very easy. Building a successful and sustainable one is fucking hard. I've built a few successful companies but did it while having income (both active and passive). I recommend the same for anyone's first endeavor. I also recommend having a partner or two and maybe ONLY go solo after you've built a successful business. It's not glamorous being a startup CEO and can be very lonely without partners. 50% of businesses fail by year 5 And 80% of small businesses have no employees. Most of the 50% that survive to year 5 are just paying bills and aren't self-sustaining businesses that have enterprise value and can be sold. If you want to be a one person show, yeah that's not hard in a service business. If you are average, 50% shot to make it 5 years. If we're talking about building something that kicks off actual profit and has employees, and outperforms the opportunity cost of working for someone else or taking an equity stake in existing business, it is most certainly fucking hard. To the parent - if you have savings and get a partner or two - I say keep applying but go for the startup too. The best businesses in my opinion are ones that make money closer to day 1 than year X. Figure that path out. Riches in niches. Don't worry about the macro environment. [1] https://www.lendingtree.com/business/small/failure-rate/ reply therealcamino 7 hours agorootparent\"You listed one career choice and agriculture is actually the easiest industry. #2 lowest failure rate in 1 year, #1 lowest after 5 and after 10 years [1]. What you thought was fucking hard is objectively not compared to every other industry from BLS data. \" You are pretty clearly defining \"hard\" differently than the poster you're responding to, as somehow being related only to the chance of a venture failing. But obviously that's not what \"hard\" means when the other examples include being a prisoner of war. reply jallen_dot_dev 15 hours agorootparentprevCompared to a 9-5 in tech? Which is what they're suggesting instead. What is the point of moralizing? reply kirse 14 hours agorootparentWhat is the point of moralizing? Because the guy is framing his discouragement as \"coming from a place of love\" when in reality it takes roughly 2-3 weeks to go from zero-to-[LLC accepting payments on Stripe]. Which means it's really not that \"fucking hard\" at all to start small and begin the search for paying customers. I've been on this board for 17 years back when it was originally called \"Startup News\" and full of new-company founders, sold 2 small SW apps back in 2009, and have also done the F100 corporate adventure. The emotional challenges of starting your own company can be easier than the 9-5. reply exclusiv 13 hours agorootparentStarting is easy. I don't think the parent you replied to was talking about that procedural part of it. The parent is weighing working for someone or starting a newco. Also it's a completely different ballgame when you build a company that has employees versus an app. We don't know what path the parent was talking about or what their business would be. We don't know their financial position. Regardless, it's hard to build a successful business. Especially on your first attempt. reply johnnyanmac 10 hours agorootparentprev>when in reality it takes roughly 2-3 weeks to go from zero-to-[LLC accepting payments on Stripe] okay, now tell my how long and how much it costs to g from new LLC to self-sustainable. Even some of the most popular startups aren't profitable for years. reply jannes 1 hour agorootparentprevThat violent metaphor wasn’t necessary to make your point. reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentprevSame, in 20+ years doing this, I've never seen it this bad. reply nebula8804 16 hours agorootparentWere you around for the dot com crash? You said 20 years so it sounds like you started when the wave began right after the crash. reply solardev 11 hours agorootparentI was around but very young and not working in Silicon Valley proper. I think my first tech internship was just a year or two after that, can't remember exactly. Never really had trouble finding work on the West Coast since then though. This year, I was unemployed for half a year (after quitting voluntarily) and finally found work with a European company. Guess the boom times are over! It's AI or bust now, lol (and I have neither the skills nor the interest to work in ML). Keep in mind though I'm also a nobody, some rando self taught web dev coming from the LAMP world into React. We're pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as programmers go, so I'm not surprised I'm not a competitive candidate! I love the frontend, but more for its visuals and UX than coding. It's a very far cry from AI or algorithms or really any sort of non visual coding. The kind of I stuff I used to get paid for when I was younger, Wix handles effortlessly now (and I recommend it my clients too... don't pay me, just make it yourself on Wix in a few hours). React's probably headed down the same path: https://v0.dev/ reply ericbarrett 13 hours agorootparentprevNot GP but I was just starting my career back then. I remember commute traffic on 101 through San Jose and Sunnyvale going from bumper-to-bumper to smooth sailing, where you never even had to touch your brakes. From the crash of April-ish 2000, it was 6-9 months before the best of the best could even get an interview, and about 36 to something approaching normality. reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agorootparentprevI was lucky enough to work for the DoD during the .com crash, but not this time. I guess the silver lining is that I can now better emphasize with the challenges of protracted unemployment. reply cchance 17 hours agoparentprevYa this time they realized instead they can just pocket even more profits, theres a reason inflation is 50+% due to corporate profits when normally inflation surges are ~11% from corporate profits. reply dpflan 17 hours agorootparentRight, reduce headcount, adjust balance sheets, extract profits with fewer people. reply bostonsre 17 hours agoparentprevIs it all due to inflation and the interest rates? Shouldn't these companies be able to issue stock to get some cheap capital to continue growth/hiring? Or anyone know why this is happening? reply adrianmonk 16 hours agorootparentOne view is that it's related to labor hoarding. A lot of people exited the labor market (disabled or killed by COVID, pulled the trigger on retiring, etc.). Unemployment was very low and it was very difficult to hire. And companies had opportunities for growth, but taking advantage of those opportunities required workers, which were hard to get. So companies responded by hiring whenever possible and keeping more employees around than they normally would. If there was less work to do, they'd reduce hours instead of letting employees go. Better to pay more labor costs now than to be stuck unable to get employees later. You pay a cost (larger payrolls) to reduce a risk. Hoarding can be kind of self-reinforcing because as everybody grabs what is available (job seekers), it becomes more scarce, so people want to grab up even more. But hoarding tends to stop eventually. Companies don't want to pay more for payroll if they don't have to. Once they feel the risk is gone, they'll aim to adjust things back to normal. Once layoffs start, they could have a domino effect on labor hoarding. If a bunch of companies do layoffs, then other companies think, \"Well, if we did need to hire, we could get some of those laid off workers.\" And then they reevaluate their own situation. If this is what's happening, then it will take some time for it to play out. Eventually all the hoarding-related layoffs will have been done. reply tyree731 17 hours agorootparentprev> Shouldn't these companies be able to issue stock to get some cheap capital to continue growth/hiring? Yes, but then the stock price would go down, which obviously isn't allowed. reply fsckboy 17 hours agorootparentissuing stock and selling it into the market doesn't make the stock price go down. Raising money for this activity on a large scale is why the stock market exists. The value of the existing company \"before\" remains the same, and the sale of the new shares brings cash into the company at the selling price, so those new cash assets exactly balance out the dilution of ownership. If anything it might increase the value of the company if shareholders believe that the same \"profit multiplier\"/ROE will be applied to the new cash, for example if a profitable restaurant chain sells new shares to get the cash to open and operate new restaurants in new locations. Of course, changes to the share price are due to changing expectations so that will occur as information about the pending transaction is incorporated into the hive mind and not necessarily at the moment of share sales. reply rsanek 16 hours agorootparentthis doesn't require any advanced analysis, it's simple supply and demand. offer up more shares to a market without changing demand and the price per share must go down. think about it the other way -- why would a company ever do a stock buyback if changing the amount of issued stock didn't change the price? there's a reason buybacks are considered essentially the same as dividends. reply jallen_dot_dev 14 hours agorootparentNo, the company becomes more valuable after the raise. It's more slices of a bigger pie == each slice is the same size as before. > why would a company ever do a stock buyback if changing the amount of issued stock didn't change the price? The company used its cash to buy its own stock. Fewer slices of the same pie == each slice is bigger than before. reply ImPostingOnHN 11 hours agorootparentThe company is worth what it's worth, according to investors, no matter how many slices you piece it up in. If you issue more shares, people will be willing to pay less for each one. Yes, adding cash to the balance sheet increases the book value, but the only way to add that cash is to sell the new shares, and the only way to sell the new shares is to offer them for cheaper than the current asking price. Put another way, if prospective investors wanted to buy more shares at the current asking price, they could, from an existing owner. The people who want shares but haven't bought, demand a lower price for them. reply diogocp 14 hours agorootparentprev> offer up more shares to a market without changing demand But demand does change, because the company is expanding its balance sheet. You end up with more slices of a bigger pie. Compare to a stock split, which keeps the pie size constant. reply bostonsre 16 hours agorootparentprev> why would a company ever do a stock buyback if changing the amount of issued stock didn't change the price? Buy low/sell high maybe? They buy their stock when the price is low and they think it is undervalued so that they can sell it later when the price more accurately reflects the value or even better when the price is overvaluing their stock. reply FrustratedMonky 17 hours agorootparentprev? Not allowed. It is done all the time. Companies can issue new stock. or? are you being sarcastic about c-suit not wanting 'stock price to go down'? which could be a consequence of issuing new stock? reply gtirloni 17 hours agorootparentThe latter for sure. reply andsoitis 17 hours agorootparentprevThere are many ways to increase profits. Diluting existing shareholders by increasing outstanding shares should not be a bandaid for inefficient application of capital, which would juts cause a vicious cycle. reply yterdy 14 hours agorootparentprevStock issue dilutes ownership and lowers share price. Why would people paid in stock do that when they can just offload labor? Also, they'd be competing with market makers, winkwinknudgenudge. reply e40 17 hours agoparentprevInterest rates and fear of recession. Big tech fuels R&D via very low-interest loans. This is what everyone in the financial community has been saying for a long time. reply eek2121 17 hours agorootparentIt blows my mind that people aren't hiring like mad with high interest rates. It seems like just parking a bunch of money somewhere and letting it accumulate interest would pay for salaries. Shoot, for 10 million dollars you could pay the entire salary of 2 developers without touching a dime of the actual money. Of course I know the economy doesn't work that way, but it is fun to think about. reply maerF0x0 16 hours agorootparentthe cost of borrowing that $10M has gone from 0.25 to 5.5 a 2100% increase. If inflation is above 4-5% then sitting on the money will lose purchasing power. Fear of depr/rec-ession means the products you build might see 0 traction as the economy contracts and the funding to survive dries up. reply araes 15 hours agorootparentReplying to below because of reply limit. Also, totally not a lawyer, take with that note. Actual text: Emphasis the \"be allowed\" portion. From: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/174 (a) In general - In the case of a taxpayer’s specified research or experimental expenditures for any taxable year— (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), no deduction shall be allowed for such expenditures, and (2) the taxpayer shall— (A) charge such expenditures to capital account, and (B) *be allowed* an amortization deduction of such expenditures ratably over the 5-year period (15-year period in the case of any specified research or experimental expenditures which are attributable to foreign research (within the meaning of section 41(d)(4)(F))) beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenditures are paid or incurred. Imply, the taxpayer \"may\" take a 20% amortized distribution. Similar to MtG cards that say \"a player may look through their library\" or similar. You don't have to (my reading). reply indymike 16 hours agorootparentprevThe's another factor: you now have to deal with getting 20% of the tax benefit from an engineering salary since R&D expenses are now amortized over five years. reply maerF0x0 14 hours agorootparentAgreed, this has a really interesting effect on smaller businesses which may not exist in 5 years. Sure the S&P500 it's unlikely many or any of them go bankrupt in the next 5 years, so they at least know they can _eventually_ write it off. Meanwhile a company may hit bankruptcy in yr 3 despite lingering credits. This can happen when they have profit on paper, but negative cashflow. reply indymike 5 hours agorootparent> it's unlikely many or any of them go bankrupt in the next 5 years, so they at least know they can _eventually_ write it off. I don't think this really matters all that much to small biz. It really has a lot of effect on the middle, where taking a $50/yr effectively leaves you having to deal with $40m you can't treat as an expense this year. It's a great way to cause unemployment. reply yterdy 14 hours agorootparentprevThey're servicing loads of cheap debt, they don't have the capital. reply coryfklein 13 hours agoparentprevSaying the stock market is surging is a bit of an oversimplification. If you compare trough (Oct '22) to peak (Jan '24) you get a 65% annualized rate of increase. But if you compare peak (Nov '21) to peak (Jan '24) we're essentially flat at 1.4% annualized. If a business accustomed to double digit growth every year instead saw 1.4% growth annualized over 2 years then the numbers simply can't work out to keep doing what they've always done. The fact that equity valuations are WAY better than they were in Oct '22 doesn't really help because nobody was raising money during the down turn in the first place! Everyone is priced in on pre-pandemic valuations, which for the most part are unchanged. Note: I used the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector, ticker NDXT to calculate these numbers [0].

Due to some GREAT legislation you can no longer write off engineers as an expense... it makes SWEs a tax liability instead of a write-off. https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/section-174/ reply latchkey 10 hours agorootparentDue to some GREAT legislation \" In 2017, then-President, Donald Trump, signed the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs act, which overhauled tax codes and reduced tax – for example, it reduced the top tax bracket from 39.6% to 37%. To make the bill pass strict budgetary rules, the Senate used a process called reconciliation: adding in tax code changes that delayed tax increases. These delayed increases “balanced out” the tax reduction. One of these changes was Section 174, set to come into effect 5 years later, in 2022. These parts deliver the blow by making it clear that software development costs need to be amortized over 5-15 years. Most experts expected Congress to push back the Section 174 amendment to a later date, or simply remove it. But Congressional negotiations to repeal the changes fell apart at the last minute in December 2022, meaning it became law. \" reply honkycat 10 hours agorootparentTo be clear, that is sarcastic. reply iammjm 19 hours agoprev\"primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard, some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted / work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total.\" 2k employees look like a lot, 8% looks kinda better.

It looks and feels like a cartoonish bootleg of SC with AI generated Fortnite-looking artwork. What made SC interesting, like most Blizzard IP of the time, was also the well written story lines with amazing character arcs, that kept people invested, and not that it was a strategy game of space marines versus organic aliens versus energy aliens. They even made sure to give story-time to the regular units as you unlocked them, not just the heroes. There were a lot of other similar strategy games at the time, and they all flopped (anyone remember Submarine Titans?). The first alpha release of SC was also mocked for being basically \"Warcraft in space\" so Blizzard had to step up and make SC special, and they did. The second game was less impactful than the original, but still good and memorable due to the story. Maybe I'm out of touch with modern gaming, but I don't see how this can succeed. If I want to play SC I can just get the real deal, and not just something that looks like it. The RTS games market is relatively small and niche nowadays and already saturated with quality established franchises from the past, so Zerospace would need to bring some new kick-ass revolutionary ideas to the table and not be just be \"copy my homework but change it a bit\" variant of SC. reply ixwt 17 hours agorootparentGiantGrantGames on Youtube made an interesting video about \"The Next Major RTS Will Fail. This is Why\"[0]. Turns out he got a lot of this information because he was one of the players that had a huge influence in the development, and this is what ZeroSpace focused their development efforts on. One of which, is targeting the casual audience, and their love for a good story. [0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XehNK7UpZsc reply graphe 17 hours agorootparentprevSo did the homeworld series. Story isn't enough. AoE2 had online and so did StarCraft so they stayed. Homeworld never got that, without the story, multiplayer and mods it's not quite up there. I remember CoH2 was popular, but you're right it's hard for me to want to try something other than AoE2 or SC, when they're pretty perfect. reply ep103 16 hours agorootparentFWIW, Homeworld 3 is coming out in 2 months, and I, for one, and psyched up about it reply graphe 15 hours agorootparentI am too. After seeing what happened with the remake I'm not sure if the audience is still there. Most would be strategy games players play MOBA but I hope that HW3 can get lots of players if it has all those essentials. reply FirmwareBurner 16 hours agorootparentprev> Story isn't enough. Characters and stories is everything. It keeps consumers invested and loyal to the franchise, even when the gameplay is boring and repetative, instead of jumping ship to a game with equal mechanics. It's why so many still cosplay as Kerrigan, Mario, Link, etc. It's how so many people remember Ezio and Altair instead of the other forgettable characters that followed. reply graphe 14 hours agorootparentPeople cosplay for many reasons and attachment to a character is rarely one of them. Most female cosplay thirst trapping from fans of the looks who looked good in a gantz suit. I see fromsoft cosplay and the main character with no lines as well. It may be as factor but it's far from \"everything\". Bioshock infinite was a crappy game with a good cosplay character who most who cosplay as her have no idea what bioshock infinite is. reply BlueTemplar 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet SC2 didn't really deliver on that in its two expansion packs (the base campaign was great though). Meanwhile the non-campaign gameplay, while polished, is hardly innovative (a common issue with the commercial RTS games compared to the fan-made ones). reply gamblor956 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat made SC interesting, like most Blizzard IP of the time, was also the well written story lines with amazing character arcs Is there an alternative universe version of StarCraft which had good writing? Because the one I played had pretty standard SciFi plots and characters. And while Sons of Liberty was adequate if perfunctory, the writing in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void is some of worst writing to make it into a finished media product. StarCraft succeeded based on its technical and audiovisual polish, despite the lackluster writing. That being said, Zerospace and Stormgate both look cartonish, but that's the graphic style they have chosen. They have budgets and teams a small fraction of the size of Blizzard, so the lack of visual polish can be forgiven if the game mechanics are good. reply HideousKojima 18 hours agorootparentprevSC1 had a great story with excellent writing, especially for the time. SC2's story was schlocky garbage. The biggest example of this is the opening cutscene of 2 with Raynor in the bar.

I'll be seeing you.\" Meanwhile in the opening cutscene of 2 he's pining over an old photo of her before she became a Zerg.

This will be a huge distraction and will surely cause an AI Winter. reply xnorswap 18 hours agoparentprevBe careful what you wish for, the soul of Blizzard is long dead. You can see this with Diablo 4, which is a completely soulless ARPG. With the latest season 3 launched yesterday, it's just not a fun game and it's clear that whatever processes and people they have at Activision Blizzard, they haven't got something in place that lets someone say, \"Wait, shouldn't this be fun?\". While D3 had it's fair criticism at launch for a number of reasons, it still at it's core had a fun gameplay loop. With the itemisation fix in Reaper of Souls they managed to turn it around and make a really fun game. Even in the launch state it felt like it was made by people who enjoyed gaming but had made some questionable decisions especially regarding the auction house. D4 in contrast feels more fundamentally flawed. It feels like a game made by people who have been described what makes a game fun but don't play games themselves. It's hard to put into words what feels so off about it. You can criticise that a player goes into the same tilesets, kills the same mobs for the same rewards, but at it's core that's true of a lot of ARPGs which are fun. You can criticise itemisation, but even that doesn't capture what's so off about the game. It just doesn't have the right dopamine releases while playing. There's little to get excited about when loot drops. You might get some \"green arrows\" but upgrades don't feel impactful. A few up arrows don't change how you play. When levelling up, your character doesn't really undergo a transformation from a player struggling to kill mobs in one way to clearing screens of mobs in a different way that you've grown and progressed into. You fairly early get your skills and you kill the same mobs in the same way but now the mobs have X,000 hit-points instead of X hit-points. I might myself get criticised for this post by people saying that fun is subjective, that this is just my opinion. But fun isn't just subjective, there's a core to computer games, and in the latest season the mechanics they added were to take some of the generally agreed least fun parts of competitors and wrap them up in something that doesn't even deliver a large reward for doing it. Twitch isn't always a reliable metric, but when hardcore ARPG fans are visibly bored and itching to play a different game, that isn't a good look. Season resets should be an exciting time for a clean start with a new character and exploring new play-styles. Instead, around 10 levels in, everyone realises they've already unlocked all the skills they'll use this season, that they've now essentially experienced most the content they'll see this season. reply jrockway 18 hours agorootparentYeah, Activision Blizzard was always chasing revenue at the expense of everything else. They got away with riding the coattails of Blizzard for a while, but eventually everyone figured out what was going on. My \"favorite\" part was watching them kill Overwatch with Overwatch League. Overwatch was popular because people played it casually. Activision thought it would be great to make it a professional sport. Eventually every balance change was aimed at preventing some pro team from complaining and they made the game completely unfun for casual players. So they all stopped playing. Meanwhile, Overwatch League was massively unprofitable and the privately-owned teams all pulled out after losing everything. Probably the worst business decision in gaming history, or maybe even in Fortune 500 history. At this point, I'm just waiting for someone else to make games with the quality and \"spark\" of old Blizzard. It will happen. Probably not at Microsoft, though. reply pfdietz 18 hours agorootparentIf the bad decisions there were driven from the top, then the acquisition could cause a large change in behavior. No guarantees, of course. reply jrockway 10 hours agorootparentThat's what I (and the rest of the community) was hoping for, but given that they gutted things like the art teams today...

Just look at what happened to Rare after they were acquired. All the games in their pipeline were published on Xbox, but then the Studio's production nose dived. Rare as an independent studio was producing banger after banger for 20 years. Under ~15 years of Microsoft they have only produced Viva Pinata, B&K:N&B, then nothing for a decade but some Kinect sports trash nobody wanted(sorry). then Sea of Thieves. reply pfdietz 16 hours agorootparentprevBlizzard has been stuck in a failure state for years now, so there's little downside for them to shaking things up. At worst, Microsoft sells its parts off to vulture companies to turn things into gatcha games. reply solardev 18 hours agorootparentprevLarian, FromSoftware, Gunfire, Grinding Gear... the smaller studios are putting out great games still, with much of that 90s magic. There's that new game Palworld too apparently making a stir (haven't tried it yet), from another small studio. It's the big ones that have jumped the shark and gone full-in capitalist. I mostly just ignore them and haven't felt like I've missed much. So many good indie titles coming out every day. reply BlueTemplar 10 hours agorootparentI guess technically Larian and GGG are \"smaller\" than even Activision-Blizzard before the buyout, but they aren't \"small\" either any more. (And GGG has been mostly owned by Tencent for a few years now.) Path of Exile 1 is a glorious mess that anyone remotely interested in the genre should try (don't give up in the first act like most players, it gets way better), but currently at least with quite ridiculously bad performance, which is particularly aggravated by it being an online-only game of which you cannot play the old DX9 32-bit version any more, which had at least an order of magnitude smaller hardware requirements. (And you aren't indie if you release on Steam (especially only !) like Palworld.

Why not? It's the best marketplace for indie games... IMO it jump-started the PC indie gaming revolution! Before that, we only had shareware of limited reach, maybe distributed through PC Gamer floppies/CDs. And maybe Tucows. It was hard to find new indie games, much less buy them.

On top of that it has a number of handy QoL upgrades over most survival crafters I've played, like all chests in your base sharing their inventory with all crafting stations at the base.

Also I hope no one bothers to argue these are AAAA, AAAAAAAA. It really doesn't matter. reply theptip 18 hours agorootparentprevFor me the big problems were 1) no power spikes, unique gear is mostly irrelevant except for a couple pieces that unlock certain builds. In D2 you’d find some crazy unique early on that makes you completely OP for a few levels, and those spikes really made things memorable. 2) too easy, and the auto-leveling on monsters. On WT2 where you start the game is just too easy and even the +2 level strongholds are not hard. If you do any side quests you quickly get to the point where you have leveled past the area minimums so there is nowhere to go to get +5-10 challenges that are actually fun. It takes so long to unlock WT4 that I was bored by the time the challenge started to pick up. I realize the hardcore players are going to do an optimized route to get to WT4 in a shortish grind, then the game begins, but just playing the game as it is presented the difficulty curves are completely wrong. reply Brybry 16 hours agorootparent1) You'll get pretty big power spikes (and some power drops) at WT3 (sacred) and WT4 (ancestral) gear jumps. One at 50(?) when you unlock paragon board and get to spend a bunch of points. Then your biggest power spike when you get item power 925 weapons (you could do this really fast from world bosses in season 2 but it's a bit slower in season 3). Then, yes, gradual power increases from other gear/glyphs/paragon and potential big power spikes from uber uniques (but rough to farm). 2) Once you beat the main story/campaign you never do the campaign or side quests again, even during seasons with new characters. Same for renown. Non-expert players hit WT4 in a day or two at season start... as long as they're playing one of the set of viable builds per class. And once you're in WT4 you can effectively pick how hard you want the content to be. In comparison, the expert players hit level 100 in a day or two. If you play D2 \"as the game is presented\" you'll have a bad time too, eventually. It's very easy to make non-viable builds in most dungeon crawl ARPG. If you really want to have fun, unless you specifically have fun developing good builds, then my biggest suggestion is to play a meta build. Season 2 ball lightning sorc was super fun. It had the full \"build struggles\" -> \"build is now online\" -> \"build is *zooming*\" experience. Yes, it was overpowered (at least until AoZ) and broke the servers during world bosses. The game definitely has problems but each season has been an improvement as well, even if an individual season mechanic isn't the greatest. In comparison, I think a game like Path of Exile is a much more interesting dungeon crawl ARPG but I think Path of Exile is also exhausting to play unless one makes it their main long-term game. reply kraig911 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's just sad I guess this is an example of post consumerism. Maybe making games for the sake of profit and not fun it was just a matter of time.

Between the server issues (for a mostly singleplayer game!), the real money auction house, criticisms about the story and the visual palette, as well as a missing PvP mode, it had a LOT of criticism. Meanwhile D4 somehow actually managed the feat of mostly stable release servers (though the online-only criticism still stands). Hardcore dungeon zoomer fans used to current D3/PoE1 might not have been the target demographic here. Probably also why you unlock most skills so quickly (which is probably barely quick enough for most players to see, as 80% of them don't finish the campaign). And I find these complaints hard to believe, as after all, the top end playstyles still tend to be much faster, and different from early on thanks to how the paragon points and especially legendary aspects and finally unique items tend to transform the skills. I found the last open beta of D4 so compelling (even more than the D3 beta) that I completely changed my mind about (not) buying it. They really nailed (again) that \"Diablo feel\" (whatever that is) that I have been missing in competitors'. I have also been surprised how well the dodge mechanic worked and how enjoyable it was. The campaign is good, the art is top notch, as usual. Now sadly the way that the leveling works in the campaign is screwed up in that it's easy to end up with a too easy game if you start on non-easy mode and start doing even the slightest sidequest (which is a shame as some of them are great !). You would have thought that, after D3's evolution, there would be more than 2 difficulty levels available for the first half of the game ! I also don't understand why the seasonal mechanics have been pushed out of the campaign. The worst issue IMHO creeps up late game (and even mid-game for the season 2) : item spam, especially for \"legendary\" items. (Listening too much to the most obsessive fans of the current D3 ??) Even worse, for some unfathomable reason, the legendary aspects don't even have unique icons to distinguish them at a glance in the inventory (ditto for dungeon sigils), which is frankly shocking for what is a Blizzard game with ridddddddddiculously long credits, and not some kind of small budget beta. But then, just like D3 changed a LOT, I'm cautiously optimistic about D4 improving over the years. (The online-only / no mods issue will remain, and this lack of future is sad to see considering the man years of effort spent on it...) reply adamrezich 18 hours agorootparentprevpeople need to get used to the idea that brand-name recognition doesn't mean anything anymore once said brand no longer represents what it once did. very few game development studios perpetuate the internal mindset they became known for, as its constituent developers get ship-of-theseus'd out. sure, you might have some fans of the old brand now working there, but merely being a fan of something doesn't necessarily confer the ideology and mindset of those who created the thing you were a fan of. as time goes on, you get to the point where studios hire fans of the latter-day output of the studio, rather than the earlier stuff, such that the studio drifts farther and farther away from its former identity. then, especially after a massive corporation like Microsoft buys the studio out completely, the studio becomes a mere husk of its former glory—completely different people with an entirely different mindset continue to wear its skin. perhaps after more of this corporate downsizing continues to occur, people will start small, passionate studios again, and this time maybe some of them can effectively gatekeep when hiring so as to perpetuate a brand identity/mentality going forward—but I doubt this will happen in any significant way. reply psunavy03 18 hours agorootparentThis has been going on since Sierra went to shit. reply asylteltine 18 hours agorootparentprevI agree.

LLMs have access to more training material than a human writer could reasonably read in a lifetime, and have a large statistical model of \"drama\" that's way more nuanced than your typical side NPC. I don't see this as an either/or situation where they'll replace the lead writers of a title and create the entire narrative. But they can surely (already) make far more interesting characters and side quests than your standard \"help kill these goblins for 3gp\" filler or fetch quest. Working together with writers, instead of outright replacing them, will hopefully create better overall experiences for gamers. reply mmcdermott 11 hours agorootparentI wonder whether LLMs will turn out to have a sort of uncanny valley of their own when it comes to producing creative works from incomprehensibly vast training sets.

Not sure who is speaking to you. reply crazygringo 18 hours agorootparentDo you have information on this particular acquisition though? Layoffs made post-acquisition are totally different from business climate layoffs. A major part of acquisitions is eliminating redundant positions/teams. You don't need two HR or accounting departments, and the new combined department isn't going to be twice as big. Whereas if they intend to keep putting out games at the same pace, there are little to no efficiencies to be found in laying off designers and engineers. (It does sound like they've canceled one of the games though, resulting in some layoffs there, but unclear in which departments. Acquisitions often involve a change of strategy as well, so that could affect designers/engineers if they can't be absorbed by other games in development.) reply CSMastermind 17 hours agorootparentReached out to some of my friends over there and it seems like news of impacted divisions is just started to roll out.

Headcount increases in software engineering projects result in diminishing returns per-individual, but the increase is still there (if managed correctly). For example a 100 person team may not be 10x as productive as a 10 person team, but they may be 5x as productive. A 1000 person team may only be 3x as productive as 100. And so on until you have many thousands of engineers that can slowly move mountains and maintain massively complex and interwoven systems. reply ryandrake 17 hours agorootparentAlso, development headcount begets support headcount. For every 10 new engineers you hire, you will need to also hire a manager for them. For every 20-30 engineers, you'll probably need a PM to steer the product and a PjM to handle all the additional communication/process overhead. For every 2-3 managers, you'll need an admin who manages their schedule and meetings. As the team grows, you'll need more people purely working on infrastructure, internal tools, build&release, security, legal, maybe doc writers, and so on, and they all need managers too. Suddenly you have 10K people. Whenever we see these big layoffs, someone inevitably comes out of the woodwork to naively ask, \"Why does Company X need 1,000 people??

It makes a lot of money. Activision-Blizzard owns a lot of valuble IP that they could absolutely further monetize. It remains to be seen if Microsoft has the vision or desire to capitalize on that. There is a huge gap with Blizzard IP mostly not being on consoles. It's worth noting that Microsoft just became the second $3 trillion market cap company.

Distros want an easy path to enabling Secure Boot using the default preloaded Microsoft signing key, rather than require users to enroll their own key. But Microsoft refuses to sign GPL bootloaders like grub in general, so shim was made to be able to be signed by the Microsoft key. (shim then implements its own separate signature verification of what it boots, based on a different key called the Machine Owner Key, MOK.) When you tell shim what EFI binary to boot, you can specify it as an HTTP URL. If you do this and the HTTP server is malicious, it can trigger an out-of-bounds write. However, usually you use it to boot a local second-stage bootloader like grub (hence the name \"shim\"), so it's unlikely to be a problem for most installs. Regardless, Secure Boot was built from the start to allow previously-signed binaries to be revoked via the DBX list - a list of signatures that can be loaded into the UEFI to make it reject binaries even if they have a valid signature. When (If) the signatures of old shim binaries with this bug are added to the list, you can update the list in your own machines. Updates may be distributed as capsule updates (via LVFS etc), or if you manage your SB keys and vars you can download and enroll the list from https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile reply BillDemirkapi 12 hours agoparentOP/bug finder here with some clarifying information. It's a common misconception that this issue can only be abused if you use HTTP boot. That is not the case at all, otherwise it wouldn't be Critical. This bug can be abused locally (privileged malware can overwrite the EFI partition), from an adjacent network if PXE boot is enabled (w/ MiTM), or remotely if HTTP boot is used (w/ MiTM). More details on these scenarios: 1. A remote attacker with no privileges in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) position could leverage the issue against a victim machine that uses HTTP boot. No direct access to the victim machine is required. 2. A remote attacker with privileges and code execution on the victim machine could leverage the issue to bypass Secure Boot, even if the victim does not already use HTTP boot (as long as firmware has HTTP support). How? Several ways: - An attacker can edit the boot order variable to specify a controlled attacker server. - An attacker can chain shim->GRUB2->shim (via HTTP). For this technique, an attacker would overwrite the boot loader in the EFI partition to a legitimate shim and GRUB2 image. The attacker would create a grub.cfg that chainloads a new shim via HTTP. This is possible because GRUB2's device syntax allows you to specify any supported device, including HTTP (if available). 3. An adjacent attacker with no privileges in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) position could leverage the issue against a victim machine that uses PXE boot. PXE is separate from HTTP boot, but similar to the local vector, an attacker can chain together shim (via PXE)->GRUB2 (via PXE)->shim (via HTTP). reply Arnavion 12 hours agorootparentYes, if the attacker can edit the the victim machine's EFI vars or the contents of its ESP, then they can make the victim machine use HTTP boot even if the victim machine didn't use HTTP boot originally. However at that point they can also wreak more havoc without involving HTTP boot. For the case where the default configuration has been set up to just chainload grub (ie what distros use shim for), and where an attacker editing EFI vars / ESP is not in the threat model, there is no concern. Yes that is just \"It's not a concern because you defined it to not be.\" but that is the reality for most users of Secure Boot on Linux. Also note that the reason I wrote that paragraph is because the HN submission was originally submitted with a title along the lines of \"Every install of shim is affected\". reply lmm 12 hours agorootparent> Yes, if the attacker can edit the the victim machine's EFI vars or the contents of its ESP, then they can make the victim machine use HTTP boot even if the victim machine didn't use HTTP boot originally. However at that point they can also wreak more havoc without involving HTTP boot. How? The whole point of secure boot is that an attacker with even that level of access can't boot the machine in an authenticated way (and e.g. make the disk encryption key available). reply Arnavion 11 hours agorootparent>How? Someone with enough privileged access to write to the ESP (ie root) can also add their own MOK to the ESP that the user might blindly accept next time they boot. Especially if they time it for when there is a legitimate new MOK in the ESP waiting to be accepted on next boot, so that the user is predisposed to accepting a new key. They can also replace shim with other binaries with other vulnerabilities that were signed by the MS key in the past, in case DBX hasn't been updated with their hashes. >The whole point of secure boot is that an attacker with even that level of access can't boot the machine in an authenticated way (and e.g. make the disk encryption key available).

Neither of those sounds like a sure thing. The first relies on the user not checking the key, and is exposing the attacker to a lot of risk if they do. The second relies on DBX not being updated, for which the remedy is \"don't do that\". > Someone with enough privileged access to write to the ESP (ie root) can also just exfiltrate your disk contents at that point. The idea is that your main data partition is encrypted with a key held in a secure enclave and can only be retrieved after a secure boot. (Or, y'know, any of the other things people would use secure boot for). Your boot partition has to be unencrypted so you can boot from it, but there's no sensitive data on there, and an attacker with write access can't \"rootkit\" it because if they replace the bootloader with a different one then it will be unsigned and break the chain of trust. Again if this stuff didn't work then there would be no point in secure boot at all. reply Arnavion 10 hours agorootparent>The second relies on DBX not being updated, for which the remedy is \"don't do that\".

Let's revisit this topic in the future to see how many systems actually get patched to revoke these signatures. My guess is that nearly 100% of shipping systems 1 year from now will still have these keys and still boot these vulnerable signed binaries right out of the box.

Good ol', classy Microsoft. > Surface Pro devices have always had toggleable & configurable Secure Boot. Not at all. While it is true that Secure Boot has been deactivable in the \"Pro\" family, disabling Secure Boot results in Scary Boot Prompts (TM) (a _permanent_, literal red screen warning during the boot process that would drive most users away). _To this day_, there is no way to install your own Secure Boot keys in the Surface UEFI setup. Again, one of the \"shitty\" implementations, and comes from Microsoft! It's actually worse than that. At least the first two Surface Pro iterations didn't even ship with the UEFI CA key, meaning you could not even install MS-signed Linux distros! The only way would be to disable Secure Boot, and thus have to suffer the red Scary Boot Prompts (TM) on every boot prompt. Again, MS leading the way for the other OEMs in terms of shittiness. Almost two years afterwards, MS started shipping a WMI-based method that would allow you to install the MS UEFI CA. So you had to install Windows and run a Windows program in order to be able to install an OS signed with your own keys. This is _still true_ even in the latest iteration of Surface Pro devices.

Leaving it as work that the open source world has to do to combine them into the derivative work? Surely an attestation/signature would be a fair use derivative work? reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentWould it? Suppose I write some GPLv3 code. You incorporate that code into a program called shim-gpl3 and release the result under the GPLv3. You also release a binary. Microsoft signs that binary and releases the signature but does not redistribute the binary. Microsoft says that they don’t think that the signature is a copyrightable work but that, to the extent that it is, it is permissively licensed (CC0, MIT, whatever). A Linux distribution builds an installer that contains, shim-gpl3 and Microsoft’s signature. The recipient of the distribution asks the distributor for source to the GPL v3 parts of their distro. The problem (as I see it) is that the distributor cannot comply. This is as intended! The media, as is, runs on an effectively TiVo-ized machine, and neither the distributor nor the end-user can build it from source such that the result works if modifications are applied. reply taeric 10 hours agorootparentIf I publicly attest to something, and provide cryptographic proof that you can verify the version you are looking at is the one that I attest to, then I do not see how that is meaningfully a derivative work of what we are attesting.

Now, it seems what you are implying is that they need a new signature that must be created at build time. I'm asking for a much more restrictive bootloader that would have to be buildable with a repeatable process so that someone else can create the same one down to the bit level.

Reproducible builds are fantastic. But I doubt that, in this instance, it would be a valid way around the GPL. Maybe if one, as an art project, made a project that, when compiled, had a particularly aesthetically pleasing binary representation, it would be okay. But we’re talking specifically about a signature needed to run the software, which appears to fit the definition of “Installation Information” in section 6 of the GPLv3. reply taeric 6 hours agorootparentMy point is the signature can be combined after the fact. Basically, I can give you a binary that is the signature for another binary that is the boot loader, built to certain specifications. You build that, and combine with this signature, and you are good to go. If the build doesn't build exactly the same, signature will be invalid and you can't use it. Note that this is VERY limited in how much it could possibly help. But I don't see why it wouldn't be permissible by all licenses involved. It doesn't require the signing key, but a valid signature. For that device, it is locked down enough that the only installer that can work is the one that matches this signature. If installing somewhere else, you don't need the signature anymore, and can make your own or use an unsigned loader. reply kmeisthax 14 hours agorootparentprevIf this were true, it probably applies to both GPLv2 and v3, since they both require installation instructions. v3 adds an additional requirement that if you mere-aggregate GPL software and other software, and put the aggregate into a consumer product, you can't disable the other software because the GPL software was modified. I don't believe this would apply in the situation that these shims are intended for - i.e. installing an OS onto a desktop machine, as those are supposed to allow you to enroll new Secure Boot keys anyway. I also don't understand why a signature from Microsoft would actually trip any of the above-mentioned requirements. Microsoft is not distributing the software, they're just signing it - i.e. distributing a message saying \"this shim with this hash can run\". That's not a copyright violation, so the GPL doesn't come into play at all.

At least one member of the SFC who was a member of the FSF in the past (Bradley Kuhn) [1] believes that the FSF has the same position - that both GPLv2 software and GPLv3 software must be accompanied by full instructions (and ability) for a user to install their own modified versions on any hardware containing this software. He believes that the only difference with GPLv3 is that, in addition to this requirement, other proprietary software on the device must continue to operate just as before; whereas, with the GPLv2, it's fine for other proprietary software to say \"you're running an unsigned version of Linux, failing to start\". Linus Torvalds' public statements about the GPLv3, as well as the FSF page on Tivoization [2], seem to suggest otherwise.

The overall spirit of the GPLv3 text is that the license demands preservation of the ability of an end user to modify and run the software they receive, see all the discussion at the time it was being drafted about \"TiVoization\". It does not specifically speak to encryption and signatures being used by the loader environment, but it's absolutely reasonable to interpret it that way. If I buy a laptop from Lenovo, and it uses a signed GPLv3 bootloader, and I want to modify and run a new version of that bootloader, I'm prevented by the lack of a signature. That action is exactly what the license demands Lenovo permit. Now, obviously this collides badly with the security requirements of the system. So it's likewise totally reasonable to imagine a court flipping the other way and refusing to literally enforce the GPLv3 because of the potential damage to the market. But if that happens, then what gives Lenovo any right to ship that GPLv3 software at all? Now they're subject to the bootloader authors demanding they stop shipment of the infringing product.

The net result, then, seems to be that any arbitrary party can obtain signing keys which allow them to sign arbitrary code which will be booted (indirectly) via Secure Boot. How is that a meaningfully different outcome from the one we would have if Microsoft simply issued signing keys for GPLv3 projects like grub? reply Arnavion 14 hours agorootparentMS doesn't \"issue\" signing keys. MS has a signing key that it uses to sign bootloaders, and which is the default key in every UEFI that wants to be able to boot Windows with Secure Boot enabled. (*) Their argument is that if they signed a particular distro's GPL-licensed binary, then the user of that binary can ask for the source to be able to regenerate that binary, and that would require the signing key for completeness to be able to boot that binary. shim is MIT-licensed so that requirement does not apply. (*) To be precise, the key used to sign Windows and the key used to sign the rest are different, but both are enabled by default.

The distro drops its MOK (the one it used to sign the kernel into the distro kernel package) into the ESP. On next boot shim notices the new key and asks the user if they want to enroll it.

Conversely, if Content-Length is larger then rx_message.BodyLength, that means that we didn't yet receive the whole message, so we should either wait more, or issue a timeout error. Either way, rx_message.BodyLength is a bogus value if it's not guaranteed to be equal to Content-Length. On the other hand, if you want to be more permissive, then why look at the Content-Length header at all?

If the server is compromised, it can just send a malicious binary.\" the short answer is: The binary that the shim ends up booting has to be signed by the MOK. So it should continue to provide the same security guarantees whether you're booting from within a compromised network, over HTTP, or if you're booting from a compromised server (even if it's over HTTPS). It's also important to note that secure boot doesn't prevent downgrades, so the fact that a compromised server could be utilised in a downgrade attack is not relevant. You would need to implement downgrade attack prevention in a more robust way regardless. That being said, I don't know _why_ the shim needs to support http boot (after all, nothing stops this from being implemented as second local EFI binary which handles it and is signed by the MOK), aside from maybe that it was thought to be a relatively simple feature to implement. reply 1970-01-01 15 hours agoprevThe S in HTTP is to be used when important things are happening.

In this case, the code accidentally uses the header for the allocation but the protocol metadata to copy it from the rx buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. reply dwattttt 12 hours agoparentprevFrom the description, it allocates a buffer based on Content-Length, but copies the size of the buffer it received, thus writing out of bounds of the allocation. reply guytv 2 hours agoprevUsing the 'goto' keyword brings back lots of memories after all these years. reply stonogo 15 hours agoprevI have to say this is definitely a bug and I'm glad it's fixed ... but what kind of psycho boots their machine from an untrusted host?

They _really_ believe in a security strategy which _requires_ everything that could be potentially be compromised to not be signed by Secure Boot. The moment you have something signed which has a vulnerability, you can use it to decrypt everyone's SecureBoot+TPM encrypted hard drives. Why that ever was considered a valid security approach is over me, as there is an entire gallery of vulnerabilities like this one. It also completely ignores the elephant in the room called Windows. Example of this type of thinking: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/3/767 Note that despite Linus' reticences, in a lot of distros integrity mode is indeed enabled when you boot with Secure Boot on.

It's a serious start and they've already written a viewer. In fact, the article itself is displayed in a browser-based wasm port of the viewer (and looks good!). One issue is how precisely EPUB, which is really XHTML, can reproduce layout. What are the possibilities here? The OP's standard is that the document will look \"reasonable\". The imply that HTML would need new layout capabilities to match PDF, at least for line breaking: There's two ways to make progress here. One is for browsers to provide more typography tools. Allegedly, text-wrap: pretty is supposed to help, but in my brief testing it doesn't seem to improve line-break quality. The other way is to pre-calculate line breaks, which would only work for fixed-layout renditions. Also, though the author mentions annotations, I don't see how they intend to implement them. reply joshjob42 3 hours agoparentThe author discusses fixed layout epubs. Effectively, the epub can give a default pagination, line-breaks, font, font size, page size, and positioning for images etc., making it render identically on everything (one might optionally omit pagination if opening in a browser but keep everything else). This can be done already in epub3. But that's not ideal, because then it doesn't look good anymore on a phone, etc. Depending on the reader though, you could override the default, but then you have to hope that your reader does a good job of making a nice document. An alternative is for the epub to specify multiple renderings, for various common screen types. I don't think this is unreasonable as a solution. By all means let's try to get a smart reader, but letting people create defaults for their documents that can be overridden if desired by the user is a good middle ground. reply idoubtit 38 minutes agorootparentIndeed, EPUB3 provides all the features that the author wishes. His \"portable EPUB\" format is just a loosely specified subset. It's unclear if some extra features are included in the format as they are in his \"Bene\" tool, like the rendering of references (i.e. links with a data-target attribute). The EPUB3 standard is much more complex than EPUB2 (media overlays, mixing fixed layout with reflowed, MathML…). In my experience the implementations are much more varying, and most of them aren't complete. So a \"Portable EPUB\" may not render as expected because the reader tool lacks some specific feature. The author also requires full JS support, which I supose does not help with portability. reply zozbot234 1 hour agoparentprevDoesn't CSS support layout capabilities for paged media out of the box? An EPUB reader just has to implement good old-fashioned \"Print Preview\" display mode, and you're set. reply geokon 50 minutes agoprevIt feels like a bit of doomed a project simply bc browsers don't open EPubs. You can link a PDF and while it's a bit of a context switch, the browser will open and display it Since as described EPubs are basically HTML its kinda dumb browsers don't open them - but good luck convincing the Chrome/Mozilla bureaucrats I think another discouraging aspect is HTML CSS are so huge and bloated at this point that few people can implement a \"reader\" for EPUB/HTML. It's basically \"go implement a new browser\". It makes one think a easy-to-parse markdown (like Djot) with some extra rendering bells and whistles would be a more likely long term solution My personal interim compromise solution is embedded everything (CSS, svgs, scripts and base64 images) into an HTML file. It's similar to an EPUB. It's a bit bloated and ugly but with a bit of care it works and naturally browsers (and by extension basically every user) can open it Unfortunately a user has no way to really know \"oh I can download and store this web page offline\". It'd be nice to have some thing like a .htmls extension that indicates it's an HTML but it doesn't have any external resources. reply zerof1l 29 minutes agoparent> It feels like a bit of doomed a project simply bc browsers don't open EPubs. Not that long time ago, browsers could not open PDFs as well. Now all browsers come with PDF reader written in ASM/JS. I see nothing that prevents browsers doing the same for EPUBs.

Google, MS, and Apple don't give a shit about EPUB, they never will, and it's arguable that we're better served with them not buying a seat at that table considering how poorly their \"help\" has helped web standards, as much of the rest of his dismissive thread helpfully notes. If he wants money for EPUB standards he should shake the cup at IDPF members who rely on it, and particularly Amazon, to whom he quite vocally abdicated the publishing space 12 years ago.[1] Barking at operating system companies is nonsense at best and how we wind up with another, even more avoidable situation where the space is held hostage by them at worst. At least Amazon can chuck some goodwill money at EPUB development while continuing to kick its ass up and down the market with MOBI. (Aside from all this, his dismissals of the \"clunky\" reading system complaint, citing how EPUB has \"too many divergences\", only further proves to me how tunneled the vision is of the people involved. To hell with forking or improving EPUB, then, because it can't be improved if that's the attitude of the people most involved with or influential within it. What bloody point is there in the customizability of a format that _nobody_ can effectively build tools for or consume?) 1: https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/notes/amazon-wins/, in which he also admits that he has no idea how to work with IDPF, which is a really great sign of how long things have been going this badly in this space reply jxdxbx 5 minutes agoparentprevMy view as a heavy ebook reader: ePubs should be inert data.

I have never seen any kind of technical documentation published in any other format than PDF that is comfortable for reading and searching, even when that is done on a mobile phone. I do not want a document that changes appearance depending on the device used for reading or depending on its temporary state, like window size. I want a document whose layout has been well conceived by its author and which is fixed, regardless of what I happen to use for reading it. When I happen to read it on a smaller screen or window, except for trivial text-only documents, I do not want changes in layout, but I only want a smart reader, with comfortable means for fast zoom and pan, and which does not have stupid behaviors (like some Android readers), for instance where scrolling vertically (including Page Up/Page Down) also moves the document horizontally (preventing the easy reading of a column of text). The traditional recommendations for the maximum width of a text column are good enough, if observed, to ensure comfortable reading even on a mobile phone. Only when the author breaks the traditional typographic rules by making extra-wide columns, the reading on a mobile phone becomes inconvenient. reply baq 1 hour agoparentprevbut but but... if I really need to print something, a PDF is the most reliable times portable route.

In some cases a single font could be larger than the entire rest of the file. I've also worked on implementing embedding fonts in some software that generated PDFs. It was surprisingly difficult to figure out how to get it to work reliably. > PDFs are rendered consistently. Not as much as you would think. There are several cases where the same PDF will render differently depending on which PDF viewer you use.

Therefore with compatible system fonts there should be no changes in the layout of the rendered document. There are of course examples of system fonts which are advertised as compatible in metrics with the ancient Adobe PostScript fonts, but which nonetheless have subtle differences.

This probably has to do something with them having nothing to do, as the big companies managed to convince the frontend dev community that the single best thing to generate layout is on the client machine on the fly. Of course they did it so the users will have a hard time selectively blocking the layout scripts from the ad/spyware most contemporary (web)software development is about. This led us to the point where saving (or God forbid printing!) an article needs a lot of effort in many cases. My observation is: when I need to go to work on the field, I need printed documents. Printed documents don't need firmware updates, their batteries don't run out, and no, I don't need interactivity in documents.

Readera is a great reader for mobile that makes this possible. I'm currently working on a script that will convert an epub to pdf, extract the annotations from Readera, and mark them in the pdf.

Quick links Read documentation January 25, 2024 Authors OpenAI Announcements, Product We are releasing new models, reducing prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo, and introducing new ways for developers to manage API keys and understand API usage. The new models include: Two new embedding models An updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model An updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model An updated text moderation model By default, data sent to the OpenAI API will not be used to train or improve OpenAI models. New embedding models with lower pricing We are introducing two new embedding models: a smaller and highly efficient text-embedding-3-small model, and a larger and more powerful text-embedding-3-large model. An embedding is a sequence of numbers that represents the concepts within content such as natural language or code. Embeddings make it easy for machine learning models and other algorithms to understand the relationships between content and to perform tasks like clustering or retrieval. They power applications like knowledge retrieval in both ChatGPT and the Assistants API, and many retrieval augmented generation (RAG) developer tools. A new small text embedding model text-embedding-3-small is our new highly efficient embedding model and provides a significant upgrade over its predecessor, the text-embedding-ada-002 model released in December 2022. Stronger performance. Comparing text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-small, the average score on a commonly used benchmark for multi-language retrieval (MIRACL) has increased from 31.4% to 44.0%, while the average score on a commonly used benchmark for English tasks (MTEB) has increased from 61.0% to 62.3%. Reduced price. text-embedding-3-small is also substantially more efficient than our previous generation text-embedding-ada-002 model. Pricing for text-embedding-3-small has therefore been reduced by 5X compared to text-embedding-ada-002, from a price per 1k tokens of $0.0001 to $0.00002. We are not deprecating text-embedding-ada-002, so while we recommend the newer model, customers are welcome to continue using the previous generation model. A new large text embedding model: text-embedding-3-large text-embedding-3-large is our new next generation larger embedding model and creates embeddings with up to 3072 dimensions. Stronger performance. text-embedding-3-large is our new best performing model. Comparing text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-large: on MIRACL, the average score has increased from 31.4% to 54.9%, while on MTEB, the average score has increased from 61.0% to 64.6%. Eval benchmark ada v2 text-embedding-3-small text-embedding-3-large MIRACL average 31.4 44.0 54.9 MTEB average 61.0 62.3 64.6 text-embedding-3-large will be priced at $0.00013 / 1k tokens. You can learn more about using the new embedding models in our Embeddings guide. Native support for shortening embeddings Using larger embeddings, for example storing them in a vector store for retrieval, generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings. Both of our new embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost of using embeddings. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the dimensions API parameter. For example, on the MTEB benchmark, a text-embedding-3-large embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened text-embedding-ada-002 embedding with a size of 1536.ada v2 text-embedding-3-small text-embedding-3-large Embedding size 1536 512 1536 256 1024 3072 Average MTEB score 61.0 61.6 62.3 62.0 64.1 64.6 This enables very flexible usage. For example, when using a vector data store that only supports embeddings up to 1024 dimensions long, developers can now still use our best embedding model text-embedding-3-large and specify a value of 1024 for the dimensions API parameter, which will shorten the embedding down from 3072 dimensions, trading off some accuracy in exchange for the smaller vector size. Other new models and lower pricing Updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model and lower pricing Next week we are introducing a new GPT-3.5 Turbo model, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, and for the third time in the past year, we will be decreasing prices on GPT-3.5 Turbo to help our customers scale. Input prices for the new model are reduced by 50% to $0.0005 /1K tokens and output prices are reduced by 25% to $0.0015 /1K tokens. This model will also have various improvements including higher accuracy at responding in requested formats and a fix for a bug which caused a text encoding issue for non-English language function calls. Customers using the pinned gpt-3.5-turbo model alias will be automatically upgraded from gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 two weeks after this model launches. Updated GPT-4 Turbo preview Over 70% of requests from GPT-4 API customers have transitioned to GPT-4 Turbo since its release, as developers take advantage of its updated knowledge cutoff, larger 128k context windows, and lower prices. Today, we are releasing an updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model, gpt-4-0125-preview. This model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task. The new model also includes the fix for the bug impacting non-English UTF-8 generations. For those who want to be automatically upgraded to new GPT-4 Turbo preview versions, we are also introducing a new gpt-4-turbo-preview model name alias, which will always point to our latest GPT-4 Turbo preview model. We plan to launch GPT-4 Turbo with vision in general availability in the coming months. Updated moderation model The free Moderation API allows developers to identify potentially harmful text. As part of our ongoing safety work, we are releasing text-moderation-007, our most robust moderation model to-date. The text-moderation-latest and text-moderation-stable aliases have been updated to point to it. You can learn more about building safe AI systems through our safety best practices guide. New ways to understand API usage and manage API keys We are launching two platform improvements to give developers both more visibility into their usage and control over API keys. First, developers can now assign permissions to API keys from the API keys page. For example, a key could be assigned read-only access to power an internal tracking dashboard, or restricted to only access certain endpoints. Second, the usage dashboard and usage export function now expose metrics on an API key level after turning on tracking. This makes it simple to view usage on a per feature, team, product, or project level, simply by having separate API keys for each. In the coming months, we plan to further improve the ability for developers to view their API usage and manage API keys, especially in larger organizations.

    "commentBody": "New embedding models and API updates (openai.com)206 points by Josely 15 hours agohidepastfavorite75 comments minimaxir 15 hours agoTo compare with the MTEB leaderboard (https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard), the new embedding models are on par with open-source embedding models like BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5, not a drastic improvement if already using them. Obviously, a cost/performance improvement is still good. I've found evidence that the OpenAI 1536D embeddings are unnecessairly big for 99% of use cases (and now there's a 3072D model?!) so the ability to reduce dimensionality directly from the API is appreciated for the reasons given in this post. Just chopping off dimensions to an arbitrary dimensionality is not a typical dimensionality reduction technique so that likely requires a special training/alignment technique that's novel. EDIT: Tested the API: it does support reducing to an arbitrary number of dimensions other than the ones noted into the post. (even 2D for data viz, but may not be as useful since the embeddings are normalized) The embeddings aren't \"chopped off\", the first components of the embedding will change as dimensionality reduces, but not much. reply summarity 15 hours agoparent> dimensions to an arbitrary dimensionality is not a typical dimensionality reduction technique so that likely requires a special training/alignment technique that's novel Very basic techniques (e.g. SuperBit random projection) have been extremely effective with OpenAI embeddings in the past. E.g. all embeddings on findsight.ai are OpenAI Ada embeddings stored as SuperBit signatures with a code length of 10,000 (i.e. 157 integers each), and there's almost no recall loss compared to the full vectors. reply osmarks 14 hours agorootparenthttps://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Vector-codecs has some good things available too. reply brigadier132 14 hours agorootparentprevHow low in dimensions have you been able to go without significant recall loss? reply huac 14 hours agorootparentprevdo you construct an index over the superbit signatures to perform approximate search or do you perform exact search? reply summarity 13 hours agorootparentParallelised exact search, which is good enough because calculating the hamming similarity is just an XOR+POPCNT per vector component and an addition. But of course you could put this into an HNSW graph for approximate search for >10M vectors. Or do LSH first for even larger data sets. reply sjkoelle 12 hours agorootparentprevhow does this compare with PCA? reply lpasselin 15 hours agoparentprevMost of the leaderboard has much lower sequence length. reply moralestapia 15 hours agoparentprev>I've found evidence that the OpenAI 1536D embeddings are unnecessairly big for 99% Agree, I tried a few 384-dim models and they perform 95%+ as good, def. not worth the extra space. reply huac 14 hours agoparentprevcurious what the latency impact is to apply the dimensionality reduction... may hint at the specific technique they use reply ldjkfkdsjnv 15 hours agoparentprevThese benchmarks never tell the full story.

It's harder to judge embeddings quality. reply moralestapia 14 hours agorootparentprevHmm ... nah. GPT4 is still king but text-embedding-ada-002 is quite bad. reply anotherpaulg 13 hours agoprevToday, we are releasing an updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model, gpt-4-0125-preview. This model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task. The new GPT-4 Turbo is intended to reduce laziness. I'm updating aider's existing laziness benchmark now. EDIT: Preliminary results are up. Overall, the new `gpt-4-0125-preview` model does worse on the lazy coding benchmark as compared to the November `gpt-4-1106-preview` model. https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks-0125.html reply fakedang 1 hour agoparentI suspect that this has been underway a long time. GPT-4 today seems as good as GPT-3 was in 2022 for most text generation tasks. Lots of answers seem cached-in-memory in some form, then regurgitated and adjusted for different user queries - recent answers seem to follow a template, as compared to organic generation (which is also computationally expensive). I have a feeling they're purposely reducing the quality of the models, and possibly even relaunching older models as SOTA to show \"progress\". reply ComplexSystems 13 hours agoparentprevThanks!

The new large model now outputs a vector of double the size 3072. I believe PGVector only supports up to 2,000 dimensions for indexing, so that will be a problem. However, I see that they also support shortening embeddings. OpenAI says that the text-embedding-3-large w/ shortening to 1536 still outperforms the text-embedding-ada-002 model. So maybe I'll go that route first, and then hope that PGVector begins supporting vectors of size >3072. reply serjester 11 hours agoparentPGVector supports up to 16k dimensions although I imagine performance will be atrocious. reply te_chris 13 hours agoparentprevThere’s a small model option too. reply BeetleB 12 hours agoprevAm I the only one who hasn't had issues with laziness? I use only the API, not ChatGPT. I can't recall a time when the result produced was seriously incomplete. reply LeoPanthera 8 hours agoparentIt's rare, but I have. I switched to using Copilot for code editing. It's never lazy, but it's a little less clever. It's perfectly fine for small edits though. reply serjester 12 hours agoprevWhile the performance gains are exciting - I’m curious when they’ll release multi modal embeddings. So much information is tied up in tables and images which are so difficult to work with right now. You can hack around it with GPT4V but it’s always going to underperform something that was trained end to end. I’d also love to see the same support for fine tuning embeddings that they have for their LLM’s. I’m curious how that’d perform over their latest massive model. reply pizza 15 hours agoprevCurious what embedding compression technique they're using since it allows for dynamic dimensionality reduction. Or maybe they trained a different projection for each conceivable dim argument? reply isoprophlex 2 hours agoparentJust PCA the thing on a couple billion embeddings, store those coefficients (only ~3000 floats) and in the API, report the n components with the highest variance/eigenvalue? reply byefruit 15 hours agoparentprevProbably something similar to https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707 reply danielcampos93 13 hours agoparentprevProbably as simple as training the smaller model to approximate the larger model. Well studied and done via tinylm and minilm. reply teaearlgraycold 15 hours agoparentprevHonestly the answers to these questions are usually the most obvious thing. It could just be some basic dimensionality reduction technique precomputed for each input/output size combination. That’s still just a few thousand matrices. I’m sure they can handle the training and distribution of that set. reply extr 12 hours agoprevAnecdotally (N~1) it does seem like the new GPT-4 Turbo is less lazy. I cut out of a bunch of my system prompt which was designed to encourage full code gen and re-tried some previous examples: it now works completely fine without all the fluff about how I'll die if you don't complete this code, I'll tip you $200, I'll do anything you want, etc etc. reply anotherpaulg 12 hours agoparentMy testing on the older `gpt-4-1106-preview` model seemed to show that these sort of \"emotional appeals\" actually hurt GPT's coding performance. GPT-4 Turbo did 4-12% worse on the benchmarks when similar concepts were added to the prompt. https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html reply elashri 14 hours agoprev> This model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task Well that's good because the term \"lazy\" is a literal definition of what I can see GPT4 doing for the last couple of months. It would be a battle to get it actually to complete a task. Let's see how it improves. reply mikeortman 14 hours agoparentThis was the biggest win for me. One time asked ChatGPT if it could \"write python to convert a docx to pdf using any python package of your choosing\" and its response was a paragraph telling me doing so is difficult, followed by a python function, with just an inline comment //implement conversion here reply gregw134 13 hours agorootparentProbably better than hallucinating a wrong answer if it's stumped reply declaredapple 12 hours agorootparentNo it's not. It does (did?) this all the time to me generating tests. I know it _couldn't_ know the right answer because I didn't tell it all of the model and serializer schema's and all that. I don't care, because I know it is capable of generating very good guesses, and it is able to generate comprehensive tests, and I just need to tweak it to actually run. The problem is you have to shove it to even try. Refusing to make any attempt makes it useless. If it's truly stumped then it'll be pretty obvious (assuming you aren't using it blindly). reply 3pt14159 14 hours agoparentprevWhat do you use GPT4 for? The reason I ask is that ChatGPT is helping me debug docker files and a lot of the times I find really hard to Google answers there. Sometimes it waves me away but usually with promptings for more information to go on first. reply darkerside 14 hours agoparentprevI wonder if information workers are becoming more lazy in the mental context of hearing AI will take their jobs, and I wonder if this ironically ends up polluting the data set. reply LeoPanthera 14 hours agoprevI wish the moderation API was available for use outside of sending text to one of the GPTs. It's surprisingly accurate. reply bob_theslob646 7 hours agoparentMay you elaborate further please with an example. reply LeoPanthera 7 hours agorootparentOpenAI offers an API for checking strings to see if they are likely to contain violent, hate, or sexual content. https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation It's free, but you're only allowed to use it for checking ChatGPT inputs and outputs. It would be very useful on internet forums, social media, and the like. reply WiSaGaN 8 hours agoprevIt seems the \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\" mentioned in the blog is not available yet through API as of 01-26 01:18 UTC? Using it resulted \"The model `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` does not exist or you do not have access to it.\". It is not mentioned in API /models either. Although there is \"gpt-4-0125-preview\". reply LeoPanthera 8 hours agoparentThis is answered in the post you didn't read. \"Next week we are introducing...\" reply WiSaGaN 8 hours agorootparentMy bad! reply Lucasoato 13 hours agoprev> By default, data sent to the OpenAI API will not be used to train or improve OpenAI models. That’s some appreciated change from the previous policy, but still it just mentions the API, not the interactive web app. reply danielbln 12 hours agoparentThis has always been like this for the API. reply binarymax 15 hours agoprevFinally, a reasonable output dim size. 1536 was just nuts, and added 4x the cost of HNSW in RAM compared to something like the e5 small models at 384 dims. reply teaearlgraycold 8 hours agoparentYou can always do PCA on your end reply franky47 15 hours agoprevML noob here: what's the migration path from a set of embeddings made with model A to model B, if the source isn't available? reply vessenes 14 hours agoparentSadly, re-embed. Or if you're really, really stuck, you could take the source embeddings, some of the sources, get destination new embeddings, then train a small model to update. It's unlikely this will do anything but lower your quality compared to re-embedding everything. This lock in effect is one reason I've avoided using OpenAI's embedding models; at least if it's open source, you'll be able to embed everything on an open model you have control of. The idea of committing to a large datastore using embedding APIs makes me feel very uncomfortable. reply avereveard 14 hours agoparentprevSame technique as for mixed password hashing, you store the embedding model name and encode and search per each model stored, until the multiple embedding cost at search time become larger than embedding the old data again in the new for.

Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the probe's solar batteries made it hard at first to figure out whether the probe landed in the target zone. While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). Improved accuracy would give scientists access to more of the moon, since probes could be placed nearer to obstacles. One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned. A pair of autonomous probes released by SLIM before touchtown sent back images of the box-shaped vehicle on the surface, although it appeared to be upside down. After a few days of data analysis, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA determined that the spacecraft landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, in between two craters near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rock.

Officials said there is still hope the probe will be able to recharge when the moon enters its daytime in the coming days. JAXA project manager Shinichiro Sakai said the images sent back were just like those he'd imagined and seen in computer renderings. \"Something we designed traveled all the way to the moon and took that snapshot. I almost fell down when I saw it,\" he said. For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a \"perfect score.\" \"We demonstrated that we can land where we want,\" Sakai said. \"We opened a door to a new era.\" LEV-1, a hopping robot equipped with an antenna and a camera, was tasked with recording SLIM's landing and transmitting images back to Earth. LEV-2 is a baseball-sized rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy Co. and Doshisha University.

Daichi Hirano, a JAXA scientist who designed LEV-2, also known as Sora-Q, said it selected images containing SLIM and nearby lunar surface and transmitted the images through LEV-1, making the pair the world's first to achieve the mission. Despite the rush, the probes captured and transmitted 275 images. Japan followed the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India to reach the moon's surface. The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA. JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.

SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25. Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March. © 2024 The Associated Press.

Lunar gravity is 1/6th of Earth so landers can take it. After ejected they both circle around and look for the mothership autonomously, and in this instance the wheeled LEV-2 rover found what it believes to be the ship and the hopper LEV-1 rover relayed the thumbnail back to Earth via direct downlink. reply sandworm101 6 hours agorootparentprevLunar gravity. Possibly landing in sand/dust. It wouldn't be much of an impact, like dropping you cellphone a foot onto a thick carpet. Most any small metal object would be fine. reply FearNotDaniel 2 hours agorootparentprevApparently there is an HN rule stating that we should never ask a commenter whether or not they have read the article posted. I respect that rule, it's there for a reason to prevent snark and all sorts of flamebait that can turn a forum toxic. However, for the sake of encouraging thoughtful and constructive discussion I am going to politely point out that the answer to that question was to be found in both the original article posted and the BBC story subsequently linked in the parent comment. reply sandworm101 6 hours agorootparentprevCorrect. The rendering is the second, more perfect, image. reply HarHarVeryFunny 19 hours agoprevI wonder if they had accelerometers recording exactly what happened as it touched down and ended up on it's back? It was meant to use a rather odd \"two-step\" landing procedure where it first touches down on the lunar surface on it's rear/primary landing gear, then pivots forward/falls under gravity to also touch down on the front/secondary landing gear. Presumably this landing procedure was simulated under lunar gravity, but it seems there are multiple potential failure modes: 1) After rear \"leg\" touchdown, over-rotate forwards over front leg (ending up on back), OR 2) After front \"leg\" touchdown, bounce/recoil backwards off front leg, flipping onto back, OR 3) Front landing gear hits rock on one side (left or right), thereby flipping it sideways onto back The whole procedure seems to rely not only on having correctly simulated under lunar gravity (and with correctly simulated stiffness of the vehicle) to avoid scenarios 1) & 2) (which would be different under earth gravity), but also the softness of the landing site being uniform and as simulated - otherwise if landing site surface was harder (rock) or softer than expected, or uneven, then this type of pivot and bounce/not landing would not go as planned. NASA seems to have done a better job in designing fool-proof landing mechanisms, from the bouncing ball of the first mars rover, to the sky-crane landing of the latest one (which appears over-complicated, but no doubt was chosen at least in part because it is in fact more predictable than the alternatives). reply jvanderbot 16 hours agoparentThe two-step sounds precisely like how all forward-moving aircraft land: Rear touch first. The alternative (front touch first) is dangerous for reasons any BMX biker could explain: You're much more sensitive to pitching forward from forward-of-gravity friction. I wouldn't read too much into that choice. More likely the velocity was a tad too high. reply HarHarVeryFunny 16 hours agorootparentBut for a propulsive landing, why would they want to have forward velocity at all, unless by design for this type of landing ? I'd have thought the preference would be to kill forward speed and land vertically. reply phh 16 hours agorootparentAs an experienced KSP crasher, you never completely cancel horizontal component, so you need a way to dissipate it. And it's easier to dissipate if you know which direction your horizontal component is, which is easier to do when its value isn't so close to 0. That being said I perfectly see how sub-ms automated command could make what I said wrong. reply numpad0 16 hours agorootparentprevOne of two main engines blew off at ~50m and the craft was essentially in a cross-wind landing, likely without de-crab. Having lateral velocity wasn't a part of the plan. reply mutagen 15 hours agorootparentThe engine loss was a detail in the article that I hadn't seen anywhere else in the commentary and speculation on the landing. Even now many commenters don't seem to be taking this into account. Even if there was redundancy built in, an engine loss makes things much more difficult. I can see why they're claiming 100% success despite being upside down. reply autoexec 11 hours agorootparentprev> The two-step sounds precisely like how all forward-moving aircraft land: Rear touch first. The alternative (front touch first) is dangerous That's why I was never comfortable stopping in rollerskates or ice stakes. reply wharvle 11 hours agorootparentI never understood why those use front-brakes instead of rear-brakes like the roller blades I had as a kid. The latter I could comfortably use almost instantly, the former, I never got comfortable with. reply gazook89 7 hours agorootparentI assume that you just drag the tip of one skate behind you, rolling on the other until you lose momentum. And having the ability to suddenly stop is akin to ice figure skates, with the pointy bits at front. reply titzer 13 hours agoparentprevFTA: > One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned. When I first heard that they might have landed upside down, a part of me felt a pang of indignation and condescension, for about ten seconds. But I kept my mouth shut and realized these things are hard and something I didn't think of in the ten seconds as an armchair lander-designer might have occurred. I found the tone of your comment pretty condescending, tbh. Hot landing is hot landing, and you're just speculating as a layman without any insight into their design and decision-making process. \"Not simulating lunary gravity correctly.\" Like c'mon, that's just an insult to their intelligence. reply HarHarVeryFunny 10 hours agorootparentWell, I did also mention stiffness which would relate to how much of a shock absorber effect there would be - preventing a bounce, so if they came in hard, that may indeed have been a factor. Maybe more to the point, it seems to be a fairly unforgiving mode of landing - maybe a NASA \"bouncing ball\" landing would have absorbed the harder landing without issue ? reply nerdponx 13 hours agoparentprev> \"An abnormality in the main engine affected the landing attitude of the spacecraft,\" the Japanese space agency Jaxa said in a statement.

Something like the mechanical arms you see in Robot Wars. reply mecsred 16 hours agorootparentMechanisms weigh a significant amount, long mechanisms like arms even more so. The more mass you spend on contingencies the less science you bring and the less valuable the mission is, even with a flawless touchdown. reply anigbrowl 10 hours agorootparentIf you can't land reliably, then a lot of the science is wasted. On the other hand, once you reliably solve the landing issue (which was one of the main objectives here, and where they made significant progress in that they successfully deployed the two mini rovers anyway), you can add on as much science as you want. Also I've said before and will say it again, the moon is not far away. Unlike Mars and other celestial bodies where we have to time launches around orbital positions, gravitational slingshots and such, the moon is really close by, and we should be lofting stuff onto it on a monthly basis. reply johnwalkr 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd it's all a moot point if you're too heavy or complicated to fly in the first place. reply blisterpeanuts 12 hours agorootparentprevGood point, but I wonder if some of the attitudinal jets could be employed to push it upright, assuming there's any fuel left (and power). reply mecsred 10 hours agorootparentNeat idea, I'm not sure how much force those jets produce, maybe it could be enough? It might be risky to fire up jets after a botched landing though. If the nozzle has any material in it I'd be worried about blowing a hole in the lander! reply anigbrowl 10 hours agoparentprevIt's big vindication for the bouncing ball approach. On the other hand the proximity of the moon makes it much more practical to field crude designs on a more frequent basis, or to put parts in orbit and assemble them into something more ship-like. reply johnwalkr 7 hours agorootparent>It's big vindication for the bouncing ball approach Not really, it's only been used for a few Mars missions, and not recently. For lunar missions you don't have the benefit of aerobraking, so you have to use so much fuel to slow down already, the math doesn't work out to use airbags at the last step. reply smeej 18 hours agoprev> For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a \"perfect score.\" I get being really, really proud of what you accomplished here, but...perfect?

But in practice, the team is confident it landed within 10m, which is pretty darn good. On the context of the \"perfect score\", they initially gave themselves a 60 out of 100 score during their first press conference after the landing, and today a member of the audience explicitely asked them to revise that score knowing what we know now. The speaker made the point that achieving that much of precision is just ground breaking and will completely change how we frame the \"where do we land\" question from now on,so giving it a perfect score is I think legit. reply csa 17 hours agoparentprev> but...perfect? Really? You can't think of anything that maybe could have gone better? The context of the comment in the article referred to the “pinpoint landing” aspect of the landing. They narrowed down the landing range from 10,000m (10k) to 100m… two orders of magnitude. From the the article, emphasis mine: > For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a \"perfect score.\" > \"We demonstrated that we can land where we want,\" Sakai said. \"We opened a door to a new era.\" I don’t know if this comment was made in English or Japanese, but I could see how a very specific comment about the pinpoint aspect of the landing in Japanese could be vague when translated into English. I don’t think anyone is disillusioned enough to think the overall landing was perfect. reply mathrawka 14 hours agorootparentActually Japanese quote from the Project Manager, Sakai-san, is: > いろんな意味で新しい扉が開き、今後、これまでできなかったようなミッションができるようになるのでは。そこが一番の意義ではないか I'm far from a translator... but it is not \"We opened a door\" but \"A door is open to do missions that were not possible before\". And he says that might be the most important takeaway from this project. https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/08a8bfdd7a41486140a97a8570... reply lmm 12 hours agorootparent> I'm far from a translator... but it is not \"We opened a door\" but \"A door is open to do missions that were not possible before\". You're being overly literal. Omitting the subject is normal in Japanese; translating that to a passive-voiced sentence in English is usually misleading. reply atahanacar 8 hours agorootparentprev>Opening a new door in many senses (or \"in different ways\" if you want to take some liberty), from now on, missions that couldn't be done until now will become possible. Isn't it the most important (thing)? Translation for those wondering. reply smeej 16 hours agorootparentprevI think I was including \"landing\" in the relevant part of \"pinpoint landing,\" not just the pinpoint element, which was what made it amusing. It did (apparently) \"land\" and not \"crash\" (or at least that's what I'm assuming from the fact that it isn't crushed/doesn't look like it made primary impact on some part that was not intended for impact), but \"landing and falling over\" doesn't normally earns a perfect score in any other common context. reply johnwalkr 7 hours agorootparentI work in the industry and \"pinpoint landing\" refers to the accuracy part. If he was talking about landing in general, the sentence would be something like \"the landing didn't go as expected, but we achieved a pinpoint landing\". reply cesaref 18 hours agoparentprevIf you can walk away from a landing, it's a good landing. If you use the airplane the next day, it's an outstanding landing. Chuck Yeager reply Fatnino 16 hours agorootparentWell this one isnt being reused. But the passenger payloads deployed correctly, so we'll count that as walking away. reply coryfklein 13 hours agoparentprevIt's possible that the \"minimum success criteria\" or \"primary objective\" of the mission was to touch down intact within a radius. If that was achieved, then I think even in English it is reasonable to call the landing \"perfect\" in that it achieved all of the mission goals. But that all depends on whether, \"land upright and measure things with the expensive instruments we sent it with\" was originally included as a primary objective and whether they've just moved the goal posts to minimize the appearance of the failure. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentWe seem to be losing the definition of words. From \"perfect phone calls\" to \"perfect landings\" just feels like moving the goal posts. Let's tone down the rhetoric a bit. A very successful landing. sure. Met all of the necessary goals even if wasn't as designed. sure. Perfect landing. Let's not be silly reply smeej 8 hours agorootparentprevI can see talking yourself into that definition, but any 4-year-old can look at that picture and tell you it didn't land perfectly. \"No, silly!

OTOH, in defense of the PM, the lander showed exceptional robustness against loss of an engine, so he'd have a reason to be proud of an explosionless landing. reply smeej 17 hours agorootparentOh definitely not saying they shouldn't be proud. I'm intensely impressed, and they should be extremely proud. It was just the juxtaposition of \"perfect\" with the picture of the thing upsidedown that made me laugh. \"Near-perfect\" I'll happily grant. Same with \"impressive as all get-out.\" But \"perfect\" made me chuckle. reply numpad0 17 hours agorootparentYes, it dooooes feel a bit of stretch to call it a perfect or successful landing with the head stuck in sand, undoubtedly... reply coldpie 17 hours agorootparentprev> 63 points, with 60 for the landing and bonus 1 point each for scientific camera and two payload probes S rank!

Is Moon's gravity strong enough to cause damage to solar panels or antennas if probe tips? reply bell-cot 7 hours agoparentIANARS (...not a rocket scientist), but the maximum thrust needed to rotate the lander, during decent (frictionless free-fall), would be rather low. Vs. the minimum thrust needed to turn it over, against lunar gravity would be far higher. And, after a hard landing, the RCS system may be damaged - so attempting to use it might result in a RUD event.

Even outside of the realm of global industries like cars you’ll find English words and phrases being used to brand everyday local products all over the place. Japan is far more full of English writing than the Anglosphere is of Japanese…or any other language.

    "originBody": "We build X.509 chains so you don’t have to Post January 25, 2024 Leave a comment By William Woodruff For the past eight months, Trail of Bits has worked with the Python Cryptographic Authority to build cryptography-x509-verification, a brand-new, pure-Rust implementation of the X.509 path validation algorithm that TLS and other encryption and authentication protocols are built on. Our implementation is fast, standards-conforming, and memory-safe, giving the Python ecosystem a modern alternative to OpenSSL’s misuse- and vulnerability-prone X.509 APIs for HTTPS certificate verification, among other protocols. This is a foundational security improvement that will benefit every Python network programmer and, consequently, the internet as a whole. Our implementation has been exposed as a Python API and is included in Cryptography’s 42.0.0 release series, meaning that Python developers can take advantage of it today! Here’s an example usage, demonstrating its interaction with certifi as a root CA bundle: As part of our design we also developed x509-limbo, a test vector and harness suite for evaluating the standards conformance and consistent behavior of various X.509 path validation implementations. x509-limbo is permissively licensed and reusable, and has already found validation differentials across Go’s crypto/x509, OpenSSL, and two popular pre-existing Rust X.509 validators. X.509 path validation X.509 and path validation are both too expansive to reasonably summarize in a single post. Instead, we’ll grossly oversimplify X.509 to two basic facts: X.509 is a certificate format: it binds a public key and some metadata for that key (what it can be used for, the subject it identifies) to a signature, which is produced by a private key. The subject of a certificate can be a domain name, or some other relevant identifier. Verifying an X.509 certificate entails obtaining the public key for its signature, using that public key to check the signature, and (finally) validating the associated metadata against a set of validity rules (sometimes called an X.509 profile). In the context of the public web, there are two profiles that matter: RFC 5280 and the CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements (“CABF BRs”). These two facts make X.509 certificates chainable: an X.509 certificate’s signature can be verified by finding the parent certificate containing the appropriate public key; the parent, in turn, has its own parent. This chain building process continues until an a priori trusted certificate is encountered, typically because of trust asserted in the host OS itself (which maintains a pre-configured set of trusted certificates). Chain building (also called “path validation”) is the cornerstone of TLS’s authentication guarantees: it allows a web server (like x509-limbo.com) to serve an untrusted “leaf” certificate along with zero or more untrusted parents (called intermediates), which must ultimately chain to a root certificate that the connecting client already knows and trusts. As a visualization, here is a valid certificate chain for x509-limbo.com, with arrows representing the “signed by” relationship: In this scenario, x509-limbo.com serves us two initially untrusted certificates: the leaf certificate for x509-limbo.com itself, along with an intermediate (Let’s Encrypt R3) that signs for the leaf. The intermediate in turn is signed for by a root certificate (ISRG Root X1) that’s already trusted (by virtue of being in our OS or runtime trust store), giving us confidence in the complete chain, and thus the leaf’s public key for the purposes of TLS session initiation. What can go wrong? The above explanation of X.509 and path validation paints a bucolic picture: to build the chain, we simply iterate through our parent candidates at each step, terminating on success once we reach a root of trust or with failure upon exhausting all candidates. Simple, right? Unfortunately, the reality is far messier: The abstraction above (“one certificate, one public key”) is a gross oversimplification. In reality, a single public key (corresponding to a single “logical” issuing authority) may have multiple “physical” certificates, for cross-issuance purposes. Because the trusted set is defined by the host OS or language runtime, there is no “one true” chain for a given leaf certificate. In reality, most (leaf, [intermediates]) tuples have several candidate solutions, of which any is a valid chain. This is the “why” for the first bullet: a web server can’t guarantee that any particular client has any particular set of trusted roots, so intermediate issuers typically have multiple certificates for a single public key to maximize the likelihood of a successfully built chain. Not all certificates are made equal: certificates (including different “physical” certificates for the same “logical” issuing authority) can contain constraints that prevent otherwise valid paths: name restrictions, overall length restrictions, usage restrictions, and so forth. In other words, a correct path building implementation must be able to backtrack after encountering a constraint that eliminates the current candidate chain. The X.509 profile itself can impose constraints on both the overall chain and its constituent members: the CABF BRs, for example, forbid known-weak signature algorithms and public key types, and many path validation libraries additionally allow users to constrain valid chain constructions below a configurable maximum length. In practice, these (non-exhaustive) complications mean that our simple recursive linear scan for chain building is really a depth-first graph search with both static and dynamic constraints. Failing to treat it as such has catastrophic consequences: Failing to implement a dynamic search typically results in overly conservative chain constructions, sometimes with Internet-breaking outcomes. OpenSSL 1.0.x’s inability to build the “chain of pain” in 2020 is one recent example of this. Failing to honor the interior constraints and profile-wide certificate requirements can result in overly permissive chain constructions. CVE-2021-3450 is one recent example of this, causing some configurations of OpenSSL 1.1.x to accept chains built with non-CA certificates. Consequently, building both correct and maximal (in the sense of finding any valid chain) X.509 path validator is of the utmost importance, both for availability and security. Quirks, surprises, and ambiguities Despite underpinning the Web PKI and other critical pieces of Internet infrastructure, there are relatively few independent implementations of X.509 path validation: most platforms and languages reuse one of a small handful of common implementations (OpenSSL and its forks, NSS, Go’s crypto/x509, GnuTLS, etc.) or the host OS’s implementation (CryptoAPI on Windows, Security on macOS). This manifests as a few recurring quirks and ambiguities: A lack of implementation diversity means that mistakes and design decisions (such as overly or insufficiently conservative profile checks) leak into other implementations: users complain when a PKI deployment that was only tested on OpenSSL fails to work against crypto/x509, so implementations frequently bend their specification adherence to accommodate real-world certificates. The specifications often mandate surprising behavior that (virtually) no client implements correctly. RFC 5280, for example, stipulates that path length and name constraints do not apply to self-issued intermediates, but this is widely ignored in practice. Because the specifications themselves are so infrequently interpreted, they contain still-unresolved ambiguities: treating roots as “trust anchors” versus policy-bearing certificates, handling of serial numbers that are 20 bytes long but DER-encoded with 21 bytes, and so forth. Our implementation needed to handle each of these families of quirks. To do so consistently, we leaned on three basic strategies: Test first, then implement: To give ourselves confidence in our designs, we built x509-limbo and pre-validated it against other implementations. This gave us both a coverage baseline for our own implementation, and empirical justification for relaxing various policy-level checks, where necessary. Keep everything in Rust: Rust’s performance, strong type system and safety properties meant that we could make rapid iterations to our design while focusing on algorithmic correctness rather than memory safety. It certainly didn’t hurt that PyCA Cryptography’s X.509 parsing is already done in Rust, of course. Obey Sleevi’s Laws: Our implementation treats path construction and path validation as a single unified step with no “one” true chain, meaning that the entire graph is always searched before giving up and returning a failure to the user. Compromise where necessary: As mentioned above, implementations frequently maintain compatibility with OpenSSL, even where doing so violates the profiles defined in RFC 5280 and the CABF BRs. This situation has improved dramatically over the years (and improvements have accelerated in pace, as certificate issuance periods have shortened on the Web PKI), but some compromises are still necessary. Looking forward Our initial implementation is production-ready, and comes in at around 2,500 lines of Rust, not counting the relatively small Python-only API surfaces or x509-limbo: From here, there’s much that could be done. Some ideas we have include: Expose APIs for client certificate path validation. To expedite things, we’ve focused the initial implementation on server validation (verifying that a leaf certificate attesting to a specific DNS name or IP address chains up to a root of trust). This ignores client validation, wherein the client side of a connection presents its own certificate for the server to verify against a set of known principals. Client path validation shares the same fundamental chain building algorithm as server validation, but has a slightly different ideal public API (since the client’s identity needs to be matched against a potentially arbitrary number of identities known to the server). Expose different X.509 profiles (and more configuration knobs). The current APIs expose very little configuration; the only things a user of the Python API can change are the certificate subject, the validation time, and the maximum chain depth. Going forward, we’ll look into exposing additional knobs, including pieces of state that will allow users to perform verifications with the RFC 5280 certificate profile and other common profiles (like Microsoft’s Authenticode profile). Long term, this will help bespoke (such as corporate) PKI use cases to migrate to Cryptography’s X.509 APIs and lessen their dependency on OpenSSL. Carcinize existing C and C++ X.509 users. One of Rust’s greatest strengths is its native, zero-cost compatibility with C and C++. Given that C and C++ implementations of X.509 and path validation have historically been significant sources of exploitable memory corruption bugs, we believe that a thin “native” wrapper around cryptography-x509-verification could have an outsized positive impact on the security of major C and C++ codebases. Spread the gospel of x509-limbo. x509-limbo was an instrumental component in our ability to confidently ship an X.509 path validator. We’ve written it in such a way that should make integration into other path validation implementations as simple as downloading and consuming a single JSON file. We look forward to helping other implementations (such as rustls-webpki) integrate it directly into their own testing regimens! If any of these ideas interests you (or you have any of your own), please get in touch!

Having a large suite of well documented test vectors, including both positive and negative examples, raises the bar for the entire ecosystem. Go and OpenSSL are mentioned, but any other environment implementing X.509 now has another very well developed test suite that can be plugged in directly. While I'm a huge fan of formal methods for developing secure code, IMHO well developed suites such as x509-limbo[1] with common, good, problematic, and outright sadistically wrong vectors are the way forward for developing robust cross platform protocols. These are the kinds of unit tests a spec should come with. [1] https://x509-limbo.com reply ivanr 14 hours agoparentAgreed. I don't see NIST's test suites [1] on the list, though.

I looked at NIST's PKITS while building the test suite.

We instead chose to integrate the BetterTLS suite[1] (warning: very large page) for the MVP.

This could be game-changing for a lot of open source software. I spent years avoiding X.509 (and ASN.1, for that matter) in my designs because every time someone I trust poked it, a remotely exploitable bug fell out. Most often, it was a Denial of Service issue rather than Remote Code Execution. Moving to Rust would demonstrably improve the security of the entire Internet. You might be tempted to ask, \"What about BouncyCastle?\" (or similar queries). Sure, you're not overwriting the EIP in most Java X.509 bugs, but check the release notes for X.509 and ASN.1 mentions: https://www.bouncycastle.org/releasenotes.html When I worked for Amazon, we disclosed a few X.509-related vulnerabilities to projects that we almost found by accident. reply blibble 17 hours agoparenthow would rust fix most of those issues? they're logic bugs reply woodruffw 16 hours agorootparentThe \"classic\" example of this is enums as sum types, rather than a thin wrapper over an integral type: Rust makes it possible to construct in invalid enum variant, whereas plenty of C logic bugs stem from taking untrusted user input and converting it into an enum variant. My understanding is that Java doesn't allow this directly, but has adjacent historical deficiencies (e.g., not allowing exhaustive enumeration handling until recently). reply tob_scott_a 17 hours agorootparentprevwoodruffw already wrote an excellent comment for this question: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39131723 Rust isn't just memory-safety.

I speak to improvements, not panaceas. Until the end of last year, I was one of the security engineers that the s2n team at AWS consulted on potential security issues. You will never hear me say anything will magically fix all our problems. Especially with TLS. However, Rust does bring a lot to the table, so I feel I'm allowed to be excited about not reviewing another X.509 library written in C. reply woodruffw 16 hours agorootparentprevThis reasoning doesn't make sense. If TLS is astonishingly complex, which it is, then we absolutely want the strongest type system that can simultaneously represent its complexity and afford developer ergonomics. TLS's complexity is a good reason for types that reflect invariants, not a good reason to give up. reply blibble 16 hours agorootparentThis reasoning doesn't make sense. I didn't say it didn't help at all, I said I wouldn't expect it to make a significant improvement over Java (and it's hardly the strongest type system with \"developer ergonomics\") reply k8svet 16 hours agorootparentI'm not even that good at writing Rust and even I recognize that countless libs I'm using are written in a way, with Rust types, that prevent serious mis-use. In ways that would be infeasible and unergonomic in other languages, or require internal library invariant assertions that are prone to bugs. Sometimes the errors wind up being nasty, but I've also gotten better at trusting that the compiler is giving me helpful info, even if it's a huge message.

Rust cannot prevent all possible forms of denial of service, but there are plenty of underlying DoS causes that Rust either outright eliminates (such as memory corruption without further control) or mitigates through stronger types.

Thanks for maintaining such an awesome library btw, most of my internal PKI (X.509 and OpenSSH) is managed with it. It's a bliss to work with, even more so compared to other crypto libs. :) reply ak217 17 hours agoprevThis is an absolute game changer for the ability to write secure PKI-based software in Python. Before now, you had to use pyOpenSSL (ignoring its warning to not use it for anything other than an SSL connection) and avoid the many footguns associated with building the certificate chain on your own, or leave Python entirely and talk to a separate Rust or Go process. Thanks to Trail of Bits for pulling this off. reply flumpcakes 15 hours agoprevAren't revocations a pretty important part of certificates, considering the whole point of this is security? I don't understand the rationale for skipping. reply woodruffw 15 hours agoparentRevocations are a great idea. In practice, they're both operationally complicated and an unreliable source of truth about certificate validity. In practice, a lot of implementations (including Go's) simply ignore them. 'mcpherrim posted a comment below[1] with some additional information, including changes to the Web PKI and CRL distribution techniques that may eventually make them more useful. [1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39132430 reply ivanr 15 hours agorootparentAny chance you could expand on \"In practice, they're both operationally complicated and an unreliable source of truth about certificate validity.\"? reply woodruffw 14 hours agorootparentI'm thinking about CRL update windows: a lot of CAs run weekly updates, meaning that CRL changes don't propagate to end users for up to a week at a time. That's well into \"security theater\" territory for me, given that a compromised CA or EE only needs to fool me for a matter of seconds, once. reply ivanr 14 hours agorootparentSure, but then you can just use OCSP. If you care about privacy very much, support only stapled OCSP. CRL is better suited for \"high-volume\" exchanges, for example for a CA to publish all their revocations [so that a system such as CRLite can be built]. reply woodruffw 14 hours agorootparentThe comment I referenced before contains a talk by 'mcpherrim as well that explains OCSP stapling's own deficiencies. I think we all want a good solution here. But none of the currently widely deployed ones are that. reply ivanr 14 hours agorootparentI am sorry, I can't watch someone else's talk to understand what you mean. If you're willing to engage in a conversation, could you say here what you think the problems with OCSP are? (If you're not, just ignore me.) As I see it, the main problem is that browsers don't want to do OCSP any more. Sure, we have a problem with how stapling is implemented in _some_ popular platforms (but not Caddy—hi Matt), but today maybe even those are fixed. The main problem IMO is that browsers won't support must-staple. In the interest of full transparency, I have a pet peeve about people saying revocation doesn't work. I appreciate that that's the current reality, but—again—only because browsers choose not to implement it. Things would change overnight if Chrome (obviously) changed their stance. reply woodruffw 13 hours agorootparentSure! I'm happy to discuss, my reason for referencing the video is because I think 'mcpherrim explains this stuff better than I do :-). My understanding is that the primary concerns with OCSP (meaning non-stapled OCSP) are that it (1) leaks end user intent to CAs, such as sites being visited, and (2) in its original form with no transport security, it is no stronger than the adversary that it needs to protect TLS/the Web PKI against (i.e., any network adversary can block the OCSP request and everything will fail open). OCSP stapling avoids both of those concerns, but requires web server and other stack changes that are not on the \"enforcement\" path in the way that CAs and other \"direct\" parts of the PKI are. The talk infers that this is why OCSP adoption has been so sluggish (which I didn't realize was the case before). FWIW, I'm sorry if I came across as dogmatic here -- revocation is conceptually important, and I think it'd be great if we ended up in a Web PKI where revocation was more effective. But I can also see why browsers have fumbled and/or dragged their feet on the CRLs and OCSP for so long. reply ivanr 13 hours agorootparentYes, agreed on the primary problem with \"classic\" OCSP. OCSP stapling and must-staple (for the benefit of other readers: a flag that's set on a certificate to indicate that it's only valid with an attached—stapled—fresh OCSP response) solves that. When must-staple initially came out, it came to light that web servers viewed OCSP stapling as a performance optimisation. When viewed from this perspective, it's not necessary to staple 100% correctly; if you don't, clients just go to the CA directly. Unfortunately, this breaks apart with must-staple and clients who refuse to talk to Cash for privacy reasons. Browsers refused to enforce must-staple because that would mean broken web sites and they didn't want to be blamed for it. As a result, web servers didn't have an incentive to fix their broken OCSP stapling implementations. There's also some politics involved. Browsers don't actually want CAs to be able to revoke certificates for reasons other than security. Think one government pressuring a CA in their country to revoke a certificate of an entity outside the country, for political reasons. (EDIT I don't really support this argument. Any organisation that cares about their availability should always have two active certificates from difference CAs. There's a variety of CA jurisdictions to choose from as well.) I don't like these long discussion chains as much as the next guy, but there's a lot of nuance and history when it comes to certificate revocation, and I sometimes take the opportunity to gently question people's beliefs. The line \"revocation doesn't work\" is very often repeated and technically it's not wrong, but I think it's important for people to understand how we got here. reply ak217 14 hours agorootparentprev[Not OP] CRL/OCSP (which are the only revocation mechanisms close to being generally used standards today) require either online verification (which is unsuitable or unsafe for many applications) or CRL distribution with CA trust root bundles, which is always in danger of being stale. You can read more in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list#Pr..., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Prot... Revocation in PKI is a hard problem that exposes a fundamental tradeoff between time to revoke and privacy/offline capability. reply ivanr 14 hours agorootparentNot quite. OCSP responses can be stapled to TLS handshakes to provide fresh revocation information. Online is needed if you want 100% fresh information, of course. reply ak217 14 hours agorootparentPKI uses are not limited to TLS, and TLS uses are not limited to those where revocation information is readily accessible (due to proxying/distribution/compartmentalization/federation constraints). There is a variety of signature standards and protocols out there that rely on PKI to manage trust, and whose users are not at all keen on calling an untrusted URL to check an intermediate cert. reply ivanr 14 hours agorootparentThat's a fair point [PKI without TLS], but I'd argue that 99.9% of situations will be with TLS. Thus supporting revocation can provide value for those. Out of curiosity, what without-TLS use cases do you have in mind? reply ak217 14 hours agorootparentMost SSO runs on SAML, which uses XML Signature, which uses PKI certificate chains without TLS. Even if you think all SSO will migrate to OIDC, the EU has enacted laws around electronic signatures that basically enshrine the use of XML Signature (with all its problems) for the foreseeable future. A lot of countries beyond the EU (many LatAm countries, for example) have followed suit. There are other signature protocols that use certificate chains as well, and devices and networks that should not be making network calls when validating such signatures. And as I mentioned, TLS uses are not limited to those where revocation information is readily accessible. reply e12e 17 hours agoprevFantastic! Curious about revocations though - the post doesn't mention it? reply woodruffw 17 hours agoparentThanks for calling this out. Revocations are not currently supported by the public API; we made a decision early in the MVP planning process to exclude them for complexity reasons. (This is consistent with Go's crypto/x509, which does not do revocation checking as part of the `Verify` API.) reply ivanr 17 hours agorootparentDo you think that it's possible to implement a good path building algorithm without support for revocation? For example, without revocation checking you may select a chain with a revoked certificate in it, only to discover that later. Then what? :) On the other hand, if you check the revocation status as part of the process, you can pivot to another certificate. reply woodruffw 17 hours agorootparentI think so -- I would consider crypto/x509's implementation good, and they similarly don't support revocation. More bluntly: it's not clear that revocation really works at all in the Web PKI; I've heard it described more as \"homeopathic\" than an actual security mechanism. What makes a path building implementation good is (IMO) its adherence to the rules Ryan Sleevi enumerates[1]: as long as you conceptualize the path building process as a dynamic search problem rather than a static one with a \"single\" result, any implementation you build will probably have the right \"primitives\" for future constraints (like revocations). [1]: https://medium.com/@sleevi_/path-building-vs-path-verifying-... reply mcpherrinm 16 hours agorootparentI recently gave a talk on this topic (sorry, haven't written as a blog post yet) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TbtL73ibh0 I do believe revocation in the webpki is important to implement, but it's not great today. There are two promising paths forward, which are complementary: The simple option is short-lived certificates (7 days), which essentially don't require revocation as that's the timeline existing revocation technology can revoke on, but that has some adoption hurdles to overcome in the future. The other solution is what Mozilla is doing with CRLite: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/09/crlite-part-1-a... They are collecting all CRLs from all public web CAs and producing a small, compressed representation of all revoked certificates. That can be pushed to clients, so there's no need for any network traffic (like OCSP checks or CRL downloads) to the wide variety of CAs in the ecosystem. These \"CRL Compact and Push\" solutions benefit from shorter-lived certificates (eg, 90 days like Let's Encrypt does right now) because the set of revoked certs is smaller as they roll off once they expire. I suspect platform verifiers like on Windows and Mac will hopefully ship something like this in the future, though they already have CRL and OCSP fetching and caching. Non-platform verifiers like this one are really the hardest part to solve revocation. I would suggest supporting CRL checks, but that requires having disk space and caching infrastructure, which is hard for a library to know how to do universally. I think the answer is that we need to have most of our software outsource to a platform verifier, or at least some sort of system-wide revocation information cache or daemon. Maybe this means a new systemd component on Linux :) reply ivanr 15 hours agorootparentThere is also the third option, via must-staple, where OCSP responses are attached to the TLS handshake. This resolves the privacy issue [because otherwise clients have to talk directly to CAs and reveal what sites they're visiting]. All (big) browsers have mechanisms functionally similar to CRLite. Apple has \"valid\" (not sure if that's the official name) and Google has CRLSets. reply mcpherrinm 13 hours agorootparentGoogle's CRLSets don't cover nearly the full set of revocations (AFAIK). I don't know the details of how \"valid\" works, but as the Apple root program has recently required CAs to publish full CRLs, I assume they're planning something similar. I mostly cite CRLite as it's well-documented. I don't think OCSP must-staple is deployable. It requires code changes to effectively every webserver in the world, and that doesn't seem to be happening. I think it is stuck in a spiral of non-adoption, where there's no incentive for anyone to make progress. I believe short-lived certs (7 days) are more deployable in the ecosystem today than ocsp must-staple, with similar security properties. Certificate automation is already desirable, and it's not as big a leap once flows are automated. This isn't going to happen overnight at least. Years, probably many. But it's happening. reply ivanr 12 hours agorootparentI think you're right about CRLSets. IMO, Mozilla really wanted to solve the problem, whereas Chrome just wanted to have a solution that they could use for emergency revocation of certificates of high-profile sites (and intermediates/roots). Small-time sites won't be in CRLSets, although if you know the right people and make enough noise you may be added to their list. As for Apple, no one knows what's going on because they don't like to share :) OCSP must-staple doesn't require code changes. It's a \"flag\" you set on a certificate. Maybe what you mean is that OCSP stapling is not enabled by default on many installations, and that's true. IIS got it right, and Caddy (obviously, the only platform that got everything right). Again, we're in this place only because browsers don't care about revocation. If they pushed for it, things would fall into place very quickly. But they're going in the opposite direction. Short-lived certificates are great, assuming you're fine with a 3.5 day (on average) window of opportunity for exploitation. There's a potentially major problem with clock skew, as many clients have inaccurate clocks. Personally, I recommend that certificates are obtained at least a week before they're deployed; a month would be better. Then rotated a month before they expire. That's how you minimise the problems due to clock skew. reply agwa 10 hours agorootparentApple shared the details of valid.apple.com in a WWDC talk: https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2017/701jvytn... Slides: https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2017/701jvytn... You can also find the client-side code if you dig around under https://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/ It aims to cover all certificates, similar to Mozilla's CRLite. reply e12e 12 hours agorootparentprevAs far as I can figure out, most ocsp staples are valid for 7 days, so short lived certificates would be equivalent, but simpler? reply ivanr 11 hours agorootparentIndeed, you're right. Must-staple and short-lived certificates have the same problem with clock skew. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentprev\"The spiral of non-adoption\" is an interesting blog post someone should write. I bet there are a couple more examples besides the obvious one. reply pvg 8 hours agorootparentIt could also be a festival/performance site for unadopted technologies. Sunday, Sunday, key signing ceremony at Non-adoption Spiral! reply ivanr 15 hours agorootparentprevExactly. Because you currently don't check for revocation, you may end up selecting a path that's a dead end and you won't be able to recover. However, if your implementation has pluggable [dynamic] constraints, once you add support for revocation, it will work optimally. You can run into the same problem with any other constraint, for example hash function deprecation, CA block, and so on. Aside: Revocation works just fine, it's just that browsers decided not to implement it. reply woodruffw 15 hours agorootparentI don't think pluggability is the important thing here: a good path building implementation doesn't need to be pluggable to handle dynamic constraints correctly. More precisely: a \"dead path\" is only a problem if it somehow excludes otherwise present valid paths, which is not an issue if you chose to not support CRLs at all (you might accept revoked paths, but you certainly won't exclude non-revoked ones). One of the problems with X.509 PKIs is that you can make them fractally complex; every implementation ends up setting its own \"I give up, doing this is too painful\" point. CRLs are a common \"give up\" point, and that probably won't change until CRLite or similar changes things here. (AIA chasing and OCSP lookups are also similar pain points.) reply ivanr 15 hours agorootparentWell, yes. If you choose to ignore revocation entirely, you will never have a dead path because of it. That will happen only if you path-build, then check revocation as two steps. (IIRC, Windows used to do this, or is still doing it.) IMO, a good path building implementation has to support revocation, but that's for another conversation :) reply colechristensen 17 hours agorootparentprevNot planned for MVP or not planned ever? reply woodruffw 17 hours agorootparentNot planned for the MVP, but not necessarily excluded in the future. I think it'd require a substantial design period, but that's my impression as an external contributor. reply kachnuv_ocasek 17 hours agoparentprevThat's a whole another can of worms. reply RustyRussell 9 hours agoprevThis looks great! I wanted to bundle a chain of certs, check that the leaf wasand its key signed , and that the bundle provided a path to a locally-trusted root. This allows third-party serving of signed data, rather than having to trade your IP address for validation. Doing so with existing tools was so terrible that I was pretty sure my result was grossly insecure :( I look forward to the promised lower-level APIs! reply hlieberman 17 hours agoprevI'm curious -- what was the inputs to the decision to redo the logic from scratch, rather than wrap something like the `webpki` crate? reply woodruffw 17 hours agoparentThis is a great question! The answer is twofold: 1. Compatibility: PyCA Cryptography has strict compatibility requirements, including being able to build with older versions of Rust that crates like webpki and rustls-webpki may not be interested in supporting. 2. Generality: PyCA Cryptography is a general purpose cryptographic toolbox, and the plan for X.509 validation is not intrinsically linked to just the Web PKI profiles. In the future, they may wish to make their APIs more flexible than a strictly CABF validator would require, meaning that they would either need to carry patches against `webpki` or get such flexibility upstreamed (to the detriment of the crate's single purpose). (I am not a maintainer of Cryptography; this is my understanding of the reasons as one of the implementors of this feature.) reply ivanr 15 hours agoparentprevGenuine question: does the `webpki` crate provide a good path building implementation? reply teddyh 17 hours agoprevNote: If your application does not absolutely need it, there are alternatives to X.509 certificates in TLS, like raw public keys (RFC 7250). reply zokier 15 hours agoparentAdded to OpenSSL last November: https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/11/23/OpenSSL32/index... reply baby 14 hours agoprevcan OpenSSL use this as well?

    "originBody": "Health HPV vaccine study finds zero cases of cervical cancer among women vaccinated before age 14 By Annalisa Merelli Jan. 25, 2024 Reprints A nurse delivers a dose of the HPV vaccine at a college western France in October 2023. DAMIEN MEYER/AFP via Getty Images A historic new study out of Scotland shows the real-world impact of vaccines against the human papillomavirus: The country has detected no cases of cervical cancer in women born between 1988-1996 who were fully vaccinated against HPV between the ages of 12 and 13. Many previous studies have shown that HPV vaccines are extremely effective in preventing cervical cancer. But the study, published on Monday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is the first to monitor a national cohort of women over such a long time period and find no occurrence of cervical cancer. advertisement “The study is super exciting. It shows that the vaccine is extremely effective,” said Kathleen Schmeler, a professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research. “It’s obviously early. We’re just starting to see the first data of the impact of the vaccine because it takes so long from the time of the vaccine to the effects.” The results underscore the importance of working to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in the U.S., said Schmeler. Scotland, for example, introduced routine immunization in schools in 2008, and close to 90% of students in their fourth year of secondary school (equivalent to 10th grade in the U.S.) in the 2022-2023 school year had received at least one dose of the vaccine. In the U.S., where HPV vaccines are not administered in school, uptake among adolescents ages 13 to 17 is a little over 60%. Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy The study also points to how crucial the timing of vaccination is. “The girls that didn’t develop any cancer were vaccinated before becoming sexually active,” said Schlemer. “So we should not wait to vaccinate folks and really do it, for the guidelines, prior to becoming sexually active.” advertisement The benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine before age 14 The authors of the Scotland study monitored the records of all women born between 1988 and 1996 who were eligible for cancer screening, about 450,000 women. Of that group, 40,000 were vaccinated between the ages of 12 and 13, and 124,000 received the vaccines at or after 14 years of age. The remaining women, nearly 300,000, were not vaccinated. No cases of cervical cancer were found among the women who were vaccinated before they turned 14, even if they had only received one or two doses of the vaccine rather than the full, three-dose protocol. Also noteworthy is that women who received the three-dose protocol between the ages of 14 and 22 also benefited significantly. While some cases of cervical cancer were recorded in this group, the incidence (3.2 cases per 100,000 women) was two and a half times lower than among unvaccinated women (8.4 cases per 100,000 women). Related: HPV vaccines are so effective that new screening policies may be in order, suggests study “I was very surprised that there were no cases” of cancer in the group who received vaccines before 14, said Tim Palmer, the former clinical lead for cervical screening in Scotland and an HPV immunization consultant at Public Health Scotland, who was a lead author of the study. “In that age group, I expected about 15 to 17 a year in Scotland — and we have had none.” The types of vaccine administered to the cohorts monitored in the study changed as newer ones became available, covering more types of HPV. Until 2012, the vaccine in use was the bivalent Cervarix, targeting HPV 16 and 18. Then the quadrivalent Gardasil was administered until 2023, when the nonavalent Gardasil 9 was introduced. This is why it’s still possible that cervical cancers may still arise even in vaccinated women, caused by the HPV strains not targeted by the earlier vaccines. “There are obviously other HPV types that cause cancer,” Palmer said, noting that the current results don’t mean cases of cervical cancers, caused by less high-risk strains of HPV, won’t emerge in the analyzed cohort in the future. Related: A single-dose HPV vaccine would have a big impact on cancer prevention The study’s findings don’t diminish the need for continued screenings for early detection of cervical cancers caused by HPV types that were not targeted in the original bivalent vaccine, said Palmer, but the vaccines effectively targeted the more aggressive strains of HPV (16 and 18). The impact of the vaccination was also greater among women of lower socioeconomic status, who otherwise reported higher occurrences of cancer, said Palmer. Ville Pimenoff, a senior researcher at the Karolinska Institutet and professor at the University of Oulu in Finland, published the results of a large cohort study in Finland in November 2023, which showed the effectiveness of cohort vaccination in creating herd immunity against HPV. He said the results from Scotland confirm his findings. “When you vaccinate in a cohort way, there seems to be very strong, protective immunity in those communities,” said Pimenoff, who was not involved in the Scottish study.

You are unlikely to have all the strains known to cause problems already. ------- Additionally (something I only became aware of from knowing a person dealing with it) - there's a modest body of clinical research suggesting that vaccinating for HPV in someone who already has it and is symptomatic (warts) can significantly lessen or eliminate their symptoms. It was recommended for the person I know on that basis by their doctor as a thing to try, and they've noticed significant improvement. Anectdata, but mentioning anyway.

However, there is a case where it makes sense: Someone who went into a monogamous relationship early and it has now ended.

All vaccines have a nonzero risk of adverse outcomes. That can be as simple as the risk of physical injury due to incorrect administration of the needle. That's weighed against the risk of nonvaccination. In almost all cases, the balance is so extremely skewed that it's safe to issue general recommendations in favor of vaccination. For HPV, the issue is that there's literally zero benefit after exposure, and it's difficult/infeasible to test for exposure, but from epidemiological data we know that most people over the age of 25 have already been exposed. > In my opinion men should also be vaccinated for it The recommendation is for all genders, and has been for well over a decade. reply volkl48 13 hours agorootparentNoted in my other comment, but mentioned here as well: - Exposure to a strain is not the same as exposure to all strains. Few are likely to have been infected with all of the strains that the vaccine protects against, and infection by multiple strains is not a rare event. - There's research being done on if the vaccine can reduce symptoms to people who already have HPV. Early results seem promising. Certainly nothing large enough for the CDC to be making recommendations on yet (that I know of/could find from a quick search), but worth noting - there may well turn out to be a significant benefit to the vaccine even after exposure, we just seem to be relatively early in that research. - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6541142/ - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38068369/ reply logicchains 14 hours agorootparentprev>In almost all cases, the balance is so extremely skewed that it's safe to issue general recommendations in favor of vaccination It's still the riskiest pharmaceutical product the average young person will take.

My (female) roommate wanted to get it immediately, even though she was very open about only having been with the man she was seeing at the time.

She said she already has to keep her head on a swivel against the possibility of assault, and she'd really rather not have to worry about a virus that could cause cancer in addition to that risk.

Some children might well be able to make sound choices like this at that age. Some definitely will not. You're advocating for a line at which parents lose their right to be parents while maintaining the rest of the responsibility for raising the child. You want to put the government in control.

And I'm not advocating for anything, I just hate the insincerity that comes from people asking questions like that. Its also a little whiffy that you're trotting out the 'some kids will make good choices' bit with regards to this age range and the ability to ask a doctor for a vaccination - we normally reserve that line of reasoning where making a bad decision is attractive and an adult might also not behave responsibly. Also point of order - what are you talking about, 'government control'? The topic at hand was literally whether 12 was an appropriate age to start respecting a persons wishes when it came to seeking a vaccination. It is troubling that you see that as government control, and troubling that you see this as 'losing your right as a parent' reply jeffbee 7 hours agorootparentprevI picked 12 because that is the age of medical privacy in my state.

(In fact, parents' rights to consent to underage marriage in some states is currently a loophole in this regard. https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/child-marriages...) > In many U.S. states, children can legally marry at an earlier age than they can consent to sex, leading to situations where sex between spouses may be a criminal act.

If your twelve year old wants to have sex, and you with your \"parents' rights\" endorse that choice, you should go to jail. Because your right as a parent to make decisions is in conflict with the right of the child not to be subject to statutory rape. The poster upthread asserts a similar conflict between the rights of the parent to make decisions and the right of the child to lifesaving medical measures. reply iraqmtpizza 13 hours agorootparentActually you make a good point. Nobody should be penetrating children, regardless of what the parents think — kids can get irreversible medical procedures when they turn 18. reply ceejayoz 13 hours agorootparentVaccination being irreversible, that's pretty clearly in conflict with the child's right not to die horribly of preventable diseases like polio. As a parent, you get to make all sorts of decisions. As with all other rights, it's still not unlimited. Certain decisions are not solely yours; certain decisions aren't ever yours. reply iraqmtpizza 13 hours agorootparentThe right not to die of disease (were it to exist) would be a statutory right and not a fundamental one. I'd rather discuss fundamental rights which are a very different thing than the shopping list that is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But I'll go one step further.

I don't know why you brought it up. Vaccines are not life-saving care by any definition. Not least of all because it does not cure or treat disease. I believe it's even illegal for a doctor to tell a patient otherwise. So this, too, is irrelevant. >Are the children of Lancaster County pushing to be vaccinated and being denied by their parents?

Not least of all because it does not cure or treat disease. Sure they can. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_vaccines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_vaccine is a good example of a vaccine frequently administered while infected to treat a disease.

A dodge. To be clear: if an Amish child wanted to get vaccinated, and their parents forbade it, I'd want our legal system to side with the child. reply iraqmtpizza 10 hours agorootparentThe comment which started this was implying that parental rights (in scare quotes) fell to the rights of children. All of your arguments focus on community rights and democratic power overcoming parental rights, something which is beside the point. If it requires democratic power and doesn't apply universally (spatially and temporally), even within that particular jurisdiction, it can hardly be said to be merely the recognition of a child's fundamental right. And the article you linked says that the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that \"[a] 17-year-old Connecticut girl with a highly curable cancer is not mentally competent to make her own medical decisions\" (emphasis mine). Also, your arguments about landmark cases in which state power overcame parental rights in rare situations would tend to demolish the idea that parental rights are some fringe legal and philosophical movement cooked up by anti-vaxxers, which is the implication which began this thread. Especially because the court recognizes the existence of parental rights even while ruling to override them. Additionally, the purported legitimacy of being forcibly vaccinated by the state would demolish any bodily autonomy argument which could be made to assert a child's right to vaccinate. >Sure they can A dodge. If there are theraputic vaccines (arguably a contradiction in terms), then they are legally distinguishible from non-theraputic ones. The original comment (about \"parental rights\") was clearly referring to this particular non-theraputic HPV vaccine and others like it. Let's stay on topic. >A dodge. To be clear I don't think it's at all illegitmate to presume that at least one Amish child in the history of Amish children has desired a vaccine and was told no by his or her parents. Throw in literally every other similarly-situated religious group and we're talking about a significant number of people. If the right is truly fundamental, it's a right denied regardless of whether the child lawyered up and took it to the Supreme Court. The Amish community would be massacred Waco-style if there were even hints that this precious, fundamental right was being denied to children (if you may recall another child-protecting operation). That is, of course, assuming that anyone genuinely believed this right to exist. Which as a general matter they do not and never have. The fringe movement is the one putting parental rights in scare quotes and treating children as adults (except when in the womb, never there). So, in summary, people who put parental rights in scare quotes while asserting invented rights as a means to acquire access to children are indeed the reason for which civilization has developed the venerable age of consent law. reply NotGMan 14 hours agoparentprevAnd you blindly trust these studies and everything else that big pharma puts out.

    "originBody": "Proposed Windows NT sync driver brings big Wine / Proton performance improvements By Liam Dawe - 24 January 2024 at 10:44 am UTCViews: 45,275 Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers has proposed a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton. As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list Figura notes: \"This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives.\" Then giving some background on it: \"The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated \"kernel\" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck. The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the \"wait-for-all\" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel.\" Figura did a presentation on it at the Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below: YouTube videos require cookies, you must accept their cookies to view.

Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton. Source: Phoronix Article taken from GamingOnLinux.com.

    "commentBody": "Proposed Windows NT sync driver brings big Wine/Proton performance improvements (gamingonlinux.com)199 points by neogodless 18 hours agohidepastfavorite58 comments derefr 16 hours agoSeems weird to upstream this support all as one shared kernel interface, modelled as only “NT emulation.” I’m surprised the kernel would be okay with this impl. It reminds me of when OpenVZ tried to upstream their big blob of container logic. The kernel maintainers forced them to part it out into individual patches so it could be reworked (and we ended up with cgroups and namespaces.) If Linux is missing certain kernel-provided sync primitives, why not just implement them all as regular Linux syscalls for every userland app to use (similar to how e.g. futexes were introduced) rather then crowding them all into some compatibility chardev with an ABI arcane enough that it would only ever be talked to by one library? reply wtallis 15 hours agoparentWine needs a high-performance implementation of sync primitives that even Microsoft has deprecated and discouraged, because there are real programs out there using those Windows APIs that Linux users want to run. Most of what Wine wants added to the kernel should not have a scope of use beyond Wine, which is why the Wine devs have put so much effort into trying to solve these problems in userspace. reply zeusk 15 hours agorootparentWhich sync primitive has Microsoft deprecated and discouraged?

It'd potentially allow 1:1 threading to better compete with M:N, which would be very nice for systems languages like C++ and Rust. reply cwillu 15 hours agoparentprevThis _is_ broken up into individual patches, with documentation and intent discussed (briefly) in each patch. It's not a big blob of undocumented and opaque container logic being dumped in one giant patch. reply derefr 11 hours agorootparentSure, but all of these patches still have a common implicit \"framework\" they're introducing ABI surface to — the ntsync char device. That \"framework\" is axiomatic to the patches. And that's the part that made OpenVZ unacceptable to integrate into the kernel — the axiomatic framework being introduced by the patch series. No matter how you split and refactor and document and drip-feed in the OpenVZ patches, they'd still just be a set of patches each proposing one component of an already-externally-designed higher-level feature, that can only exist if all the patches are accepted. (See the relevance?) My understanding of how things should go in Linux kernel development, is that when submitting a single patch to LKML, 1. the motivating user-story should first be explained, and 2. the patch that follows should then be the most idiomatic way to solve that single problem within the existing architecture the Linux kernel. This will then 3. start a discussion, where any \"specialization\" of the design from its normative \"obvious\" form may be proposed, and justifications for this argued. When submitting a patch series, each patch must go through this process independently. If there is any common framework to the patches, it can only be because the \"obvious way\" (by the consensus of all participants) to solve patch 2's user-story, with patch 1 already in place in a dev branch, is to refactor the logic of patch 1 and patch 2 together. In other words, it should be up to the core kernel maintainers — not the contributor — to propose an in-kernel architecture like \"this set of operations introduced over the last few development patch series, would make a lot of sense to expose as messages passed into a single character device.\" And such an architecture should be proposed because it's what's best for the kernel, rather than because having it that way would make the contributor's life easier in implementing their library. (The only exception to this being if the aim is to support direct interoperation with some existing portable software, by exposing a syscall or device or filesystem that other platforms already have, and that existing software already depends upon on these other platforms. Which doesn't apply here — NT itself doesn't have an ntsync device!) I would expect, if this process were followed for NT's sync primitives, that: • some of the resulting changes would introduce ioctls; • some of the resulting changes would add flags for the io_uring or epoll syscall families; • and some of the resulting changes — for the legacy NT sync-primitive objects specifically — would probably become their own syscalls (probably in such a way that they only exist with a certain kernel module loaded, so that the attack surface they represent can be disabled in hardened systems.) These changes would likely all solve the problems as stated (i.e. making it possible to execute NT software that uses sync-object X, with only a userland translation library between the kernel and the software, no RPC daemon needed) ... but these changes likely wouldn't solve the problems in the most efficient way for WINE. Not if there's any other uses — in greenfield Linux software, in virtualization of other OSes, in accelerated kernel-mode hypervision, etc — for exposing such primitives. And also, obviously, these primitives would all end up fairly different from one-another, and from what NT expects — and so WINE would still need a fairly complex translation layer to target these syscalls. Just like it does today. Just, one without inefficiant and apparently-untenable userland arbitration. reply cwillu 8 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, OpenVZ was a massive set of infrastructure: new APIs, new user-space components, new filesystems, new cpu schedulers, etc. The individual components were what needed to be split out and merged incrementally with room for discussion, and those components were about the size of this patchset. reply arka2147483647 16 hours agoparentprevI imagine the point is not to implement some species of sync primitives currently not supported by Linux, but to implement exactly what windows does, so one does not need to emulate them in userspace. reply derefr 10 hours agorootparentThe point for the contributor is that, yes. The point that would convince the Linux kernel maintainers to actually accept the patchset, though, would likely be the introduction of generally-useful \"species of sync primitives.\" In such a way that those primitives can be used to solve the \"hard part\" of WINE's virtualization of NT's versions of those primitives; but which wouldn't be constrained to guarantee an efficient zero-impedance call path between those implementations. reply zaphirplane 14 hours agoparentprevI though Cgroup originated from google employed engineers It’s a shame openVz pioneered container, yet docker ate their lunch reply dusted 13 hours agorootparentI used OpenVZ for a long time before Docker came along, it was certainly nicer than what I did previously (run everything right on the host) but, of the two, I'd pick Docker every time. Dockerfiles, images, layers, thinking of containers as \"application instances\", the networking, the cli, the speed, there's nothign I miss from OpenVZ, even if it was good for what it was, the way Docker improved on it made a very big difference, in a positive way. reply antod 11 hours agorootparentprevDocker didn't bring container running features or kernel features for running containers (they just used LXC at first didn't they?), Docker brought an image layering and distribution set of features for single process containers. OpenVZ (like LXC) was more of an OS level VM alternative type of container. Docker was more of a developer oriented distribution/isolation system than OpenVZ/LXC/etc which were more of a sysadmin oriented hosting system. In the very early days Docker didn't make much sense to me until I realised that. reply rrdharan 13 hours agoparentprevcgroups was built by Google https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups reply jonhohle 12 hours agoparentprevPerhaps the operations could have all been added to `ioctl`. reply bhaney 11 hours agoprevLooking forward to this.

We'll see how it goes! Tried my CH Pro Pedals but they weren't working due to an SDL issue that should be fixed in 2.30.0. Tried plugging some VKB gear in but not all the controls were recognized, so I just got another USB controller to install in it so I'm not daisy-chaining the VKB modules anymore. Just received a Grassmonkey head tracker, but haven't had time to try it yet. Not sure if you're running flatpak Steam but I hear controller recognition works better with standard Steam. Other than the control contretemps, it's been a good experience absent the occasional Proton breakage. I stick to Experimental, FWIW. reply avhception 11 hours agoparentprevAnecdotal, but I've got a Radeon RX 7600 at the moment and was using an RX 580 before. Just an hour ago I played Witcher3 through Steam/Proton/Wine on my 4k TV. I haven't done any tinkering with drivers or anything, it just works out of the box even with my stupid self-compiled Gentoo kernel. The RX 580 went into the secondary box running OpenSUSE and works equally well there. reply aappleby 13 hours agoparentprevI have a cheap RX 6400 and it is flawless in both Wayland and X. reply rpcope1 12 hours agorootparentI have one, and I sure wouldn't recommend it beyond being a simple display driver. The real killer on that card in particular is that it, so far as I can tell, does not have any (?) video encoding/decoding acceleration whatsoever, and generally the support on AMD cards is mediocre at best until you step up to very high power cards. That's actually one of the painful parts about video on Linux, is that if you've got something that needs GPU acceleration via libav, you've got three (or four) not so nice choices: nvidia, which has good hardware support but is hit or miss if it actually works outside of their proprietary nvenc, especially for libav and vaapi; AMD, which seems to lack hardware for this on low power cards, or it's poor where it exists; Intel, where the ARC cards don't work well (or at all) if you lack resizable BAR (which means you can't use anything with any age as the host). Intel's integrated graphics is probably the best choice, but still I'd really like a discrete GPU with good Linux h264, vp9 and av1 encoding and decoding support, as it doesn't seem to exist today. reply jeroenhd 11 hours agorootparentThe 6400 lacks video encoders, but it still has decoders for H.264 and H.265. VP9 decoding should also work, but it's not listed on AMD's website per se. To use these capabilities on Linux, you will need to install the correct VA-API drivers, though, and Firefox is still reluctant to enable hardware video decoding on Linux. The resizable BAR problem is annoying, but that's not limited to AMD, either. I'm not 100% sure about Intel, but if resizable BAR doesn't affect performance, that only makes me think they left some easy performance win on the table.

    "originBody": "crdt CRDTs Turned Inside Out Wil Dec 15, 2023 • 8 min read 🔰 If CRDTs are new to you, here are some introductory links. - An interactive intro to CRDTs - An introduction to state-based CRDTs - CRDTs for non-academics - CRDT: The Hard Parts - Readings in CRDTs - crdt.tech Last time, I discussed the trade-offs between more traditional CRDTs, such as the State-based CRDT, Op-based CRDT, and Delta-based CRDT. There is another class of CRDTs: Merkle CRDTs. Most ink spilled on CRDTs focuses on consistently merging data from different replicas. That's just half the story. Without a way of storing when concurrent edits happen, merges can't make consistent decisions about conflict resolution. Normally, this is the job of version vectors in State-based CRDTs and the log of causal operations in Op-based CRDTs. But if you're familiar with blockchains or Git, we notice that Merkle Trees and DAGs (Directed Acyclical Graph) can also do the same job. The following is how we construct this bookkeeping, exposed as an inherent structure of the concurrent state, rather than hidden away within a container. Let's look at the two variations: Merkle-DAG CRDTs Merkle Search Tree CRDTs Merkle-DAG CRDT The Merkle-DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) models CRDTs as a growing DAG of Merkle nodes about concurrent updates as events occur. This is a Merklized version of Op-based CRDTs, where the internal bookkeeping grows with the number of state updates, rather than with the number of replicas. Each node in the Merkle-DAG can carry a payload of operations, state snapshots, or even deltas. This node payload must be a CRDT for the Merkle-DAG to be a CRDT. However, these payload CRDTs can be much simpler in their implementation because the bookkeeping on concurrent edits is delegated up to the Merkle-DAG. It's as if a state-based CRDT was turned inside-out. The common bookkeeping elements are now the container (the DAG), and the payload-specific bookkeeping is inside of the payload CRDT. Beyond simpler bookkeeping for payload CRDTs, Merkle-DAG CRDTs have an advantage that non-Merklized CRDTs don't. They can determine equality by comparing root hashes, and they can determine diffs by walking down the DAG. This reduces the bandwidth for syncing between replicas. A remote replica broadcasts its root hash to our local replica. The local replica compares its root hash with the remote hash to determine if something has changed. If the root hashes are different, it then asks the remote replica to send every node hash as it walks down the DAG from the root. When the remote replica sends a hash that the local replica already has, the path from the root to this node is the list of all nodes missing in the local replica. This is quite a bit of chatter over the network, but the hashes don't have to be delivered in causal order any more. Merkle DAGs are by definition a causal chain of hashes. Hence, the nodes can be reordered at the receiver, regardless of how they were sent, as long as all of the nodes were received. An upside of keeping the Merkle-DAG is that the data kept by a Merkle-DAG is immutable. It can be reconstructed and queried at any point in history. Immutability means diffs are easy, undos are easy, and provenance can be verified. But again, the downside here is a history of changes that grows with the number of events. However, Merkle Trees uses structural sharing as a form of compression to lower the space cost of storing such a data structure. 💡 - Merging of two Merkle DAGs is done by comparing hashes and walking down a DAG. - Node payload is a CRDT, and its merge function still needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent. 👍 - Smaller amount of data sent over the network to sync by comparing hashes. - Sync protocol is simpler due to not needing causal order delivery, but still requires some chatter over the wire to find diff to send. - Data is immutable so diffs, undos, and provenance is easy. 👎 - Internal data structure grows with the number of updates. Merkle Search Tree CRDT The second kind of Merkle CRDT is covered in the Merkle Search Tree paper. A Merkle Search Tree (MST) is a tree that maintains an ordered set of keys. It does this by maintaining a few invariants. All the keys in a node are ordered. All child nodes between two keys in a node contain entries lexicographically between the two keys. The leaf layer is layer zero. The layer above is layer one, with increasing layer numbers until the root. The layer a key belongs to is dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hash of the key. A node has a content ID that's a hash of all its keys concatenated with the content IDs of all its children. A child node is referenced by its content id. Keys live in all nodes of an MST tree, unlike a B-tree where keys are only at the leaves. This construction makes MSTs advantageous in two ways: it is self-balancing and it is unicit. Enjoying what you're reading? Subscribe for more A MST is self-balancing through both invariants #2 and #3. When a key is inserted in the tree, the layer is determined by the key's hash and the node in the layer is determined by the key's value. When the key is inserted in a node between two keys, it necessarily splits the child node between the two keys into two nodes due to invariant #2. Given a hash is in base B and invariant #3, the average number of keys in layer L is B times the average number of keys in layer L + 1. Hence, the average node size is B. Due to the placement of a key being completely deterministic, the tree self-balances. Unicity means, for a given set of keys, the MST is unique. It implies the MST's construction does not depend on the order of the keys that were inserted. This is extremely desireable, because we can tell if two MSTs are different simply by comparing their root hashes regardless of the insertion order. If the root hash is the same, then the two trees are the same. To construct a CRDT out of an MST, we simply add a payload to each key that's also a CRDT. Since the MST is an ordered set, merging sets have well-defined semantics, and merging the payloads is delegated to the payload itself to resolve. And just like the Merkle-DAG construction, the payload CRDT doesn't need to be as complicated. For example, to construct a Grow-Only CRDT, we select the set { ⏊, ⏉ } (called \"bottom\" and \"top\" respectively) as the payload CRDT. All the values of the payload start as \"bottom\" by default. Merging means taking the max of \"top\" vs \"bottom\" (top always wins in a max operation). Unfortunately, the paper leaves out the construction of other CRDTs using MSTs, as it was left as an exercise for the reader. However, there are two other possible constructions I think will work. Causal Length CRDTs for add-remove sets could be implemented in MSTs with ℤ (the set of integers) as the payload. If the number is even the key doesn't exist, and if it's odd, then it does. Merging would just be taking the max of the two replica's payloads. Replicated Growable Arrays (RGA) could be implemented by using virtual pointers concatted with the replica ID as the key. Since the MST keeps the keys ordered, we can read back the string by traversing in key order. This would need a mechanism outside of the MST to insert and assign tombstones for deletions. [^3] Beyond that, there is an undetailed edge case. What if the key you're adding has a lot more (or a lot less) leading zeros in its hash than the number of leading zeros in the current root layer? Do you just add nodes in between the root and the new node? What should go in those in-between nodes? If there are no keys in these in-between nodes and just child content IDs, there would be no way to discern which child to descend into on a query. My guess is to simply insert a ghost key that doesn't exist in the set but only serves as a range bookend for queries. There are implementations to check out for details. [^4] As for downsides, it's also vulnerable to attackers constructing a key with a large number of zeros and trying to insert it. That would result in a tall tree, reducing queries from O(log n) to O(n). And while the node size is on average B, the variance is spread pretty wide, so it can be common to have nodes that are too small or too large. 💡 - Merging of two Merkle Search Trees is done similarly to a Merkle Tree: by comparing hashes and walking down the tree. - Node payload is a CRDT, and its merge function still needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent. 👍 - Smaller amount of data sent over the network to sync by comparing hashes - Sync protocol is simpler due to not needing causal order delivery, but still requires some chatter over the wire to find diff to send - Self-balancing tree - Trees are unicit - Internal bookkeeping doesn't grow with either replicas or the number of updates 👎 - Possible for attackers to construct tall trees to slow query times - Variance of node sizes is large The surprising connection After this and the previous survey on CRDTs, I came away with some clarity on them. CRDTs need two main ingredients to work, a merge/application operator that's commutative and associative, and some bookkeeping to keep track of concurrent or causal edits. This bookkeeping is like an uncollapsed superposition of state while the system isn't sure if there are any more concurrent edits. If we can be sure that all replicas are synced, we can either collapse the state or simply throw it away if we don't need to travel back in time. For typical CRDTs, this bookkeeping is internal, and you're given an interface to set and query, so one can pretend this is a regular state that can be updated in place. Merkle CRDTs turn this inside out, exposing the inherent structure of concurrent edits and uncollapsed state for users to see and exploit. This mirrors closely with how Git is structured. That surprised me at first. But as I dove into Git's history, I found this tidbit in passing. The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid base for future merges. In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes. Linus Travolus vs Bram Cohen The values are the contents of the file, and the bookkeeping on concurrent edits happens outside of the value. What stops Git from being a CRDT is that its default 3-way merge isn't commutative and associative. As history proved, it's the bookkeeping data structure that's important for merges, not the conflict resolution itself. But in the case of CRDTs, it's important to constrain the merge with algebraic properties [^2]. The search continues Merkle Search Trees have lots of nice properties, such as unicity, self-balancing, and a CRDT that doesn't grow with the number of replicas or events. But I think we can do better. For one, the variance of the node sizes is large in MSTs, which makes for uneven trees. In my search, I found Prolly Trees, and will take a look at them. If anyone has other suggestions for data structures to look at to implement composable CRDTs, let me know. In the meantime, subscribe or follow me on twitter. [^1] If you aren't familiar with the internals of Git, I'd recommend looking into it. Git is the only piece of software where learning its internal data structure made it easier to use. - Git Internals: Plumbing and Porcelain - A Visual Guide to Git [^2] The algebraic properties we need to maintain for a merge are commutativity, associativity, and idempotency. This forces every replica to arrive at the same merged state without coordinating with each other. [^3] Of course, actual RGA implementations are far more optimized than this outline.

I'm a bit sorry now that I used the \"Merkle-CRDT\" name all over the paper because Merkle-Search-Trees CRDTs also deserve that tag. I think it is good to explain Merkle-DAG CRDTs (MD-CRDTs) as \"merklerized \"op-based CRDTs\", and I would add that Merkle-Search-Tree CRDTs (MST-CRDTs) are akin to \"state-based\" CRDTs, to complete the analogy. This helps to bridge traditional and Merkle CRDTs and I would probably introduce it the same way, but it is also not quite right when going into some more depth. I will try to explain why. In MD-CRDTs we have a growing-DAG that works like a chain of operations that are applied in the order that the DAG is traversed. It looks a lot like an operation log, except it can have multiple branches and, if we follow my paper, operations do not need to have any total order (unlike op-based crdts). We know the latest operation in the DAG (the root node) happened AFTER its children, so there is an embedded notion of order. However, if it has multiple children, we don't know how to order the operations in their respective branches, and we don't need to because they should be commutative etc. For that to work, the paper explains that DAG-nodes embed not operations, but \"state deltas\". So in reality, MD-CRDTs are delta-based crdts where the merkle-dag structure stores the deltas as they are broadcasted from replicas. It's just that deltas look a lot like operations. In MST-CRDTs, if my understanding is correct, replicas will be broadcasting the roots of the DAG pointing the full state (similar to state-based CRDTs broadcasting the full state). However, thanks to Merklelization etc., changes to the state only update sections of the full DAG, and diffing, retrieving or broadcasting only the changed parts is super easy and very compact. Since the nodes values will be CRDTs themselves, they can be merged on conflict just fine. In practice, it is sort of also dealing with delta-crdts. The main thing in both is that reconstructing the full state from deltas is easy and efficient because everything is linked, so you just follow links and drop branches that you already have. Deltas without headaches. Perhaps another way to conceptually understand both is that in MD-CRDTs, you add DAG-nodes to the top of the DAG as root DAG nodes, leaving the bottom of the DAG untouched. In MST-CRDTs, you add dag nodes to the bottom (the leaves) of the DAG, which cascades into having new root DAG nodes. In both cases you broadcast new root DAG nodes and the rest of people traverse and sync. Now, what are the practical consequences for implementations: - The main problem in pure MD-CRDTs (with no caveats) is the unbounded growth (ala blockchain) even when the state becomes smaller. This only matters if you plan to delete or overwrite things from the state. In MST-CRDTs it is \"easy\" to discard orphaned data. However, one of the main advantages in MD-CRDTs is that \"syncing\" happens from the last operation/delta. This can be important if you care about having certain notion of order, i.e. that \"elements added last\" are the first ones to be synced into an empty replica. Another advantage may be to be able to reconstruct multiple views of the same state by re-traversing the DAG, which has \"everything\". - MST-CRDTs are very good for database tables, syncing is very efficient, things are compact. I haven't implemented them myself but they seem quite adequate for that use-case. When thinking of downsides, I wonder if they suffer from the cost of re-hashing operations as they grow with a very large number of keys and with heavy usage (larger blocks to hash or more levels to update). One very important advantage of MST-CRDTs is that they are more resilient if a leave-DAG-node is unretrivable. In MD-CRDTs an unretrievable DAG node can break DAG-traversal and with it a large portion of the state while in MST-CRDTs, this will affect only a key or a set of keys related to the missing DAG node. In the end, for both the devil will be in implementation details: how good is your pubsub code? How good and parallelizable is your update-processing code? How good is your GC process? How good is your blockstore? All those things become performance bottlenecks even when the theoretical properties work perfectly. reply hecturchi 7 hours agoparentI forgot: key-value store using MD-CRDTs was implemented here: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-crdt The trickiest part was not the CRDT, but the DAG traversal with multiple workers processing parallel updates on multiple branches and switching CRDT-DAG roots as they finish branches. reply iamwil 4 hours agoparentprevWere you inspired by Git?

(Amazon Dyano paper does the same, but only a few years before). Also, it contains this line which always makes me laugh: Network partitioning can completely destroy mutual consistency in the worst case, and this fact has led to a certain amount of restrictiveness, vagueness, and even nervousness in past discussions, of how it may be handled.

    "originBody": "EFF has joined forces with 110 NGOs today in a joint statement delivered to the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee, clearly outlining civil society non-negotiable redlines for the proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty, and asserting that states should reject the proposed treaty if these essential changes are not implemented. The last draft published on November 6, 2023 does not adequately ensure adherence to human rights law and standards. Initially focused on cybercrime, the proposed Treaty has alarmingly evolved into an expansive surveillance tool. Katitza Rodriguez, EFF Policy Director for Global Privacy, asserts ahead of the upcoming concluding negotiations: The proposed treaty needs more than just minor adjustments; it requires a more focused, narrowly defined approach to tackle cybercrime. This change is essential to prevent the treaty from becoming a global surveillance pact rather than a tool for effectively combating core cybercrimes. With its wide-reaching scope and invasive surveillance powers, the current version raises serious concerns about cross-border repression and potential police overreach. Above all, human rights must be the treaty's cornerstone, not an afterthought. If states can't unite on these key points, they must outright reject the treaty. Historically, cybercrime legislation has been exploited to target journalists and security researchers, suppress dissent and whistleblowers, endanger human rights defenders, limit free expression, and justify unnecessary and disproportionate state surveillance measures. We are concerned that the proposed Treaty, as it stands now, will exacerbate these problems. The proposed treaty concluding session will be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from January 29 to February 10th. EFF will be attending in person. The joint statement specifically calls States to narrow the scope of criminalization provisions to well defined cyber dependent crimes; shield security researchers, whistleblowers, activists, and journalists from being prosecuted for their legitimate activities; explicitly include language on international human rights law, data protection, and gender mainstreaming; limit the scope of the domestic criminal procedural measures and international cooperation to core cybercrimes established in the criminalization chapter; and address concerns that the current draft could weaken cybersecurity and encryption. Additionally, it requires the necessity to establish specific safeguards, such as the principles of prior judicial authorization, necessity, legitimate aim, and proportionality. joint.advocacy.statement-cybercrime.convention-jan.23.2024-final.pdf",

    "commentBody": "Proposed UN cybercrime treaty has evolved into an expansive surveillance tool (eff.org)166 points by laserstrahl 20 hours agohidepastfavorite57 comments _fat_santa 18 hours agoHere's the problem I see with tackling \"cybercrime\", most of it happens outside the jurisdiction of western countries. When it comes to things like hacking, selling stolen data, scams you name it, most of it happens in countries where enforcement is either lax or just non-existent. And \"access\" here is completely asymmetric, if someone opens up say a scam store in London that victimizes it's visitors in some way, the authorities have access to the business just like the business has access to the residents of London, here the \"access\" is symmetric as the authorities can just show up and shut down the business and throw the criminal org running it in jail. With cybercrime though, the criminal has access to the victim, but the authorities do not have access to the criminal. The criminals can victimize folks all day long but besides stern warnings to potential victims, there's nothing the authorities can do. The criminals know this and this is why most of your online scams and cybercrime occurs in places outside the jurisdiction of western states / states that care about this stuff. A cybercrime bill like this will inevitably be kneecapped by virtue of it's jurisdiction. As a result they won't have any \"real\" crime to go after and will increasingly go after lower hanging fruit that one could interpert as \"crime\". So expect the real criminals will still be in business while these agencies will go after folks for saying mean things on the internet that could be construed by a court to be a \"crime\" reply thmsths 18 hours agoparentMaybe it's naive, but I wonder if escalating fines then sanctions against countries responsible for a lot of cybercrime could work. Right now the incentives are all messed up. If citizens from country A lose millions from scammers in country B, country B has little incentive to spend precious resources on making it stop. In some cases it's even worse as country B might be benefiting from the scam. Telling some countries \"we won't let you route calls to our country because a disproportionate amount is scams\" might provide an incentive, and if it doesn't it makes the scamming harder. Of course this needs to be weighed against the potential costs. reply _fat_santa 18 hours agorootparent> Maybe it's naive, but I wonder if escalating fines then sanctions against countries responsible for a lot of cybercrime could work. Unfortunately that gets wrapped in Geopolitics. I'm sure the cybercrime unit will love to issue sanctions against certain countries but the higher ups will never allow that because they need that country as an ally in the region more than they need to stop cybercrime from that country. Ie. bigger fish to fry. reply grotorea 12 hours agorootparentAnd those are mostly third world countries so I doubt it would look good to basically sanction countries that have enough trouble with national debt as it is. And is there any country where the \"bilateral\" cybercrime is more significant than the legitimate bilateral trade? India is notorious for the phone scam centers but it also has a giant legitimate call center business. reply MrYellowP 57 minutes agorootparentprevYou make little sense. What are they going to do about it? Digitally lock down everything somehow? Outlaw encryption? Forbid VPNs? Implement a massive, nation-covering firewall that actually can enforce any of that? reply pksebben 18 hours agorootparentprev> Of course this needs to be weighed against the potential costs. On both ends. Listening to Darknet Diaries [1] recently with a story on email fraud, and they mentioned that the estimated yearly take for one particular fraud group in Nigeria amounted to roughly a third of Nigeria's GDP. Even if we interpret this as inflated, it's hard to imagine that the Nigerian government is highly motivated to put a stop to that flow of capital. 1 - https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/141/ reply FredPret 17 hours agorootparentDear lord, what if they actually make one of them the Prince of Nigeria for real reply HowTheStoryEnds 12 hours agorootparentHe'll still need you or your parents to get to his money. reply grotorea 12 hours agorootparentprevI like the interpretation of cybercriminals as privateers, specially where the state lets it be like in Russia. reply ajb 17 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, cybercrime is cross-border because that makes it difficult to reverse fraudulent transactions. There should simply be an international treaty such that fraudulent transactions crossing a border can be reclaimed from the government of the destination country, leaving them with the problem of reclaiming it within their own country. reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparentThis is assuming you even know where they are. Suppose you want to impose tariffs on China because of cybercrime originating from there. Then China comes back and says they've investigated your claims, the computer you say the attack was coming from was actually another victim being used as a proxy and the real perpetrators are in North Korea or wherever. Then they make up some IP address in North Korea and tell you to go after them, which you can't because they don't have any money or don't trade with you or already hate you. Or cybercriminals in whatever country actually do just compromise some machines in other countries and use them as proxies to keep their own local authorities from having to care, and then you legitimately don't know where they are. reply ajb 16 hours agorootparentAny such crime involves a transfer of money, and the destination country is easily determined. The point is not to figure out where the criminals are, but to place responsibility on the country that can act on it. That's why I said the refund should come from the destination country, not the country where the criminals are located. If the criminals are not located there, then that country will have a claim on the next country that the money is transferred to, etc. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentMoney isn't any easier to trace than data packets. Dollars get converted into bullion or Monero some other fungible commodity with no tracking attached, then back into money. The country where the conversion happens isn't inherently the country where the criminals are, and you can't plausibly make it illegal to buyfor every value of . reply grotorea 12 hours agorootparentIs it completely implausible to tell the country where that exchange took place that it's their problem if they failed to enforce KYC/AML laws and check who is exchanging those fungible commodities and its origins? reply 14 17 hours agorootparentprevHow can you prove what country a criminal is from? You would have to make vpns and tor illegal so that it is impossible to mask your connection and that will never happen. I believe right now they can sometimes gleam hints as to the source country of malware but it’s not a certainty as of course a smart hacker would take steps to mask their work. reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparent> You would have to make vpns and tor illegal so that it is impossible to mask your connection and that will never happen. It would also be irrelevant, since criminals don't follow laws. reply ToucanLoucan 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, one can easily make the argument that this an incredibly rare instance where the global south get to be the exploiters as opposed to the exploited, and online scams could be argued as a \"colonialism tax\" on the richer, dumber citizens of western nations that are used to a government that at least feigns giving a shit about their security. I'm not saying that's right, of course, something something two wrongs. I don't condone it but I don't judge them for it either. As with most crime, the answer largely seems to be elevating the communities from which the crime comes, because while there's certainly a non-zero population out there that will just fuck shit up for their own gain, regardless of how harmful and risky it is, numerous studies on the subject and the successful rehabilitation programs in other countries not using a punitive system of justice demonstrate that the vast majority of the time, what \"criminals\" really need is a legal option to make a decent living. That can require a wide spectrum of things from proper education/skills training for that given person, to environmental or medical help to address untreated mental/physical illnesses, to systemic improvements so jobs pay enough to actually live and are available where people are. Basically: Our society demands people have money to survive, and most people given a reasonable opportunity to earn money in a pro-social way will do that, because if for no other reason, it's easier and less risky. However if you live in a place where you are denied the opportunity to make that living, what do you expect people to do? Lie down and wait for the cold embrace of death, or start stealing shit? Put in that position I'd tell you exactly what I'd do. reply AnthonyMouse 16 hours agorootparent> online scams could be argued as a \"colonialism tax\" on the richer, dumber citizens of western nations that are used to a government that at least feigns giving a shit about their security. Which brings us to the actual problem that causes these others. We don't put the consequences of bad security practices on the people who could have taken better precautions because they're \"the victim\" even though they're also the only person who could have prevented it. So instead we move the cost to the merchant via the credit card companies etc., or some other intermediary whose fault it was not. Which removes the incentive for ordinary people to care about security, and then they don't. Who cares if your IoT garbage provides an entry point into your home network and some Russians get your credit card number? Don't spend time choosing a device with open source firmware that gets indefinite community support. Don't worry about giving your credit card number to scammers. Just buy whatever's cheap and when it happens you can call the credit card company and make it their problem. Which in turn makes it the credit card company's problem, which they don't like, so they start asking for awful cybercrime bills to do something about this, even though the only something that works is to make consumers feel meaningful consequences for not caring about security. reply grotorea 12 hours agorootparentAre people that indifferent to cybersecurity in your opinion? There are lots of ways to lose money that can't that easily be clawed back. reply ToucanLoucan 14 hours agorootparentprev> We don't put the consequences of bad security practices on the people who could have taken better precautions because they're \"the victim\" even though they're also the only person who could have prevented it.

Eeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh waves hand The fact that tons and tons of what constitutes the backend of modern finance tech is the exact same shit that was originally built in the 70's is not something that I think can be overlooked so easily. A lot of what constitutes that ecosystem is just, practically allergic to security. Your social security number (if you're American) for example is basically a unified ID number that corresponds to everything from your medical records to your credit report to bank accounts to insurance, on and on, and accessing information with that number is nearly completely insecure. If someone gets ahold of yours and your basic public info, they can turn your life upside-down in such a way that will take hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to resolve. And it would be like, trivial to lock that behind some sort of MFA situation with a state-centralized solution. The entire ecosystem around EFTs is just incredibly needlessly bloated and slow. I understand why they were slow when I was born, right? But we have advanced so much since then and yet EFTs despite just being like... digital checks remain basically inaccessible to working class people, despite them being objectively useful and, again, literally just checks in a different form. And their difficulty in use and desire for people to use something like them has given birth in turn to entire new financial products and services, many of which are pretty scammy in their own right, and subject to their own risks of abuse with even less overall security since most are tech companies and not insured with the FDIC. That's not to say that people shouldn't be security conscious, of course they should be. But that requires education on how to be that, and frankly I don't think it's unreasonable to say that the finance sector could, itself, make being security conscious quite a bit easier without dinging their own profits too badly. reply titzer 19 hours agoprevEvery piece of legislation that has anything to do with privacy or surveillance will inevitably be corrupted to make surveillance worse, either directly by inserting or modifying language, or indirectly by interpretation or optimizing right up to the letter of the law, but not the spirit.

Data science has been fun, but it's all a moot point if our civil liberties are deteriorated. reply sgjohnson 19 hours agoparent> modern decentralized networking But the internet is already completely decentralized and has been since the 1990s when we switched from EGP to BGP. EGP used to have a single, global \"backbone\", BGP doesn't. The only semi-centralized part of the internet are the regional registries, although IANA is still the supreme numbers authority, but they don't care about what you do with your assigned numbers unless you hijack other numbers or acquired yours fraudulently. reply pixl97 18 hours agorootparentYou may be confusing what exactly decentralization is referring to in this case. BGP may be fully decentralized for IP, but if your only providers are your ISP and Amazon then your local industry has consolidated to the point that decentralization of the last mile and services don't matter. Two entities have full control of how your packets get to other people. The decentralized networking the above poster is talking about is a layer on top of this existing 'polluted' network where your traffic is encrypted in it's own layer and goes to servers/services not controlled by said providers. The particular problem I have with OPs idea this will give them some measure of privacy or safety. This isn't how law enforcement works. They will bust individual nodes and force the operators to keep them running all while gathering information on users of the network. They'll capture more nodes and unmask users with threat of even longer jail time to those that do not defect. reply tomrod 17 hours agorootparentYou interpreted me mostly correctly. I had in mind more nesh networking than node/point (i.e. having root access to a single node, whether by purchase or by pipe wrench, doesn't infiltrate the network sufficiently to bring it down). reply tenebrisalietum 17 hours agorootparentprevWell said, but parent post probably meant \"communication applications\" instead of \"networking.\" reply rokkitmensch 7 hours agoparentprevStart with GPG, comrade.

Is this just another bill that uses cyber secruity as an excuse to pass some bullshit laws? This is common practice in Germany, so it would not surprise me if that kind off stuff also reached the UN... reply TheGeminon 19 hours agoparentFrom my (limited) reading it seems like this is a UN treaty to allow for better co-operation between states when prosecuting/investigating cybercrime. The main issues I see is that there is little distinction in what constitutes a crime that would fit under the \"cybercrime\" banner, potentially allowing a state that has e.g. anti-LGBT laws to request assistance in prosecuting that crime by e.g. getting de-anonymized data from a US-based social network. reply aa_is_op 19 hours agoparentprevThe super short tl;d is: This is a treaty proposed by Russia, and heavily supported by the growing number of dictatorships around the world, such as China, the Arab states, and more recently the growing number of African countries, that will effectively allow them to prosecute anyone who says something bad about their countries under vague \"terrorism\" charges. If a western country refuses, then they can cut off any legal collaboration for any other more serious crimes. Example: UAE says this French national said something bad about their sheik. France must arrest and hand over that guy because they would be breaking an international treaty otherwise, and may be vulnerable to sanctions and UAE (and others refusal) to cooperate in France's legal investigations, such as economic fraud, terrorism, and such. It's basically a cleverly designed document to enforce and give more power to dictators across their borders, and inside other democratic countries. reply zwnow 3 hours agorootparentWell that is obviously something that will never come through, right?
