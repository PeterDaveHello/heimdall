    "originBody": "Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation About Issues Our Work Take Action Tools Donate SEARCH ISPs Should Not Police Online Speech—No Matter How Awful It Is. BY ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AUGUST 29, 2023 Entrusting our speech to multiple different corporate actors is always risky. Yet given how most of the internet is currently structured, our online expression largely depends on a set of private companies ranging from our direct Internet service providers and platforms, to upstream ISPs (sometimes called Tier 2 and 3), all the way up to Tier 1 ISPs (or the Internet backbone) that have no direct relationships with most users. Tier 1 ISPs play a unique role in the internet “stack,” because numerous other service providers depend on Tier 1 companies to serve their customers. As a result, Tier 1 providers can be especially powerful chokepoints—given their reach, their content policies can affect large swaths of the web. At the same time given their distant relationship to speakers, Tier 1 ISPs have little if any context to make good decisions about their speech. At EFF, we have long represented and assisted people from around the world—and across various political spectrums—facing censorship. That experience tells us that one of the most dangerous types of censorship happens at the site of a unique imbalance of power in the structures of the internet: when an internet service is both necessary for the web to function and simultaneously has no meaningful alternatives. That’s why EFF has long argued that we must “protect the stack” by saying no to infrastructure providers policing internet content. We’ve warned that endorsing censorship in one context can (and does) come back to bite us all when, inevitably, that same approach is used in another context. Pressure on basic infrastructure, as a tactic, will be re-used, inevitably, against unjustly marginalized speakers and forums. It already is. So we were concerned when we started hearing from multiple sources that Hurricane Electric, a Tier 1 ISP, is interfering with traffic. Confirmation of the details has been difficult, in part because Hurricane itself has refused to respond to our queries, but it appears that the company is partially denying service to a direct customer, a provider called Crunchbits, in order to disrupt traffic to a site that is several steps away in the stack. And it is justifying that action because activity on the site reportedly violates Hurricane’s “acceptable use policy”—even though Hurricane has no direct relationship with that site. Hurricane argues that the policy requires its direct customers to police their customers as well as themselves. If the site in question were Reddit, or Planned Parenthood, or even EFF, the internet would be up in arms. It is not, and it’s not hard to see why. The affected site is an almost universally despised forum for hateful speech and planning vicious attacks on vulnerable people: Kiwi Farms. For many, the natural response is to declare good riddance to bad rubbish—and understandably so. At EFF, our mission and history requires us to look at the bigger picture, and sound the alarm about the risks even when the facts are horrific. That means we need to say it even if it’s not comfortable: Hurricane Electric is wrong here. It gives us no joy to call Hurricane on this, not least because many will perceive it as an implicit defense of the KF site. It is not. A site that provides a forum for gamifying abuse and doxxing, whose users have celebrated on its pages the IRL deaths of the targets of their harassment campaigns, deserves no sympathy. We fully support criminal and civil liability for those who abuse and harass others. But just because there’s a serious problem doesn’t mean that every response is a good one. And regardless of good intentions, Hurricane’s role as a Tier 1 ISP means that their interference is a dangerous step. Let us explain why. For one thing, Tier 1 ISPs like Hurricane are often monopolies or near-monopolies, so users have few alternatives if they are blocked. Censorship is more powerful if you don’t have somewhere else to go. To be clear, at time of writing, there are two mirrored instances of KF online: one on the clear web at a country code top-level domain, and the other an onion service on the Tor network. So right now this isn’t a “lights out” situation for KF, and generally the Tor network will prevent that from happening entirely. The so-called “dark web” has plenty of deserved ill repute, however, so although it is resistant to censorship by Tier 1 ISPs, it is not a meaningful option for many, much less an accessible one. Which brings us to the second point: this approach is usually a one-way ratchet. Once an ISP indicates it’s willing to police content by blocking traffic, more pressure from other quarters will follow, and they won’t all share your views or values. For example, an ISP, under pressure from the attorney general of a state that bans abortions, might decide to interfere with traffic to a site that raises money to help people get abortions, or provides information about self-managed abortions. Having set a precedent in one context, it is very difficult for an ISP to deny it in another, especially when even considering the request takes skill and nuance. We all know how lousy big user-facing platforms like Facebook are at content moderation—and that’s with significant resources. Tier 1 ISPs don’t have the ability or the incentive to build content evaluation teams that are even as effective as those of the giant platforms who know far more about their end users and yet still engage in harmful censorship. ISPs like Hurricane Electric are bound to be far worse than Facebook and its peers at sorting bad content from good, which is why they should not open this door. Finally, site-blocking, whatever form it takes, almost inevitably cuts off legal as well as illegal speech. It cuts with a chain saw rather than a scalpel. We know that many believe that KF is uniquely awful, so that it is justifiable to take measures against them that we wouldn’t condone against anyone else. The thing is, that argument doesn’t square with reality, online or offline. Crossing the line to Tier 1 blocking won’t just happen once. To put it even more simply: When a person uses a room in a house to engage in illegal or just terrible activity, we don’t call on the electric company to cut off the light and heat to the entire house, or the post office to stop delivering mail. We know that this will backfire in the long run. Instead, we go after the bad guys themselves and hold them accountable. That’s what must happen here. The cops and the courts should be working to protect the victims of KF and go after the perpetrators with every legal tool at their disposal. We should be giving them the resources and societal mandate to do so. Solid enforcement of existing laws is something that has been sorely lacking for harassment and abuse online, and it’s one of the reasons people turn to censorship strategies. Finally, we should enact strong data privacy laws that target, among others, the data brokers whose services help enable doxxing. In the meantime, Tier 1 ISPs like Hurricane should resist the temptation to step in where law enforcement and legislators have failed. The firmest, most consistent approach infrastructure chokepoints like ISPs can take is to simply refuse to be chokepoints at all. Ultimately, that’s also the best way to safeguard human rights. We do not need more corporate speech police, however well-meaning.

Personally, I think Germany takes things way too far and that state censorship really is dangerous, but I also recognize that they&#x27;ve been in a very difficult position since the end of the war. I can&#x27;t really fault them for over-correcting, but I do feel for the German people who have to live under unjust laws.To their credit they&#x27;ve also relaxed a bit over the years. For example, they lifted the ban on Mein Kampf and it flew off the shelves (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-38495456) not because the country was full of secret Nazis this whole time just waiting for it, but because the German people strongly desire freedom.It&#x27;s worth noting that even in Germany and other EU counties that gave up basic freedoms in an effort to oppose racism there are still racists. Innocent people get hurt by oppressive laws and racists gain a talking point for recruiting that resonates with a lot of people. It&#x27;s a lot easier to feed into a person&#x27;s victim complex when they&#x27;re actually being oppressed. reply indigo945 1 hour agorootparentnext [–]> To their credit they&#x27;ve also relaxed a bit over the years.

Mein Kampf was never \"banned\", in fact, there is no such thing as book bans under German law, as there is no censorship - article 5 of the Basic Law explicitly says so. The state can make it illegal to sell and advertise media to minors if it is considered dangerous, and Mein Kampf is and always was on that list.The reason Mein Kampf could not be distributed until a few years ago is because after Hitler&#x27;s death, the copyright on Mein Kampf fell to the state of Bavaria (for convoluted reasons), and Bavaria just never reprinted it, nor gave license to reprint it. Therefore, any copying of the book was piracy and was prosecuted under piracy laws. Because German copyright ends 70 years after the death of the author, this no longer applies, and the book can be printed and distributed again.Note that public distribution of the book for nazi propaganda purposes is still banned under German hate speech laws (\"Volksverhetzung\") - not because it is this particular book, but because all nazi propaganda in public is blanket banned. This is why the now-released official Bavarian-government-approved copy of Mein Kampf contains additional commentary by historians to situate Hitler&#x27;s remarks in historic context. reply autoexec 47 minutes agorootparent> The reason Mein Kampf could not be distributed until a few years ago is because after Hitler&#x27;s death, the copyright on Mein Kampf fell to the state of Bavaria (Bavaria used copyright to enforce an \"unofficial\" ban on the book. It&#x27;s ridiculous to try to paint the situation as one where Bavaria just never got around to reprinting it. reply indigo945 43 minutes agorootparentThis was of course intentional, but you incorrectly claimed that > To their credit they&#x27;ve also relaxed a bit over the years. For example, > they lifted the ban on Mein KampfThis just never happened. No ban was ever lifted. This does not show some change in the German mindset towards being more tolerant of Nazi speech, as you insinuate. The copyright expired - that is all. reply raxxorraxor 2 hours agorootparentprevPretty much sums it up. Also of note is that Germany already had and still has laws against numerous forms of speech, most notably anything that could threaten the public order, which you could mold into a justification to basically stop any speech. The only thing preventing that isn&#x27;t a law, it is the overall political culture. But with polarization rising, it can quickly become more serious.Most of these laws stems from a time where monarchy wanted to suppress unsanctioned speech.The Nazis made a lot of political capital because people wanted them banned and censored. Of course that was just political play and they set new standards for suppression of information and propaganda, but that came after they got into power. reply indigo945 49 minutes agorootparentnext [–]> Also of note is that Germany already had and still has laws against numerous forms > of speech, most notably anything that could threaten the public order, which you > could mold into a justification to basically stop any speech.Germany has no laws against \"anything that could threaten the public order\". This is just unsubstantiated nonsense.There are laws against hate speech: \"Volksverhetzung\", a more direct translation: \"incitement of the people\", i.e. hate speech with the intent of causing mob violence or the persecution of minorities. There are also laws against disrupting the public order: \"Erregung öffentlichen Ärgernisses\", so \"causing public offence\", but those don&#x27;t really target speech, they&#x27;re more about taking your pants off in public and peeing on the sidewalk.Also, neither of those laws are from the time of the monarchy. > The Nazis made a lot of political capital because people wanted them banned and > censored. Of course that was just political play and they set new standards for > suppression of information and propaganda, but that came after they got into > power.The Nazis also made a lot of political capital because people didn&#x27;t ban them for democratic and free-speech reasons.

Very short sighted, both forwards and backwards reply foldr 2 hours agorootparentprevSure, pretty much everyone except extreme libertarians agrees that there are limits to private property rights that can be overriden in certain circumstances. However, if we (rightly) force businesses not to discriminate on the grounds of race, then it seems logically consistent to also allow businesses to refuse to associate with racists. I am not sure how someone could be ok with government intervention to prevent \"whites only\" restaurants and yet not ok with the government merely refraining from interfering with businesses that voluntarily choose not to associate with racists. reply Dylan16807 38 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a great policy, but it makes sense to me.Running a whites-only business overlaps but is different from being racist.In this scenario, it would be weird to force your business to associate with whites-only businesses. But those are illegal, so you&#x27;re not forced to do that. You&#x27;re only forced to work with racists that don&#x27;t run whites-only businesses. reply foldr 23 minutes agorootparentYes, I suppose there is a logically consistent space there, but not one that seems either appealing or consistent with the way the legal lines have been drawn in the US. For example, as it is not illegal in the US to express hatred for people of a particular ethnicity, should bakeries therefore be required to bake &#x27;Ethnicity X sucks&#x27; cakes? That seems both absurd and inconsistent with the eventual outcome of the Masterpiece Cakeshop case.My overall point here is that it does not make much sense to object to the freedom of association arguments being made in this thread on the grounds that similar arguments were used to support discrimination against Black Americans prior to the Civil Rights Act. The Civil Rights Act recognized racism as a unique evil that required special legal remedy; it did not recognize racists as requiring special legal protection. So, yes, freedom of association permits you to avoid associating with racists but does not (in all cases) permit you to avoid associating with people of a particular ethnicity. reply nonethewiser 7 hours agorootparentprevFreedom of speech is a pretty fundamental value.

Free speech has never guaranteed anyone a platform.That&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. Yes, it can be messy. Yes, it can be abused. Yes, it means social media companies are allowed to ban you for any reason they like, just as restaurants are allowed to refuse you service.

To be clear, filing a complaint is simply an online form. This does not involve or require lawyers or any expense.The TLDR version is: We filed it as a violation of HB2282, Washignton State&#x27;s Net Neutrality &#x2F; Open Internet laws, the AG thought it was an appropriate complaint and forwarded it to HE. This gives them 21 days to respond. They (HE) responded relatively quickly, basically saying, \"Nah, no we didn&#x27;t and no we don&#x27;t block access to it\". At this point it&#x27;d be up to us to fight it further. We&#x27;re not their direct customer, nor will we ever be (now).

I have a class interest. I am not interested in convincing you one way or another. If arguments actually worked to protect our rights then we wouldn&#x27;t have to go through this merry-go-round of nonsense every few years. I am stating quite simply that the proletariat has certain rights and attempting to infringe upon the same as the bourgeoisie has done for the last decade is a sure-fire way to result in the same being subject to boycott and ruin... and if you don&#x27;t think that is the case then ask Budweiser how they&#x27;re doing at their next quarterly earnings report.My only message is for bourgeoisie who may be reading: If you value your profits then maybe you should consider leaving your customers the hell alone, because the incident with Budweiser shows that customers incensed with your manipulations can and will stop doing business with you. No one is exempt from this fact, including ISPs, NSPs, payment processors, or other intermediaries who perhaps justifiably think that they are untouchable.Lest there be any room for doubt: KiwiFarms has been under assault for the better part of a year and change... and now we&#x27;re talking about it on Hacker News.

He went on to describe specifically xenophobia (\"The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate\") but he went on to argue its transformation is deeper (\"It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.\")This is part of him exalting capitalism for laying the groundwork that he believed would make socialism possible. E.g. later:> The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?So this notion of making an argument that it is about class couched in left wing terms does not change that by that same left wing thinking, this process is progressive. Not by intent, but firstly because bigotry and hate is bad for business, as your yourself point out when you talk of Budweiser boycott (ironically mostly benefiting a more progressive company), and so while some short term losses will be had by people pushing to hard too fast, the regressive parts of the working classes will not just be left to its own, but will be battered over and over by both the bourgeoisie and the progressive parts of the working classes, because bigotry and hate is bad not just for business but also for people. reply bemusedthrow75 4 hours agorootparentprev> Attempting to equate this with child porn (yes, call it what it is rather than the euphemism-du-jour CSAM)The reason the world has moved on from calling it \"child porn\" is- because the world has generally moved on from thinking consensual pornography is always morally indefensible- because consensual pornography is generally legal- and so because \"porn\" doesn&#x27;t truly describe what is happeningIt&#x27;s not a euphemism.

There could be a future where different T1 ISPs block different sites so there is no way to browse the entire internet using a single ISP, but instead you have to cleverly pick a different ISP for each destination IP to get it properly routed. reply kristjank 1 hour agoprevI hate how Kiwi Farms has become the benchmark for so many important concepts relating to internet freedom. As much as I think the world would be a better place with them being forever banished to the onion realm, I can&#x27;t really defend HE and other service providers drafting their own visions of internet code of ethics, then enforcing them on other people&#x27;s traffic. A smaller ISP would probably start losing business over such concerns, but HE is so large, almost all of internet traffic touches them at some point, so their ability to moderate is not even impacted by their business decisions.Defending a company&#x27;s AUP&#x2F;ToS is reasonable when the company is reasonably sized, but HE is clearly over that limit. When a company gets too big to fail (banking also comes to mind) due to providing crucial societal function, there should be very strict restrictions on what they&#x27;re allowed to moderate. This also applies to big industry conglomerates (oil, pharmaceuticals).Another part of the problem seem to be various lazy officials not prosecuting these sites on the basis of obvious crimes involved in their operation.I really appreciate EFF defending the obviously neutral approach here. reply jauer 11 hours agoprevYawn. Non-telco(*1) Tier 1 provider declines to carry routes for an entity they don&#x27;t like. Happens all the time. This is why you buy from a Tier 2 instead and bypass DFZ(*2) politics.Drop routes from spammers: Spamhaus DROP list. Drop routes from DDoS sources? All the time.Even Google wasn&#x27;t reachable from Cogent over IPv6 for years because of a business dispute. For all we know someone working at HE was targeted by KF and this is a security response (also generally allowed even if you are a regulated provider).*1: Cogent & HE thread the needle around being a common carrier (they don&#x27;t sell voice or TDM service) or a broadband provider, which is why KF&#x27;s WA state complaint will fail (WA&#x27;s law only applies to mass-market retail providers, which HE is not).*2: Tier 1 does not mean \"best carrier\" it means \"carrier that doesn&#x27;t pay another carrier for routes.\" DFZ literally means default-free zone as in they don&#x27;t have a default route to another provider. reply mid-kid 10 hours agoparent> Happens all the time.As this is the first time I hear of this, I&#x27;m curious.

I completely believe in limits to free speech on a case by case basis, online and otherwise. For example, I think HN would be a worse place without moderation, same with Reddit, I think my home country Canada would be a worse place without hate speech laws, etc.Not against limits to free speech online, but I think ISPs are the wrong layer for them. Governments can go after specific sites carrying out illegal activities, online communities can moderate themselves to avoid devolving into 4chan, but ISPs shouldn’t make censorship decisions, it’s just too broad a reach&#x2F;impact for a private company. reply raxxorraxor 2 hours agoparentHN is moderated, but I cannot imagine many opinions that really would be outright banned or suppressed. It has strong requirements to the form, but not necessarily the content of the message itself. That is in essence not the topic people complain about, otherwise they probably wouldn&#x27;t post.I am a free speech absolutist though, I tend to like the term too because I believe its intended derisiveness is mostly impotent. Overall I believe trying to enforce hate speech laws is fundamentally flawed. I think people should be free to express acceptance as they should be able to express rejections. reply kredd 54 minutes agorootparentQuite a lot of opinions get suppressed over here, and rightly so. You can see a lot of flagged comments in hot threads.I grew up with unrestricted access to internet as a child, browsed a lot of forums, and most of them were always heavily moderated as well. The thing is, the majority of audience (read-only people) don’t want to see extremely stupid content (subjective). Thus the mods, host and etc. have to play the balancing game. HN is one of those places, and they’re doing a terrific job, in my opinion.I’m not sure how to put it into words, but Internet is not the same as public free speech. Anonymity, physical distance, not seeing others’ faces contribute to the way people talk. I completely support the former kind, but not the latter. It just becomes a breeding ground for a lot of naive people who start thinking that’s tolerable to act that way in real world too (can’t cite any sources, just observations from my nephews and others kids I know). We like to tout how everyone forms their own opinions, but I’m a heavy believer of the “nurture” side of the debate. If you get sucked into one corner of the Internet, you will start hating the other corner, and that’s basically your nurturing. I guess, the major question is, should we keep fostering this behaviour or not? And I don’t know the answer, as there isn’t “one right corner” most of the time. The best I can do is to support the crackdown on extremely obvious shitty behaviour knowing that’s against the free speech ethos. reply chonkerz 2 hours agoparentprevKiwifarms makes shell companies so the hosting provider is a confederate and the only way to terminate service is to go over their head and complain to the upstream.

In that mode, nothing is sent to the other end until the user presses return. A MiTM only \"sees\" one packet no matter what, and with padding they can&#x27;t even infer the password length.For a time, there was rich pickings in applications that accepted passwords in unbuffered mode. Many of them doing it so that they could echo \"*\" symbols, character by character, as the user typed. That simple feature looks cool, and does give the user feedback ... but would leak the keystroke rate, which is the last thing you want on password entry.I hope we preserve buffered I&#x2F;O for password entry, because it&#x27;s still better than what ssh can do with some obfuscation. But it&#x27;s great to see ssh add this, and will help protect content that can&#x27;t be buffered, like shell and editor input. reply pbhjpbhj 17 hours agoparentAside, I&#x27;ve noticed that the current technique of rendering a fixed number of asterisks independent of the password length is quite confusing to users -- \"that&#x27;s wrong, it&#x27;s the wrong length\", resulting in attempts to type in the \"correct\" password and this obviating the benefit of the stored password.Not sure how to fix that. I recall a visible hash of some form being used in the past (eg take a 2-digit hash, pair of with a smiley; I must have entered it right, it&#x27;s showing me ROFL smiley), but that would aid shoulder surfed password entries, at least. reply yencabulator 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen a GUI password input field that mutated an abstract line drawing on every keypress.

There&#x27;s a plugin to Keepass2Android that I use to type passwords from my phone. I use that to unlock my password manager (using a giant untypable passphrase).

But...it&#x27;s easy to slip up now and then and forget you&#x27;re actually putting in a password while screen sharing that it&#x27;s probably best not to have your co-workers know! Obviously the worst is your actual O&#x2F;S password, as knowing that could potentially allow a co-worker access to other passwords that are quite sensitive, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even possible to screen share your O&#x2F;S login screen - probably shouldn&#x27;t be! It is a good argument for not re-using that password for any browser-based logins, but SSO policies tend to make that impossible unfortunately. Mind you I use a pin for my O&#x2F;S login screen, whereas for browser-based logins you can&#x27;t. reply axus 15 hours agorootparentprevSadly I think security systems will have to accommodate the possibility that someone else can see your screen.

It&#x27;s either a physical or virtual server you more or less control, in which case the siblings&#x27; answers apply.

Injecting a public key does. reply vladvasiliu 12 hours agorootparentThe password needs to be generated somehow, right?

They likely don&#x27;t have the right network settings anyway to drop them right into the bigger LAN.Otherwise I think you just prepare a certificate ahead of time, and scp it during the first connection, then immediately disable password-based access, or at least change the password. Any passive eavesdropping still needs to defeat the encryption somehow (no feasible ways are known now), even having seen the initial exchange.If you have an active MITM attack, all bets are off, because the attacker could even grab the image with the pre-baked key you&#x27;re sending, and copy or change the key.

Cool, thanks for the reply!Money quote from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mosh.org&#x2F;#techinfo :Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted by the client&#x27;s terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of the current screen state. The problem becomes one of state-synchronization: getting the client to the most recent server-side screen as efficiently as possible.This is accomplished using a new protocol called the State Synchronization Protocol, for which Mosh is the first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams are encrypted and authenticated using AES-128 in OCB3 mode. ... Roaming with SSP becomes easy: the client sends datagrams to the server with increasing sequence numbers, including a \"heartbeat\" at least once every three seconds. ...Instant local echo and line editingThe other major benefit of working at the terminal-emulation layer is that the Mosh client is free to scribble on the local screen without lasting consequence. We use this to implement intelligent local echo. The client runs a predictive model in the background of the server&#x27;s behavior, hypothesizing that each keystroke will be echoed at the cursor location and that the backspace and left- and right-arrow keys will have their traditional effect. But only when a prediction is confirmed by the server are these effects actually shown to the user. (In addition, by default predictions are only displayed on high-delay connections or during a network “glitch.”) Predictions are done in epochs: when the user does something that might alter the echo behavior — like hit ESC or carriage return or an up- or down-arrow — Mosh goes back into making background predictions until a prediction from the new batch can be confirmed as correct.Thus, unlike previous attempts at local echo with TELNET and RLOGIN, Mosh&#x27;s local echo can be used everywhere, even in full-screen programs like emacs and vi. reply howeyc 15 hours agorootparentprevI would assume that doesn&#x27;t work well for text editing. reply darkclouds 18 hours agoparentprev> Keystroke timing has been a concern for terminal I&#x2F;O since the 1980s and folks were using primitive encryption with stelnet and kerberos.I had a visual basic AI addon in the 1990&#x27;s that could work out who was typing at the keyboard from their typing pattern within a few minutes of typing, which kind of rendered the logon process mute.Today, that can applied to touchscreen logons by tying finger pressure patterns ie size and shape of finger contact with the touchscreen to a user, and when incorporating swipes or mouse movements in the desktop OS context, its possible to have a security app which can lock a system if someone is using a device and user account which is not theirs.At the very least you can log every time one&#x27;s GF&#x2F;missus has gone through your phone. reply placesalt 18 hours agorootparent> mutemoot? reply pkulak 18 hours agorootparentLike a cow’s opinion. reply zoklet-enjoyer 18 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the 4chan guy reply 14u2c 17 hours agorootparentNah it&#x27;s a brand of synthesizer. reply pessimizer 16 hours agorootparentNo, the meaning of \"moot\" is clear.

I did. In bridge there&#x27;s a rule where if your partner gives you a hint not via the bidding, you must take the opposite approach if logically possible. It is called \"Active Ethics\". I had an interviewer try to lead me by the nose to the answer way too hard, in a debugging interview. So I&#x27;d stop and check EVERYTHING I could think of first before doing what he said.

The interviewer is allowed to give you hints or suggestions, and they&#x27;re very interested in how well the candidate takes hints.And sometimes the hint can be a trick! I recently did an interview where the interviewer asked if I should use a shortcut to compare two strings, one that assumed there&#x27;s only one way to normalize a string. I almost fell for it, but then I hesitated and mentioned that I was concerned about some languages where that assumption wouldn&#x27;t hold.

Always work from the symptoms to the problem. replysingron 16 hours agorootparentprevIt probably wasn&#x27;t the situation in your case, but I often give straightforward hints if the candidate is struggling with something that I don&#x27;t want them to spend time on so we can get to the significant material.E.g. in an algorithms interview they get stuck on an unrelated python issue (many people interview in python but don&#x27;t use it day to day), or in a system design interview they get stuck on designing extra-credit subsystem C when they haven&#x27;t finished subsystems A and B.If they aren&#x27;t getting it after a couple hints, I&#x27;ll just tell them the answer or tell them to come back to it later.Anyway, I would be very careful if you aren&#x27;t going where the interviewer is pointing you.

This is amazing!” but then reading about how real bridge tournaments run, yeah, they crafted the rules to remove every single one of those cool implications.[EDIT] to be fair, the basic rules would also result in a terrible game as soon as people got too good at exploiting them. I just think they’ve managed to find another way to ruin the game while keeping it technically playable. reply cge 14 hours agorootparentThe extent to which this just seems to be openly true is startling. Some games, in response to new strategies that are particularly effective, by embracing them and setting aside older approaches. Some games respond by rebalancing and changing rules to keep the game working well. Bridge just bans the strategies themselves (eg, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strong_pass and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Highly_unusual_method ). reply ilc 13 hours agorootparentStrong Pass there&#x27;s very good reasons to outlaw. It is simply too destructive a method to yield an interesting game.HUMs also tend to end up being very destructive to the opponents, because they really don&#x27;t understand the full implications of the bid. And may not have discussed how to bid over it. Heck I&#x27;ve run into this with people playing over a strong club system, and they haven&#x27;t discussed what 2C means.In the end... many games end up with a few rules to make them interesting. I will not defend the ACBL here, I think the WBC is pretty much on the mark last I watched. reply grayfaced 14 hours agorootparentprevBridge has a built in channel for communication that has very limited bandwidth. The bidding conventions are about maximizing how much you communicate with limited symbols and almost no attempt at secrecy. Effectively it&#x27;d turn the game into one where players play with their hands face up, because that&#x27;s the most effective way to communicate. That doesn&#x27;t sound very interesting to me. reply umanwizard 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to invent a version of bridge where surreptitious information-passing is part of the game, more power to you, but it’s not the same game. reply ilc 13 hours agorootparentprevQuite untrue.There is this thing called \"Bridge Judgement\" that you are allowed to use.Just because your hand has 10 HCP... but has 13 spades... doesn&#x27;t mean you will pass. You&#x27;ll bid your 7 Spades and call it a day.Bridge has many shades of grey. It is learning how to dance them correctly that is hard. reply pessimizer 17 hours agorootparentprev> Information-passing is a human skill that adds a dimension to the game.Nah. You choose the game that you prefer. You can play the game where you cheat all the time, but don&#x27;t play it with people who like bridge without asking them first. reply air7 18 hours agoparentprevWow, looking at this with a red-team cap on, there is so much human \"messiness\" to exploit here. It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard too be able to pass a bit or two of information. reply pessimizer 16 hours agorootparentIt might be interesting for a security person to try to come up with ways to hypothetically assure a trustworthy bridge game, assuming no limits on costs or inconvenience (i.e. if a trustworthy bridge game takes three months to play, or requires launching a satellite into orbit, so be it.) reply googlryas 19 hours agoparentprevIt seems there is still a possibility for passing information. For example, you can shove the little table across the barrier, or slowly slide it to indicate something. That&#x27;s how the guy in the upper right passed it the first and second time. reply pessimizer 17 hours agorootparentThere are endless ways to pass information. Notice the sibling comment about \"active ethics.\" It&#x27;s the game sort of saying \"there&#x27;s really no fool-proof way to keep you from cheating, so please just be a good person. Even to the point that if you&#x27;re put into a situation where you could accidentally cheat, you should intentionally play non-optimally.\" reply IshKebab 16 hours agoparentprevBridge is a really weird game. It&#x27;s all about secret communication with your partner, but it&#x27;s not allowed to be secret. You can communicate, but no communication! Very odd. reply hotnfresh 15 hours agorootparentBridge tournament rules are crafted as if everyone involved wishes they were playing a different game, but are for some reason stuck with the basic rules of Bridge. There’s a pile of rules about how you aren’t allowed to do all kinds of things that the basic rules would enable.It’s like if baseball couldn’t change field size or mound height or whatever and just had to add lots of rules about how you aren’t allowed to throw too fast or hit too far et c., but kept the physical reality of the game the same. reply pessimizer 16 hours agorootparentprevCommunication through bidding is fascinating. Any type of collusion during any kind of auction is fascinating. reply omeid2 13 hours agoprevLink to the actual commit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openssh&#x2F;openssh-portable&#x2F;commit&#x2F;7603ba712... reply djmdjm 4 hours agoparentIt also depends on the previous one for the PING&#x2F;PONG messages used to simulate keystrokes and terminal echo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openssh&#x2F;openssh-portable&#x2F;commit&#x2F;dce6d80d2... reply some_random 19 hours agoprevI know some people do network monitoring for hands-on-keyboard shells (presumably) by measuring packet timing, I wonder if this will mess with those detections and if so by how much. reply cyrnel 19 hours agoparentI hope that kind of thing goes the way of other corporate efforts to break&#x2F;backdoor encryption for the sake of \"security\". IMO, it&#x27;s really the wrong way to go about security. Sure it would be nice to know if some automated script is being used to log into a machine, but better design can mean that information isn&#x27;t important. reply some_random 18 hours agorootparentThis has nothing to do with breaking encryption and of all the sketchy corporate surveillance tooling that&#x27;s deployed for security purposes (so say nothing of HR purposes) monitoring for shells on the network seems about as benign as it comes. reply cyrnel 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s only benign if we don&#x27;t see new policies that say \"everyone must disable keystroke obfuscation so we can still spy on traffic\".If a company&#x27;s security strategy relies on the ability to tell if a given stream of encrypted bytes is shell traffic, and that it can be fooled by timing obfuscation, they need a better strategy. Attackers won&#x27;t care to follow a \"no timing obfuscation\" policy. reply hedora 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve definitely encountered security teams that thrash between different broken policies. For instance, one employer simultaneously had these two policies:- All developer laptops must be able to log into prod- You must type a 2FA pin each time you access the test environment, and that includes nightly automation scripts.I imagine they&#x27;d love to run a thing that detected and blocked scripted access to the test environment, but allowed it in production.(In case it isn&#x27;t obvious, I agree that corporate security teams shouldn&#x27;t use strange network monitoring heuristics to interfere with common engineering and ops workflows.) reply gcoakes 19 hours agoparentprevWhat non-malicious use case is there for this? reply some_random 19 hours agorootparentNetwork monitoring for unauthorized&#x2F;unusual access, reading more into how this works I don&#x27;t think this would actually change anything, you can probably still discern scripted vs manual shells it would just be a bit harder. reply eli 19 hours agorootparentprevpresumably for checking compliance with a policy that forbids it reply monocasa 17 hours agoprevDoes mosh do something similar? It seems like that&#x27;d be way more effective in a protocol that&#x27;s already much more tolerant of random latency spikes already. reply baggy_trough 20 hours agoprevSending a packet every 20ms seems like a lot of extra traffic. reply Karellen 19 hours agoparentAn empty IPv4 packet is 20 bytes, and an empty IPv6 packet is 40 bytes. An empty TCP header is 20 bytes. Therefore, if you want to send a single byte over TCP, you need 41 bytes over TCP&#x2F;IPv4, or 61 bytes over TCP&#x2F;IPv6.Let&#x27;s call that 64 bytes&#x2F;packet for a small packet.20ms&#x2F;packet = 50 packets&#x2F;sec = 3200 bytes&#x2F;sec = 3.125KiB&#x2F;s.For comparison, a copper-wire non-broadband modem in the early &#x27;90s ran at 33.6kbps (kilobits&#x2F;sec) which worked out at 4.1KiB&#x2F;s. So a packet every 20ms wouldn&#x27;t even saturate 30-year old modem tech. And believe me, that was slooooooow! reply djmdjm 4 hours agorootparentyeah, keeping the total bandwidth used to be less than a dialup modem connection was an explicit goal when choosing the 20ms default interval. reply SoftTalker 19 hours agorootparentprevIn the early 90&#x27;s I was still using 2400 baud, maybe 9600 reply aidenn0 17 hours agorootparentI went from 2400 to 14.4; 9600 was the limit before trellis modulation, but IIRC it jumped from 14.4 to 33.6 rather quickly.[edit]After some quick googling, 33.6 wasn&#x27;t standardized until 1996 (compare to 14.4 in 1991), but the manufacturers released modems ahead of the V.34 standard with DSPs so that they could be upgraded to the standard when it was available.14.4 did catch on almost overnight in the early 90s though as the modems were no more expensive (and sometimes cheaper) than slower modems. reply xoxxala 17 hours agorootparentprevYou kids and your high-speed 2400 baud modems. When I was dialing up, we had 300 baud AppleCats and we liked it. reply CWuestefeld 16 hours agorootparentI had an Atari 800, with an MPP-1000c modem. Those babies could, when connected to another modem of the same model, push the speed up to 450 baud. They were odd devices, connecting to the computer through one of its joystick ports. reply robertlagrant 18 hours agorootparentprevI remember 56k (V90!) in the late 90s. I can&#x27;t remember when 36k came in, though. reply nullc 13 hours agorootparentThe 56k was only in one direction, made possible by having the ISP modem on an ISDN PRI. In that configuration the only ADC in the fast direction is the high resolution one in the modem. reply chaxor 11 hours agorootparentprevThe US hasn&#x27;t really improved infrastructure since the 90s though. So yeah, it&#x27;s slow, but it&#x27;s also still that slow for many people. reply Ensorceled 19 hours agoparentprevOnly while you are typing and for a random time period after you stop. 50 packets per second, while I&#x27;m typing, doesn&#x27;t seem like too many packets. reply baggy_trough 18 hours agorootparentOK, it wasn&#x27;t very clear if this was all the time or what. reply ajsnigrutin 19 hours agoparentprevI didn&#x27;t read the code, but as I understood it, it was more like a frame rule (\"imagine a bus stop...\"), where your keystrokes will be delayed&#x2F;buffered for a few milliseconds and then sent in regular 20ms interval bursts reply toast0 19 hours agoparentprevFortge chaff packets, sure. But aggregating keystrokes for 20 ms into one packet may save data. reply Goz3rr 18 hours agorootparentI can type pretty fast (100+ WPM) but I&#x27;m sure as hell not getting multiple keystrokes into a 20ms window reply capableweb 20 hours agoparentprevGuess that&#x27;d depend on how big the packet ends up being. reply gruez 19 hours agorootparentTCP has an overhead of 20 bytes. I&#x27;m not sure how much openssh adds, but if it&#x27;s just a keystroke I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;d be over 64 bytes. Add those together and multiply by 50 packets per second (20ms between each packet), and it works out to a whopping 4.2kB&#x2F;s. reply raverbashing 20 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s a nice security feature, trueThough I&#x27;m curious how does the project keep working with CVS in $year, I wonder if everybody just uses git cvsimport and just forgets about CVS most of the time reply isamuel 17 hours agoparent“No mention of openbsd on the internet is complete without a long thread about source control migration.” — tedu@ reply heffer 19 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s an explanation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cvs.afresh1.com&#x2F;~andrew&#x2F;o&#x2F;why-cvs.html reply simias 19 hours agorootparentAll of these reasons boil down to \"if it ain&#x27;t broke\" and \"that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re used to\".Switching VCS for a project of this size is always complicated and OpenBSD devs are famously \"old school\" and conservative with their software choices.I used to use CVS before switching to SVN and later DCVS like Mercurial and Git.

But the key line of “we all know cvs” is effectively exclusionary to all the other developers in the world who don’t use cvs. At some point they will need new talent which will be harder to get. reply arp242 18 hours agorootparentIf you know git or any other version control then using CVS really isn&#x27;t that hard; many commands are similar.And everything is exclusionary to someone. Pure git email workflow? Exclusionary to people who find it hard&#x2F;difficult, or use email in a different way (e.g. only gmail web UI). GitHub Pull Request workflow? Exclusionary to people who don&#x27;t want to run non-free JS, or don&#x27;t want to use \"Micro$oft GitHub\", or don&#x27;t like using web interfaces. reply hnfong 19 hours agorootparentprevAccusing on of the first pioneers of Open Source as being \"exclusionary\" has got to be a joke.In many ways, they were there first.I really don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s such a tendency to demand \"monolithic social networks\" even in open source software development. Connecting to people is great when feelings are mutual, but we don&#x27;t even have a right to be left alone without being accused of being anti-social? reply TheHappyOddish 19 hours agorootparentprevBased on that rationale, anyone using Typescript is being exclusionary to developers who don&#x27;t know Typescript.They picked a system that suits the projects work flow, is well documented and a relatively low learning curve for anyone interested. I doubt cvs would be the main turnoff for someone looking to be an OpenBSD developer. reply raverbashing 19 hours agorootparent> that suits the projects work flow, is well documented and a relatively low learning curve for anyone interestedMaybe well documented, but \"suits the project flow\" and \"low learning curve\", absolutely not(I mean, ok, maybe \"low learning curve\" if you&#x27;re developing a very simple UNIX project in the 90s)CVS is one of the tools where I literally never look back and say \"ok this was nice\". SVN and Mercurial something here and there. CVS? Never reply oofbey 19 hours agorootparentprevThat argument would be more analogous if you picked say CoffeeScript. The point is it’s something that used to be reasonably popular but for reasons the vast majority of the world has moved on from. reply SoftTalker 19 hours agorootparentprevCVS isn&#x27;t hard to learn; it&#x27;s not a barrier for someone who&#x27;s interested in working on OpenBSD in the first place. reply hnfong 19 hours agorootparentCVS isn&#x27;t \"hard to learn\", devs worthy enough to make meaningful contributions to OpenBSD can probably make sense of it in less than a day.

That was millions of people. In that space, it had no competitors.Ruby ended up &#x27;specializing&#x27; in web dev, because of Rails. But when Node and React came out, Ruby on Rails had to compete with Nodejs + React &#x2F; MERN as a way of building a web app. Since people first learning programming to build a web app would usually start with javascript anyway (since a lot of very first projects might not even need a backend), it was a lot easier for the Nodejs&#x2F;React route to become the default path. Whereas if you were a data scientist, you started on python, and as you got better, you basically just kept using python. reply dmazzoni 13 hours agoparentI think Python was popular as a general-purpose language first. After all, there was a reason people put so much effort into writing Numpy in the first place.I think a lot of people were attracted to the language design, as captured in the Zen of Python (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0020&#x2F;), such as:Explicit is better than implicit.Readability counts.Errors should never pass silently (unless explicitly silenced)There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.In many cases, Ruby has almost the opposite philosophy.

This point is forgotten some 20-30 years latter reply bb88 10 hours agorootparentNot just perl, but C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Java as well. Ruby was a competitor to Java JSP development back in the day. And I remember when a lot of Java people jumped ship to Ruby. I moved from C++ to python over a decade ago and never looked back.Back then, the python jobs were scarce -- but based upon how I picked up the language, many of the typical C++ issues just disappeared -- and I knew it was going to become popular.One comp sci professor talking at a PyCon years ago made a point that maybe the best college level introductory course probably should not have been SICP based but Python. His example was that for the first time in 5 years of teaching intro courses he had people coming up to him looking to change majors. reply bluGill 9 hours agorootparentC++ and Python are not competitors. Sure both are Turing complete so you can implement anything in either. However if you should is a different question. Python is very difficult to maintain when you program goes over 100k lines of code, while the static type system of c++ is good for millions. C++ compiles to fast binary code, while Python is typically 60x slower for logic (though often Python calls a fast algorithm implemented in a compiled language for anything significant so this is hard to measure in typical programs). However if your programs are not very large and you don&#x27;t need every last bit of speed Python is going to be easier to work with. (And frankly if not working with a legacy c++ codebase you should look at rust, ada, go, or something else i&#x27;m not aware of, c++ has many ugly warts that you shouldn&#x27;t need to worry about) reply germandiago 8 hours agorootparentAs a person who uses C++, I must say something that also applies, somewhat, to Java.We have all the cool kids like Kotlin, Rust, etc.However, when it is about finishing a project, beating C++ or Java ecosystems is almost impossible.Besides that, C++ has improved a lot over time. It still has its warts and knives but you can code very reasonable C++ with a few guidelines and there are also linters, and -Wall -Wextra -Weverything -Werror. That takes you quite far in real life provided you have a reasonable amount of training.I would choose C++ over Rust any day. The only hope I have for C++ successors are Cppfront and Carbon and they are highly experimental. As successors those two fit the bill.There is a third one, my favorite. It is this one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hylo-lang.org&#x2F; but I am not sure how compatible it will&#x2F;would be. reply no_wizard 7 hours agorootparentThe one thing Rust is getting right that I hope Carbon et. al take from it is using the type system to manage memory.not having to explicitly remember `free` in safe Rust code is amazing. Knowing that if my types are sound that memory will be managed reasonably is great.I also think that immutable by default, mutable by explicit declaration is pretty great.I do think there is a lot of room to add better ergonomics on these ideas however reply germandiago 7 hours agorootparentThe amount of complexity that Rust adds is not worth in most scenarios in my opinion. I can think of Rust as something for OS with critical safety or so.Besides that, in real life you end up having C in most of your software, so I am not sure how Rust behaves compared to well-written C++ with all warnings and linters on and using smart pointers. But my hypothesis is that they do not stay very far apart in safety.There are many ways to achieve safety, and the most promising, IMHO, is the path that Hylo programming language is taking. It sticks to Generic programming and mutable value semantics.The language base draws from Swift and it has very strong people behind that know what they are doing. For example David Abrahams and Sean Parent. This is an implementation in a language of many of the ideas from \"Better Code\" from Sean Parent. It has a very solid foundation.Besides being a solid foundation for generic programming, value semantics, and concurrency, what I like the most is how much it simplifies the model by not escaping references all around and preventing unnecessary copies. This removes the (IMHO) mess that is to have to manage reference escaping constantly in Rust, reason why many patterns such as Linked lists are not even possible.And Lists are not just an academic exercise, as I was told sometimes by Rust proponents. Linked structures (Inmutable linked structures actually) are important in scenarios such as TelCo backend where you need replication, fast moving of data and history versioning, rollbacks and so on. reply lelanthran 4 hours agorootparent> The amount of complexity that Rust adds is not worth in most scenarios in my opinion. I can think of Rust as something for OS with critical safety or so.It&#x27;s difficult to have this discussion in any sane way when Rust (or C) comes up. I tried Rust, but I have projects to deliver on strict timelines and I have yet to find a client who is prepared to pay me for the (what I found to be) very large onramp time to gain deep Rust expertise.[1]The argument of \"just get gud\" whenever you point out the deep learning curve of Rust is pointless; I have noticed that Rust experts only come when your employer is rich enough to pay the team to not deliver while they learn it: Basically only FAANGs and startups flush with VC money.[1] When I have a small project I reach for C. When I need something bigger for which C is not suitable, I don&#x27;t reach for C++, or Rust, I rather take the tiny performance hit and move to Go. On extremely large projects, where I work with others, C# and Java seem to hit the sweet spot.[2][2] Although, C# and Java are also getting a bit too complicated for my tastes too. Seems to me that every language follows C++ evolution towards complexity, because the people stewarding the language are experts in that language and&#x2F;or in programming language theory.[3] They are comfortable with the changes they propose because they have no need to upskill (they are already at that skill level).[3] I propose that a language designed by your average corporate developer who has 15 years of experience but no CS degree will have much higher adoption than languages designed by PL purists. reply no_wizard 7 hours agorootparentprevAll this may be true (I&#x27;m not the strongest C++ developer in the world, relatively limited exposure), however the Rust memory management via the type system feels natural once you wrap your head around it. That idea is really good. I always hated dealing with `delete`, `free` and `malloc`.Being able to offload all that busy work to the type system is just nice. There are definitely ergonomic improvements that could be made around this.All the rest?

The language is chock full of implicit behavior, and strongly encourages writing implicit code. From the dynamically typed nature of the language itself, to being able to define dunder methods that change the behavior of comparison and arithmetic operators.I really like Go partly because of this. Not only does the language itself stictly follow the explicit over implicit and TOOWTDI principles, but it encourages or even enforces them on the programmer. reply vonwoodson 10 hours agorootparentIt is absolutely not a meme, it&#x27;s [PEP 20](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0020&#x2F;).

Having your core values right there, well defined and out in front, wasn&#x27;t something you get with a lot of languages. Any language thats been around for a long time gets sorta.. muddled. reply danShumway 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m from the outside looking in so don&#x27;t take me too seriously because I tried Python and bounced off of it; there&#x27;s very likely elegant parts of the language that I never really internalized because I didn&#x27;t spend enough time working with it.But speaking as someone who tried Python because I agree with principles like \"have one right way to do things\" and \"be explicit\", my initial impression working with language is that much like real souls, Python&#x27;s soul is metaphysical, unobservable, and doesn&#x27;t seem to interact much with the physical world in an observable way ;)If I had to list some of my main criticisms of Python it would be that the language seems to have way too much implicit behavior and seems to have way too many ways of doing everything. I&#x27;m going to say something heretical, but it was weirdly enough early Javascript that I found to be a lot more consistent and explicit[0]. Type casting was a disaster of course, dates and the standard APIs were a complete mess, but beyond that it was rare for me to look at Javascript code and think \"I have no idea what the heck that is doing.\" But it happened all the time in Python, it took me a while to get used to things and I still feel generally less capable in Python than I do in other languages that I&#x27;ve spent less time working with. There&#x27;s so many little syntactic tricks in the language that are... convenient, but I resent having to memorize all of them.[0]: Until it started messing around with classes and const and Symbols and crap -- the language is probably much harder to learn now than it used to be in the past, but I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;m disconnected from new users now. But certainly having 3 ways to declare a variable now probably doesn&#x27;t help new users.----As an example, just this weekend I tried to convert a Python codebase from 2.0 to 3.0 and was immediately hit by needing to resolve implicit casting rules about integers, buffers, and strings that were all different now. Python has this weird thing where sometimes it does implicit casting behind the scenes and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t? There&#x27;s probably a rule about it, but it&#x27;s never been explained to me.So then I wanted to figure out the best way to handle converting a string of hex values into a manageable format so I searched that up and got advised that I should use `struct.unpack` except to be careful because that would give me a tuple instead of a list and also would require me to pass in the length, so instead I should actually use `map(ord, s)`, which prints out something that certainly seems to look like a list, but is not subscriptable, which is not a thing that I knew that I needed to care about but apparently do because the program broke until I cast it back to a list. And probably what I should have done was list comprehension from the start? But it wasn&#x27;t clear to me if I could do list comprehension on a string or not since I do know that strings in Python technically aren&#x27;t lists, they&#x27;re sequences, and anyway list comprehension was not what people were suggesting.And I know it&#x27;s unfair because this is very beginner stuff in the language, but my immediate thought was, \"oh right, Python. Of course when my debugger prints out something that looks like an array of values it might be one of 3 or 4 different types behind the scenes, all of which will error for subtly different reasons. It was silly of me not to see this coming.\"Again, fully aware that this is basic stuff that would completely go away with familiarity with the language, but like.. oh my goodness my kingdom for having one array type that just works everywhere and one iterable quality that supports the same manipulations everywhere no matter what the underlying type is. I&#x27;m trying to do quick scripts, if I cared about these distinctions and if I cared enough about performance to need multiple ways to have a list of values, I&#x27;d have written this in Rust or at least C# or some fully typed lower-level language. There doesn&#x27;t need to be this many ways in a scripting language to say \"I have an ordered collection of values.\"I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, I suspect you&#x27;re right. I suspect the underlying language is much more elegant than what I&#x27;m seeing. All I&#x27;m saying is just that the initial impressions of Python for people like me who are really inexperienced with the language are anything but the PEP 20 list -- the impressions are the opposite, it&#x27;s exactly why I bounced off of Python so hard. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s individuals doing something weird, that seems baked into the language? Individuals didn&#x27;t give Python 4 different ways to represent a sequence of values. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a few coders&#x27; fault that I&#x27;m constantly seeing syntax in Python where having the code look prettier seems to be the priority over making it understandable or explicit? Again, take it with a grain of salt, just... I don&#x27;t know, I always laugh when I see the PEP 20 linked because it&#x27;s so contrary to how I think the language looks to new users. I could compare this to something like Lisp, which I am also extremely inexperienced with and extremely bad at writing, but when people talk about Lisp having simple rules, I think, \"yeah, I see that. I see the system that you&#x27;re talking about and I see the consistency you&#x27;re talking about.\" With Python I just don&#x27;t see it, the initial impression makes it feel like a language written by graphic designers trying to create something that&#x27;s pretty rather than systemic. reply sanderjd 5 hours agorootparentFor what it&#x27;s worth, I have come around to really enjoying the more recent versions of python, and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m writing most at the moment, but I totally agree with you here. I don&#x27;t think of python as being explicit and having only one way to do things. I think that&#x27;s a pretty inevitable result of trying to both add new things and also keep older things for compatibility. reply bb88 9 hours agorootparentprevI code both.> explicit over implicitGo was the first language I used that broke an explicit check for nil&#x2F;null&#x2F;None.

It seems Go is the explicit one here.> A library developer might decide to panic and cause your program to crashGo is abundantly clear that panics should never cross package boundaries except in exceptional circumstances. And those exceptions should crash your program. An exception means that the programmer made a mistake and the program is now invalid. There is nothing left to do but crash.It is technically true that a library developer can violate that guidance, but it is strongly encouraged for them to not. The parent did indicate that sometimes the explicitness is only encouraged, not enforced.Not that Go is some kind of explicitness panacea. It has its own fair share of implicitness. But I&#x27;m not sure these two are representative. reply lelanthran 4 hours agorootparentprev> Go was the first language I used that broke an explicit check for nil&#x2F;null&#x2F;None.

It&#x27;s also a decent rationale for changes made from Py2 to Py3 regarding bytes-to-string conversions needing to happen explicitly.It&#x27;s also about how usually you end up explicitly listing imports (wildcard imports exist but are pretty sparing), or lacking implicit type conversions between data types.This stuff is of course dependent on what library you are using, the projects you are working on, etc. And there&#x27;s a certain level of mastery expected. But I think the general ideas exist despite the language allowing for much more in theory. reply exhuma 4 hours agorootparentprevThis held up much better in the earlier days of Python.Sooner or later every sufficiently popular programming language is confronted with the dilemma of either breaking backwards compatibility and&#x2F;or adding \"alternative ways to do things\"Pathlib is an interesting one. It even has a correspondence table [1]. The introduction of pathlib made sense because it is just much nicer to use. But you couldn&#x27;t drop the equivalent functionality in the \"os\" module for backwards compatibility. It&#x27;s just far too widely used.The is no magic bullet for this one. Either you accept introducing duplication in your language or you go through a hard change (f.ex. the Python 2 to 3 change).The softest way to migrate might be to flag functionality as deprecated and give users a fairly long time (talking years) before dropping it. But no matter how much time you give the users there will be users who won&#x27;t change until it&#x27;s too late.So there really isn&#x27;t a winning path for this one.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;pathlib.html#correspondenc... reply jacurtis 12 hours agorootparentprevThat was the one mantra from the zen of python that I always laugh at too.Because my #1 complaint with python is that there are so many ways to do the same thing. It sounds nice in theory if you are a new developer because you can create your own voice in python and character.For example, lets say I gave a simple coding puzzle (think leetcode) to 10 python engineers. I would get at least 8 different responses. A few might gravitate around similar concepts but they would be significantly different.By comparison if I gave the same puzzle to some Go engineers, all of the responses would be probably very close to identical.This sounds fun as a new engineer, like this is an argument for using Python. But as you get older and more experienced you will likely find yourself hating the flexibility of python because as you scan any decent size codebases, you start to be able to identify entire parts of the codebase and who wrote them, without even needing to do a git blame.I am currently an SRE manager who works in a very polyglot environment (primarily Node&#x2F;js, bash&#x2F;sh, python, and Golang with just enough java thrown in to ruin your day). When I read through python codebases, I can identify exactly who wrote it, even past employees. Then when you need to fix it, you often have to adapt to that style as you fix a bug or add an updated feature. This is a little true with Bash because you will see certain engineers always lean towards sed and others towards awk and grep to solve problems depending on their strength, but it is less significant. However, in our Go codebases, everyone writes nearly identical code.I&#x27;ve been writing Python for over a decade and I still learn new features of the language every week or month. Just this week I had to dive into the `ast` library (abstract syntax trees) which was a native module I haven&#x27;t ever touched before. By contrast, I haven&#x27;t had to learn any new core syntax and tools of Go and Bash in a long time. You have a fairly small set of syntax and that&#x27;s it. The power comes in how you use that small set of tools, not learning a new language module.Again, the infinite flexibility sounds nice. But in a corporate environment the strictness of other languages is actually a benefit because it keeps everyone following the same path.I truly believe the mantra from zen of python:> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do itSadly, Python lost this tradition far before I ever became acquainted with the language. And the python3.10+ mentality of supporting everything forever is only going to make it worse overtime. reply lmm 10 hours agorootparentEither you move with the times or you become obsolete. 20 years ago Python codebases were clean and consistent, but language design has moved on, and Python has - barely - kept up with it, so now you have people who know the new ways and people who know the old ways and various stages in between (and it&#x27;s not like they didn&#x27;t try ditching backward compatibility, but that didn&#x27;t work out well either). Go has the luxury of starting 20 years later and being a lot less ambitious, but it&#x27;ll happen to Go too in time. reply hbrn 3 hours agorootparentprev> For example, lets say I gave a simple coding puzzle (think leetcode) to 10 python engineers.

Arguably, what&#x27;s different about Python is that the more senior the engineers you&#x27;re interviewing, the more likely their solutions to converge.Just because something is in the Zen of Python, doesn&#x27;t mean it automatically gets followed by every Python engineer.

I think that most experienced Python developers tend to gravitate towards the same style of solutions for things like coding puzzles (including the classic \"read in data, map it through a comprehension, write out data\" pattern).There are multiple ways of expressing the same thing, but very often in a specific context one of the ways tends to be overwhelmingly a better fit than the other. reply kemayo 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s generally one obvious way to do it.

Sure. reply rout39574 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d suggest \"pythonic\", rather than obvious, for that sentence.

It is now.It didn&#x27;t used to be though. People would wax poetically about how pythonic some codebase was and sing the praises of idiomatic python.

Of those few that depend on the language too bad python violates pretty much all of them. Starting with the very 1st and 2nd line, where significant white spaces (one of the worst idea ever in programming, if you ask me) make block limits implicit in the indentation rather than explicit int he code with clear delimitation marks (brackets, for instance), making in return most of the source code written in it look quite ugly, and as dyslexic I can add not very accessible. Let alone the horrible experience while iterating on a piece of code: 99% of the time you&#x27;re briefly stopped by and error simply because in the iteration some lines got commented out and now the damn thing throws a fit for the indentation. Not really practical in my experience.The reason why one language is more used then others at any given times it&#x27;s way simpler and more bound to humans than the languages them self: - fashion trendes - laziness - slothMost of the people out there writing code and \"increasing numbers for any given language\" have no real idea of why they started with one language rather then some other one, they never really dig deep enough to actually made an informed choice, and most will keep using a single programming language because they \"don&#x27;t feel the need to learn a new one\", aka: I&#x27;m too lazy to ever go deep enough the only language I know, let alone learning a new one. And it&#x27;s the market&#x27;s fault: we spent the last decade or more taunting how many bagilions programmers will be needed, how anyone can get a great life by simply learning a bit how to code, etc. None gave a fuck about quality, the only goal being cheapening and cheapening the Software Developer profession, until neural networks came about and indirectly revealed the truth: we haven&#x27;t being rising SW developers&#x2F;engineers&#x2F;etc, most of them were just Code Typist copying out of stack overflow. If something like copilot or chatGPT can substitute them, it means there wasn&#x27;t much value there in the 1st place. In 2007, Jeff Atwood made the quote that was popularly referred to as Atwood&#x27;s Law: “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”, and that&#x27;s NOT a good thing, it&#x27;s just the epitome of the state of the industry.In python&#x27;s case it&#x27;s luck was google: python (like go, for instance) is a convenient language for system automations, let&#x27;s say a more sane versions of what perl was mostly used for in the past (if you notice, lots of python Zen&#x27;s ideas are attempts to fix perl&#x27;s insanity). Google has lots of system engineering going on, lots of people using (and abusing) python, and a single repo where everything ends up into, and when they started making neural networks with them, python got fashion for making neural networks. Anyone and their dog wanting to try out some kind of machine learning (10+ years ago) would find a tutorial in python, and tensorflow sealed the deal.Yes, numpy and pandas did have quite a bit of weight into luring the Math Community into using python, but there&#x27;s nothing inherent in python that makes them possible, they could have being made in any other language.

Python has fantastic libraries, but it is a mediocre language. Ruby feels like a simpler version of Perl + Smalltalk, and it is a joy to use. Python has intentionally crippled anonymous functions plus syntactic whitespace, which often leads to long and ugly code.I think it is a shame Guido hated functional programming and he did not embrace an Algol-like syntax with begin&#x2F;do end blocks.

Other than PHP, I don&#x27;t really know of any other JIT scripting languages they could have chosen. reply Gualdrapo 12 hours agorootparentI knew about Python in 2006 or so when got into Linux, and at that time (when Python 2 was a thing, iirc it just came out) it was very popular between the FOSS world for doing apps and GUIs (I even toyed a lot with PyGTK), whereas I felt Perl was much more about more \"serious\" stuff like text processing and kind of a sh language with steroids. I just barely heard about Ruby and wasn&#x27;t sure what it was its purpose - I just heard about its \"gems\" but not about Rails. Still as both Python and Perl were FOSS I supposed their niche and user base were going to be around it, as many things FOSS at the time.At 2008 I started my graphic design studies and I just pretty had to forgot about programming (which in hindsight if I had kept doing it I would have a very strong programming background and maybe my life would be much better now, but it is what it is) - but was very surprised to discover around 2011 or so that it seemed _everyone_ was using Python. Like I just blinked and it took over the world somehow. reply BeetleB 12 hours agorootparentprevThere were always other choices. Lua is the main one that comes to mind.The point is that data science use came quite late in the Python world, and the increase in users due to it is incremental. Python was already at 3.x before the ML world adopted it. If the ML world picked another language, Python would still be in the top 5 languages. reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentprevYou arbitrarily restricted the scope. Java is what I saw.I was in college 2006 - 2010 in CS, and while all the introductory courses were in Java, by 2008 or so a lot of the other students had switched to Python on their own, for projects where either language would work. Didn&#x27;t really see anything else, just Java and Python. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentNo, it wasn&#x27;t arbitrary.

The opposite of JIT is AOT (Ahead of Time). JIT languages go through two compilation steps: one to bytecode, and another to native code in runtime. Java is one example of a JIT compiled interpreted language, that also does ahead of time compilation to bytecode, while python compiles to bytecode transparently, but does not do any JIT compilation to native, which is part of the reason it&#x27;s considered a \"slow language\" (though this expression doesn&#x27;t really make any sense, as slowness is a property of the implementation, not of the language).TLDR:Java uses AOT bytecode compilation + JIT compilationPython uses import-time bytecode compilation + slow interpreter reply Phrodo_00 6 hours agorootparent> (though this expression doesn&#x27;t really make any sense, as slowness is a property of the implementation, not of the language)Yes, which is why this is the way CPython works, but PyPy uses JIT and is faster. replysanderjd 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve used both ruby and python extensively, and I don&#x27;t actually consider them to be any different, really, on any of these points. reply mr_toad 9 hours agorootparentprev> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.There’s not even one obvious flavour of Python to use. reply BobbyJo 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard for me to name a problem domain that doesn&#x27;t have 3 different python packages doing the same thing three different ways, each more clever and less understandable than the last. reply psunavy03 8 hours agorootparentWhy TF would you name an HTML parser BeautifulSoup? reply nijave 7 hours agorootparentI Googled it, apparently it comes from this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tag_soup reply psunavy03 3 hours agorootparentOK, I get it, but when I&#x27;m trying to write automation for a shop that isn&#x27;t natively Python-savvy (long story short, it made sense when I started a side project which evolved), if I use that library and ever move on, I now have to document in comments or somewhere WTF \"BeautifulSoup\" means.

Function call polymorphism?Aside: I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the Mathematica language so I wrote \"PyML\" a looooong time ago- it turned unevaluated Python expressions into Mathematica, transmitted them via MathLink to be evaluated the Mathematica kernel, and then the results were send back and converted to a Python expression. This was long before sympy. It never went anywhere (I found ways to simply not depend on Mathematica). reply fluidcruft 9 hours agorootparentYes, function call polymorphism. Especially combined with Mathematica&#x27;s piecewise syntax. I didn&#x27;t really use it for numerics, it was more for Lisp&#x2F;Prolog type things. I was always impressed at how short and readable the Mathematica code ended up being. I used to use Mathematica quite a bit to generate C++ functions.But it&#x27;s a very different use case than Matlab. One of the things I like about python is it isn&#x27;t too bad for sliding between lispy&#x2F;functional modes for some things and more lapacky things elsewhere. Matlab has a better syntax for the lapack parts but trying to do anything functional gets really annoying and very, very slow. But still I would say Mathematica has the best pure math syntax for those sorts of things.

Julia looks pretty cool to me, but I already know Python. I&#x27;ll probably learn more about it in my spare time, but I&#x27;m also never going to be able to convince my coworkers to try it out, because they also know Python and that&#x27;s good enough for them. And thus Python&#x27;s dominance continues. reply ziotom78 1 hour agorootparentI was able to convince my coworkers to stop working on a Python project (a simulator for a scientific instrument) once we all realised that we would have not been able to keep using plain Python because of performance. When the alternatives where (1) to force everybody to learn either C or Fortran, or (2) to rewrite everything in Julia, they asked me to provide examples of both solutions. After I showed them a few different approaches (pybind, cbind, f2py...), there was full consensus for Julia. We moved what we implemented so far (it was not to much, luckily), and so far nobody has regretted the choice.The problem in using two languages is that you do not have just to learn a new language besides Python. You have also to figure out how to properly interface them. (f2py was considered the easiest solution, but we feared that the 1- vs 0-based array indexing would have likely caused many bugs.) reply twelvechairs 12 hours agoparentprevI agree with these as major points. A few other secondary onesRuby was primarily maintained in Japanese, so had a barrier to entry for language level issues.

As python started coming pre-installed on MacOS and was a lot easier than fumbling with shell scripts, a lot of scripts were being written to automate boring stuff. Also, the hidden beast is Django and Flask, which are also being commonly used by both serious and non-serious folks, overall increasing the userbase.Also python is less verbose(compared to Java, C#, Scala, JavaScript pre-ES6 etc.) in terms of syntax, so it is much easier to learn and can do both OOP and Functional, while being easier to adapt(no compiler, easy installation, lots of popular libraries), hence academia picked it up. Also, python has built-in parallel processing features which are less daunting(in terms of concepts and syntax) than other competitors(C++&#x2F;Java etc).See the popularity of Go, same thing happened with Python. reply dgellow 13 hours agoparentprevTo add to your comment, the web space was also already very crowded, with PHP, C#&#x2F;ASP, whatever Java people were using, Django, etc. Rails has always been fairly niche compared to giants like PHP. reply rcarmo 13 hours agorootparentPeople like to hate on PHP (and to be honest I really never enjoyed it), but there was a time when if you wanted to build powerful, large scale websites (or hosting, or scalable web farm deployments) it was the most reliable and performant thing short of Java.It also helped that the PHP ecosystem had some pretty solid and battle tested HTTP components and pretty productive frameworks--server-side rendering with Varnish was as fast as a CDN-backed site feels today. reply CuriouslyC 12 hours agorootparentThe things PHP had that made it win (for a while) was that it was easy to set up and configure for a hosting environment (Apache plus modphp worked out of the box consistently) and the HTML first design made it easy to add to static web pages, whereas forms and CGI was multiple steps and more confusing for less experienced devs. reply cutler 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d qualify that. A lot of the hype around PHP being easy for cheap web hosting misses the point that a lot of that cheap hosting was configured with PHP as a CGI module, not mod_php.

    "originBody": "ABOUT FINANCIAL STARTUPS GET STARTED CAREERS BLOG XTDB FREE CONSULTATION Clojure in Banking: Griffin A fully-regulated, API-driven bank, with Clojure Aug 29, 2023 \"IN A STARTUP, YOU SHOULD BE USING THE MOST POWERFUL LANGUAGE YOU CAN, AND THAT IS CLOJURE.\" Contact us to share your story Griffin is a banking-as-a-service platform and part of the new wave of API-driven banking. Their services allow Fintech businesses to integrate banking features quickly and securely. In March 2023, Griffin was granted their UK banking license by the Financial Conduct Authority, making them a fully-regulated UK bank. We caught up with Allen Rohner, Griffin Co-founder and CTO (also Co-founder of CircleCI), to discuss how they’ve built a bank, from the ground up, using Clojure. Joe: So what does Griffin do? Allen: We are a fully regulated UK bank. We call it “the bank you can build on”. That means we’re like AWS for banking. So there’s an API to onboard a customer, an API to create a bank account, an API to make a payment. By law, fintechs must work with a bank to do these things, and right now that means a legacy high street bank with mainframes. Griffin is the bank plus technology platform that all future fintechs would build on. We got our license in March and we’re still in what’s called ‘mobilization’, which is basically like training wheels. The training wheels come off when we complete an audit, raise some more money, and finish writing the code. That should be Q3 or Q4 this year. Joe: So presumably, the mission of Griffin would be to disrupt the market, have a more modern set of technologies, a better, faster delivery capability than some of the existing banks? Allen: Yeah, exactly. We kind of joke that we’re a tech company that happens to have a banking license. Joe: How did Clojure end up becoming the language of choice for the platform? Allen: I mean, the flippant answer is: because I liked it. The serious answer is: Clojure is the right choice because it’s immutable, it’s powerful; it’s a good fit for financial services and anything that needs an audit log. There is a longer story about how I arrived at Clojure. I graduated from college (you UK folks would say ‘university’) in 2005, and I got a boring enterprise software job and, uh, was pretty unhappy with it. Then I started reading Paul Graham, and he was writing about how you should both start a startup and work in Lisp. And so I said, Hey, let’s do both of those. At the time he was saying, don’t use Common Lisp because it’s old, fragmented, and there wasn’t a good implementation that did everything. There was like one implementation that was good at threads and another implementation that was good at, let’s say, graphics. And if you wanted to do graphics and threads, you were outta luck. He was saying, “Wait, wait, I’m gonna work on this”. The problem with Common Lisp is that it needed a BDFL like Python, and there wasn’t one yet. And so PG was saying, well, “I’ll start Arc”, but he’d been talking about that for multiple years. So then I started writing my own Lisp, got about halfway into it, and then I saw that Rich released Clojure. That was probably 2007 - one of his first announcements. I looked at Clojure and I said, “Well, that’s way better than what I would’ve written”. So then I did a startup that didn’t go anywhere, and then I founded CircleCI in 2011. This is also getting into the history of Griffin as well. I hired David [Jarvis], my co-founder at Griffin, as engineer number nine or so at CircleCI. David later went on to work at Standard Treasury, which was a YC company that was trying to sell modern APIs to US banks. That ended up not working out. Too late in Standard Treasury’s runway, they said, “Instead of trying to sell the banks, let’s become a bank”. They figured that out too late. David always liked the idea and he saw Monzo get authorized in 2017. He said, “Well, if Monzo can get authorized for this retail bank, then we can get authorized for this tech infrastructure bank”. So, by this point, I’d been using Clojure for a decade and it worked great at CircleCI and it was a very good fit for financial services. Joe: So you were coming to Clojure from a Lisp background. Had you worked with JVM languages before that? Allen: Not really. I had, maybe, three months of Java before using Clojure. Before that my prior experience was C and C++, Python, and Ruby. Joe: So did you see the JVM as a benefit or a drawback? People talk about the ‘JVM tax’ (on resources like memory). Were you thinking that way? Allen: I did at first, but my perspective has changed. For the first couple of years I didn’t appreciate it [the JVM]. But now I’ve seen other niche startup languages try to grow, and they run into the library problems and run into problems making the compiler and the runtime fast. It’s become obvious to me that the JVM is a huge benefit. Joe: When you were working on CircleCI and also when you were starting Griffin, were you mindful that this choice of language and technology would have an impact? Did you feel that using Clojure said something about the business? Allen: Yeah, I think it definitely says something about the company, something I thought was good. If we had picked Python, it’s very boring and reliable, and the same could be said of Java. But you’re picking the lowest common denominator. I would say high performers, and the best programmers are often people that will only work in niche languages. The problem is, there are good Java programmers, but there are also thousands of terrible Java programmers. If you pick the right niche, it’s easier to find the high-end talent. I think Paul Graham also made a very strong case that in a startup, you should be using the most powerful language you can, and that is Clojure. FoundationDB Joe: How would you describe the architecture of the Griffin platform? Allen: We’re running Clojure on Kubernetes, on AWS, and we are almost entirely event sourcing. The database is FoundationDB, and this additional proprietary thing that I really need to open source (I ported Datascript to FoundationDB). It’s a Datomic-like layer that writes directly to Foundation. I should talk about Foundation, cause it’s awesome. FoundationDB is a strict-serializable key value store that supports transactions. It was originally a Silicon Valley startup and then got acquired by Apple in 2015. It kind of disappeared, and then Apple re-open-sourced it around 2018. Apple uses it in production for iCloud. They’ve benchmarked it running like a million transactions a second. It’s strict serializable, which means that it’s at the highest correctness level for databases. So Foundation is a very good database. It’s very fast, and it’s intentionally built to be built upon. The normal API is just ‘get a key’, ‘set a key’. It’s not SQL. I ported Datascript to that. So now we have atomic queries, reading and writing on this strict serializable data store with transactions. The database supports concurrent writes (not a single writer), and we need to go over a thousand transactions per second, so we’re very happy with that. Event-sourcing Allen: We also have an event sourcing model. Every input to the system is an event. So like every API request, every webhook from a third party, it turns into an event. Those go into a message log. For us an event is just a Clojure map with a type field and some keys, values, and specs. The entire system is just reactions to events. We have these small log processors, or ‘procs’ for short. The proc declares “I listen for message type A, and then in response to that, I will emit either B or C”. And each one has its own little private state. You can build up a graph of how the messages flow through the system. Events will flow until you reach a terminal node in the graph. For example, a web server says, “I will receive http events and write them. Please make a payment and I will listen for either payment created event or a payment rejected event. When I see one of those, I will respond back to the client”. That’s a Netty asynchronous http handler, so an asynchronous payment response back to the client. Joe: So you have many independent procs all receiving and acting on those events, and producing their own. Yeah. How are those events conveyed? Allen: They’re all written to Foundation, so they go into the log there and each little log processor has its own private data, like its own namespace in the database, where they emit messages. The procs are watching in Foundation for a certain type of event to be written, and they are writing their own events back to Foundation. Foundation has a feature for watching when DB keys change, so it’s efficient to build a reactive system on top of that. If you had a database and some separate messaging like ZeroMQ, Rabbit, Kafka, you’re going to get race conditions. There’s always going to be a potential race where you have two messages - one is going to the disk and one is going to the network. If someone else is listening and sees both of them, they could potentially get them in either order. So it’s much, much simpler to just have one path. Foundation is really fast, so it works great. Joe: Do you have log processors as independent services, or are things more monolithic? Allen: It’s a monorepo. And right now many log processes run in the same JVM for efficiency. They are independent, so they could be run each one in its own JVM process, but right now we’re running low hundreds of them in a single JVM. One architectural choice that we made that I highly, highly recommend is: Keep your business logic as dumb and clean as possible. For these individual log processors, if you look at the namespace, it’s almost entirely pure Clojure. No third-party libraries, and very few side effects. A log processor is function that takes a Clojure map in and returns one or more Clojure maps out. There’s a protocol for proc state, but it’s a protocol so you don’t know what’s on the other side of that. So yeah, keep the business logic as clean as possible, with as few dependencies as possible, and then interact with the outside world via protocols. So for example, for the proc state protocol, it could either write to an in-memory database, or it can write to Foundation. It’s great because you can change out your implementation at test time. Joe: I see. I guess there are two patterns that people often use, aren’t there? One is keeping all interactions with the outside world at the outer edges (e.g. functional core, imperative shell). Another is more like dependency injection, where we interact with the outside world from anywhere, but put in some abstractions, so that we can swap out the implementation. So you’re doing the latter? You do allow those interactions to happen within the business logic, but you make sure to always have a protocol in front of those interactions so that you can swap out the implementation. Allen: Exactly. Also, the interface to the outside world is as small as possible. For the vast majority of procs, the only thing they can do is write to their own internal state and emit messages. That’s it. They can’t make network calls. They can’t call AWS. They don’t do anything else. So when we do wanna talk to the outside world, there’s a special kind of proc that has a dispatch handler that is dedicated to talk to that external system. So, this one talks to AWS, this one talks to our clearing bank, this one talks to some other API. That separation is very useful. Libraries Joe: What’s the typical selection of libraries and things from the Clojure ecosystem that you’re using? Allen: So in the business logic itself, very little. Outside of that, for instance in the API web server or the service gateway (where we talk to the outside world), it’s ring, netty, reitit. We’re using Clojure spec extensively. For AWS we’re using the Cognitect aws-api library. Joe: And do you use any library for managing the parts that interact with the outside world? Dependency injection or wiring up the application? Allen: The thing we use is based on a blog post called closeable. It’s great. Five years ago, this guy wrote a blog post. His argument was that you don’t need Component or Integrant, or any of that. All you need is with-open. You get lexical scope, you get the right-hand side of declaring your bindings to construct things. And then because of how the introduction of bindings works, it forces you to declare your things in order. There’s a couple of little helpers. One of them is for things that have state but don’t implement Closeable, or for things that are stateless, so you can declare them in the with-open block. And so that’s it. You’re done. It’s very simple, and very clean. Hiring Joe: You spoke earlier about how, often, the best programmers work in niche languages and it means that using marks your business out. How do you find hiring and finding good engineers? Do you have any issues? Allen: I’m really happy with it. I joke about it sometimes, but it’s not a joke, it’s real: if we said we were hiring for Java programmers, we’d get like a thousand CVs and you’d have 10 good ones. If we’re hiring for Clojure, we’ll get 13 CVs and 10 good ones. You’re going to find high quality people and you’re gonna do less work for it. We’re also remote, which I think is important because when you’re dealing with a smaller hiring pool, and you also constrain to geography, that’s hard. If you’re a remote company, then your hiring pool is, either everyone on earth or everyone within three time zones, or everyone in Europe, whatever. You’re at a good sized pool. Joe: Yes, and it’s very rare that a company needs to hire, say, a hundred engineers in a short space of time. Allen: Yeah, I think that’s an anti-pattern. Joe: What’s the size of your team at the moment? And what is that geographical split? Allen: There are maybe 70 in the company, and 22-24 or so in Engineering. In engineering, it’s maybe two thirds in the UK and then a third in the EU. We’ve got, say, four in Germany, four in Sweden, one in Ireland. And then people over most of the UK. Our headquarters are in London, but most of the developers are in the UK outside of London. Testing for correctness Joe: How do you feel about the direction of Clojure at the moment? Are there things that you would like to see happen in the Clojure space? (either in the core or in the ecosystem). Is there anything that you feel is missing, or any new direction you are interested to go in? Allen: So a thing I’ve been banging around for a while, but haven’t really made any progress on yet is around testing of systems. The FoundationDB team have a great video on how they do testing, but the problem is that this approach is hard to do as a library. Foundation is a distributed system and almost every system that any of us work with on the internet today is a distributed system. Cause, you know, even if you have one process talking to AWS, then congratulations, you’re now a networked system! So there are two big problems that we have to deal with. One of them is race conditions, and the other is system errors. As a bank we have to be what is called ‘operationally resilient’, which really just means no downtime. But we’re dealing with people’s money, so we have to actually prove it. So, don’t go down, and when there is a problem, how do you prove that you’re not losing people’s money? What the Foundation team did was build a simulator of the database. They have something like 20 different process types, so 20 different ‘roles’ within the Foundation cluster, and they wrote them as single-threaded C++ apps. Then they built an actor-model concurrency compiler on top of C++. Every single system call or network call that they make goes through a protocol, so they can inject errors. All of their multi-threading also happens through this actor model with the sending of messages. With all this in place, they can then say, “Oh, what happens if I send message A and then send message B, but then on the other end it arrives B and then A?”. Or “What happens if, in the middle of processing this message, I try to write to disk and I get an error?”. They can inject errors anywhere in the system, deterministically. You can think of it as kind of like test.check generative testing, where you have all non-determinism in the system seeded from a single random number that you control. You can control disk errors, network errors, and reordering of messages. I’m really interested in having something like that. The problem right now is that there’s no way to control the behavior of the underlying Java threading libraries, nio, and writing to disk. Joe: Similar to Jepsen, in a way, where you can enumerate all of the possible error scenarios for a complex, distributed system, but rather than just controlling the environment to disconnect the network or stop writes to the disk, you also have total control over things like thread scheduling to enumerate all the possible internal outcomes too? Allen: Yeah. It is very much in the same spirit as Jepsen. In Jepsen you set up like five VMs and say, “Oh, well maybe I’ll kill this process”, and maybe that turns up a bug and maybe it doesn’t. Jepsen is very ‘brute force’, and it’s hard to know when you’re done because you can’t inspect the database’s state, so you don’t know how much coverage you’re getting. How many times do you have to do it before you’re confident that you don’t have any bugs there? The difference, if you have this environment where you have total control, is that you can enumerate system calls, or say, for all possible interleavings of messages, make sure this thing happens. And because it’s in memory, it’s extremely fast. Joe: Have you seen this going on successfully outside of Clojure and the JVM? Allen: No. I don’t know if anyone is doing it aside from the FoundationDB team. They started and built that on day one. I think in the video they said they had that built before they were even writing database tables to disk. This is the kind of thing that gives us a lot of confidence in FoundationDB. Joe: Thanks a lot for speaking with us Allen. Finally, are you hiring? Allen: We tend to go into a bit of a lull on interviewing during the summer due to holiday, but yes we’re hiring.

The most important thing is to reduce the surface area of your application. Our business logic is almost entirely pure.

It’s had things like instant, free, payments between personal accounts for almost two decades. Contactless transactions for at least a decade, mobile banking for decades, and government mandated banking API for almost 5 years.In short, the UK has a very active banking sector that’s been rapidly (for banks) innovating for many decades. So the environment and ecosystem are well developed for further and faster innovation.In the U.S., it seems banks gave up on tech innovation decades ago, and decided that innovation in fees and punitive treatment of customers was their preferred approach. As a result there just isn’t an environment for new innovation, the incumbents find it much easier to crush competition, rather than compete. Why the same isn’t true in UK (which until recently had remarkably few distinct banks), is probably down to the nature of law and regulation, which gives customers lots of rights, and actively punishes banks that don’t uphold them. reply 8fingerlouie 3 hours agorootparent> The UK on the other hand has actively encouraged new banks and new tech.

Here&#x27;s why:1. Deposit flight. Small banks are struggling to attract deposits at a time when money markets pay considerably more than deposit accounts.2. Investment scarcity. Small banks are struggling to find places invest deposits where returns are safe, on a reporting adjusted basis. Meaning, small banks invest(ed) in US Treasuries, but as the Fed has rapidly hiked rates, the mark-to-market value of these investments has declined (though the funds are safe). The same can be said of new lending, which has similar problems due to credit risk, primarily in commercial real-estate.3. Perceived risk. Rather than allow depositors to purchase additional FDIC insurance (above the $250k limit), which insurance would generate revenue for the FDIC and banks, the USGOV had done nothing. If you want to insurance excess deposits you must use an IntraFI account that spread deposits among different banks, and&#x2F;or brokered CD&#x27;s which does the same for that banking product. Both are higher friction, and both prevent instant access to funds - regardless of one&#x27;s tolerance for penalties.4. FISERV missteps. Small banks rely on Fiserv and a few other vendors to for back office and retail banking systems. In Fiserv&#x27;s case their software is well behind big bank products that provide more features and easier user interfaces. Younger banking customers prefer big bank systems.5. Regulatory overreach. Complex issue, but in sum its not clear bank regulators understand the banking business, or if they do, that they have any flexibility. By way of a few examples, its not clear to me regulators understand the safety & utility of brokered deposit use by small banks; the worthlessness of many bank capital asset appraisals, or the immense risk real-estate heavy loan portfolios are facing.6. Asset-based lending death. Pre-2008 one could borrow against many types of capital assets, allowing businesses to purchase those assets with, say, 20% down. The asset secured the loan, with little or no reliance on personal guarantees or recent cash flow analysis. This practice led to problems in the 2008 GFC, but instead of tweaking the approach, lenders and regulators simply eliminated asset-based lending. When I write &#x27;eliminated&#x27; I fully understand its still advertised as a lending product, but underwriting is reliant on cash flow, personal financial statements, and other factors that make &#x27;asset based lending&#x27; a marketing term, not reality. This was profitable business for banks and didn&#x27;t need to die.More threats lie ahead for small banks in the US. Folks in the know speculate USGOV prefers the Canadian model, where most deposits are held by several big banks. It might be the case FedCoin opens new possibilities for small banks, reducing Fiserv and friends hold on small banking business. One can always hope. reply arohner 15 minutes agoparentWe could in theory bank other banks, but that&#x27;s not our focus.

My other option would&#x27;ve been to go back to Korea and buy Rolexes.- I moved to an Eastern European country and spent several weeks providing KYC&#x2F;AML docs after attempting to send $30k from the US to a local bank account while my funds were in limbo. Ended up having to use ATMs to pay rent and other expenses.- Bought a house in said Eastern European country and almost lost the deal because of several bank delays. Seller was pissed and had to involve lawyers to calm him down. Technically I should&#x27;ve had to pay extra because of the delays, because of the way real estate deals are structured in that country.- I moved to Latin America and went to probably 6 car dealers who all told me that purchasing a car would take up to 2 months because of the KYC&#x2F;AML process involved in wiring money from the US. I ended up going various ATMs 40 times over the course of several weeks, withdrawing $500 at a time, so I could buy a used car off Facebook marketplace. Had to take over $20k in cash in a backpack to a lawyer&#x27;s office to complete the deal. Spent way more time & money on my rental car than I wanted to.- Earlier this year while visiting the US I went into a bank branch to withdraw $20k to purchase a used car for my dad and not only could the teller not help me, but it triggered a flag on my account that caused all of my funds to be frozen for several days until I was able to get it resolved. Ended up borrowing money from a friend so I could buy the car before I left the US.- Sending even $500 to my bank account here in Latin America takes over a week with various questions from bank staff. Every time I worry if the funds will even arrive because it has to go through multiple intermediaries with various memos&#x2F;notes to the intermediary receivers. From my US bank account to another bank in NY, credited to some European account holder to send to Europe with further instructions on how to get the money to me in Latin America. I bank with an institution that&#x27;s run by the national government; I figured they&#x27;d have better international finance connections than any of the commercial banks, but apparently not.- A couple weeks ago I decided I&#x27;d send $50k to my account here because I don&#x27;t want to go through this processes every time I want to pay bills. 2 weeks later and my $50k is still stuck. The bank keeps coming back with more questions and requesting more documents every few days. Nobody at the bank can tell me how long it will take to release the funds.I&#x27;ve got more stories like this, and I know many expats with similar stories.

Having to engage in “money laundering” such as those privacy measures you bring up being a reason the government may put an address on the block list would make it quite difficult to get around too.That is assuming Ethereum sees that kind of mass adoption to the point governments start to regulate its usage. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentIs there actually a \"block list\" of this kind? It seems like it couldn&#x27;t possibly work, e.g. there is a huge foreign entity that does zillions of honest transactions but isn&#x27;t in a jurisdiction that subjects it to a given block list and it gets a transfer from some wallet that is. Either you now block anyone who transacts with them in turn and by Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon therefore the entire world, or transfers from \"blocked\" wallets go in there and come out non-blocked. reply kemotep 9 hours agorootparentThis is what all those chain analysis companies claim to solve for, and allegedly law enforcement agencies have done in the past to de-anonymize people. Perhaps you are right about it not being feasible given enough volume and so on.But at that point, if a government level threat actor wants to stop you from doing something and you are in their jurisdiction, jail cells tend to be quite effective at limiting people from spending money. If using non-government sanctioned cryptocurrencies is a crime in the future, than it doesn’t really matter if it is perfectly privacy preserving or not does it if you need to pay taxes in not the privacy preserving crypto. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> This is what all those chain analysis companies claim to solve for, and allegedly law enforcement agencies have done in the past to de-anonymize people. Perhaps you are right about it not being feasible given enough volume and so on.De-anonymizing people who are not attempting to prevent it is fairly trivial. You tie one transaction to their wallet and they use the same wallet for everything. But that&#x27;s an entirely different question than whether you can have a \"block list\" for wallets.What do you do when people in other jurisdictions pay no attention to the block list and then someone uses the money in the \"blocked\" wallet to buy some other fungible commodity there?> But at that point, if a government level threat actor wants to stop you from doing something and you are in their jurisdiction, jail cells tend to be quite effective at limiting people from spending money.But then it has nothing to do with the money at all. \"You can&#x27;t sell heroin for cryptocurrency because heroin is illegal\" applies just as well to cash or gold or iTunes gift cards.And then, in a country with rule of law, they have to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. The original problem was a random bank&#x27;s fraud algorithm unjustly stealing your money as an innocent person. reply kemotep 8 hours agorootparentI will concede the concern that the bank won’t be able to just take your money in the case of using ethereum, but being unable to legally spend your ethereum in the country you physically reside in complicates things. And buying things over the internet would get the government to wonder how you can afford these things and how you will pay your taxes, thus investigating your finances and discovering the proscribed crypto wallet. Capone got busted this way and cash is 100% fungible and private. reply AnthonyMouse 3 hours agorootparent> being unable to legally spend your ethereum in the country you physically reside in complicates thingsBut you can legally spend it, because nobody has found you guilty of a crime, because you haven&#x27;t committed a crime.The existing problem is that you don&#x27;t have to be convicted of a crime to have some payment intermediary extrajudicially lock your account. To which the solution is to not have a payment intermediary.Then if the government wants to stop you spending your own money, they can accuse you of a crime, but then they would presumably have to prove that you have committed the crime that makes it unlawful to spend the money instead of just letting the bank steal it from you without due process. reply hanniabu 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, let&#x27;s just give in completely then and give them the ability to freeze any funds they want. That&#x27;s definitely the logical approach.

Functional languages (in most cases) disallow direct mutation without some sort of immutability or persistence.Types have little (or nothing) to do with program correctness, or data correctness as it relates to external storage engines and their concurrency guarantees (i.e. FoundationDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc...).Therefore, in this scenario, what matter&#x27;s most is the correctness of underlying storage (including the rigor of validating expected behavior) and the event sourcing&#x2F;messaging systems, not on the internal data structures and their idioms conveyed by the language. reply lmm 10 hours agorootparent> In OO languages (Java, C#, C++, etc...), and functional ones (F#, Haskell, OCaml, etc...) types do not validate the correctness of logic, they evaluate the correctness of data structures and their access&#x2F;mutation as they are manifested in the language.Nonsense.

Let me turn it around: what kind of logic errors are you seeing that you think wouldn&#x27;t be eliminated by using types? Types can&#x27;t help you avoid errors in the specification itself, and there are a few domains where they may not yet be practical (mainly math-heavy things like linear algebra, where there&#x27;s centuries&#x27; worth of mathematics that&#x27;s applicable except where it isn&#x27;t, and we just don&#x27;t capture all of that in practical type systems yet), but the vast majority of the time you can construct your types in ways that force your logic to be correct because you just don&#x27;t offer the ability to do the wrong thing. reply bnert 8 hours agorootparent> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s \"extreme\", it&#x27;s very normal and natural.

More so (which I think I loosely alluded to), is that the type system was being used to \"model objects in the real world\".> what kind of logic errors are you seeing that you think wouldn&#x27;t be eliminated by using types?Classic \"logic\" stuff. Forgetting to modify and return a map given some other information. Accidentally returning the inverse of a boolean (i.e. !isSomething(x) vs isSomething(x)), incorrect adds or bit shifts, concurrent access to shared data structures (shared memory may be a more apt term), reconciling two different pieces of data into a shared one, algorithmic implementations (though I think you touched on this being less likely when using a type system designed to encourage correct algorithms by applying type theory, so it may be moot).To maybe give some clarity to what I mean by correctness, I mean does the program match the expected behavior of the programmer. In playing around with F#, I&#x27;ve written buggy F#, but the types all matched up. I had a guarantee that my program would run in a non-faulty manner (bar any system fault), but the program was not correct.> and found types to be very effectiveI&#x27;m very curious where you&#x27;ve seen this be very effective (if you&#x27;re able to share), and with what language&#x2F;technology.---Also, as a last quip, I am enjoying learning about your perspective with type systems.

It had a direct mesh-to-mesh optical fabric. What might also be interesting is the 8-core processor with 66 threads per core. Again, please excuse typos, these are being done live. Intel Shows the First Direct Mesh-to-Mesh Optical Fabric The key motivation behind this was the DARPA HIVE program for hyper-sparse data. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_03 When Intel profiled the workloads that DARPA was looking at, they found they were massively parallel. Still, they had poor cache line utilization and things like big long out-of-order pipelines were not well utilized. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_04 Here is an interesting one. Intel has a 66-thread-per-core processor with 8 cores in a socket (528 threads?) The cache apparently is not well used due to the workload. This is a RISC ISA not x86. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_05 Intel is packing these into 16 sockets in a single OCP compute thread and using optical networking. Here is the die architecture. Each core has multi-threaded pipelines. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_06 The high-speed I/O chips bridge the electrical to optical capabilities of the chip. Here is the 10-port cut-through router being used. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_07 Here is the on-die network where the routers are placed. Half of the 16 routers are there just to provide more bandwidth to the high-speed I/O. On-packaged EMIBs are being used for the physical connection layer. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_08 Going off-die, each chip uses silicon photonics to drive its optical networking. With this, the connections between cores can happen directly between chips even if they are not in the same chassis without adding switches and NICs. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_09 These chips are being packaged as a multi-chip package with EMIB. Having silicon photonics engines added a few other challenges of going from package to strands of fiber. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_10 Here is the optical performance. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_11 In terms of power, this was done in an 8-core 75W CPU. More than half of the power here is being used by silicon photonics. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_12 Here is the simulated to measured workload performance scaling. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_13 Here is the actual die photograph and confirmation that this is being done on TSMC 7nm. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_14 Here is what the package and test board looks like: Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_15 This was done in 7nm and work is still happening on this in the lab. Intel Direct Mesh To Mesh Optical Fabric_Page_16 Final Words It was interesting to see that Intel did not use the pluggable connector it showed off at Innovation 2022. It seems like this might have been built before that project was ready. This was assisted by Ayar Labs on the optical side. Perhaps the big item is the 66 threads per core! That is a huge figure. I think folks will enjoy that stat.

Per core? Is that a typo or have Intel really built such a thing? If that is, in fact, not a typo, that’s one damn big-ass processor (or maybe WIDE-ass since 8 cores is on the puny end but with 528 total threads, that makes it quite wide in terms of number of concurrent “channels/lanes” per core). Judging by the pics provided, the package, while big, doesn’t seem quite “mainframe-sized” enough to me for 528 threads to really be viable. Also, unless I missed it, there doesn’t appear to be any mention of what this RISC monster is being called.

Yamamoto August 30, 2023 At 2:43 am From my understanding, this is purpose built processor to perform large graph traversal. On graph traversal tasks, each thread just load then conditional store and ALU or other singleton resource of the processor is rarely used and efficiency is scaled well by increasing just execution unit. I remember similar purpose built CPU, Sun Niagara processor which is designed solery for web server tasks, and one floating point unit is shared by 8 cores (32 hyperthreads) LEAVE A REPLY Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

We shouldn’t expect those threads to be very fast, but we can assume that, if the processor has enough work, it should be able to be doing something useful most of the time (rather than waiting for memory). reply jandrewrogers 5 hours agoparentI don’t know if Intel has the appetite to attempt another barrel processor.The primary weakness of barrel processors is human; only a handful of people grok how to design codes that really exploit their potential. They look deceptively familiar at a code level, because normal code will run okay, but won’t perform well unless you do things that look extremely odd to someone that has only written code for CPUs. It is a weird type of architecture to design data structures and algorithms for and there isn’t a lot of literature on algorithm design for barrel processors.I love barrel processors and have designed codes for a few different such architectures, starting with the old Tera systems, and became quite good at it. In the hands of someone that knows what they are doing I believe they can be more computationally efficient than just about any other architecture given a similar silicon budget for general purpose computing. However, the reality is that writing efficient code for a barrel processor requires carrying a much more complex model in your head than the equivalent code on a CPU; the economics favors architectures like CPUs where an average engineer can deliver adequate efficiency. At this point, I’ve given up on the idea that I’ll ever see a mainstream barrel processor, despite their strengths from a pure computational efficiency standpoint. reply yvdriess 1 hour agorootparentThere&#x27;s two single threaded cores, but the four multithreaded cores are indeed Tera-style barrel processors.

Is it possible that the hit to cache locality is what inhibits uptake?

Amdahl&#x27;s law is in full effect here, a sequential part is going to bite you hard. That&#x27;s why each die on this chip has two sequential-performance cores.The graph problems this processor is designed to handle have plenty of parallelism and most of the time those threads will be waiting for (uncached) 8B DRAM accesses.> From skimming Wikipedia, it looks like a big challenge is cache pollutionThis processor has tiny caches and the programmer decides which accesses are cached. In practice, you cache the thread&#x27;s stack and do all the large graph accesses un-cached, letting the barrel processor hide the latency.

Each of the 2 fast threads has its own non-shared execution units.Separately, the 2 fast threads and the 64 slow threads are very similar with older CPUs or GPUs, but their combination into a single core with shared scratchpad memory and cache memories is novel. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agorootparent> Separately, the 2 fast threads and the 64 slow threads are very similar with older CPUs or GPUs, but their combination into a single core with shared scratchpad memory and cache memories is novel.Getting some Cell[1] vibes from that, except in reverse I guess.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cell_(processor) reply voxadam 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;m far from a CPU or architecture expert but the way you describe it this CPU reminds me a bit of the Cell from IBM, Sony, and Toshiba. Though, I don&#x27;t remember if the SPEs had any sort of shared memory in the Cell. reply adrian_b 9 minutes agorootparentWhile there are some similarities with the Sony Cell, the differences are very significant.The PPE of the Cell was a rather weak CPU, meant for control functions, not for computational tasks.Here the 2 fast threads are clearly meant to execute all the tasks that cannot be parallelized, so they are very fast, according to Intel they are eight time faster than the slow threads, so the 2 fast threads concentrate 20% of the processing capability of a core, with only 80% provided by the other 64 threads.It can be assumed that the power consumption of the 2 fast threads is much higher than that of the slow threads. It is likely that the 2 fast threads consume alone about the same power as all the other 64 threads, so they will be used at full-speed only for non-parallelizable tasks.The second big difference was that in the Cell the communication between the PPE and the many SPEs was awkward, while here it is trivial, as all the threads of a core share the cache memories and the scratchpad memory. reply tgv 2 hours agorootparentprevSo this is a processor where you would have 97% of the threads doing some I&#x2F;O like task?

The chassis and cooler designs of the old intel based macs sandbagged the performance a great deal.

You can see this sandbagging in the old intel chassis Apple Silicon MBP where their performance is markedly worse than the ones in the newer chassis. reply acdha 7 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t make sense: everyone else got hit by Intel’s failure to deliver, too. Even if you assume Apple had some 4-D chess plan where making their own products worse was needed to justify a huge gamble, it’s not like Dell or HP were in on it. Slapping a monster heat sink and fan on can help with performance but then you’re paying with weight, battery life, and purchase price.I think a more parsimonious explanation is the accepted one: Intel was floundering for ages, Apple’s phone CPUs were booming, and a company which had suffered a lot due to supplier issues in the PowerPC era decided that they couldn’t afford to let another company have that much control over their product line. It wasn’t just things like the CPUs failing further behind but also the various chipset restrictions and inability to customize things. Apple puts a ton of hardware in to support things like security or various popular tasks (image & video processing, ML, etc.) and now that’s an internal conversation, and the net result is cheaper, cooler, and a unique selling point for them. reply Aurornis 5 hours agorootparentprevI doubt it was intentional, but you&#x27;re very right that the old laptops had terrible thermal design.Under load, my M1 laptop can pull similar wattage to my old Intel MacBook Pro while staying virtually silent.

The workloads they consider have a large number of indirection and poor memory locality, so a lot of memory operations have to wait for cache misses, but you have to do the same thing a lot of times independently with different data.Normal multithreading is not a solution because it is not granular enough, you can not context switch in the middle of each memory access to run a different thread while waiting for the memory access to complete. You could manually unroll loops and instead of only following one path through the graph you could follow several paths at the same time by interleaving their operations. While this will be able to hide the waiting times because you can continue working on other paths, it will make your code more complex and increase register pressure as you still have the same number of registers but are operating on multiple independent paths. Letting the hardware interleave many parallel paths will keep your code simpler and as each thread has its own registers also not increase register pressure. replymrweasel 4 hours agoprev [–] I can&#x27;t help picturing the OpenBSD developers getting their hands on this and promptly disabling 65 threads per core due to security concerns. reply belter 2 hours agoparentThose who sacrifice security to performance, deserve neither :-) reply coldtea 2 hours agorootparentFounding fathers aside, if you&#x27;re not connected to the internet or even wider LAN, but on some private lab running specific workloads, you don&#x27;t need security from malicious side-loaded apps. reply kriro 2 hours agoparentprevPretty snarky comment in my opinion.

    "originLink": "https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems",
    "originBody": "📣Postmark has been acquired by ActiveCampaign Continue reading → x People-First Products Resources About Eugene September 16th 2021 Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems Recently, I set out on a mission to reconstruct a color system in Postmark. This project addressed several problems with our design system, involved a lot of research, and even required building a few custom tools. Now that this project is finished, I want to share the most important lessons I learned about color and present a new design and accessibility tool Accessible Palette born out of this work. The main problems with our old palette were inconsistent perceived lightness of colors (blues and reds are much darker than yellows and greens) and unpredictable contrast ratios between color variants. When picking a color pair, we couldn’t easily tell if it would meet the recommendations from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and had to manually check the contrast ratio. (Or, most likely… not check.) Postmark Color System v1 with inconsistent lightness Contrast ratios against white background In fact, both of these problems were caused by the inherent fault in the HSL color model and lack of support for better alternatives in the design tools. While HSL and HSV are fine choices for choosing a single color, they’re not suitable for building a color system, as they simply transform the RGB model and ignore the complexities of human perception. To see what’s wrong with them and find an alternative, we need to look at color theory and consider other color spaces. Stop using HSL for color systems! The RGB color model reflects how screens work and is not trying to be user-friendly or intuitive. Instead, in the 1970s, researchers came up with HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV/HSB (Hue, Saturation, Value or Brightness) models as alternative representations of RGB, based on how humans think of colors. The intention was good, but they had to trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, as more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive for that time. The resulting HSL and HSV models are easy mathematical transformations of RGB that don’t reflect a human perception of lightness or saturation. Consider colors in this scale with the same Saturation (100) and Lightness (50) in HSL: While this scale may have consistent lightness according to the color model, it definitely feels wrong for a human — visually, blue (#00F) is much darker than yellow (#FF0) or cyan (#0FF). This happens because in HSL, fully saturated colors are mapped to the peak RGB values and placed around a Hue circle at a Lightness value of 50, with values of 0 and 100 corresponding to fully black and white, respectively. When a lighter or darker variant of the color is needed, it gets “mixed” with white or black. The central vertical axis comprises the range of neutral or gray colors with a Saturation of zero. (The difference between HSL and HSV is insignificant for this discussion, but instead of “mixing” colors, HSV represents how colors appear under bright light, so the most saturated colors have a Value of 100.) Based on illustrations by Jacob Rus and Michael Horvath (SharkD), CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons. Luckily, we’re not limited by computational speed anymore and can use better tools for this job. Meet CIELAB and LCh By the time HSL and HSV models were formalized, a better alternative already existed. The International Commission on Illumination (abbreviated CIE) defined the CIELAB or L*a*b* color space back in 1976. It was designed as a perceptually uniform color space, where a given numerical change corresponds to a similar perceived change in color. Unlike the RGB color model, CIELAB is designed to cover the entire range of visible colors, and its Lightness (L*) component closely matches human perception. Here is how this color space is defined, according to Wikipedia: The lightness value L* defines black at 0 and white at 100. The a* axis is relative to the green-red opponent colors, with negative values toward green and positive values toward red. The b* axis represents the blue-yellow opponents, with negative numbers toward blue and positive toward yellow. Earlier, I said that RGB isn’t user-friendly or intuitive. Well, CIELAB really put things into perspective. Visible gamut within CIELAB color space (see also as a video). a and b are the horizontal axes; L is the vertical axis. Michael Horvath (SharkD), Christoph Lipka, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons. Just as HSL and HSV are easier-to-use cylindrical representations of the RGB, CIELCh or LCh or Lch(ab) color space is a cylindrical representation of CIELAB. Chromaticity components a* and b* are replaced with Chroma (relative saturation) and Hue angle, while Lightness remains unchanged. The Hue angle is similar to the one in HSL, but they’re not identical — HSL/HSV uses the three additive primary colors red, green, and blue (H = 0, 120, 240°). Instead, the LCh system uses the four colors red, yellow, green, and blue (h = 0, 90, 180, 270°). (It’s worth mentioning there is a similar HCL or LCh(uv) color space with a Chroma on a uniform scale from 0 to 100, unlike an LCh(ab) where it varies based on Hue and Lightness.) Visible gamut within CIELCh color space (see also as a video). L is the vertical axis; C is the cylinder radius; h is the angle around the circumference. Michael Horvath (SharkD), Christoph Lipka, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons. You may notice that, unlike HSL and HSV, LCh fits inside a cylinder but doesn’t fill it. This is expected, as some combinations of Lightness, Chroma, and Hue produce impossible colors — for example, a dark saturated yellow just doesn’t exist. The closer the visible gamut gets to black and white on a Lightness scale, the fewer colors can be distinguished by a human eye. In reality, not even all of these visible colors can be displayed on a screen — the sRGB gamut represents a typical screen and includes only about ⅓ of the LCh color space. That’s what we’re limited to in CSS as well, at least for now. The sRGB gamut plotted within the cylindrical LCh color space (see also as a video). Michael Horvath (SharkD), Christoph Lipka, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons. Let’s go back to our HSL color scale with Saturation of 100 and Lightness of 50 and see what its Lightness is in LCh: Now, these numbers make more sense — yellow is the lightest color, blue is the darkest, greens are almost three times lighter than blue or twice than reds. Let’s rebuild this scale in LCh with a consistent level of Lightness: Because of the varied Chroma component, some of these colors are more saturated than others, but their lightness is visually consistent. This doesn’t look good as a gradient but may be desirable in a color system — I want my colors for notifications and warnings more saturated than shades of the base text. Just for curiosity sake, let’s see how these scales look with more consistency in Chroma: Smooth as butter, even while we’re dealing with a limited sRGB color space. This is a great foundation for building a color system. At this point, you may wonder why the design community does not widely use this powerful color space. As of today, neither Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD support CIELAB or LCh. There is an LCH color picker and Chromatic plugins for Figma, but I didn’t find them sufficient to construct a flexible color system. The ideal tool for the job would generate color variants with persistent lightness, let me control the contrast ratio between them, and be flexible enough to accommodate existing brand colors. That’s when I discovered a Chroma.js library with great LCh support and decided to write a simple tool to generate a new palette from code. After using this tool internally and sharing it with a few friends, we decided to turn it into an app and share it publicly as a project from our Labs. Introducing Accessible Palette Accessible Palette is an app for building color systems with consistent lightness and predictable contrast ratios across color levels. It’s flexible enough to accommodate existing brand colors and lighter or darker palettes. Let’s see how it works: The interface of the Accessible Palette app You begin by tweaking one of the starting colors or pasting the existing color from your design. The tool will use color’s Chroma and Hue to calculate a scale with multiple lightness levels. Lightness is completely customizable and can work both with light and dark palettes. It also provides granular control over a palette to include existing brand colors. In our case, I wanted to preserve the three most used colors from the original Postmark palette — yellow #FFDE00, blue #007DCC, and green #4FC47F. After taking them as starting colors, I used their Lightness values (88.6, 75.2, and 50.6, respectively) as lightness for levels 200, 400, and 600. Contrast ratio depends on Lightness and is calculated for every level using both current WCAG 2.1 Recommendations and a new algorithm in an upcoming 3.0 Working Draft. (The current way of measuring contrast is flawed, but we’ll talk about this later.) By default, the contrast of every color is measured against a white background, but you can select any color swatch to measure the contrast ratio against it. Levels can be generated using RGB or CIELAB color space. In some cases, the results can be different, so it’s worth experimenting. In the Postmark color scheme, using CIELAB reduced purplish tint in lighter reds (good) but increased in blues (bad). For some colors, you may want to shift Hue across the range. Our bright yellow is a good example — as it gets darker, colors get a greenish shade. To shift them a little closer to orange, I use a negative Hue compensation. As you use the app, it updates the URL to save changes. Share it with your team, or add it to your Figma library and a CSS file with color variables for future reference. The app can be used to generate all kinds of color palettes. Use them as a final color system or as a foundation to build upon. To see some real-world examples, check out a new Postmark color palette or palettes based on Google’s Material Design or TailwindCSS. They’re not exact replicas, but alternative takes inspired by the original colors and levels of lightness. Bonus: How are contrast ratios calculated? So why does Accessible Palette show two different contrast ratios? WCAG 2.1 calculates the contrast ratio by dividing the luminance of the foreground color by the luminance of the background. The problem is this formula provides a linear response, while humans perceive the contrast between lighter colors as higher than between darker colors. Consider these examples: In practice, samples meeting the WCAG 2.1 recommendations are harder to read than those with an “insufficient” contrast ratio. Luckily, W3C is aware of this problem, as Andrew Somers started an open discussion back in 2019. (It’s a fascinating and deep reading if you have a spare evening or two.) He proposed a better working algorithm that is now a part of the WCAG 3 Working Draft and built an APCA Contrast Calculator that is perceptually accurate and also takes font size and weight into account. Accessible Palette uses his Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) and considers score 60 as the minimum level recommended for readable text, similar to the old 4.5:1 contrast ratio recommendation in WCAG 2.1. Let’s see how our examples will hold up with the new algorithm: Does it mean that WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio is useless? No, it’s still fairly accurate for mid-range colors, but overall the new algorithm is a massive improvement. Keep in mind that it’s still a Working Draft and may change over time. For maximum future-proofness and compliance with current guidelines, try building your color system with both guidelines in mind. As I started working on Postmark’s new color system, I didn’t expect to give up on the most commonly used color model or question WCAG’s current guidelines. This project led me down the rabbit hole of color theory and resulted in a tool that can help build consistent and accessible color palettes with very little effort. This is a rare situation when both designers and users win in the end.

The exact formula depends on your color space but Grayscale = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B [1]is commonly quoted (I think for sRGB) and in that case the brightest pure red is about 30% bright and the brightest pure blue is 11% which makes \"bright red\" an oxymoron in most cases.You can certainly use those colors but they are always going to be dark. Simply applying contrast rules will make your color choices accessible but if you want to make something accessible and that look good the techniques in that article will make you a winner.For that matter, saturated screen greens are nowhere near as saturated as is possible but are more saturated than most greens you see in real life: I make red-cyan stereogramshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anaglyph_3Dand one rule of thumb is that trees and grass look great in stereograms because even though they are green, they actually have a lot of red so the balance between the channels is good so you get good stereo and good color.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynamsoft.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;insights&#x2F;image-processing&#x2F;ima... reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentThis brings back thoughts of the NTSC days and broadcast safe limits, and the horrible time of clients that loved loved loved red. Explaining to them how the beautiful red artwork will be anything but beautiful on TV was never fun, especially if they wanted it for broadcast. Even when it wasn&#x27;t for broadcast, an illegal red could still be seen frames later, and would bleed like it just had its throat slit. reply mrandish 16 hours agorootparentAs someone who also worked within the arcane limitations of analog video, at both the broadcast and prosumer levels, today&#x27;s UHD video standards and colorspaces can be incredible when correctly applied in a maximal high-end workflow such as native 4k 10-bit HDR.Yet when I look at today&#x27;s typical \"top quality\" live broadcast content such as the 4K Super Bowl as delivered by mass consumer distribution such as Comcast Xfinity (via their latest high-end decoder box), it&#x27;s a visual mess compared to what the signal chain should be capable of delivering.Even though I have top notch viewing gear properly configured and calibrated (with local video processing &#x27;enhancements&#x27; disabled), it looks terrible. Unfortunately, due to the layers of compression, conversion and DRM slathered on the signal before I receive it, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to analyze what&#x27;s going wrong. All I can determine is that it is a video feed being decompressed into a 4K-resolution, 4:2:2, 60fps frame buffer. However, examining still frame sequences reveals extensive motion, color and resolution artifacts.The net effect conveys a sense of \"sharpness\" in the frequency domain at first glance but on critical viewing over time it&#x27;s a weird kind of digital abomination of macro-blocked chroma splotches, lagged temporal artifacts and bizarre over-saturation of primary hues. While some pre-compressed streamed film content looks quite good when delivered via a streaming service willing to devote sufficient encoding time and delivery bitrate, it&#x27;s still hit and miss. Live broadcast content, especially high-motion sports, is almost always a mess. We&#x27;ve come so far in standards and specifications yet still have so far to go in the actual delivered result to most households. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentYears ago when deciding to cut the cord, I had to convince my roommate that an OTA DTV antenna would provide a better image. We had clear line of sight to the broadcast towers, so I knew it was a no brainer, but I&#x27;m in the video side of things, and he&#x27;s not. This makes him a great analog for the vast majority of viewers. I set the inputs on the TV to the same channel for the Comcast cable box and the OTA antenna, and then A&#x2F;B tested the inputs for him. Even he could see how bad the image from cable came. Their push-a-button-get-a-prize style one set of encoding settings for all content will always mean their low bit rates look bad.My favorite cable box sports example was a PGA tournament was showing a golfer putting on the green. The shot was an extremely tight close up of the ball sitting there as the golfer addressed the ball. All of the dimples in the ball were clear, and every blade of grass was visible until the golfer swung and made contact with the ball. As the camera panned to follow, the ball went to this white roundish shape with no detail and the grass went to this blurry green smear again with no detail. As soon as the ball went into the cup and the camera stopped moving, at least one GOP later the grass snapped into full detail again.Their predictive model is tuned for low motion static content because that&#x27;s what 90%+ of their content is. Even something like ESPN is now primarily talking heads of people talking about sports rather than being sports. Any sports show in replay and not live so who cares? Looking back at crappy SD tape captures, it&#x27;s obvious that anything was better than nothing. Much like YouTube. People just want something, doesn&#x27;t have to be amazing. If it looks like Picasso instead of Monet, they don&#x27;t care as long as their minds don&#x27;t have to think reply Aloha 11 hours agorootparentI have absolutely blown people socks off with the quality delivered OTA via ATSC, it looks so good. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentAnd to think the US government gave anyone that wanted one a free DTV antenna. By that point, pretty much nobody used a terrestrial antenna any more, so a very few number of people took them up on the offer. I can only imagine cable companies being very please with that.Also, the signal was meant to have even more bandwidth. When the broadcasters decided to bring out the fractional channels, it didn&#x27;t exactly fit the idea that Congress had when allocating the frequencies. Yet another example of how Congress can be behind the times in pretty much everything. reply graedus 13 hours agorootparentprevInteresting comment, thanks. Two questions out of curiosity:> Even though I have top notch viewing gear properly configured and calibratedAny chance you&#x27;d be willing to share a few details about this?> While some pre-compressed streamed film content looks quite good when delivered via a streaming service willing to devote sufficient encoding time and delivery bitrate, it&#x27;s still hit and miss.Which streaming services are doing things right in your view? reply mrandish 12 hours agorootparent> Any chance you&#x27;d be willing to share a few details about this?I have several viewing devices in different rooms including an LG C2 OLED, a high-end Samsung QLED and in my dedicated, fully light-controlled home theater room a native 4K 10-bit HDR+ laser projector and 150-inch screen. Each of these displays has been professionally calibrated. To objectively evaluate an input source these days it&#x27;s important to try multiple different display technologies because flat screens can vary between OLED, QLED, mini-LED, LCD and VA which all have different trade-offs in contrast, peak brightness, viewing angles, color spaces, gamma response curves, etc. And that&#x27;s before getting into various front projector technologies.Most consumer TVs these days come with a pile of post-processing algorithms which claim to deliver various \"enhancements.\" In almost all cases you&#x27;ll want to turn these options off in the setup menus. For critical viewing, objective calibration with a suitable colorimeter is ideal, especially when considering HDR sources which should be normalized to each display&#x27;s native capabilities in Nits. If you don&#x27;t want to dive down the rabbit hole of evaluating all this yourself (which can admittedly get complex), I suggest the TV reviews at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com which are credible, thorough and yet still relatively accessible to non-experts. Unfortunately, RTings doesn&#x27;t evaluate front projectors. For that the best bet is an expert forum like AV Science (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avsforum.com).> Which streaming services are doing things right in your view?Currently, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any service I would say is universally \"doing it right.\" It still varies depending on the individual piece of content. Amazon, Netflix, AppleTV and even YouTube each have some extremely well-encoded, high bitrate content. But I&#x27;ve also seen examples on each service that aren&#x27;t great.The highest-quality home source will typically be a UHD Blu-Ray disc player. If you have such a player I highly recommend the Spears and Munsil UHD Benchmark Discs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spearsandmunsil.com&#x2F;uhd-hdr-benchmark-2023&#x2F;). Just because a disc is UHD format doesn&#x27;t mean the media on it has been encoded correctly, from a high-fidelity source and in appropriate quality. The Spears and Munsil disc features a comprehensive suite of custom-designed test signals and specially sourced demonstration content identically encoded in HD, UHD, HDR, HDR10, HDR10+ and DolbyVision, including moving-window split screens allowing you to compare formats. It&#x27;s extremely impressive and, as a video engineering geek, I found it fascinating to explore for hours on my various displays - while my wife had zero interest in it :-). reply PaulHoule 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, the visual quality of a sports game can vary a lot and is frequently a disappointment. I can get an ATSC 3 multiplex from Syracuse and it is sad that it is not really better than the ATSC 2 symbol. reply mrandish 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s disappointing to hear because my current residence came with a large digital-capable antenna installed in the attic which I&#x27;ve never connected. When more local stations in my market start ATSC 3 broadcasts next year I was thinking of hooking up an OTA feed just to see if it&#x27;s better than the Comcast XFinity cable-delivered mess.I don&#x27;t even watch that much TV content but when I do, I want it to not look like crap. It&#x27;s frustrating because I&#x27;m sure the four national broadcast networks and top cable channels (eg ESPN, CNN, etc) are providing pristine source feeds at their head-end distribution points which look amazing. Is there even any meaningfully better-quality alternative these days? Maybe some over-the-top streaming provider of broadcast and cable channels who actually delivers 4k sources with guaranteed high-quality encoding and decent bitrates? If so, I&#x27;d cut the Comcast cord even if it costs more.

The bleeding and chroma crawl that is most visible in NTSC red, has been replaced with at best half chroma resolution, and depending on how the viewer&#x27;s decoder works, red edges may be especially harsh-looking.It&#x27;s definitely better than it used to be, though. reply adrian_b 15 hours agorootparentThe better monitors can be reconfigured to use the DCI-P3 primary colors instead of the default Rec. 709 primary colors (a.k.a. sRGB primaries).(sRGB combines the Rec. 709 primaries with a certain nonlinear transfer function, while Display P3 combines the DCI-P3 primaries with the sRGB nonlinear transfer function and with the PAL&#x2F;SECAM white, which is also used by Rec. 709 and sRGB).With the DCI-P3 primaries, it is very noticeable that the red is much better, allowing the displaying of reddish colors that are simultaneously more saturated and brighter than what can be achieved with the Rec. 709 red.While DCI-P3 also has a better green than Rec. 709, there the improvement is much less obvious than in the red area. reply PaulHoule 15 hours agorootparentThe monitor has a set of primaries that doesn&#x27;t change but the monitor can treat R, G and B signals as if they are in a particular color space with certain primaries and do the best that it can to simulate the appearance specified in the signal. reply adrian_b 14 hours agorootparentFor most monitors, as a user you cannot know which are the true colors of the pixels of the screen and this is completely irrelevant.What matters is which are the colors that will be reproduced on the display when you send the digital codes corresponding to pure red, green and blue, through the DisplayPort or HDMI interfaces of the monitor.All the good monitors have a menu for the selection of the color space that will be used by DisplayPort and HDMI, and the menu will typically present a choice between sRGB and Display P3 or DCI-P3. Even when in the menu it is written DCI-P3, what is meant is Display P3, i.e. the menu changes only the primaries, without changing the white or the nonlinear transfer function.All monitors will process the digital codes corresponding to standard color spaces to generate the appropriate values needed to command their specific pixels in order to reproduce a color as close as possible to what is specified by the standard color space.The cheapest monitors are able to display only a color space close to Rec. 709 a.k.a. sRGB, those of medium price are normally able to display a color space close to DCI-P3 and a few very expensive monitors and many expensive TV-sets, which use either quantum dots or OLED, are able to display a larger fraction of the Rec. 2020 color space (laser projectors can display the complete Rec. 2020 color space).Even when a monitor can display bright and saturated reds, as long as it remains in the default configuration of using sRGB over DisplayPort and HDMI, you cannot command the monitor to display those colors. For that, you have to switch the color space used by DisplayPort and HDMI to a color space with a wider color gamut.Some monitors, typically those that are advertised to support HDR, allow the use of the Rec. 2020 color space over DisplayPort and HDMI, but most such monitors cannot display the full Rec. 2020 color space, so the very saturated colors will either be clipped to maximum saturation or mapped to less saturated colors. reply account42 58 minutes agorootparent> All monitors will process the digital codes corresponding to standard color spaces to generate the appropriate values needed to command their specific pixels in order to reproduce a color as close as possible to what is specified by the standard color space.This is overly optimistic.

We used it internally here at Figma for our own accessibility revamp for a final result that ended up much better than it would have otherwise. Eugene provides some great examples of when WCAG 2 fails, and we were continually running into those.That really brings me to my main piece of advice here: color is really hard to get right - any tool you have can help you along the way, but that said at some point you also have to trust your eye. At the end of the day, all of these tools are just providing some mathematical approximation for how your eye sees color. Your eye is the final source of truth, not the algorithms. If you&#x27;re encountering areas where a tool or an algorithm aren&#x27;t providing you the right result, switch it around or fall back to basics. reply seanwilson 15 hours agoparent> We used it internally here at Figma for our own accessibility revamp for a final result that ended up much better than it would have otherwise.Can you go into more detail here? Do you mean you use only APCA and ignore what the WCAG 2 color contrast algorithm flags as insufficient contrast? reply jjcm 14 hours agorootparentWe use a balance of both. All of our body text is WCAG 2 compliant - we wanted to ensure the primary usability of the app is accessible towards the current standard. Where we diverge is when combining saturated colors with desaturated colors for foregrounds&#x2F;backgrounds, which WCAG has some trouble with. Some good examples of this are here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DanHollick&#x2F;status&#x2F;1417895151003865090This was relevant for our Figma&#x27;s brand color, as prior to our accessibility pass it wasn&#x27;t compliant when combined with white text for neither WCAG 2 nor APCA. We modified it slightly to be #0D99FF, which was close enough to the original brand color it didn&#x27;t feel like a rebrand, while still allowing us a passing APCA color contrasts score. Notably though it doesn&#x27;t pass WCAG 2, but you&#x27;ll see from this example the contrast is significant: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;image.non.io&#x2F;15ed7558-5337-40fc-9e5b-2392087cc35b.we...That&#x27;s not to say though that APCA is a perfect solution. Interestingly, should APCA be adopted as the WCAG standard, Figma and Hackernews both would fail contrast guidelines. Part of APCA is a guideline for what font size&#x2F;weight combinations are allowed for any color contrast level. Even with #000 and #fff as your colors, fonts under 11.5px are not allowed (Figma uses 11px for much of the UI). For many expert tools, 11px fonts are fairly standard due to the amount of UI you have to have on screen - other examples here where this is common are tools such as Blender or CAD software. Hackernews uses black 12px font for the main body text against a #f6f6ef background, which according to APCA requires a minimum 15px font at normal font weight. This is a perfect example of my earlier point that you have to use a collection of tools at the end of the day to get to a correct solution, rather than using a single tool or algorithm as a dogmatic source of truth. You can create poorly accessible solutions with WCAG and bad user experiences with APCA. reply seanwilson 14 hours agorootparentThanks!> All of our body text is WCAG 2 compliant - we wanted to ensure the primary usability of the app is accessible towards the current standard.

But the L thing is crucial for WCAG (c.f. article), and designers, and the blue&#x2F;yellow stuff is interesting.- it&#x27;s _not bad_ Its better than HSL in that its lightness is correlated to \"true lightness\", and it&#x27;s __much__ simpler to implement than a more complex thing like HCT&#x27;s CAM16 x L.

They&#x27;re opposites on the color wheel and should cancel out to nothing. Better to instead note the requirement that you don&#x27;t want gray gradients, and to travel \"around\" the colorspace instead of \"through\" it, i.e. rotate hue to make the gradient, travelling along the surface of the colorspace, rather than going into the color space, reducing colorfulness. reply arthur2e5 5 hours agorootparent> Oklab L is not L: The problem for engineers and designers: no relation to LAB L*&#x2F;XYZ YThat should not be considered a bug by itself.

Any thoughts on how HCT compares with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsluv.org&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;?

The color contrast value between a pair of colors depends on which color is the foreground and which is the background, so just comparing the difference in \"T\" won&#x27;t be enough now? reply refulgentis 11 hours agorootparentre: HSLuv, I don&#x27;t know much of it but I&#x27;ve heard it mentioned several times, so it must be helpful. This comment[1] goes into more detail, but TL;DR the core to me seems to be having L* and whatever H and S measurement works for you, so I&#x27;d say HSLuv is spot on.I love APCA, Myndex (Andrew Somers, APCA author) was an absolute inspiration to me for getting interested in color, I wouldn&#x27;t have known 1% of what I do or have done 1% of it without his deep dives showing how to work in this space.It has an interesting effect on the community in that the general language around it is read too strongly: it is an important and crucial advance, getting science-backed data on exactly the right contrast in multiple scenarios is _absurdly important_ in a world of Ambient Computing™.The mistake that&#x27;s made is reading into this too heavily as _the previous spec or WCAG aren&#x27;t based on data at all_.Yes, the calculation is based on absurd stuff -- 100 nit monitor, you can&#x27;t track down a source for every bit of it.But there&#x27;s a _whole separate field_ that spatial frequency comes from and it is _very_ well known and understood.Most importantly: the APCA predictions for contrast were only about 5-7 L* different last time I checked. This is important, thats a _lot_ --- but it also isn&#x27;t a lot, that&#x27;s on a scale of 100. What we have today isn&#x27;t completely utterly alienly different and broken.Comparing the difference in T will be enough as long as the luminance measure APCA relies on is monotonic to RGB (HSL&#x27;s lightness is hilarious, its the max of RGB minus min of RGB)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37314700 reply drakmaniso 15 hours agoparentprevIs there a public specification somewhere?

CAM16 is relatively incredibly complex, about 500 lines of code. #2 it maps it to L*.#1 is because nobody gets fired for basing Google&#x27;s color system on CAM16. #2 is for WCAG.There was continually interesting conversations on what exactly the name of the space was and whether it represented a new color space that precluded more formalization of it, the code ended up being the spec as it were.

Is that not overkill and unnecessary?At a minimum, most web UIs grow to need:- Several greys (borders, headings, body text, boxes), a primary&#x2F;accent color (to show what&#x27;s clickable), green (to show success), red (for danger) and orange&#x2F;yellow (for warning).- If you then want to show success&#x2F;danger&#x2F;warning alerts&#x2F;badges&#x2F;icons&#x2F;buttons, you&#x27;ll usually want extra shades of each for the borders&#x2F;background&#x2F;headings&#x2F;text.- For buttons, you&#x27;ll usually want shades of at least your primary color for the background of each normal&#x2F;hover&#x2F;clicked&#x2F;disabled state too.- At that stage, you may as well have shades&#x2F;tones ready for the other colors in case you need them in the future so you don&#x27;t have to keep coming back to it. You could get by for a while by generating new color variants from existing colors with shortcuts like using transparency or contrast filters, but the feel&#x2F;branding of these probably won&#x27;t be ideal compared to more designed palettes.- From a light theme, you&#x27;ll need to tweak the colors to get a dark theme, usually reducing saturation as the colors become too bright on a dark background.You can get pretty far with a restricted palette though e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;design-system.service.gov.uk&#x2F;styles&#x2F;colour&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbootstrap.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;4.0&#x2F;utilities&#x2F;colors&#x2F;. Or use an existing large palette like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;design&#x2F;language&#x2F;color&#x2F;, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radix-ui.com&#x2F;colors or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;designsystem.digital.gov&#x2F;design-tokens&#x2F;color&#x2F;system-...

Or was is more guilt by being in the wrong place, used in the wrong way, at the wrong time? reply seanwilson 11 hours agorootparent> Yes, but do they grow because they can?

Each one has a unique background, border and text color, and the text contrast meets accessibility standards. So that&#x27;s 15 colors just there.Alerts like this are super common for any UI with forms. You could simplify each alert to use only one or two colors (which puts limits how you can make them look), but do you think this example is over designed as is?> Put another way, how many users are going to understand ALL those shades and subtle signals in a don&#x27;t-make-me-think (i.e., Steve Krug) sort of way?You&#x27;d assume the user can tell the danger color from info, but the different shades of the danger color wouldn&#x27;t have a different meaning except for emphasis and to help with the information hierarchy. Even if your UI was greyscale, you&#x27;d want different shades to help here too.Can you point to a UI you like? How many colors and shades does it have? reply chiefalchemist 11 hours agorootparentMy understanding is color alone is not enough as a signal for alerts. There are enough people who have issues with color differentiation that color isn&#x27;t enough. So if we presume this to be true - and it is :) - well now we&#x27;ve add all these colors to \"the brand\" *and* also have too much confidence in what they can accomplish for all users.Look. I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s absolute right or wrong.

But for people that can see those color differences (about 90% of the population don&#x27;t have color blindness) it&#x27;s a very worthwhile improvement so isn&#x27;t it overkill to ignore these people?

This site is entirely funded by subscribers and you will be directly powering our journalism. A group of right to repair activists and consumer rights advocates are petitioning the Librarian of Congress for the right to hack McDonald’s notoriously unreliable McFlurry machines for the purposes of repair, according to a copy of the petition obtained by 404 Media. “This is a request to expand the repair exemption for consumer electronic devices to include commercial industrial equipment such as automated building management systems and industrial equipment (i.e. soft serve ice cream machines and other industrial kitchen equipment),” the proposal, written by right to repair group iFixit and the nonprofit Public Knowledge, says. In addition, iFixit got its hands on a Taylor ice cream machine and tore it down in an effort to determine why they are broken so damn often and published a new video showing the process of taking the machine apart and explaining why they’re always broken when you want fast food ice cream. The petition and teardown video come as a lawsuit between Taylor and a company that made a device that reads and deciphers the machine’s error codes enters its third year and heads toward a jury trial later this fall. Every three years, interested parties have to file requests with the Librarian of Congress that seek “exemptions” to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the overarching federal copyright law. Through a process called Section 1201 rulemaking, repair professionals and consumer rights groups seek permission from the government to break arbitrary software locks and passwords that keep consumers and repair professionals from diagnosing and repairing equipment they own or are authorized by the owner to work on. IMAGE: IFIXIT Currently, Taylor has service contracts with McDonald’s franchises that allow them to exclusively service the ice cream machines. A DMCA exemption would allow McDonald’s franchises to legally do repair work on their own machines. In the past, hard-fought exemptions have been won for consumer electronics, tractors, and video game consoles. This year, iFixit and Public Knowledge want to extend an exemption to McDonald’s ice cream machines. In the past, companies like John Deere and lobbying groups like the Entertainment Software Association have tried to kill these exemptions, but groups like iFixit and Public Knowledge have generally been able to push them through the exemption process. “The current barriers to these works include service passwords and digital locks,” the petition reads. “Commercial ice cream machines, such as the Taylor manufactured ice cream machines used by McDonald’s, frequently fall into disrepair when its daily pasteurization cycle fails. Circumventing the digital lock on the software would enable owners and repair professionals to diagnose and perform the necessary repairs to get these devices back up and running.” A few years ago, I reported that McDonald’s franchises have been surreptitiously hacking their ice cream machines to be able to read diagnostic codes without permission from Taylor, which makes the machines. In 2013, Taylor issued a “Service Bulletin” that said unauthorized people had been installing a “shunt” or “jumper” that can bypass arbitrary locks on the machine. In its Taylor ice cream machine teardown, an iFixit technician says he believes there are several specific issues with the machine that causes it to break down, and which prevent it from being repaired easily. “The machine overheats if it’s used too much within a certain time period. This results in mushy goop coming out or the machine shutting down and refusing to work until it resets and cools down,” Shahram Mokhtari, iFixit’s lead teardown tech, said in iFixit’s teardown. The machine gives error codes that explain what’s wrong with the machine: “error after error means I’m constantly having to refer back to the manual … tiny errors can cause big headaches … the error codes are nonsensical, counterintuitive, and seemingly random, even if you spend hours reading the manual.” Broken McDonald’s McFlurry machines has become a meme over the years, with the company itself joking about extended downtime, and the Federal Trade Commission promising to investigate why they are broken so often. But the issue of unreliable, difficult-to-repair McFlurry machines and various associated legal dramas around it could fill out a Bingo card of important right to repair and public access issues in the United States. DOWNLOADING COURT DOCUMENTS FOR THE KYTCH LAWSUIT IS $2,999 A company called Kytch built a small, third-party device that could be attached to the soft service ice cream machines that read and interpreted Taylor’s error codes. Kytch has been engaged in a lawsuit in California state court with Taylor and McDonald’s for more than two years. More than 480 documents have been filed with the court in that lawsuit, and a trial is scheduled for this fall. Even reading documents from this lawsuit is a costly nightmare of an affair. The Superior Court of Alameda County is charging roughly $1 per page to get legal filings. To download the entirety of the court proceedings to date, the court wants $2,999.

Rather than innovating their product, they realized its cheaper if they have their lawyers engineer a way to lock in their customers to their product over their competitors&#x27;.And you seem to see this more and more. It seems that these days the product quality itself doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s all about the contracts that your legal team setup in the background. I have to ask the engineers that work at these companies: does it bother you that the only reason people use your product is that they would get sued if they tried using another product? How does it make you feel that your product is so bad the only thing keeping your customers in the door is the contracts your legal team drew up. reply Alupis 13 hours agoparentWhat happens if the replacement parts aren&#x27;t actually as good, safe or reliable as the originals? McDonald&#x27;s gets bad PR, or a lawsuit depending on the severity.Look, I&#x27;m all for better repair options and Right to Repair, but McDonald&#x27;s is selling consistency and their reputation is on the line (not the franchisee) when something goes wrong or people get sick.For those reasons alone, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to force franchisees to use a specific brand of machines, contract a specific company for repairs, and use specific OEM parts. CYA big time in so many ways.What people are forgetting here is McDonald&#x27;s has an interest in these machines working as well as possible (revenue + reputation), and the franchisee also has an interest in these machines working as well as possible (revenue). The franchisee however, does not necessarily care about the McDonald&#x27;s brand and reputation, and given the option might choose degraded parts&#x2F;safety to save money - causing a problem for McDonalds.So... McDonald&#x27;s says you have to use these approved machines and get service&#x2F;parts from this approved vendor. Case closed...The only people who seem to really care about this issue are customers. That won&#x27;t be enough to force a private company to open the door to any yahoo repair company with Wish.com replacement parts. reply krisoft 11 hours agorootparent> What people are forgetting here is McDonald&#x27;s has an interest in these machines working as well as possible (revenue + reputation)But clearly they are dropping the ball all the way to the third basement. If a piece of equipment is so bad that it&#x27;s lack of reliability becomes a meme then you have issues.What I really don&#x27;t understand is that it seems that the franchisees are paying for the equipment manufacturer per service call. It would make much more sense to pay a fixed fee per ice cream machine per unit of time subject to some SLA. If you properly set up the incentive structure that makes the equipment manufacturer incentivised to seek ways to provide reliable, easy to maintain machines.It is not like this is impossible. The same manufacturer sells reliable machines to all the other chains! So they can do it.> The only people who seem to really care about this issue are customers.And the franchisees? Who are losing money every time they are turning away costumers. (Not talking about the lost business because they are not seen as a reliable purveyor of ice cream, and people who crave ice cream go to some other place.)

If a piece of equipment is so bad that it&#x27;s lack of reliability becomes a meme then you have issues.I couldn&#x27;t find numbers - however I have a feeling the issue isn&#x27;t less reliability than expected, but rather McDonald&#x27;s serves more ice cream products (by volume) than most or all other fast food chains.Anecdotally, people travel to McDonald&#x27;s only for some of their ice cream products, such as McFlurries, and then leave disappointed when the machine is not working. Very few people go to, say, Burger King just for a shake. This pattern makes the issue more visible.> The same manufacturer sells reliable machines to all the other chains!We have no real evidence of this though, do we?It makes zero sense to have these conspiracy theories that McDonald&#x27;s is being paid to push unreliable machines on franchisees or something. Few if any franchisees are even complaining about this issue, it&#x27;s customers like you and me who are mad about not getting a milkshake, and then companies trying to shoehorn their way into the lucrative commercial repair business.If McDonald&#x27;s thinks everything is ok, and franchisees on average are not complaining, then what&#x27;s the real issue?No matter how we spin it, this particular situation has nothing to do with Right to Repair. It&#x27;s about corporate standards for franchisees. reply pseg134 9 hours agorootparentThe franchisee’s do not like the situation. You immediately write everyone off as being conspiracy theorists, but you are failing to consider the incentives. Other companies negotiated a fixed service fee for the life of the unit paid at the time of purchase. McDonalds signed a contract that requires payment per service call. The company now has an incentive to make sure McDonalds has the least reliable machines and the franchisees have an incentive to not call in for a repair. No conspiracy needed. reply billjings 8 hours agorootparentprev> What people are forgetting here is McDonald&#x27;s has an interest in these machines working as well as possible (revenue + reputation), and the franchisee also has an interest in these machines working as well as possible (revenue).The franchisee, however, has a countervailing desire to reduce their own costs which McDonald&#x27;s is fairly insensitive to. McDonald&#x27;s needs the ice cream to be available, sure, but are they above accepting kickbacks from Taylor the ice cream machine company to keep Taylor&#x27;s cash flow going?We are living in an obscenely corrupt and top heavy business environment where much money is to made by insider dealing in large companies with entrenched market positions. There really should be no better evidence of that than the fact than the evidence presented here: America&#x27;s largest, most famous fast food chain, incapable of reliably serving ice cream to its customers because it&#x27;s subject to vendor lock-in. reply greedo 12 hours agorootparentprevMcDonalds exerts controls to protect its reputation, and does this through its franchise agreements with franchisees.

The ice cream products from McDonald&#x27;s all come from the same machine. I was not asserting they are the same machines at other fast food brands.The fact that these machines are likely custom made, or partially customized just for McDonald&#x27;s is even more reason why it&#x27;s reasonable for McDonald&#x27;s to force franchisees to use specific vendors for repair&#x2F;parts.Even with right to repair, McDonald&#x27;s can force franchisees to use specific equipment and parts and vendors. That is their right as the brand owner.Which means... there is no reality where joe-random repair company is going to be allowed to repair joe-random franchisee&#x27;s machines using parts sourced from who knows where. It&#x27;s just not going to ever happen, there&#x27;s too much liability.McDonald&#x27;s wants a machine that&#x27;s so brain-dead simple to use safely and keep sanitarily that even a new-hire with 5 minutes of training can operate it effectively.

Most fast food chains only sell one ice cream product, usually shakes or cones, maybe both. McDonald&#x27;s sells McFlurries which are very popular, in addition to seasonal products and then the regular products. Given McDonald&#x27;s is also the largest fast food chain in the world, it stands to reason they sell more ice cream products than anyone else.Which would, yes, mean the surface area is larger and more exposed.

Someone made a 3rd party troublehsooting tool that solved the majority of problems without needing to call a Taylor tech, and McDonalds corporate disallowed it.The point is not \"can they do this\" the point is \"is it necessary for them to do it for brand reputational reasons\".The steelman argument I&#x27;ve seen for this state of affairs is that (apparently) the McDonald&#x27;s machine is much more complicated to allow it to self sanitize&#x2F;clean every night and only need full disassembly every 2 weeks. The machines used at other chains apparently don&#x27;t&#x27; have this automatic process and must be disassembled and manually cleaned more frequently. That would all be well and good...if it worked. The frequent state of disrepair of McDonalds machines pretty clearly indicates it does not.They are mandating the use of a low-reliability machine, presumably in the name of lower labor costs (which you&#x27;d think you wouldn&#x27;t have to _mandate_ since the franchiesees probably care more about labor costs than anyone), also mandating an expensive service contract for those machines. I&#x27;m just really really skeptical that 3rd party parts would make this situation worse. People already have the impression that McDonals ice creams machines are usually broken. I don&#x27;t think this opinion is based on a quantitative assesment of uptime, where, if it got 10% worse, their opinion would decrease by 10%.To try and summarise: I thin your argument that 3rd party parts would create enough of a reliability problem to meaningfully change their reputation, which is _already_ one of lack of reliability (deserved or not), is completely implausable to me. reply Alupis 11 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking past each other it seems.> They literally _are_ doing that.

It&#x27;s non-standard and non-approved. McDonald&#x27;s has no idea what that firmware&#x2F;tool actually does. You (and the makers) claim it was better, but how do you actually know? Maybe it just bypasses safety and sanitary standards McDonald&#x27;s has set for these machines... giving the appearance in the short-term of being more reliable.In the end, it&#x27;s McDonald&#x27;s who will be sued if someone gets sick from a milkshake. Therefore, they can and will enforce standards, including machines and vendors. Heck, they probably have approved vendors and parts for everything inside a McDonald&#x27;s, not just the ice cream machines. The toilet paper dispenser even most likely... but surely the stoves, fryers, etc.Right to Repair has nothing to do with this specific situation. It&#x27;s about corporate standards set for franchisees.Additionally, the franchisees aren&#x27;t even complaining about this. It&#x27;s customers, like you and me, who are mad we can&#x27;t get a McFlurry or something.That&#x27;s not going to compel any change other than make McDonald&#x27;s realize they might need more machines per location. replysircastor 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m reminded of Cory Doctorow&#x27;s referencing DMCA and the like as \"felony contempt of business model\".I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been this way a lot longer than I imagine, but it feels to me like in the 80s or so companies became a lot more interested in making their shareholders happy than they were in making their customers happy. reply jasonwatkinspdx 12 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s some truth to the idea that the \"MBA-ization\" of business management has been quite destructive. reply ChrisCinelli 9 hours agorootparentprevProbably more in the 90s since the 80s were all about total quality management.But \"companies became a lot more interested in making their shareholders happy than they were in making their customers happy\" is the BIGGEST problem with modern capitalism.

We also had an older model so it may also have been simpler to fix.One thing I would add is that it also highlights the importance of having a good maintenance person even in McDonalds. The reason why I knew a lot of the tricks with the ice cream machine is we had a guy there, who had been working overnight maintenance for >10 years there. The video mentions that you can’t expect minimum wage employees who have only been there for 2 weeks to know how to do these things.

Thank you for saving our time! reply SirMaster 13 hours agorootparentprevIf I recall some video I watched awhile ago:1. McD HQ mandates franchises buy a special model Taylor-Made machine (not the same that like Chick-fil-a and others use). This is why McD machines stop working but other companies don&#x27;t.2. Every night there is a very specific maintenance routine that needs to be ran to clean and prep the machine for the next day. If it&#x27;s not followed perfectly, the process will likely fail and the next morning workers will be greeted to a cryptic error code. Sometimes re-running the process will clear it, sometimes it wont. But this can take hours.3. If re-running it doesn&#x27;t fix it, then the franchise owner is stuck with the dilemma of bleeding money not having a working ice cream machine for customers, or calling an expensive hourly certified Taylor-Made repair person.4. So they usually end up calling the repair person.The idea is that McD HQ is working with Taylor-Made to make this problem happen so that franchise owners have to pay for expensive repair people.Apparently the error codes have been reverse-engineered with a USB device that a third party created.

Just reporting that tells you what you need to do to fix the problem. Dump a couple cups out and rerun the cycle. Or \"feed too viscous\"--dump the entire thing and run water on a cycle. Then reload with a fresh batch.This seems to be emblematic of that machine.And, the problem isn&#x27;t that these machines don&#x27;t have good error reporting. The problem is the fact that these machines are terribly unreliable. A 15% failure rate is bad. However, there is no money to be gained from fixing the issues. So, neither Taylor nor McDonalds&#x27;s will spend any money to fix it.It&#x27;s also emblematic that, given the health sensitive nature of the machines, no other company attempts to do heating in place.

If you could get into the service menu, you could find out what the problem is, fix it, and have it successfully complete a cycle, if you had access to the settings, you might be able to set it to try for a 5 hour cleaning cycle to give it more time to heat itself up to clean itself.

My fault for quick replies.I was responding to \"There are so many of these situations in medical devices.\" by which I took you to mean that there are many parallel situations the the McDonalds&#x2F;Taylor issue in the linked article and the franchises inability to keep them in service, or accept 3rd party help in doing it; I read this as the core point of the article.When I said \"things are more complicated\" I meant the relationship between the various entities and how systems get deployed, managed, maintained, etc. doesn&#x27;t look the same.So is that what you meant?It&#x27;s possible you just mean there are similar technical issues in the pumps, something I&#x27;m happy to accept you have direct experience in; in that case I just misread you.

That is pretty obvious . reply iancmceachern 6 hours agorootparentA good parallel in medical devices is dialysis.The dialysis industry is dominated by 2-3 large players who dominate the market, reimbursements, everything. They are Da Vita, Fresenious and I think there is a smaller third one.Dialysis machines are very similar in practice to ice cream machines. They have peristaltic (and other) pumps inside with wearable parts that need to be replaced on regular intervals for not only reliability and safety concerns, but for biological concerns. Bugs grow inside them, even though thy have a daily self sterilization cycle they run. So they need to do preventative maintenance every few months and change out plastic wear parts inside like pump heads, seals, valve seats, etc. Keep in mind these machines are used constantly, these companies view an empty seat at a dialysis center like lost revenue, so they do there best to keep the machines busy.Da Vita buys Gambro Dialysis machines, Fresenious makes their own. In both these cases there is a huge volume of disposables and accessories that go with these machines, both the daily disposables but the PM stuff too.Lots of these dialysis centers do things to improve their bottom line that is off label. They do things like washing and reusing dialyzers which are explicitly single use. They do so with other stuff also.Some newer systems are starting to use different techniques to not allow this, not allow these kinds of practices.This isn&#x27;t just dialysis.

You were focused narrowly on the technology, I was focussed on the broader situation, where I don&#x27;t see the equivalent of the franchise owner or the ice cream consumer in your dialysis example; if nothing else unlike the ice cream machines the dialysis units mostly function well for reasons related to how the two situations differ.There is some tech parallel I agree in e.g. protecting consumables , but that’s an aside in this context , and largely symptomatic if the way health care is paid for in US that drives towards a razor:razor blade model.Anyway that was a long walk for a short drink of water! replymewse-hn 15 hours agoparentprevSo.. one of the smokescreens Taylor uses is that their proprietary control software is necessary to ensure the sterilization procedures happen correctly, so they can trot out the argument \"if you tamper with our machine you could kill somebody\".But it&#x27;s a damn ice cream machine.The stakes get a bit riskier when it comes to medical devices because it&#x27;s much easier to imagine the scenario where you tamper with a pacemaker, you&#x27;re going to kill somebody.

It&#x27;s called the risk based approach. You define what&#x27;s called essential performance or your device, things it must do or the patient or caregiver is harmed. You then do a FMEA to determine what failure modes exist, and what the result of each failure is. You then make sure you have mitigation in place for each of those situations. You then document that all, get it signed off internally, by the FDA, by your notified body, and by the test house (for 14485, FCC testing, etc). All that makes up the stack of documents that allows you to sell a medical product.It&#x27;s no different if it&#x27;s a generic product or a new novel one, same process same standards.For food machinery it&#x27;s also thr FDA for things like design and materials, and it&#x27;s the local health department for those items.

That evidently isn&#x27;t happening, so it seems safe to assume that Taylor is doing exactly what McDonalds corp thinks they should be doing. If a burger shop proprietor doesn&#x27;t like this, they&#x27;re free to open their own burger shop without a McDonalds franchise.

I was 16, and the dude in charge of cleaning the shake machine and the sundae machine was a bit of a stoner. Back in the day all the cleaning was manual (1982). So the dude would pull out all of the frozen shake mix, then run a soapy water mix through it, then a sanitizer rinse. Took some time, and closing was always a rush.So he either forgot or decided to skip the sanitizer rinse.Now if you put soap in dairy products, you end up giving people diarrhea.

New study finds microplastics infiltrate all systems of body, cause behavioural changes. KAREN LAIRD TWEET SHARE SHARE EMAIL PRINT Professor Jaime Ross, with graduate students Lauren Gaspar and Sydney Bartman, is investigating the potentially serious neurological impacts of microplastics on mammals. A news study conducted by University of Rhode Island Professor Jaime Ross investigating the infiltration of microplastics in mammals has revealed that this is far more widespread than initially thought. In fact, the plastic particles were found to bioaccumulate in every organ, including, startlingly enough, the brain. Microplastics are among the most pervasive pollutants on the planet. They have been discovered in the air, in water systems and food chains around the world. While their negative impacts on marine organisms have been established, few studies have examined the potential health impacts on mammals. “Research on the health effects of microplastics, especially in mammals, is still very limited,” said Ross, an assistant professor of biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences at the Ryan Institute for Neuroscience and the College of Pharmacy. The study noted that humans are exposed to microplastics through the consumption of ‘water, seafood, consumer products (clothes, toothpaste, salt, sugar, honey, beer, anything stored in plastic bottles, plastic wrap, or cans/cartons lined with plastic), and via inhalation from textiles, synthetic rubber tires, and plastic covers’. They have been detected, among others, in blood and even breast milk - findings that warrant more investigation into the health outcomes of such exposure in mammals. Currently, there are limited studies that address the potential adverse effects of exposure to MPs on brain health in mammals and even fewer studies that consider age as an additional factor that may impact the outcome of exposure to microplastics - the reason Ross and her team chose to focus on neurobehavioral effects and inflammatory response to exposure to microplastics, as well as the accumulation of microplastics in tissues. Together with graduate students Lauren Gaspar and Sydney Bartman, she examined the biological and cognitive consequences of exposure to microplastics in mice. The drinking water of a diverse group of older and younger mice was spiked with microplastics over a period of three weeks - with ‘striking’ results, said Ross. The researchers found that exposure to microplastics - in this case, fluorescent polystyrene particles - induced both behavioural changes and alterations in immune markers in liver and brain tissues. The mice in the study began to move peculiarly, and to exhibit behaviours reminiscent of dementia in humans. The results were even more profound in older animals. “These were not high doses of microplastics, but in only a short period of time, we saw these changes,” Ross said. “Nobody really understands the life cycle of these microplastics in the body, so part of what we want to address is the question of what happens as you get older. Are you more susceptible to systemic inflammation from these microplastics as you age? Can your body get rid of them as easily? Do your cells respond differently to these toxins?” After three weeks, dissection of the mice revealed that the ingested PS micro-particles had infiltrated every every tissue sample - liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, lung, spleen, heart, and brain tissues from both young and old exposed mice - tested. The particles were also observed in the mice’s bodily wastes. “The detection of MPs in tissues such as the heart and lungs … suggests that the PS-MPs (polystyrene microplastics) are going beyond the digestive system and likely undergoing systemic circulation,” the authors write. An observation they note that is further supported by the detection of microplastics in urine and the brain, indicating they can pass the blood–brain barrier. That brain infiltration also may cause a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein, called “GFAP”, a protein that supports many cell processes in the brain, results have shown. Previous studies have suggested that GFAP expression might decrease in early stages of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, or in younger patients with depression disorders. What is especially concerning is the fact that these changes were seen after just three weeks of exposure to microplastics. As human exposure today is inevitable it is therefore essential to better understand their toxicity to limit their impact on human health. The present study, showed that in just three weeks, polystyrene particles measuring 0.1 and 2 μm can reduce cell viability, translocate throughout the body, accumulate in tissues including brain tissue, markedly modify behaviour in mice, and significantly alter immune markers in both the liver and the brain. Additionally, the effects of exposure seem to be age-dependent. Future work is needed to examine these factors in order to understand the mechanisms behind these effects and the changes seen with age, said Ross. “We want to understand how plastics may change the ability for the brain to maintain its homeostasis or how exposure may lead to neurological disorders and diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease,” she said. The study was published in the International Journal of Molecular Science. It was supported by the Rhode Island Medical Research Foundation, Roddy Foundation, Plastics Initiative, URI College of Pharmacy, George and Anne Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, and the Rhode Island Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.

Most people do not relate the two, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they have related causes.The first is the Flynn effect, which was rising IQ levels decade over decade, which halted and then reserved for most Western nations around 1990s&#x2F;2000s and is now declining: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flynn_effectThe second is the dropping fertility&#x2F;sperm counts&#x2F;hormone issues&#x2F;etc: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Male_infertility_crisisI think microplastics along with forever chemicals&#x2F;PFAS are two of the likely culprits and are probably fairly easy to deal with.I wonder what else could be contributing? reply rthomas6 20 hours agoparentAlso the metabolic syndrome&#x2F;obesity epidemic. 40% of US adults have obesity.

That&#x27;s part of it, but I wonder if microplastics or some kind of gut biome disruption is playing a role as well. reply bhouston 20 hours agorootparentObesity is caused in part by environmental toxins, probably to different extents in different people:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2022&#x2F;may&#x2F;19&#x2F;environm...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;obesity&#x2F;what-to-know-obesogensThese so called \"obesogens\" just increase the propensity towards obesity and depending on exposure and your sensitivity to then, you can overcome them or not via exercise and dieting and other means. reply SunlightEdge 19 hours agorootparentThe prevalence of sugar in so many foods can&#x27;t help.Personally I avoid \"sugary\" food and drinks like the plague.

Its complicated... reply dhfjfhfh 16 hours agorootparentWhat about obese adults that used to be obese children?Regardless of the cause of the obesity epidemic, it should be addressed compassionately and efficaciously. What makes that difficult (at least in the US) is that the most efficacious treatments aren&#x27;t aligned with how the healthcare system works. Maybe you won&#x27;t blame being fat on diet and exercise, but there&#x27;s almost certainly a diet and excercise plan that will make you lose weight.First-line treatment should be, - Walk&#x2F;jog 30 min, 3x per week. Pace for a mildly elevated heart rate. - Eliminate super sweet foods from regular diet. No more than 3x per week. This could be VERY hard for sugar-addicted folks, so start small and work up. - Fast occasionally. Intermittent is great, but longer is even better. - Take a multivitamin.The end goal is to replace your sweet craving with a fat craving and be ok feeling hungry for periods of time. reply geysersam 15 hours agorootparentprev> Obese children I have sympathy for, I&#x27;m uncertain how I feel about obese adultsWhy would you not have sympathy for someone suffering?

If you don’t eat then you won’t gain weight, there is no subverting the laws of thermodynamics.It sounds callous but if you go to Africa or visit a prisoner of war camp you won’t find many fat people and so blaming chemicals in America for so many fat people doesn’t make much sense to me. reply avgcorrection 20 hours agorootparentThe tunnel-vision on this subject is truly astounding. I can&#x27;t think of any subject that is treated in the same way.Say that someone was failing at university because they have no motivation. And they have no motivation because they have depression. Then a vocal minority would always butt in with the following truism:- Failing university courses is caused by not studying enough. There is no subverting the fact that you need to study the material in order to not fail the course.This is of course a completely useless advice&#x2F;truism.Now say that someone overeats because they have depression. Or because of some pathology caused by microplastics. Or let&#x27;s just say that there is a possibility that a different environment (no microplastics) would lead to them not overeating. Do you still want to derail this conversation with irrelevant “thermodynamics” truisms? reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentAs someone who struggled with depression at university, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the only useful advice.\"I am failing because I am not studying enough.\"Granted, I could introspect on what was preventing me from studying, leverage additional college resources, align to my learning styles, etc.But until I accepted the above as an honest objective truth, and a path to change, I wasn&#x27;t able to be successful. reply edgyquant 19 hours agorootparentprevHow about we stop trying to come up with any reason but the objective one for the cause of the problem? reply no_identd 11 hours agorootparent&#x27;The mistake here lies in the assumption that it is possible to describe an object completely (we won&#x27;t go so far as to say \"explain\") without making any reference to its relation to its environment (whether this relation be one of indifference, selective relevance and capacity for stimulation, of disconnection, or of closure). In order to avoid these problems, which arise from the point of departure taken, both subjectivist and objectivist theories of knowledge have to be replaced by the system&#x2F;environment distinction, which then makes the distinction subject&#x2F;object irrelevant.&#x27;― Luhmann, Niklas (1990), The Cognitive Program of Constructivism and a Reality that Remains Unknown.

You argument says nothing about what causes people to gain weight, however.Just look up &#x27;hormonal weight gain&#x27; to see that it isn&#x27;t just about eating less. Then look at research into the influence of chemicals&#x2F;micro plastics on those hormones.Yes, all calories have to go in through the mouth. How those calories are processed, however, is influenced by a great many factors. reply tarsinge 19 hours agorootparentI visited the US a few years ago and I was shocked how much calories were packed in random foods. Some desserts&#x2F;cakes alone were above 1000kcal. Basically in the US I had to be very careful and calorie counting and I got the impression if you eat randomly you&#x27;ll end up with a very high calorie intake (typically above 3000 per day), whereas this is usually less true in Europe (but it&#x27;s getting less true every year) and you might end up just a bit overweight instead of obese by eating randomly. reply joquarky 18 hours agorootparentprev>How those calories are processed, however, is influenced by a great many factors.I feel compelled to assume that we can&#x27;t possibly be extracting every calorie from certain types of food. Caloriometers work differently from human digestive systems. reply sudosysgen 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s correct, but we&#x27;re pretty efficient - from 75 to 99%. This is typically around 90% except for fiber, which is marked down in calorie labels already. It also depends on what exactly you&#x27;re doing with the energy, if you&#x27;re in a calorie surplus then protein to tryglyceride metabolism is less efficient than, say, dietary fat to tryglyceride, but this can just be neglected.But yeah, human digestion is pretty efficient. Muscles are far less efficient though, around 30%, which is a neat fact. reply flir 20 hours agorootparentprevIn an environment awash with cheap calories, some people get obese and some don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s something worth investigating. (I personally think it&#x27;s more about natural mental variation than subtle chemical poisoning, but that&#x27;s probably just my bias talking). reply kjkjadksj 19 hours agorootparentAlso the big elephant in the room is most people are hardly active. Your body is designed to forage for miles a day. Who even bothers simulating that? We walk to the fridge and from grocery store to parked car at most. Its so much easier to maintain good health if you are active. reply joquarky 18 hours agorootparentI wonder how much better it would be if we had developed more for walking than for cars. reply gizmo 20 hours agorootparentprevTrue in the technical sense, but it doesn’t address the mystery that in the 40s, 50s, 60s people in rich countries had access to plenty of food, ate lots of calories, and yet obesity was very rare. reply flextheruler 15 hours agorootparentThat’s no mystery. The amount of calories the average person expends has decreased as we’ve become more sedentary.In the 40s, 50s, and 60s most people did manual labor and even office jobs were not as sedentary since you couldn’t just sit at a computer.Here’s another simple overlooked example, grocery shopping, before the rise of superstores you’d go into town and visit 4 different stores.

If it’s being caused by external factors like plastic or any pollution we’d expect to see similar effects in all other mammals especially ones close to human populations.I wasn’t able to find any studies backing this up with just a cursory search, but it is likely the easiest way to add or detract from the plastic hypothesis.I do know that not all but most studies comparing fertility between decades found that when controlling for obesity the differences were not statistically significant between time periods. reply kjkjadksj 19 hours agorootparentprevNicotine suppresses appetite. reply voakbasda 18 hours agorootparentTrite, but accurate.

I could diet and exercise and still gain weight that was largely visceral fat, and especially fat in my liver. I was in the beginning stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Under my doctor&#x27;s supervision, I went on the keto diet. I eat high fat foods and meats, and I lost about 50 lbs in 2 months. My weight stabilized over the following months within a healthy range. Additionally, chronic pain, concentration, and energy levels all improved. Most of this is due to the weight loss, but not all of it. Sugar can cause inflammation in high quantities, and it can also cause an increase in blood pressure. Sugars are also metabolized by cancer cells while ketones are not, which would explain the rise in cancer rates as sugar consumption has increased across the planet. My liver function improved, cholesterol levels improved, blood sugar stabilized, and insulin resistance went down.I personally believe that there is some kind of difference among humans in how we digest things that goes beyond the microbiome. Some people can eat high amounts of carbohydrates and sugars without negative consequences beyond tooth decay. Other people cannot eat any sugar without incurring weight gain and cognitive problems. reply HyprMusic 20 hours agorootparentprevFat by itself is very satiating, you&#x27;d struggle to rack up the calories eating purely fat unless you were really trying. However too much sugar without fibre will spike your blood sugar levels which triggers an insulin response, causing your body to effectively store any glucose in your bloodstream into muscle and fat cells[0]. The end result is you&#x27;re hungry again and able to eat more calories. Combine that with a high fat diet and you have a recipe for obesity.When I used to weight train, during my cuts (weight loss phases), I had much more success with a high fat&#x2F;low carb diet than I ever did calorie counting (which naturally makes you avoid fat since they have a higher calorie density).[0] Not an expert but this is my layman&#x27;s understanding after reading lots of books on the subject. reply relwin 20 hours agorootparentprevThese folks suspect lithium in our water causes obesity.

It is hard to pull all the factors apart because they contribute to each other. If you are obese, I understand it screws up your hormones which makes it easier to stay obese.

If we can continue to deal with these harmful chemicals that have clear links to negative health outcomes, we will be better off as a society.The trick is to keep studying them and then act on those studies to mitigate the harms of those chemicals.The world is complex and there is usually not a singular cause of everything.

Nobody likes other people so much that they’d choose to be stuck in a school cafeteria environment for their food or their children’s food forever. Life is not perpetual kindergarten where everyone’s together all the time. Life is competition and mutually-beneficial cooperation in some things, and friends are made on the basis of mutual desire. Not forced socialization and collectives. What you are proposing results in mass starvation when the systems of incentives and motivations collapse.More local farms and more vertical farms and more greenhouses and more victory gardens are the best path. I leave it to families and individuals to choose what options they want and to buy food whenever they want. With more production, all the options will get cheaper as we flood the world with more fresh produce from better and more localized supply chains owing to incoming innovations in vertical and greenhouse farming. Not interested in going back to top-down control structures from the 1900s.What’s next? Restricting the caloric intake of political pariahs? Restricting the options available at the local canteen to give the best options to the friends of the party and everyone in charge?

All plastics are ephemeral and they&#x27;re not easily recyclable. Humans used glass, wax, paper, wood, and other products before plastics were widely available and our materials sciences have improved dramatically over time. To me, the main problem here is that plastics are just so cheap due to having been in production for so long. With a strong tax incentive, it should be possible to promote other materials.

Lead, mercury, radioactivity, thalidomide, and asbestos poisoning are not detectable as “my child put a toy in their mouth and their tongue fell off.”These were uncovered over the course of years by statistical analysis, prompted by suspicions created by (noisy, often non-human) information about the mechanisms.Similarly, we have tons of data supporting a bunch of theories of micro plastic harm in the lab. The waiting revelation isn’t going to be “omg all these people are sick and we didn’t know it,” it’s going to be “all these people have been sick and we didn’t know why.”Which is exactly the form of the sperm quality&#x2F;fertility theory as well as obesity. We know these compounds cause fertility and metabolism issues in cell cultures and in animal models. We know we are facing civilization-scale problems with obesity and fertility. Drawing the connection between these types of observations is always extremely noisy because there are obviously trillions of variables affecting “does a specific individual become infertile or obese,” or “does a person have an elevated risk of birth defects.”I’m not necessarily on the side of an immediate and total ban, but this “we’ll see the problems if they exist” attitude is profoundly ignorant and arrogant.

So be completely apathetic. Or always be afraid of everything and perform some purity rituals that give you some peace of mind despite not really knowing anything. Like drinking bottled water only despite that maybe having more, or installing expensive filtration systems without testing before or after for the existence of microplastics or effectiveness of the filter. Or telling your kid not to drink certain water because its not safe, despite having no actual knowledge of any risk.Obviously we should continue to gather more information and remediate what we can but I think there is also a problem with fear-based behavior that just spreads anxiety baselessly. reply yakcyll 21 hours agorootparentI agree with the perspective that it&#x27;s impossible to tell exactly, with confidence, how harmful they are and what each of us should do. The topic may not be fresh, but the awareness of the dangers is. If you aren&#x27;t willing to go with the intuition that having non-degradable artificial compounds in your body sounds &#x27;bad&#x27;, then I&#x27;d personally go for what seems to be a reasonable middle ground, likely what most of us are already doing, which is - stay on the look out. Assimilate trustworthy data (on the question of what constitutes trustworthy data - that which comes from sources striving for integrity and rigor and not from anecdotes), be ready to adjust, steel yourself for possibly drastic changes in the future.Personally, I find the argument that the data we currently have is not enough to force us to make such changes absolutely understandable - but at the same time, I find this kind of inertia unwarranted in the age where the world looked almost unrecognisable just a decade ago. reply Semaphor 21 hours agorootparentprevI mean, some things will reduce your plastic exposure without requiring measurements. Glass containers, metal bowls, no non-stick pans. That still leaves open if that results in different health outcomes, but it’s still something you can do without having high-tech measurement devices. reply nonethewiser 21 hours agorootparentWell I&#x27;m talking about water specifically. In theory I agree that we can avoid things we know are harming us. But there is a balance to be struck between avoiding things out of an abundance of precaution and paranoia. Let&#x27;s not forget that mental health issues including anxiety have skyrocketed the past few decades. At some point it has to be measured or else we wouldn&#x27;t know its harmful. With microplastics and water, you need to know what comes out of your faucet (or whatever you are drinking). You can&#x27;t just rely on some study analogous to those finding issues with eating teflon or using it on very high heat. And not drinking out of plastic cups seems firmly in baseless anxiety territory. reply gniv 21 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure that helps.

    "title": "Grave flaws in BGP Error handling",
    "originLink": "https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-path-attributes-grave-error-handling",
    "originBody": "< All postsFediverseRSSGitHubTalks Aug 29 2023 Grave flaws in BGP Error handling Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto protocol that directs routing decisions between different ISP networks, and is generally known as the “glue” that holds the internet together. It’s safe to say that the internet we currently know would not function without working BGP implementations. However, the software on those networks’ routers (I will refer to these as edge devices from now on) that implements BGP has not had a flawless track record. Flaws and problems do exist in commercial and open source implementations of the world’s most critical routing protocol. Most of these flaws are of course benign in the grand scheme of things; they will be issues around things like route filtering, or insertion, or handling withdraws. However a much more scary issue is a BGP bug that can propagate after causing bad behaviour, akin to a computer worm. While debugging support for a future feature for my business (bgp.tools) I took a brief diversion to investigate something, and what I came out with might be one of the most concerning things I’ve discovered for the reliability of the internet. To understand the problems, though, we will need a bit more context. A mistaken attribute On 2 June 2023, a small Brazilian network (re)announced one of their internet routes with a small bit of information called an attribute that was corrupted. The information on this route was for a feature that had not finished standardisation, but was set up in such a way that if an intermediate router did not understand it, then the intermediate router would pass it on unchanged. As many routers did not understand this attribute, this was no problem for them. They just took the information and propagated it along. However it turned out that Juniper routers running even slightly modern software did understand this attribute, and since the attribute was corrupted the software in its default configuration would respond by raising an error that would shut down the whole BGP session. Since a BGP session is often a critical part of being “connected” to the wider internet, this resulted in the small Brazilian network disrupting other networks’ ability to communicate with the rest of the internet, despite being 1000’s of miles away. A reader has pointed out that the attribute in question was not actually corrupted, but the support was just unfinished it appears The packet that causes session shutdowns was really quite benign at first glance: When a BGP session shuts down due to errors, customer network traffic generally stops flowing down that cable until the BGP connection is automatically restarted (typically within seconds to minutes). This appears to be what happened to a number of different carriers, for example COLT was heavily impacted by this. Their outage is what originally drew some of my attention to this subject area. To understand why this sort of thing can happen, we’ll need to take a deeper look at what BGP route attributes are, and what they’re used for. What is a BGP Route Attribute? At their core a BGP UPDATEs purpose is to tell another router about some traffic that it can (or can no longer) send to it. However just knowing directly what you can send to another router is not very useful without context. For this reason a BGP packet is split up into two sections: the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) data (aka, the IP address ranges), and the attributes that help describe extra context about that reachability data. Arguably the most used attribute is the AS_PATH (or actually, the AS4_PATH), an attribute that tells you which networks a route has travelled through to get to you. Routers use this list of networks to pick paths for their traffic that are either the fastest, economically viable, or least congested, playing a critical role in ensuring that things run smoothly. At the time of writing there are over 32 different route attribute types, 14 deprecated ones, and 209 officially unassigned ones. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is in charge of assigning codes to each BGP attribute type codes, normally off the back of IETF Internet-Drafts. The IANA list doesn’t always give the full story, though, as not all internet-drafts make their way into more official documents (like RFC’s), so code numbers are assigned (or sometimes even “squatted”) to attribute types that did not get wide deployment. Unknown attribute propagation At the start of every route attribute is a set of flags, conveying information about the attribute. One important flag is called the “transitive bit”: If a BGP implementation does not understand an attribute, and the transitive bit is set, it will copy it to another router. If the router does understand the attribute then it may apply its own policy. At a glance this “feature” seems like an incredibly bad idea, as it allows possibly unknown information to propagate blindly through systems that do not understand the impact of what they are forwarding. However this feature has also allowed widespread deployment of things like Large Communities to happen faster, and has arguably made deployment of new BGP features possible at all. When attribute decoding goes wrong What happens when an attribute fails to decode? The answer depends strongly on if the BGP implementation has been updated to use RFC 7606 logic or not; If the session is not RFC 7606 compliant, then typically an error is raised and the session is shut down. If it is, the session can usually continue as normal (except the routes impacted by the decoding error are treated as unreachable). BGP session shutdowns are particularly undesirable, as they will impact traffic flow along a path. However in the case of a “Transitive” error they can become worm-like. Since not all BGP implementations support the same attributes, an attribute that is unknown to one implementation (and subsequently forwarded along) can cause another implementation to shut down the session it received it from. With some reasonably educated crafting of a payload, someone could design a BGP UPDATE that “travels” along the internet unharmed, until it reaches a targeted vendor and results in that vendor resetting sessions. If that data comes down the BGP connections that are providing wider internet access for the network, this could result in a network being pulled offline from the internet. This attack is not even a one-off “hit-and-run”, as the “bad” route is still stored in the peer router; when the session restarts the victim router will reset again the moment the route with the crafted payload is transmitted again. This has the potential to cause prolonged internet or peering outages. This is a large part of why the RFC mentioned earlier, RFC 7606, exists; looking at its security considerations section, we can see a description of this exact problem:: Security Considerations This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening routers. Since the intervening routers do not recognize the attribute, they propagate it without checking it. When the malformed attribute arrives at a router that does recognize the given attribute type, that router resets the session over which it arrived. Since significant fan-out can occur between the attacker and the routers that do recognize the attribute type, this attack could potentially be particularly harmful. In a basic BGP setup this is bad, but with extra engineering it could be used to partition large sections of the internet. If BGP sessions between carriers are forced to reset in this way, causing traffic flow to stop, some routes on the internet would not have alternatives to use, making this a family of bugs that is a grave threat to the overall reliability of the internet. Building a basic fuzzer Important Commitment: I run a business that involves being peered to many IXP route servers and other peoples routers. I have not and will not ever test for BGP bugs/exploits on customer/partner sessions (unless they give consent). All testing here has been done either on GNS3 VMs, or physical hardware I have hanging around and in isolated VLANs. To figure out if this would be a practically exploitable attack, I decided to write a fuzzer that would try to stuff random data in random attribute codes to see if I could get sessions to reset on different vendors BGP implementations. Because I am looking for problems that are “wormable”, I added a Bird 2 router in between my fuzzer and the router being tested. This way Bird will filter out all of the obvious non-exploitable issues, and leave me with the packets that are of concern. All good fuzzers should be able to run unattended, so how do we teach the fuzzer to tell if the session has reset itself? The solution I came to was that the Victim router would always announce a keepalive prefix, 192.0.2.0/24 (aka TEST-NET-1) and the fuzzer would treat a withdraw of that prefix (from the intermediate bird router) as a sign the session went down, and report back the parameters that caused that to happen! Testing the fuzzer, I can see that the bird output shows unknown attributes as their type code, and a hex encoding of their contents. In addition it puts a [t] to indicate that it is transitive. 198.51.100.0/24 unicast [fuzzer 21:31:24.378] * (100) [AS65001?]via 192.168.5.1 on ens5Type: BGP univBGP.origin: IncompleteBGP.as_path: 65001BGP.next_hop: 192.168.5.1BGP.local_pref: 100BGP.community: (123,2345)BGP.ec [t]: 7d cc c7 30 Now that the fuzzer was able to run itself, all that was left was to test all of the vendors one by one… Fuzzer findings / Impacted Vendors Keep in mind that the described issues are applicable if you are running an edge device with full BGP tables. If you are not running a “full routing table” or a partial peering table, then you are less likely to be impacted by these discoveries. Another thing to keep in mind, the issues below are different to the ones that the team at Forescout recently presented at BlackHat. Unimpacted Vendors: MikroTik RouterOS 7+ Ubiquiti EdgeOS Arista EOS Huawei NE40 Cisco IOS-XE / “Classic” / XR Bird 1.6, All versions of Bird 2.0 GoBGP Juniper JunOS Impact Juniper has released: JSA72510 Similar to the problem that caused this research to be done, another exploitable Attribute was found in the form of Attribute 29 (BGP-LS). Due to the nature of the attribute it is unlikely that an exploit attempt will propagate too far over the internet, however peering sessions and route servers are still at risk. All Juniper users are urged to enable bgp-error-tolerance: [edit protocols bgp] root# show group TRANSIT { import import-pol; export send-direct; peer-as 4200000001; local-as 4200000002; neighbor 192.0.2.2; } bgp-error-tolerance; In all tested cases, enabling bgp-error-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions. A JunOS software release is expected in the future to correct this. One member of staff at Juniper has also authored an Internet-Draft at the IETF around handling these issues. Juniper is tracking this issue as CVE-2023-4481 / JSA72510. Nokia SR-OS Impact Fuzzing SR-OS (Version 22.10) revealed many, likely highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes. All Nokia SR-OS and SR-Linux users are urged to enable error-handling update-fault-tolerance on their devices. bgp group \"TRANSIT\" export \"yes\" error-handling update-fault-tolerance exit neighbor 192.0.2.2 peer-as 2 exit exit no shutdown exit In all tested cases, enabling update-fault-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions. To the best of my understanding, Nokia has no plans to correct these issues, instead suggesting customers apply error-handling update-fault-tolerance to their BGP groups. FRR Impact (and other downstream vendors) FRR Has patched post publication: [Link to PR] FRR attempts to handle bad attributes using RFC 7606 behaviour. However the fuzzer discovered that a corrupted attribute 23 (Tunnel Encapsulation) will cause a session to go down regardless. After reporting this bug to FRR maintainers I received an acknowledgement of the issue and understanding that the issue is a DoS risk to FRR users, but I have not managed to get anything out of FRR since. This bug is being tracked as CVE-2023-38802 and at the time of writing has no patch or fix. FRR is packaged inside many other products, to name a few: SONIC, PICA8, Cumulus, and DANOS. OpenBSD OpenBGPd Impact OpenBGPd also supports the improved RFC 7606 behaviour, however it was found that the recently added Only To Customer implementation could cause session resets. This issue was very rapidly fixed after being reported to them, and is tracked as CVE-2023-38283. OpenBSD users can install Errata 006 to mitigate this issue. Extreme Networks EXOS Impact As a result of fuzzing EXOS, the program revealed 2 highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes in the form of: Attribute 21: AS_PATHLIMIT Attribute 25: IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community There is currently no known patch or mitigating config for this issue. I made Extreme aware of this problem, however after a back and forth with them waiting for what I understood was an implied release of a patch or fix, they communicated that they will not be fixing it in the near future. A quote from the security email thread (I’ve added emphasis to the critical parts of their response): After review of all the material, we are not considering this a vulnerability due to the presence of RFC 7606, as well as a history of documentation expressing these concerns all the way back to early 2000s, if not earlier. Malformed attributes are not a novel concept as an attack vector to BGP networks, as evidenced by RFC 7606, which is almost a decade old. As such, customers that have chosen to not require or implement RFC 7606 have done so willingly and with knowledge of what is needed to defend against these types of attacks. Thus, the expectation that we’ll reset our BGP sessions based on RFC 4271 attribute handling is proper. We do abide by other RFCs, in which we claim support, that update RFC 4271. Other vendors do claim RFC 7606 support and have been sharing these controls as a mitigation to malformed attribute response. They don’t appear to be producing new work product to account for these behaviors. We are evaluating support for RFC 7606 as a future feature. Obviously, if customers desire a different response, we’ll work through our normal feature request pipelines to address. This is no different than any other RFC support request. I cannot overstate how much I disagree with Extreme’s response to this, and in the interests of full transparency (and to avoid any allegations of editorialising this, in my view, extremely poor response), I have made the full email exchange available here: (PDF). The Vendor Security Response I’ve been through my fair share of security issue discoveries, and over time I’ve taken a stronger leaning into “simply do not report” or “full disclosure without warning”, rather than the now commonly accepted 90 day “responsible disclosure” methodology. This is mostly because I’ve had really poor experiences when disclosing issues to security teams. The bugs discussed in this post cover many vendors and implementations. Full disclosure was originally my plan, however due to the clear risk of harm to the general internet routing system from these findings, I felt it was likely inexcusable to do full-disclosure. (Plus, a malicious deployment of these findings could have a small but I believe very real chance of a “kinetic response” from a misunderstanding.) Overall the response from vendors has been mostly disappointing. One vendor was extremely hard to find contacts for, and I feel that they were stringing me along for some time, only to reply back that they were not going to fix the problem. Other vendors notably were not immediately interested in notifying customers of mitigating config to the problems, however when I personally started extending notices to my peers at larger carriers about the problems (since if they were not going to, I was going to try and reduce the exploit surface) a vendor notice was issued. No vendor that I reported to has any form of bug bounty, and this entire adventure has consumed huge volumes of my time and mental capacity. In a normal situation this “cost” would have simply been eaten by an employer whose interest is name recognition or altruistic actions. However I am self-employed with my own company (that admittedly does have an interest in a functioning BGP ecosystem), and so this entire adventure has simply delayed product development that I (and customers) really would have liked to have done. With all of that in mind, my “good faith” advice to people reporting security bugs in network vendor software is that contacting vendors is not an effective solution. The people on the other side are either already overloaded, or generally don’t care about receiving issues. Since there is no motivation to report bugs (either in the form of bug bounties, or being treated well), I see no reason to do responsible disclosure (apart from cases where it would clearly protect their innocent customers from misery, while accounting for the risk of a vendor simply doing nothing). The two options, as far as I see it, are either being strung along by a vendor over email for 90 days and then likely finding out nothing is done, or full disclosure. I worry about the state of networking vendors. With that being said, I would like to thank the OpenBSD security team, who very rapidly acknowledged my report, and prepared a patch. My only regret with dealing with the OpenBSD team was reporting the issue to them too quickly. Closing thoughts As mentioned before, with a few of the vendors (Nokia, Extreme, Juniper) I found myself contacting their own customers myself to warn them to enable mitigating config, as that proved to be a much more effective way at preventing risk than trying to push the vendor itself into action. As a result at least several incumbent ISPs, 1 large CDN, and 2 “Tier 1” networks have applied configuration to help prevent these issues from impacting them. If the goal of reporting security flaws is to reduce harm to their customers, I’m not convinced that reporting problems to vendors has enough of an effective impact to be worth doing, vs the loss of personal time and sanity. Several people I spoke to have been incredibly helpful (some who could not be listed here). I would like to thank the following people for having some role in helping me either discover/disclose these problems, editing this post, or general support for when vendors were being very frustrating.

When \"fixing\" a router means you break half the internet, you just don&#x27;t fix it. This isn&#x27;t some walled garden where you can just say \"tough shit if you broke, fix it\".Most of the \"issues\" these researchers find are well known, but backbone operators are more militant than Linus when it comes to: rule #1 is don&#x27;t break user space. reply gnfargbl 16 hours agorootparent> I think you fail to realize that the internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls.The internet is a bunch of disparate networks that no one person controls, exactly.

This is a security lesson that has been learnt in recent years by many sectors of the IT industry and, judging by the woeful response that Ben Cartwright-Cox describes in his post, it&#x27;s one that the network backbone is going to be learning soon. reply zamadatix 11 hours agorootparentThe internet does not owe a negligent operator peering. No one person controls the internet but you sure as hell can find yourself kicked out if your goal is to be right on principals instead of a good peer. The only hubris which could be at play is someone thinking the rest of the internet should follow their desires instead of the other way around.Research is great but if you&#x27;re poking around breaking things via DoS in the internet you&#x27;re going to be judged as a bad peer regardless what the route daemon does. The security of the internet constantly moves forward but that doesn&#x27;t mean the expectation of improving has to hold more precedence than the expectation of running.

The reality is that backbone routing is expensive, and expecting everyone to update their kit on YOUR timeline isn&#x27;t reasonable. reply gnfargbl 15 hours agorootparentI am aware that network operators have behaved this way for very many years. The point I am making is that all of the IT industry used to attempt to \"work around\" security vulnerabilities in the same way, until log4shell and all the others gradually beat that propensity out of them.I am prophesying that a similar reckoning is likely to come upon the network backbone. You&#x27;re arguing that the cost of entry to the game (BGP peering) is such that the old ways will continue to work. Let&#x27;s hope you&#x27;re right. reply devonkim 11 hours agorootparentSoftware ecosystems like libraries and frameworks have completely different propagation and remediation mechanics compared to federated systems like core Internet backbone routers and switches is the thing. Try as we might conceptualize otherwise the modern Internet from a packet’s purview is more like a loose confederation of ultimately privatized or state-run fiefdoms than a cellular automata digraph explosion. So actors that try to act maliciously against the network will be basically shut out given the rule of an iron fist being the default. reply gnfargbl 1 hour agorootparentConceptually, there is no special difference between a remotely exploitable vulnerability in an HTTP server and a remotely exploitable vulnerability in a BGP router. It would have been theoretically possible to have dealt with log4shell by blocking every IP address that was sending malicious payloads, for instance.Practically, I accept that there is a real difference. ASNs are much harder to acquire than IP addresses, and there are far fewer of them. That difference might mean that blocking continues to be an effective mechanism. However, in a world where malicious actors are increasingly just nation states wearing a flimsy mask, I&#x27;m not sure that the difficulty of getting access to sufficient numbers of ASNs is going to be a forever mitigation.The main thing I have taken away from this thread is that when it comes to vulnerability management, network operators seem to be pretty far behind the curve in mindset terms. The arguments being made in here (\"you can&#x27;t break other people&#x27;s stuff\", \"we have a lot of boxes and SLAs mean we can&#x27;t patch quickly\") aren&#x27;t even slightly new.

If there was a law that all cars had to be able to get hit by another car and keep going without issue (and this was physically plausible), then it would be similar. reply adra 19 hours agorootparentprevAs lousy as these systems are, they kill a hell of a lot fewer people (for now) than drunks, so net positive for the time being. reply simiones 18 hours agorootparentThat only makes sense if all the people using self-driving cars would have driven drunk (or drugged, or sleepy) instead. Otherwise, you&#x27;re replacing a decent driver with a sub-mediocre automatic system. reply mschuster91 19 hours agorootparentprevThe solution to drunk drivers is public transport, not self-driving cars. reply zajio1am 9 hours agorootparentUnfortunately at the time when drunken people are returning home from pubs&#x2F;bars (e.g. 2 in the morning) most public transport do not drive or at least is significantly limited. reply patmorgan23 8 hours agorootparentThis is a problem with North Americas suboptimal implementations of public transit. Most public transportation systems in the rest of the world do actually take care of this. reply zaroth 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s 2023 and driving kills like 40,000 people a year.We’ve been building trillions of dollars of public transit since about the same time as we started building the National highway system. So when exactly does public transit start saving all these lives?A new train from SF to LA has been in the works since 1996. They are expecting partial completion for $30 billion by 2030 which is projected to carry ~15 million passengers * ~400 miles = 6 billion passenger miles per year.The fatality rate for passenger cars is ~0.57 per 100 million miles, so eliminating 6 billion passenger miles could be reasonably expected to save about 60 * 0.57 = 34 lives a year out of the ~40,000 that are dying on the roads annually.This is just rough napkin math showing the scale of the problem would require a roughly $30 trillion investment in public transit to appreciably shift passenger-miles away from passenger cars.Public transit can be very useful. But it’s clearly not the solution to eliminating driving deaths. reply autoexec 17 hours agorootparentIt seems unfair to say that public transport doesn&#x27;t have a role in reducing deaths caused by drunk drivers just because the hugely flawed and half-assed public transport systems in our cities (which were designed to make public transport ineffective) haven&#x27;t yet delivered on that promise. In places where cities and public transportation systems are well designed and useful people do use them and those places see far fewer deaths from drunk drivers than the US does as a result.You argue that it would be very expensive to fix the problems we&#x27;ve made for ourselves in order to get useful public transportation and that&#x27;s certainly true. It&#x27;s also very expensive to invent self-driving cars and part that cost has already been paid with lives lost and human suffering, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped us from developing those systems. We could decide to invest instead in improving our cities and infrastructure. We just choose to let obscenely rich people kill innocent Americans while they play with their profit generating spying car tech instead. reply simiones 1 hour agorootparentprevHaven&#x27;t many cities actually dismantled public transport that they had already built (or rather, sold it to car companies \"to operate more efficiently\", who then proceeded to dismantle it so it didn&#x27;t compete with their cars)? reply hiddencost 18 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re confusing \"musk killing people to compete for market share because he&#x27;s woefully behind\" with \"driverless cars\".There are other people building driverless cars, who have safer systems that they rolled out reliably.Musk isn&#x27;t saving people from drunk drivers, he&#x27;s trying to catch up with the competition and chose to kill people to catch up. reply lexicality 22 hours agoprevVery comforting to know that most of the core underpinning of the internet doesn&#x27;t follow the robustness principle by default.Still, I guess it keeps support contracts active and network engineers in a perpetual hell of on call alerts reply treve 21 hours agoparentThe robustness principle: \"be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others\", hardly applies here.

We can say it until we&#x27;re blue in the face, but vendor behavior will remain largely unchanged regardless (there are a few bright spots, but not nearly enough).So you go to war with the army you have. In this case, that means frequently deferring&#x2F;coordinating security event communications. As much as I wish the market would appropriately penalize vendors that encourage researchers to sit on 0-days, that rarely happens, and the cost of insecurity is passed onto consumers instead.Tl;dr delaying disclosure does suck, but you should still do it. reply salawat 15 hours agorootparentAlas, it is the consumer that apparently drives pain reception for vendors, as they have no interest in minimizing consumer pain, but their own pain.

Chances are the control plane is handled by a bog-standard Linux&#x2F;VxWorks&#x2F;BSD that does all the logic of talking BGP&#x2F;etc and then populates the right registers in the switching&#x2F;routing hardware which handles the actual data plane.You could technically replace all the control and decision-making with whatever off-the-shelf computer platform you want, and have it drive the carrier-grade router and \"manually\" populate its routing table via some API&#x2F;Telnet&#x2F;SNMP. In fact, as long as the hardware packet-routing core is still good, this might be a good way to upgrade out-of-support equipment that is no longer getting updates to its control-plane computer. reply appplication 21 hours agorootparentprevI could have sworn I saw someone on here a few weeks ago saying how they switched their router to openBSD and ended up in some horrible broken state after a power outage or something.

It’s happened probably 3 times in the last year or so.To another commenter saying it’s crazy to not run a UPS with your router: this is residential. 99% of people don’t have a UPS for their router. They probably don’t even have a separate router and all and just use an all in one modem&#x2F;router&#x2F;wifi combo.

Some bad input happened, thus shutdown happened. Seems fine to me. I&#x27;m not seeing a grave flaw. reply buro9 21 hours agoparentThe impacted systems get stuck on a retry loop... they can neither forward the message blindly nor consume it.

It’s also important to emphasize that when a BGP session between two ISPs is lost, all connectivity between those ISPs on that path is also lost. This is why the author emphasized when you can reconfigure the routers for error tolerance without affecting active BGP sessions. reply throw0101c 21 hours agorootparentprev> When they receive something that they don&#x27;t understand they need to propagate without breaking connection, and they do not.And this is how things are done, per the article:> On 2 June 2023, a small Brazilian network (re)announced one of their internet routes with a small bit of information called an attribute that was corrupted. The information on this route was for a feature that had not finished standardisation, but was set up in such a way that if an intermediate router did not understand it, then the intermediate router would pass it on unchanged.> As many routers did not understand this attribute, this was no problem for them. They just took the information and propagated it along.However, the information was corrupted at the source, and those devices that did understand the attributed detected the corruption and rejected it:> However it turned out that Juniper routers running even slightly modern software did understand this attribute, and since the attribute was corrupted the software in its default configuration would respond by raising an error that would shut down the whole BGP session.The question is whether the session shutdown was appropriate (at least by default).I think Juniper&#x27;s default is reasonable, as attributes can communicate important information about the intentions of the network operators, and rejecting a particular attribute and basically ignoring the intentions of the operators may also cause problems.I also think that thinking that perhaps allowing the session to continue but throwing a (loud) warning is also reasonable (and there is a flag for that). reply ExoticPearTree 19 hours agorootparent> However, the information was corrupted at the source, and those devices that did understand the attributed detected the corruption and rejected it.No they did not, they shutdown a whole session down for a malformed announcement. The right decision would have been to ignore the corrupt attribute and maybe not install that particular route.A logged message saying \"Attribute 129 with value 0 is invalid\" would have helped operators more than just blindly shutting down sessions through which this was announced. reply fanf2 19 hours agorootparentThe right decision is specified in RFC 7606, which is usually to treat the malformed announcement as a withdrawal. (BGP attributes cannot in general be discarded safely.) reply tsimionescu 21 hours agorootparentprevThe current behavior is akin to an HTTP server shutting down whenever it receives an invalid HTTP request. Or, for an even better analogy, it is like an HTTP server that, upon receiving a malformed HTTP request, drops all current and future traffic from that IP.

That&#x27;s awesome! I would want my web server to block bad clients.Heck, it would be nice if web browsers would do the same thing with content they downloaded. In the early days of the web there were all sorts of garbage files out there and instead of forcing people to correct their HTML they tried to be clever in mind reading:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tag_soupFor a time there was an entire &#x27;movement&#x27; to get people to clean up their act:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;W3C_Markup_Validation_Service* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HTML_TidyIt&#x27;s fine to have a flag to have stringency be a policy that can be toggled, but I think Postel&#x27;s law (\"be liberal in what you accept\") can cause issues over the long-term:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robustness_principle reply tsimionescu 19 hours agorootparent> So just like (e.g.) fail2ban blocking IPs that continuously send bad login requests? That&#x27;s awesome! I would want my web server to block bad clients.Well, somewhat, except that it&#x27;s not awesome. It&#x27;s like fail2ban, but implemented on a server that sits behind a load balancer. So, when it receives a bad login request from an IP and it bans that IP, it actually banned the IP of the load balancer, so now it won&#x27;t receive any other requests. So that a malicious client can just send 1 bad request, and take down everyone else using the whole server.Basically, this whole discussion is not so much about Postel&#x27;s law, it&#x27;s about limiting failure domains. A bad route advertisement should make that 1 route inaccessible. It is not good design for a bad route advertisement to take down all the other good routes. It is particularly bad design for a protocol where routes are automatically propagated by devices that don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with them.If you want to compare it to the HTML situation, the bug can also be seen as a browser that, when it receives invalid HTML from www.google.com&#x2F;search would not only throw an error, but also refuse any other connection to *.google.com&#x2F;*. The proposed fix is not to interpret anything as valid HTML. It is to show an error only when accessing www.google.com&#x2F;search. reply fanf2 20 hours agorootparentprevIt’s like your origin web server unceremoniously dropping the http connection when its front end reverse proxy (fastly, cloudfront, akamai, etc) forwards an invalid request, and when your web server restarts the proxy retries the bad request. replymnw21cam 21 hours agoparentprevBad input -> shutdown provides a method by which an external attacker can shut down your service by providing bad input, otherwise known as a denial of service attack. reply throw0101c 21 hours agorootparentThe input in question was a particular attribute: these attributes can have important information about the intentions of how the operators wish things to work. Simply ignoring the bad input and carrying on the BGP session without the attribute(s) in question may lead to working against the desired intentions of the network operators.I think Juniper&#x27;s default is reasonable: rejecting a particular attribute and basically ignoring the intentions of the operators could also cause problems, and instead of trying to read the minds of those running the networks, the software doesn&#x27;t try to be clever.I also think that thinking that perhaps allowing the session to continue but throwing a (loud) warning is also reasonable (and there is a flag for that). reply tsimionescu 21 hours agorootparentThe problem is that one bad route in a BGP session caused the whole session to shut down. So if ISP1 advertises a new route with a corrupted attribute to ISP2 who doesn&#x27;t understand it, and ISP2 advertises it to ISP3 who does understand the corrupted attribute, all traffic between ISP2 and ISP3 will shut down. So ISP1 has caused communication failure between ISP2 and ISP3 for all clients, not just for its own routes. reply throw0101c 20 hours agorootparentYes, I know about BGP propagation works.My point still stands: attributes can have important information about the intentions of how a network operator wishes their network to be seen to the rest of the world. Having a corrupt attribute, and thinking it&#x27;s okay to simply assume that without that attribute the rest of the advertisement is still valid is not fine IMHO: you&#x27;re basically trying to guess&#x2F;assume the intentions of the source of the advertisement.For all we know ignoring that attribute and accepting the rest of the advertisement as-is could have caused flood of traffic over the connection causing a just-as-effective-DoS. reply fanf2 19 hours agorootparentAs the fine article explains, your concerns are addressed by RFC 7606. It recommends that in many cases, an error should be treated as a route withdrawal, not by dropping the session. (The RFC specifies other ways to handle errors in specific situations.) There’s no guessing or assuming.In the scenario that started off the author’s investigation, the bad attribute kicked COLT off the Internet even though COLT did not connect directly to the Brazilian ISP that sent the bad route update. When they received the bad update, COLT’s routers dropped their BGP sessions with intermediate ISPs that were unrelated to the Brazilian ISP, causing complete loss of connectivity.If COLT’s routers had treated the error as a route withdrawal, they would have lost connectivity to the Brazilian ISP but not the rest of the Internet. reply tsimionescu 19 hours agorootparentprevThat is not what is being done. If you advertise a route with a corrupt attribute, your route will be considered inaccessible by any device that understands the attribute.But! All your other routes that you advertised earlier with perfectly fine attributes will continue working. This is what prevents this from becoming a DoS vulnerability.Let&#x27;s take a more complete example.ISP1 advertises 2 routes to ISP2: 35.67.0.0&#x2F;16 attr1=val1 37.61.0.0&#x2F;16 attr1=corrISP2 doesn&#x27;t know what attr1 is, and it advertisea the following routes to ISP3: 35.67.0.0&#x2F;16 attr1=val1 37.61.0.0&#x2F;16 attr1=corr 78.0.0.0&#x2F;8The bug is that ISP3 will then stop routing any traffic to 35.67.0.0&#x2F;16, 37.61.0.0&#x2F;16, or to 78.0.0.0&#x2F;8.After the fix, ISP3 will keep routing traffic to 35.67.0.0&#x2F;16 (respecting the value val1 for attribute attr1) and to 78.0.0.0&#x2F;8 through ISP2. It will not route traffic to 37.61.0.0&#x2F;16. replycapableweb 21 hours agoparentprevThat sounds like a typical denial of service attack, which you don&#x27;t see a problem with? reply JonChesterfield 19 hours agorootparentIt sounds like a system designed to stop doing things on unexpected input. The designers chose correctness over robustness. It&#x27;s not an accidental vulnerability.Maybe switch off on request is a dubious design choice for infrastructure that you&#x27;d rather stay alive, but it sounds like a new version of the spec has already been released to make that an option. reply remram 19 hours agoparentprevImagine if Gmail and Outlook refused to talk to each other and transmit any email anymore, because Gmail tried to deliver one email whose content was invalid (bad MIME, invalid attachment, etc).If you shutdown the whole session because of one bad forwarded message, you are indeed a broken implementation. reply vitiral 22 hours agoparentprevThe issue is how it interacts with other designs, such as forwarding of unknown attributes who are now poisoned reply Bluecobra 21 hours agoparentprev [–] Agreed, the article title is a bit sensationalist. Really should be titled “RTFM: Juniper routers shutdown BGP on bad input”. That being said, I found it be a good deep dive and I appreciate the author looking into this. BGP isn’t perfect but we made it this far and I think it does a pretty good job for handling ~75K autonomous systems. reply gregw2 21 hours agorootparentErr no, it was not just Juniper. Many other systems were fuzzed, half a dozen vendors were fine, another 5 weren’t and some remain unpatched and vulnerable.If it were just a Juniper implementation flaw it’d be less interesting than explaining an aspect of BGP error handling more generally which is indeed what the article was, for those of us aware of BGP but not familiar with specific protocol design decisions and implications.If you quibbled with the word “Grave” I might agree since it’s not industrywide and impacting major vendors like Cisco and Huawei and those implementing RFC 7606 (although there is no patch for Nokia or Extreme or Bird!) I’d counterpropose that a more neutral TLDR title&#x2F;summary for an HN audience might be “Grave flaws in non compliant BGP error handling.”But on balance I think the author is better off with raising the alarm with a stronger headline; he clearly put his passion to good use and I learned a little something as a result. reply nsteel 18 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, Nokia equipment already does the correct thing if you configure it correctly in fault-tolerance mode. reply pdonis 11 hours agorootparentprevBird routers didn&#x27;t have the problem, correct? reply sgjohnson 17 hours agorootparentprev> BGP isn’t perfect but we made it this far and I think it does a pretty good job for handling ~75K autonomous systems.Absolutely not.

Features Has a graphical output Dynamic allocation Load and run concurrent apps All apps run in an async loop Support Virtio mouse and keyboard (drivers are async tasks) Cooperative scheduling (apps yield control as much as possible) No context switches once booted Nearly support Virgl ™ There is 5 examples of apps in this repo named app_*, some in Rust, one in C. The kernel is in bootloader. What is unique The signature of an app in Fomos: pub extern \"C\" fn _start(ctx: &mut Context) -> i32 Apps do not need a standard library, any OS functionality is given to the app through the Context. the Context is mostly a pointer to a bag of kernel functionnalities pub extern \"C\" fn In Fomos, an app is really just a function. There is nothing else ! This is a huge claim. An executable for a Unix or Windows OS is extremely complex compared to a freestanding function.It is out a frustration for all my Glibc problems during day job dev on linux that I chose to try this approach. I want a flat contract between an app and the OS. So what if an app was a function ? The contract is then only the explicit argument type. In Unix, an app has to know the target OS, but also what standard library it uses, that is 2 levels of indirections. Sometimes the os level has a conflict, sometimes the standard library level has a conflict, and sometimes I just don't have the level to understand why something doesn't work. I merely know it is related.I am trying to know if it is possible to have an OS-App ecosystem that does not suppose ANY implicit configuration. An app would JUST have to handle its explicit start context argument. Context gives any OS function necessary, think alloc, free, access to a framebuffer, or any hardware, any system calls etc. That way, apps could be freestanding, and compatible on multiple OS. More about Context Here is the Context for the last version of this OS #[repr(C)] pub struct Context { pub version: u8, pub start_time: u64, pub log: extern \"C\" fn(s: *const u8, l: u32), pub pid: u64, pub fb: FB, pub calloc: extern \"C\" fn(usize, usize) -> *mut u8, pub cdalloc: extern \"C\" fn(*mut u8, usize, usize), pub store: &'a mut Option>, pub input: &'a Input, } Note that app_test for instance, uses an old version of the Context, and still works on the newer version of the OS Old Context used by app_test: #[repr(C)] pub struct Context { pub version: u8, start_time: u64, log: extern \"C\" fn(s: *const u8, l: u32), pid: u64, fb: FB, } Meaning Fomos already handles gracefully Apps designed for a much older version of itself. As long as the OS stays compatible with the old stuff in the context, it can add new functionalities for other App by just appending to the context the new functions (here calloc, cdalloc, store, and input). app_test precedes the dynamic allocation age ! Could that pattern work in the long term ? How about system calls None. Lets try to put everything into Context functions. No voodoo cpu instruction magic. But how do you give back control to the OS ? Just return; How do you sleep, or wait asynchronously ? Just return; Apps are cooperative in Fomos, They can just return (which would exit permanently an app on a classic OS), and assume that they are gonna be called through their only function start again soon, maybe even instantly if the \"system call\" works that way. But an app loses all RAM data everytime it yields that way ! No, an app can store anything it wants in Context.store during its execution, and get it back every start call. The OS keeps everything in RAM (on the heap). The stack itself is \"reset\". But it is not more \"reset\" than it is after any function execution in a normal program. You don't lose anything. In Fomos, apps are merely a single function called multiple times! Over simplification of the kernel loop: loop { for app in apps.iter_mut() { app._start(Context::new(...)); } } There are a lot of questions without answer yet, but by now you might be curious, what if all the question had an answer in the pattern ? It looks like it could actually work (with a lot of work). Advantages A lot of stuff comes free once you accept the premises. Sandboxing, instrumentation, debugging Every functionnality and side effect given to an app goes explicitely through the Context. The Context is just a struct, we can wrap or replace anything in it. Lets instrument an app we'll call special_app. Over simplification : loop { for normal_app in normal_apps.iter_mut() { app._start(Context::new(alloc,..)); } // special_app alloc instrumentation fn alloc_log(..){log(\"allocation detected!\"); return alloc(..);} special_app._start(Context::new(alloc_log,..)); } Restart, sleep, change of hardware An app memory lives in its context. The stack is fleeting. It is reset after each yield and doesn't mean much in Fomos. Since the Context is explicit, it can be stored. A restart can be made completely transparent to an app. Pseudo code: //kernel just started ... let app = App::new(..); let ctx = disk.load(app.id).unwrap_or(Context::new(..)); loop{ app._start(ctx); if restart_request{ disk.save(app.id, ctx) break; } } //handle restart ... Quickload and quicksave of an app complete state is trivial. Note that some change of hardware could make an app bug. It would be a problem if it was transparent. However, it could be made opaque and obvious, in an opt-in manner, again through the Context. Disadvantages Security Right now it is not implemented, any app can casually check the ram of another app ^^. This is going to be a hard problem to solve. I have plans to have data security without context switch, and without giving every damn app its own virtual memory stack. Cooperative vs preemptive scheduling The argument that a cooperative scheduling is doomed to fail is overblown. Apps are already very much cooperative. For proof, run a version of that on your nice preemptive system : while(true){ new Thread( () => { fs.writeFile(\"/home/\"+randomString(),randomString()) malloc(randomInt()) curl(\"http://\"+randomString()+\".com\") } } Blender does a compelling impression of that when you increase the level of details one too many times. Might fill your swap and crash unsaved work on other apps. Badly written Webgl websites crash my gpu driver. Not only is preemptive scheduling not enough, IMO it is not necessary. Also it is a spectrum. A system can be optimistically cooperative, and turn preemptive pessimistically. However the ecosystem is made for preemptive OS. There is friction in doing things differently. Missing Permanent storage (should be easy since virtio is already implemented) Gpu support (virgl wip) Networking A nice abstraction for apps to share data and functionnalities between themselves The rest should live in userland.

Lisp machine operating systems are somewhat closer, since initially they had no object system and used freestanding functions calling each other, though later they became generic functions specialized to their arguments&#x27; classes. reply leowbattle 1 hour agorootparentReminds me of TempleOS, where all programs run in the same address space.

The “fomos” context is only as simple as it is because the OS provides a small number of simple things. Expand those to full OS capabilities and the context will get full OS complex.The odd thing about this “OS” is that a running app is just the start function called repeatedly in a loop. This makes one app call a single coherent slice of app execution. That’s kind of interesting, but makes this pretty limited. E.g., it looks like apps are entirely cooperative. It’s maybe more of a cooperative execution environment.Maybe it would be good for some embedded uses? reply lostmsu 6 hours agorootparentSeems similar to Singularity https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Singularity_%28operating_syste... reply ben-schaaf 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d suggest reading the linked readme, it does a great job explaining the differences.

Any app can get hold of the CPU for an indefinite amount of time, possibly stalling the kernel and other apps. There&#x27;s a reason we are using OS-es with preemptive scheduling - any misbehaving app can be interrupted without compromising the rest of the system. reply rollcat 18 minutes agoparentI remember Microsoft Research had a prototype OS written entirely in .NET some time in mid 2000s; IIRC they used pre-emptive multitasking, but didn&#x27;t enforce memory protection. Instead, the compiler was a system service: only executables produced (and signed?) by the system compiler were allowed to run, and the compiler promised to enforce memory protection at build time. This made syscalls&#x2F;IPC extremely cheap!I think a slightly more fancy compiler could do something similar to \"enforce\" coop-multitasking: insert yield calls into the code where it deems necessary. While the halting problem is proven to be unsolvable for the general case, there still exists a class of programs where static analysis can prove that the program terminates (or yields). Only programs that can&#x27;t be proven to yield&#x2F;halt need to be treated in such fashion.You can also just set up a watchdog timer to automatically interrupt a misbehaving program. reply lugu 37 minutes agoparentprevOn smalltalk systems like squeak or Pharo, the user interrupts the execution of a thread when it hangs with a keyboard shortcut. And people don&#x27;t run untrusted code in their \"main\" image, they would run it in a throw away VM. The same type of model could be used here using an hypervisor. This said, no one uses exclusively a Smalltalk system, it needs some infrastructure. reply tayistay 6 hours agoprev> The argument that a cooperative scheduling is doomed to fail is overblown. Apps are already very much cooperative. For proof, run a version of that on your nice preemptive system : [pathological example which creates tons of threads and files]The example is just too contrived. On a preemptive OS, apps typically hang in ways that don&#x27;t turn the whole thing cooperative (thread deadlock, infinite loop, etc.). Also, a preemptive system could kill an app if it creates too many threads, files, or uses too much RAM, long before it gets effectively cooperative. Our systems are just more permissive.> [Sandboxing] comes free once you accept the premises.and yet> any app can casually check the ram of another app ^^. This is going to be a hard problem to solve.So no, sandboxing doesn&#x27;t come for free.That said, it&#x27;s a cool idea and I wish the author success! reply Veserv 1 hour agoparentThe example is even more contrived because it assumes all systems have terrible sandboxing like Windows and Linux.Any system competently designed for robust sandboxing would have limits for all resources and reject requests when the limit is reached. reply dclowd9901 5 hours agoparentprevIn browser land, all open sites share the memory of the browser heap, and there’s no crosstalk at all. I think the way out of that particular issue is creating a closure around the function (application) that effectively acts like the application’s own context. What if an app could open an app? Or put another way, what if an app could be an OS to another app? reply josephg 4 hours agorootparentThere’s no cross talk because you can’t peek &#x2F; poke arbitrary pointers in javascript. But you can in Rust.And even then, I think modern browsers still isolate each tab in a separate process just to be safe. I don’t think they share memory. reply vlovich123 6 hours agoprev> How do you sleep, or wait asynchronously ? Just return;This is a bit strange. I would think async I&#x2F;O in the style of io_uring would be fantastic but this kind of model seems to rule out anything like that. That’ll make it hard to get reasonable perf. It’s also strange to not support async as it’s a natural suspension point to hook into but you would have to give up a lot of the design where your application state has to be explicitly saved &#x2F; loaded via disk if I’m not mistaken. Seems pricy. Hopefully can be extended to support async properly.In a similar vein, I suspect networking may become difficult to do (at least efficiently) for similar reasons but I’m not certain. reply duped 7 hours agoprev> In Fomos, an app is really just a function. There is nothing else ! This is a huge claim. An executable for a Unix or Windows OS is extremely complex compared to a freestanding function.I&#x27;m curious what Fomos uses as a distinction between \"process\" and \"executable.\"On Linux a \"process\" is the virtual address space (containing the argv&#x2F;envp pointers, stacks, heap, signal masks, file handle table, signal handlers, and executable memory) as with some in-kernel data (uid, gid, etc) that determine what resources it is using and what resources it is allowed to use.An \"executable\" is a file that contains enough bits for a loader to populate that address space when the execve syscall is performed.One of the distinctions is that you do not need an executable to make a process (eg, you can call clone3 or fork just fine and start mucking with your address space as a new process) and while the kernel uses ELF and much of the userspace uses the RTLD loader from GLIBC you don&#x27;t need to use either of these things to make a process in a given executable format.And finally, a statically linked executable without position independent code is \"just a function\" in the assembler sense, with just enough metadata to tell the kernel&#x27;s loader that&#x27;s what it is. But without ASLR to actually resolve symbols at runtime, it&#x27;s vulnerable to a lot of buffer overflow attacks if the addresses of dependency functions are known (return to libc is one of those, but it&#x27;s not unique).I&#x27;m the first to point out the flaws in glibc and want an alternative to the Posix model of processes (particularly in the world where the distinction between processes, threads, and fibers is really fuzzy and that is clear even within Linux and Windows at the syscall level), but I&#x27;m curious what is going on in Fomos. Most of the complexity in \"executables\" in Unix is inherent (resolving symbols at runtime is hard, but also super useful, allowing arbitrary interpreters seems annoying, but is one of the strengths of Linux over Windows and MacOS, providing the kernel interface through stable syscalls is actually the super power of Linux and a dynamic context either through libc or a vtable to do the same thing is not that great, etc). reply duped 7 hours agoparentThinking about it for a few more minutes, one thing that I think is the great mistake is a homogenization of executable formats (everything on Mac is Mach-O, everything on Windows is PE, everything on Linux is ELF, etc). There&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have a diverse ecosystem of executable&#x2F;linkage formats - and an OS with a dirt simple model for loading in code is a great place for that. reply kukkamario 5 hours agorootparentWhat would be gained by making more different formats? Also #!&#x2F;bin stuff is executable in sense and the most files in Windows that have default application set.Dirt simple model works until it doesn&#x27;t. Without address space separation there is no safety between executables and cooperative scheduling is the same. Running faulty binary or simply bit flip in ram can crash the whole system instead of just that process. reply duped 5 hours agorootparentI mean there&#x27;s value in being able to grok it without having read \"Linking and Loading\" and we don&#x27;t want an Asimov scenario (I can&#x27;t remember if this is Foundation or the Last Question) where we just truck on assuming things work without understanding how they work. And there&#x27;s a lot of arcane knowledge in executable formats buried in mailing lists and aging&#x2F;dying engineers on how and why decisions about these formats were designed.\"How does loading work\" has a simple answer: you map the executable into virtual memory and jump to the entry point. But the \"why does XYZ format do this to achieve that\" has a lot of nuance and design decisions - none of which are documented. Particularly things like RTLD, which is designed heavily around the design of glibc and ELF, while the designer of the next generation of AOT or JIT compiled languages for operating systems with capability based models for security might want to understand before they design the executable format and process model that may deviate from POSIX.There&#x27;s space for design and research there, and a platform that makes that easy has a lot of value. While I would encourage the designer of such a platform to read the literature and understand why certain things are done the way they are, it&#x27;s valuable to question if those reasons are still valid and whether or not there&#x27;s a better way. reply KineticLensman 2 hours agorootparent> I can&#x27;t remember if this is Foundation or the Last QuestionFoundation. The Galactic Empire makes use of atomic energy and other technologies that were created in the distant past and the technicians can only (sometimes) repair but not create. &#x27;The Last Question&#x27; has a question that remains unanswered throughout human history, which isn&#x27;t quite the same thing. reply dee-bee 5 hours agoparentprev> providing the kernel interface through stable syscalls is actually the super power of LinuxI thought that it was drivers? Linux isn&#x27;t particularly unique for having a stable abi (and the utility of such a decision is highly questionable).

Although I&#x27;m not sure why insist on a single function (if not for a \"hold my beer\" moment), because for any non-trivial program the single function will obviously act as the entry point of a state machine, where the state is stored in the context.

All current platforms do this by isolating processes using virtual memory.(2) at loadtime. The loader verifies that the code does not do arbitrary memory accesses. Usually enforced by only allowing bytecode with a limited instruction set (e.g., no pointer arithmetic) for a virtual machine (JVM, Smalltalk) instead of binaries containing arbitrary machine code.The author of Fomos doesn&#x27;t want context switching, memory isolation, etc. And Rust compilers don&#x27;t produce bytecode. Is there another way? reply lugu 1 hour agoparentWild guess: you could have a single address space shared by all \"programs\" while using virtual memory to restreint visibility on which page is accessible at a certain time. Like, at runtime, resort on a segfault to check some types of security tokens the caller would to check they are allowed to access the page and make the call. No idea how practical this would be. reply tralarpa 1 hour agorootparent> which page is accessible at a certain timeSounds like a context switch to me :) (at least for the MMU registers) reply forgotpwd16 1 hour agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capability-based_addressing ? reply doctor_eval 2 hours agoprevI’m terms of cooperative multitasking I suspect this is not the same as what we had in Classic MacOS in the sense that we now have a zillion cores, so presumably one or two non yielding processes don’t actually hold the whole system up.I’d also assume that a function that is misbehaved (doesn’t return) could be terminated if the system runs out of cores.My point is that cooperative multitasking doesn’t necessarily equate to poor performance. Time sharing was originally a way to distribute a huge monolithic CPU among multiple users. Now that single user, multi core CPUs are ubiquitous, it’s past time that we think about other ways to use them.I’m really excited that this project exists. reply doctor_eval 0 minutes agoparentJust adding to this:> cooperative multitasking doesn’t necessarily equate to poor performance.I meant to say “poor interactive performance”The lack of context switches in this model is likely to actually improve performance.

    "originSummary": [
      "Fomos is an experimental operating system (OS) constructed using Rust, aiming to streamline the relationship between an application and the OS. In Fomos, an app is treated as merely a function and liaises with the OS via a Context structure.",
      "Fomos OS encompasses attributes like sandboxing, instrumentation, debugging, and the transparent restarting of applications. To deal with older versions of apps, the OS constructs new functions within the Context.",
      "Challenges still linger, including security and the scheduling modalities. Future plans encompass extending functionalities like permanent storage, GPU support, network connectivity, and an abstract structure for application communication."

    "commentSummary": [
      "The discussion focuses on Fomos, an experimental operating system that handles apps as functions, with prospective applications in embedded systems and AWS (Amazon Web Services) Lambda runtime.",
      "Participants express concerns over security/safety in Fomos; potential solutions such as static analysis — examining program code without executing it — and watchdog timers — system supervisors that perform actions if something fails — are suggested.",
      "The topic of sandboxing, encapsulating a program to limit its scope of operations, within operating systems is discussed, highlighting the associated challenges and the advantages of diverse executable formats."
