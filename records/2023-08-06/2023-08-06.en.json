Obviously I&#x27;m going to use the better tool.\"Bram changed the lives and careers of so many of us, myself included. I never interacted with him personally but from everything I&#x27;ve ever seen he was humble, brilliant, helpful, and took his craft as seriously as anyone I&#x27;ve ever heard of.RIP Legend. reply behnamoh It&#x27;s weird, his last message was in December 2022:\"\"\" Happy New Year to all Vim users!I have updated the handy desktop calendar for 2023.

Rest assured that us Vim users will be happy Vimming while being sad that you are gone. reply kmarc > Bram changed the lives and careers of so many of usTrue.> [...] he was humble, brilliant, helpful, and took his craft as seriously as anyone I&#x27;ve ever heard ofI start to think that this is not a coincidence. These excellent people, the \"brilliant, but humble\" ones are the ones that changed my (and possibly others&#x27;) lives and careers.Mr Moolenaar, many other FOSS devs (maintainers), university professors (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only lucky one who experienced this), all the real silent \"rock stars\". reply anon432q My personal theory is that \"humble\" people are more open to ideas and collaboration with others.I&#x27;ve seen too many people with big egos who stagnate as developers. They were the top of their class in school and were used to being the \"smartest\" in the room. When they start working, they often make a toxic work environment and can be a huge negative impact. Unfortunately their confidence makes them more appealing to the management and many are promoted to positions where they have even less reasons to listen to others \"below them\" and eventually stop improvingThose that are humble and eager to learn and work with others are a huge boost to the team. The mythical 10x programmer may not exist, but a single individual can certainly make a 10x team. reply thewakalix https:&#x2F;&#x2F;martinwguy.github.io&#x2F;xvi&#x2F; reply kazinator I evaluated a bunch of vi clones in around 1994 and went with Vim. Xvi was one of them, as well as Elvis and some others. Already, Vim was a cut above the rest with some nice features. reply uean 1Personal anecdote: I had lived and worked in southern Uganda with a Canadian organization called Kibaale Children’s Fund (now Kuwasha). One day Bram came by our location. We talked a bit - someone told me he was influential and “worked for google or something” and then I learned his real identity and the software he was a part of. I was just on the brink of beginning a career in IT at the time and later in life as my skills and toolset grew I realized his significance. He never spoke of VIM in person during our time and was an incredibly humble quiet man, dedicating his time to helping children in need through ICCF Holland, which operated out of the same school I was working with as I recall. I found Bram incredibly genuine, and was also highly impressed with the ethics he brought to his efforts in the local work in Uganda (where it is typical to see fundraising dollars sliced and diced with admin-fees - ICCF turned every cent of a dollar back into the community.) He will be missed by many in that part of the world for such a massive impact he was able to have through funds raised through VIM. May he rest in peace. reply tomcam 1> in Uganda (where it is typical to see fundraising dollars sliced and diced with admin-fees - ICCF turned every cent of a dollar back into the community.)That’s very good to hear. I donated, but not very much – I assumed that their money would end up going to the wrong places. How did Bram manage to avoid this? reply capableweb > I assumed that their money would end up going to the wrong places. How did Bram manage to avoid this?From the LICENSE (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimdoc.sourceforge.net&#x2F;htmldoc&#x2F;uganda.html#license):> Compared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are very low. This is because the money goes directly to the centre. Less than 5% is used for administration. This is possible because this is a small organization that works with volunteers. [...]> How do you know that the money will be spent right? First of all you have my personal guarantee as the author of Vim. I trust the people that are working at the centre, I know them personally. Further more, the centre has been co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and is now under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society. The centre is visited about once a year to check the progress (at our own cost). I have visited the centre myself many times, starting in 1993. The visit reports are on the ICCF web site. reply uean 1I shouldn’t speak for Bram or ICCF but can point you to the financial docs which give a great explanation https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iccf-holland.org&#x2F;iccf.htmlFrom KCFs perspective where I worked, during my time there, I fundraised my salary (expenses) personally “door to door” to keep any funds donated to the organization going direct to the kids and community. I understood this was the case for others as well. I believe Bram paid for flights out of his own pocket. reply lolive 1Went to his website. There was an interview of him from 2022. The answer that really stroke me was not about Vim, but about software craftmanship vs professional programming:« I have been working for a company where quite a few managers, educated in physics and mechanics, thought the software was just the same as what they knew and they could decide how to make it. That company went downhill and was eventually taken over. The same happens in places where decision-makers can get away with failure, such as in government. The people writing the code probably just make sure they get paid and then run away from the crime scene. On the other end of the scale are people who want to write beautiful code, spend lots of time on it, and don’t care if it actually does what it was intended to do or what the budget was. Somewhere in between, there is a balance. »I am not so sure about the last sentence. But the rest is SO true! reply tonyedgecombe I&#x27;m pretty sure that company was Océ, I worked there at the same time Bram was there (although I don&#x27;t think I ever met him).They were a photocopier company that struggled with technology in general, not just software. I suspect the root of their problem was that they had been taken over by sales and marketing people. That&#x27;s never good for a technology company. reply bennyschmidt 1> people who want to write beautiful code, spend lots of time on it, and don’t care if it actually does what it was intended to doThere was a funny React framework a while back that has all kinds of cool state management and this and that, but it renders nothing. For the developers who spend more time theorizing, migrating, refactoring, than shipping.It&#x27;s funny when people go back and forth about the time complexity of a click handler (that is debounced anyway), and they arrive at the optimal solution, but when you use the app the entire thing is super clunky lol where is the concern for time complexity of me using the product xD reply asveikau 1I feel it&#x27;s much more common to create abstractions without regard for performance cost of the abstraction. So keeping time complexity down, even for a piece that doesn&#x27;t matter much, is above average for this sort of thing. reply hock_ads_ad_hoc 1Creating abstractions without considering performance is probably the correct approach. It’s much better to at least start with a program with enough abstraction to allow reasoning about how things should work. Save performance concerns for when optimization is seen to be necessary. reply KerrAvon 1This is how you wind up with fundamentally slow systems that can’t be easily sped up. You need to take some account of performance in systems design. Just don’t micro-optimize too soon. reply geodel This is how we get software that run ten times slower consumes ten times more resources and this happens on occasion when software works, more often it doesn&#x27;t. reply eru Big-O notation lets you conveniently ignore constant factors like &#x27;ten times&#x27;.(I&#x27;m only half joking. A system that&#x27;s always ten times slower than the optimal solution, can still be beneficial to one that&#x27;s quadratically slower than the optimal solution. Or it can be worse, it depends on how big your instances are.) reply regular_trash Hard disagree. Abstractions are nice when they match the mental model of a problem domain, but the odds you have the right set of abstract primitives in mind from the outset is practically 0. reply kykeonaut This is why TDD is not good when starting from scratch.Your abstractions might change in a way that they break your tests in a major way, and not only do you end up re-writing a great part of your code but also of your test set. reply MoreQARespect 37 Unit test driven development is not good at this. Integration test driven development works pretty well though. reply kazinator The stupid thing in TDD is that when you refactor while keeping tests working, many of them turn into duds: tests that are not testing any corner case.Suppose you use TDD to write a function that adds positive integer together. You get it working for add(0, 0), and nothing else. Then add(0, 1), and add(1, 0) and so on. So you have all these cases. The function is just switching on combinations of inputs, branching to a case, and returning a literal constant for that case.After writing a few hundred of these cases you say, to hell with this nonsense, and refactor the function to actually add the f.f.fine numbers together.Now you have two, maybe three problems:1. Almost all the tests still pass, but most of them are uselessly uninformative.2. Almost all, because you made a typo in the add(13, 13) test case such that it required the answer 28 to pass, and that&#x27;s what you did in the code; the real code correctly puts out 26, requiring the test to be fixed.2. The function adds together combinations that are not tested, just fine, but you can no longer have the function fail for hitherto untested inputs, and then make the test pass. You can no longer \"do the TDD thing\" on it.TDD is just a crutch that has to fall out the way when a developer with two brain cells together implements a general algorithm that makes all possible inputs work.At the same time, that crutch is pretty good for systems that fundamentally are just collections of oddball cases that won&#x27;t generalize. As a rule of thumb, if there is no obvious way to refactor the code, then TDD is likely continuing to provide value in the sense that the tests are protecting important properties in what has been implemented, against breakage. reply eru Property based testing might be helpful for some of that. reply Gibbon1 1Also creating abstractions without considering the mental overhead of reasoning about what the code is doing.Not enterprise: event --> action.Enterprise: event --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> action_parta --> abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> action_partb abstraction --> abstraction --> abstraction --> action_finalizer. reply The_Colonel I sometimes wonder if people believe that enterprise devs create abstractions for \"fun\" without having any rational reason. reply tonyedgecombe In my experience enterprise devs don&#x27;t really like what they are having to create either. They feel boxed into it because of all the petty rules that large organisations create. reply imoverclocked A paycheck and a re-org are pretty rational reasons. Maybe they aren’t the ones that create concise software but they can certainly be the ones taken en masse. reply twism Re-frame? reply cxr 1What&#x27;s wrong with the last sentence?For ease of consumption, the context again:> On the other end of the scale are people who want to write beautiful code, spend lots of time on it, and don’t care if it actually does what it was intended to do or what the budget was. Somewhere in between, there is a balance. reply sillysaurusx 1It’s remarkably uncommon to find an employee who strikes a balance between the two. But I think this doesn’t make the sentence wrong. reply myst 1Literally everyone strikes the balance. According to their experience. The older, the more experienced, the more balanced. reply Denvercoder9 1There&#x27;s a difference in the balance that people like to do, and what&#x27;s best for the organization. I definitely can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;ve sometimes gone for the side that made my job better for me, but not necessarily helped the organization the most. reply 1letterunixname 1The problem is corporate interests usually demand expedience and individual, short-term output while dismissing any notion of craftsmanship, completeness, correctness, or long-term investment. More and more corporations have completely stopped investing in employee education, career, and professional development apart from harassment and privacy training videos. reply creer 1I&#x27;ll go with: the sentence takes this as a dimension, this at one end, that at the other. While perhaps what matters is on an entirely different dimension. From a point of view of usefulness to its users, is there a strong correlation with whether the project was \"thrown over the fence\" or is a work of software artistry? reply WalterBright 1I understand wanting to write beautiful code, it&#x27;s a major motivator for me. But it does have to actually do something useful - or there&#x27;s no point. reply The_Colonel The code itself, its elegance and cleverness can be a point in itself. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s a stupid point (with a few exceptions ala CCC), but for some people it does seem to be the main driver. reply ugh123 The last sentence was the point. Either end of the spectrum are people who are not caring about the right things (typically about themselves, egos, etc). reply 1letterunixname 1I&#x27;ve worked with enough \"professional\" programmers to know I don&#x27;t want to work with them and their sloppy, reckless, uncurious, and inconsiderate ways. reply Exoristos So what do you do for a living? reply gpanders As a long time Vim user I’m extremely thankful for Bram’s creation and stewardship of an incredible piece of software. He gave the world an amazing gift.I’ve interacted with Bram a few times personally in the process of submitting changes to Vim, and I’ve observed many more interactions with others. I always had an immense amount of respect for the way he led the Vim project and interacted with the community. It is not uncommon to see open source software maintainers become burnt out or frustrated, particularly with a piece of software as quirky and complicated as Vim. But Bram was almost always respectful and patient with users and contributors, even when they were not.This is a loss for the software world. Bram, you will be missed. reply l00sed Thanks for sharing! reply tmountain 1I am such a huge fan of Vim that I ran a Vim blog and posted daily tips for several years (will not mention it by name because I do not want to self-promote in this thread). I don&#x27;t have much to say besides the fact that I feel like we&#x27;ve lost a \"giant\" in the open source world, and Bram&#x27;s contributions as a software engineer, and more importantly, a fantastic human being, will not be forgotten. :help uganda reply itsmartapuntocm 1I’ll do it for you, I’d be interested in reading that blog. reply Aachen Could mention the site in profile btw. Afaik it&#x27;s common&#x2F;good practice to have some sort of way to get to a contact method in one&#x27;s profile reply tmountain Thanks, added. reply ezoe 1I had an opportunity to talk to the Bram Moolenaar when VimConf 2018 was held in Japan. First and only time Bram visited Japan.I was there as a volunteer staff, sitting at a reception desk. Although vim is the text editor I use everyday, I&#x27;m not that enthusiastic to participate the vim conference. I&#x27;m not a vim developer. I don&#x27;t use some of the advanced vim features. I don&#x27;t ask much for a text editor. I use vim simply because it&#x27;s available in all environments I could possibly use. I was a volunteer staff because I was asked by one of my colleague at that time who was a serious vim user and organized the VimConf.So I didn&#x27;t have a plan to talk to Bram at all. There were so many Japanese vim developers and serious vim users there who want to talk to Bram. This may be the first and last chance to talk to Bram in person for them. I don&#x27;t want to waste the precious time for them.Then, I learned at the conference that recent vim release includes termdebug plugin which allows vim to behave as a gdb frontend. Since I am a C++ programmer, I started playing with it. Then, I quickly found a bug. termdebug assume there&#x27;s only one function for a name and couldn&#x27;t handle C++ function overloading.I discussed this issue with Bram Moolenaar in a spare time.There aren&#x27;t many other things I can tell about Bram.At the after party of VimConf 2018, Bram absolutely refused to use a cup and drink beer directly from a beer bottle. It wasn&#x27;t a small 333 ml beer bottle. It was a big 633 ml beer bottle.Before the VimConf 2018, Bram went to climb Mt. Fuji during his stay in Japan. reply capableweb 1Here is photos from Bram when they were at the Japan trip: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.google.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;AF1QipMc4NF8j66ohinWutVHktl4... \"Tokyo 2018 (Nov 17 – 25, 2018)\"His website has a lot of other albums he published for everyone to enjoy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moolenaar.net&#x2F;albums.html reply ezoe 1https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;BtVZMoZjdEmPKCeu9This photo remembers me a funny discussion at that time.One of the participants said he use vim to write .emacs file.\"Why don&#x27;t you use Emacs for that?\" I asked.\"Because if I have to edit .emacs, that means emacs isn&#x27;t configured the way I liked it. So I use vim in that case\" reply junon 1Wow these are really great photos - I&#x27;m sure both due to most culture in Japan is dripping in beauty, but also because Bram just takes really good photos!Thank you for sharing. reply cozzyd 1Though while I&#x27;m on Bram&#x27;s team in the editor wars, it seems like we chose different sides in the camera wars. RIP and thanks for the program I probably use the most. :x reply capableweb Few people could probably argue that they helped as many humans in dire situations like Bram did in his life. Vim was the first time I came across \"charityware\" as vim encourages users to donate to International Child Care Fund Holland on its splash screen, instead of begging for money for itself. I feel a bit of shame when I say that I&#x27;ve only donated to ICCF once over all these years....As a remembrance of Bram and to thank him for building the editor I&#x27;ve been using for as long as I can remember, I&#x27;m doing exactly what he would have wanted me to do, donating to ICCF Holland. If you&#x27;re a vim&#x2F;nvim&#x2F;other edition user, I suggest you to do the same: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iccf-holland.org&#x2F;donate.htmlIf you&#x27;re a (neo)vim user, there is more information at `:help iccf` as well.Thank you Bram for everything. I&#x27;m sure your spirit and lines written will stay with me and others for a very long time in the future. reply arp242 Bram had been spending over 30 years on Vim; and not just \"the occasional patch&#x2F;bugfix\", but significant amounts, and almost every single day for some years.The number of people who spent that much time working on Open Source is very small, and the number of people who have spent that much time purely in their spare time is smaller still. In fact, I don&#x27;t really know of anyone who even comes close to Bram.The number of people who spent this much time volunteering for anything is very small.Bram&#x27;s effort on Vim was phenomenal and exceptional by any standard.---I only met Bram in person once, in 2014, when he talked about Zimbu[1]; at some point I must have given a bit of a skeptical look, and he promptly looked at me and asked \"oh, you don&#x27;t agree? Why not?\" It was a nice talk with lots of \"audience engagement\" like this. We spent some time talking during the rest of the day and the next day; we discussed and joked about lots of things; I don&#x27;t recall talking much about Vim: it just didn&#x27;t come up. I found him a very friendly, warm, and likeable person.Sven Guckes (who passed away last year) did organize a little \"Ask Me Anything\" type workshop with Bram, and I discovered Bram struggled remembering the ins-and-outs of some of the lesser used Vim features just as much as the rest of us :-)[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_O-QdG2X1Lw) reply RMPR > and the number of people who have spent that much time purely in their spare time (i.e. not as part of their job, like Torvalds or van Rossum) is smaller still.I agree, but the fact that there&#x27;s a non-zero amount of people doing it shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. For example maintainer of qutebrowser (who also happen to be in pytest core team) and apart from a teaching job at an university a couple of months per year, he&#x27;s working full time on OSS. The main characteristics they share (at least those I met) seem to be a deep love for the craft, a deep love for people, and be virtually unfazed by the amount of money they can make if they weren&#x27;t doing that. reply echelon 1I don&#x27;t know if Bram&#x27;s family has this thread or is reading it, but the extent to which his work has impacted the software development community is enormous.Vim was one of the first pieces of software I learned when I switched to Linux in college. It was tricky at first, then it delighted me to no end. It remains a daily part of my life nearly 20 years later, and I&#x27;m still learning more about it every single year.I can&#x27;t count the number of times I wish I could drop out of insert mode in normal web browser text boxes.Bram&#x27;s insistence of donating his earnings to helping the children of Uganda is also incredibly selfless, and it&#x27;s impossible to mention him without bringing this up [1].We&#x27;ll miss you Bram. We&#x27;ll be learning from you for decades to come.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vim.org&#x2F;sponsor&#x2F;faq.php reply turboponyy 1> I can&#x27;t count the number of times I wish I could drop out of insert mode in normal web browser text boxes.You can, if you really want to:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;glacambre&#x2F;firenvim reply agumonkey 1readline vi mode, vimperator and pentadactyle are a testimony reply colmmacc 1I wrote on twitter that vim is a masterpiece. It&#x27;s the gleaming precise machine tool on which so much of modernity was crafted. It&#x27;s so hard to quantify Bram&#x27;s impact, because he did so much through so powerful a force multiplier.I started as a Unix sysadmin 25 years ago and kept gravitating towards vim. One practical reason is because it paid off to be familiar with vi, which is nearly always still available on just-installed or bare-bones systems. But another is how welcoming and leveling the Vim community was. It was so easy to get great macros and tips, and everyone was just super friendly about it. I remember someone in #vim irc teaching me \"gqap\" to wrap a paragraph, and they very naturally took the time to explain how it all worked. There was no sneering on from the community. I think Bram&#x27;s empathy and leadership was a huge part of that attitude in the community.I&#x27;m a regular annual donor on Vim&#x27;s behalf, and this morning donated another €250 in Bram&#x27;s memory. People should only donate what they can afford, we all have different means, but I&#x27;d encourage folks to work out what a great commercial editor or IDE would have cost them in licensing over their use time, and to consider donating in proportion.:wq Bram reply justin_oaks Few contribute so meaningfully to the world through software as Bram did. I donated an amount as if I were purchasing vim as an expensive commercial text editor.For most death announcements on HN, I have to look up who they were. Not this one. I greatly appreciate his work and contributions to the world. reply riedel 1The news made me unexpectedly said. There are not many people that felt so close without ever knowing them, just because I used their software. Thank you for the reminder to donate: the least thing one can do now. I think most of the digital stuff I ever produced in my life was using vim. Software, scripts, websites, theses, a book, I actually even used a plugin to fill out text boxes in the web using vim.All the stray &#x27;i&#x27;s in documents or source code in stuff I had to write with other editors give evidence to my dedication. Thank you Bram! May you live forever in vim. reply kibwen For everyone reading this who has ever adored vim, or any of the editors that would go on to be inspired by vim, I can think of no better tribute to Bram than to make a donation to the charity that he spent the better part of his life advocating for. reply kdheepak 1Thanks for posting the donation link and the reminder, I&#x27;ve made a donation as well.Vim has shaped so many aspects of my professional life; I&#x27;ll forever be grateful to Bram for his work and contributions.

Better late than never, I suppose. reply diffserv Thanks for bringing this up! It was a good reminder for me to donate. May he rest in peace. reply ruuda 1I met Bram once, at an open source fair at Google’s Zürich office. At the fair everybody could show off their projects. There was one person who had built some kind of AST editor&#x2F;IDE, where the unit of editing was not the file, but functions floating around in a workspace. He was showing this to Bram, but I don’t think he realized who he was talking to. When he asked “so, what do you think?”, Bram answered “Hmm yeah, I’m more of a vi-type of person.” reply robertlagrant 1That&#x27;s a great anecdote! reply alarge When I first entered this field in the 80s, there was a rivalry between vi users (as I was) and emacs users. There was so much about emacs that I couldn&#x27;t stand, but I&#x27;ll admit to quite a bit of envy as well.Then, some time around 94 or so, I became aware of this vi clone called vim. My emacs envy could finally be put to rest because this vim could either do (or had on the roadmap to do) everything I had envied from looking over emacs users&#x27; shoulders! I became a rabid user and evangelist, immediately downloading each new version, reporting (and occasionally fixing) bugs. For a while when I was working at Sun in the late 90s, Bram and I had an ongoing email dialog.My career path has never really allowed me to significantly work on open source, so I never really made the transition to a major contributor. Many years ago, vim hit peak feature set for me, so I didn&#x27;t really need to track its development - the version bundled on my work desktop would always suffice and I&#x27;d download a new version at home whenever I changed out my home Windows PC. Other than that, I lost track of the community.When I came to Google, I was tickled to find out that Bram worked here, though I never reached out to him personally. Before I knew it, he had retired, and I lost that chance.For over 25 years, I have only ever used vim as my editor - at home or at work. It is the most dependable tool in my box, traveling with me through multiple employers and programming languages.RIP Bram. reply pseudo_meta 1> Anyone who&#x27;s used Vim has seen evidence of Moolenaar&#x27;s generosity. \"Vim is Charityware,\" Moolenaar wrotes in its pioneering license. \"You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.\" Moolenaar pioneered the concept of charityware decades ago, and also helped to popularize its adoption.Pioneered one of the most iconic pieces of software in history, and yet did not make a single dime from it.

I never knew him other than through the welcome message on Vim, but he made one of the tools I rely on the most in my daily life.Thanks Bram, have a good afterlife. reply scop I am likewise surprised by how hard this hits. I shouted out loud when I read the headline! Quite a reaction to somebody who I only ever saw one photo of and read the occasional release notes etc. Yet as a vim user, he has been part my daily activities for years.The name Bram Moolenaar has hovered across all my work…Thank you Mr. Moolenaar. reply sramsay 1Absolutely. I&#x27;ve written everything in Vim for almost as long as Vim has been around -- three books, dozens of talks and papers, who knows how many lines of code . . .I had been joking on social media a few weeks ago that Vim must be \"done\" since patches stopped appearing about a month ago. Can&#x27;t believe that the guy who created maybe the most important tool in my entire arsenal is gone. reply keepamovin 1Yeah, relate. It shows you that with some good software, you can make an impact. reply birdyrooster 1Damn… I have been using Vim for decades and never thought once about the people responsible for it. I need to be more thoughtful of this to acknowledge people’s excellent work. reply jzb 1Yes, very hard. I feel like I knew him - kind of silly given I&#x27;ve never met him and I don&#x27;t think have even crossed emails with him.

My first donation as a late teen to free software, was to the ICCF Uganda, thanks to vim&#x27;s charityware license. It was maybe around 1997 or 98. Later versions of vim used a formal free software license, but still off-band encouraging donations to the ICCF. I&#x27;ve always been a bit skeptical to the whole concept of charity, but I respected Bram Moolenaar so much due to his work on vim that I trusted his judgement. I kept donating to the ICCF for a few years until he was hired at google.I was also deeply honored to see my (tiny, insignificant) minority language on his page for the word Mooleenar in many languages [0].As a matter of respect and to honour his memory, I will keep using the last version of vim (by his last commit [1]) as my main text editor for as long as humanly feasible.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moolenaar.net&#x2F;[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vim&#x2F;vim&#x2F;commit&#x2F;4c0089d696b8d1d5dc40568f25... reply tzhenghao Loved his \"7 Habits For Effective Text Editing 2.0\" (2007) talk and humor [1]\"How many of you are mostly using Emacs?\"a bunch of raised hands\"Okay, we&#x27;ll try to convert some people today!\"RIP, Bram Moolenaar[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p6K4iIMlouI reply steinuil 1A lot of this advice is about turning vim into a \"modern\" text editor with a language server configured.I used to use vim but lately I switched to Helix, which is basically vim but with all the good features and plugins built into it and without a configuration&#x2F;extension language. Almost all of the features are easily discoverable by just pressing spacebar, and the rest by browsing the (small) documentation, and I can think of a way to do all the things Bram talks about from within Helix, often better (because it&#x27;s relying on the language server).Still, the main point about learning your tools by detecting inefficiencies and searching for a better way is always valid, and I&#x27;m sure that all these things Vim was already doing at the time helped pave the way for modern editors.

When they found out I was geekish they said a relative of theirs was big in the open source world.

But that&#x27;s not so.\"I didn&#x27;t take the advice well at the time, but now, a little older and wiser, I understand.Thank you, Bram. Thank you for vim, for your time and dedication, and for taking the time to deposit a small amount of your wisdom into my brain. Sorry for being a dick. reply Aachen It&#x27;s a hard piece of advice to make use of. I couldn&#x27;t say whether I assume everyone is like me or not: it really depends on what we&#x27;re talking about.Are you okay with sharing what it was about concretely? That may be more of a takeaway, to learn in which way people aren&#x27;t all alike, than the general statement that not everyone&#x27;s the same reply soulofmischief It was in response to some UX considerations for a feature I wanted to patch into vim. I must have had a bad week, I was needlessly combative after an initially abrasive response from another contributor who closed my issue without consideration. Bram stepped in and finally got the conversation moving.We couldn&#x27;t come to an agreement on how to implement it in the most robust way... meanwhile over at neovim a PR was submitted and merged, and a backwards-compatible solution provided within 3 days of me filing an issue. :-) reply user3939382 There is a collection of people and cultural artifacts that are contemporary to us, though usually not our exact age. They pass away, one at a time, until we are all that is left of the world we once defined, a world that eventually is gone.Bram’s passing is another chip at the passing of the world I knew, where vim was new.Thank you Bram for your excellent and enviable contribution to computing. reply Ecco I wrote the iOS port of Vim and therefore exchanged a few emails with Bram. As you can guess, a very nice person. Thank you for Vim, Bram! reply zaikunzhang Bram was a great man. Vim is a great piece of software. Vim is charityware. Distributed for free, it encourages people to make donations to help children in Unganda. I used to donate some money, starting from 2010. Bram sent you a key corresponding to your donation when he received it, and you could use the key to accumulate the amount of you donations, which would give you some priority in suggesting improvements in Vim. He responded very promptly after donations were made. My last donation on 17 July 2023 did not receive his reply, and I was worried.I am by no means a Vim master, but Vim is virtually the ONLY text editor that I have been using since 2009. I typed my Ph.D. thesis (in Chinese!) and all of my papers&#x2F;code using Vim.Bram, thank you very much for this masterpiece. Thank you for making your masterpiece charityware, which has inspired me to do the same thing with my code.R.I.P. reply bbkane Goofing around with Vim as a quiet \"rebellion\" to my professor demoing EMACs went much further than the joke I started it as - it became a gateway drug to me using the terminal for almost everything and understanding how computers work at a much lower level.Thank you Bram for the work you put into Vim! reply JohnMakin 1I&#x27;ve used vim for everything going on my entire career now.It started in my senior year as a CS student - in an operating systems course, we were introduced to a lot of linux stuff and the professor taught Vim as part of his course. At first I rebelled. I chose to develop most of my projects in eclipse&#x2F;Java at that point and had developed an aversion to the command line. That, plus Vim&#x27;s learning curve made me hate it at first.Fast forward a year at my first job at an embedded systems shop writing in pure C, all the vets used vim and I saw how fast they were with it and it made me want to learn. I think my first \"aha!\" moment was when I accidentally entered visual mode and prepended several lines at once with a comment. After that I was hooked, and while I&#x27;m typically one of the only ones using pure vim on any team I&#x27;m on, inevitably after a year or so at the job people see how I use it and start asking about it. reply favadi Sending heartfelt condolences to Bram&#x27;s family.

We&#x27;ll have to see how things and the relationship between Vim and Neovim change and evolve in the coming weeks and months. reply ilaksh 1I assume there are multiple people willing and able to continue vim development and I think it might be important for that to happen.

I was very proud to have found Bram to speak there at our event. On the days ahead I became very anxious to welcome this paragon of open source contributors, but I soon found out Bram was one of the most fun and caring people I had the honour to meet. Not just did he tell us his story of developing vim, he also organised an in promptu quiz on Unix and networking. I have fond memories of Bram and am truly sad to hear he passed away. Bram truly captured the soul of open source. reply keepamovin OH NO!!!! This guy literally changed my life by making vim.

I first downloaded vim from a public FTP server in the early 90s on my Amiga computer. My love-hate-love relationship with the editor has followed the arc of my own decades-long hacking adventure. When neovim came out, I stuck with vim out of loyalty and nostalgia, not due to any technical merits -- which was very out-of-character for me. I guess I finally have a good reason to swtich.RIP Bram. reply sph As an Emacs user [1] I can only say: RIP and thank you, for making the lives of programmers and engineers worldwide easier, with the healthy competition of Emacs and VIM approaches to text editing.You live as long as your contribution to the world, and you can rest assured that a large part of us will still be using modal editing in our mind-controlled VR spatial googles.:wq--1: just this morning I was trying evil-mode once again... reply virtualsue Such sad news!

One way to commemorate his life is to donate to the charityware cause he championed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iccf-holland.org reply jakebasile Vim and its descendant modes in other editors has drastically improved my life, which maybe is a weird thing to say about a text editor but it&#x27;s true. I am very sorry to hear of his passing. reply Syssiphus 1If it&#x27;s something that you use for a large part of your day, then there is nothing weird about it. reply Lio 1I was just trying to think how to say the same thing but wasn&#x27;t sure how to say it. Since first discovering Vim back in the 1990s it&#x27;s been something I&#x27;ve used almost every working day.It&#x27;s probably my favourite piece of software. Where ever I go, whatever platform I use, whatever I write, I use Vim.Bram&#x27;s work has made my life better. This is sad news indeed. :( reply orsenthil 1Bram influenced me. The splash screen that encouraged donation to charity caught my attention like nothing else. Inspired by that splash screen, I started volunteering my time and donated money to many causes that I cared about.I once had a brief interaction with Bram. He clearly said, he didn&#x27;t need any money and encouraged all donations to causes he cared about. In one case, $10,000 to Kilbale children center, he volunteered with. reply rochak 1There are extremely few people whose software transformed my life as much as Vim did. I know people would say that Vim is just an editor, but to me it rekindled the spark by giving me the direction I was looking for in this limitless world of computers. The fact that something can be so damn powerful and precise under the hood while coming across as just a blank screen with a blinking cursor changed the way I thought about software. I know this community took you for granted sometimes, but I couldn&#x27;t be more thankful for this incredible piece of technology and the way you used it to give back even more to the community. Thank you, Bram. reply stonekyx 1The very first time in life that I reported a bug to an OSS project was to Vim, by email to Bram, when I was in high school. Thinking back from now, that was definitely not a good way to report bugs, but Bram was super helpful and responded kindly to this ignorant kid.Thank you Bram, and RIP. reply fareesh 1I learned vim as a kid in the 90s and used it my entire life. I&#x27;ve never used anything else. The hours it has saved me through its efficiency and productivity has probably extended my lifespan.Vim was born out of a simple system and a deep empathy and understanding of what a developer really needs.In every line of code, every efficient series of keystrokes, his legacy endures.

It might be the last time that you have the opportunity to make that human contact.Thank you, sir.Anyone who&#x27;s used Vim has seen evidence of Moolenaar&#x27;s generosity. \"Vim is Charityware,\" Moolenaar wrotes in its pioneering license. \"You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.\" Moolenaar pioneered the concept of charityware decades ago, and also helped to popularize its adoption.Pioneered one of the most iconic pieces of software in history, and yet did not make a single dime from it. That is truly something to look up to. reply ppqqrr I remember the moment I decided to be a vimmer. I was in my first systems class in college, looking for advice. A senior asked me if I knew how to use vim, and with a few flicks of his wrists, split his screen into halves, quarters. I was sold.I still wonder about what I encountered in that moment - a kind of honesty and stubbornness to build something true, universal, empowering. The restraint and confidence it takes, then, to present it as a blank canvas for all to build on.Because vim exists, I know it is possible to build in that spirit; I will always strive to do so myself. reply marcyb5st 1As a former colleague, I remember one funny interaction with him. I was sitting in the same desk but on a different floor. One sleepy morning I tried to oust him from his desk and once I recognized him we ended up chatting few minutes about open source at Google and his involvement. Great person and as a Vim user forever grateful for his efforts. reply yowlingcat 1I&#x27;ve spent most of my schooling and career using Vim in one form or another. It&#x27;s as close to an instrument that I don&#x27;t even need to think about using and can just follow muscle memory as anything I&#x27;ve ever worked with.It&#x27;s perhaps my most important tool as an engineer. So much of its design is clear as the brainchild of Bram, so hearing this makes me sad. I hope Bram knew how many lives he touched. reply dawidpotocki 1Vim has completely changed the way I use computers and I&#x27;m not able to thank Bram enough for this. Even though I have switched to Neovim and never met him, it makes me deeply sad. :wq reply srivmutk 1God ... this hit me like a pile of bricks. Bram has probably had one of the biggest impacts on development out of basically anyone. I mean not just Vim, which was genius in its own right, but his work with the ICCF and the concept of charity-ware. My deepest condolences to his family. Anybody set up a HN donation drive for ICCF Holland? reply steve-chavez 1I remember feeling like a reached a next level as a software engineer once I started using Vim. It&#x27;s been almost 10 years now and I still use it (through NeoVim and neovim-qt).Thank you so much Bram! reply dmarinus 1So sad, I had the honor to meet Bram at a FOSS talk with RMS which he organized in Amsterdam RAI. I&#x27;ll never forget that day. I&#x27;ve been using VIM for a many decades and I&#x27;m sure to keep using it for a long time. Many thanks for all the work and condolences for his family. reply azemetre 1I was first introduced to Vim from a Jeffrey Way tutorial about HTML5 way back in 2010 or maybe 2008 when first learning about programming. Ever since then I&#x27;ve used Vim throughout my career, even somehow convincing others to use it too. I&#x27;ve been using neovim for the last 5 years but can still hop on a colleagues machine or into a server and still be productive.Easily the most important piece of software I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, since it has allowed me to make a living.RIP Bram Moolenaar. reply maphew Using gvim to automatically edit and re-path thousands of ArcView 3 project files across our network shares in the early 2000s was one my \"Behold! I am mighty and a god!\" highlight moments.Before that the project was \"work with these 25 people and help them open each project and fix the broken paths interactively\" (because servers changed).The script ran at night and everyone&#x27;s things \"just worked\" the next morning. It was glorious.Thanks Bram. reply INTPenis 1Still to this day when I start my daily vim session I see his personal message to donate to the children of Uganda. I&#x27;ve been seeing this message for well over 20 years, my entire career for sure. What an impact to have on IT, and on the world. You&#x27;re forever remembered Bram. reply pixelmonkey Bram was an inspiration, not just for developing vim, which so many of we programmers used to get into a flow state programming. But also for his work on charity. Deserving of the black banner! reply Galicarnax For me, Bram is probably among names like Tarkovsky, Stravinsky and Attenborough, who greatly affected the way I see&#x2F;feel life. R.I.P. reply robertlagrant 1I was introduced to vim at university around 2001. I wasn&#x27;t great with it, but back then I occasionally was doing some basic sysadmining, and also sometimes hand-editing websites live over SSH and it was the best tool for me. I&#x27;ve started using it again in 2022 and am enjoying the experience!Thank you Bram. reply zoom6628 Sad day. I have used vim for about as long as it’s been around. Small fraction as a developer, but also for notes and editing huge text files. Always learn something new about it.I salute his contribution to craft and more so his contribution to humanity for support of ICCF. We all can and should follow his example in whatever way possible. reply sombragris 1RIP, a great guy, a public benefactor and a great coder.I think the black stripe should be on HN today; it&#x27;s quite justified. reply phelipetls 1I probably wouldn&#x27;t enjoy programming as much as I do if it wasn&#x27;t for Vim.

I didn&#x27;t interact with Bram much, but I did have an email exchange with him early in my software developer journey. I submitted a few patches to Vim and he helped me work through them to get them approved&#x2F;merged. He was very patient and kind even though I was a complete newbie. reply grrandalf RIP. I started using Vim on Slackware iirc. Haven’t stopped.I checked out various other clones back in the day — vim was way better afaict.PS: A major reason I use Vim rather than Emacs is that the arrow keys worked in Vim but not emacs. On Slackware. No I don’t use the ijkl keys to move in Vim. :) :) #blubvimmer reply ilaksh 1Hmm. I also first used vim inside of Slackware and also use arrow keys in vim.Not sure I&#x27;ve ever run into another person who admitted that publicly. Not that I think it&#x27;s something that one should actually be ashamed of, it makes total sense. Just not a popular approach. reply lucasfcosta 1Bram was really important for me. I remember the joy of learning how to use vim and how easy it was to bond with other fellow users.Who would imagine a text editor could instill such a strong sense of identity into its users?The first time I’ve been to SF I even got a “:w” tattooed on me.Bram, you will be missed. reply pylua 1I was looking for a post like this because I couldn’t agree more. While I didn’t get a tattoo like you , I can’t imagine living without a tool that is one of the most important to my livelihood. reply praptak 1I met him in the Google Zurich office. He led an \"Open Source at Google\" talk as part of orientation for our group. Probably the best person to lead that talk at that time. reply omoikane 1VIM is not just my favorite text editor, but my favorite piece of software of all time on all platforms. I have only ever encountered so few minor issues, and Bram fixed them all quickly. He will be sorely missed. reply hiyer I&#x27;ve read a lot of obituaries on this forum, but this is the first one that affected me on a personal level.

Thank you for your immense contribution to computer science. RIP. reply armatav 1That’s quite young, what a shame - Vim is amazing. reply ravishi I have been programming for more than 15 years. I&#x27;ve used vim since the very beginning and it always puzzled me as something so genuinely clever. Using vim is a joy. I feel good while doing it. Bram has been this strong influence in my life all due to his software. reply dlevine 1At my first job out of university, we were deploying applications on Solaris servers. I had been using emacs as a text editor, and these servers only had vim installed. I mentioned installing emacs to my manager, and he said that learning vim would be a \"feather in my cap.\" I took him up on that advice, which was sage wisdom.I spent a lot of my career using various forks of vim as my primary editor, and still use it when I need to edit a file.Thanks Bram! This world will miss you. reply m47h4r He has helped many IT people avoid carpal tunnel syndrome and achieve great productivity.

It is because of these traits that your loss, though I never knew you personally, hits so hard. RIP.:wq! reply OKodysseas This is sad news.

I hope to see the mainline vim project innovate and thrive so that Bram’s legacy can live on. reply vmlinuz Very sad news - been using vim for decades, still use it every day as pretty much all of my colleagues use VSCode... I met him briefly at FOSDEM 20+ years ago, will have to see if I can find the photo I took of him looking slightly bemused when I showed him vim running on a Linux-ified iPaq with a touchscreen and no keyboard!As others have said, time to make a donation in his honour. reply gitfan86 1Amazing guy, I&#x27;ve been using vim daily for decades.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content heather buchel blog about work Just normal web things. 06 July 2023 We've let ourselves get away from building websites that can do normal web things. I've noticed this a lot recently due to a surge in new social media platforms springing up. Everyone is building new clients, apps, and in some cases, like React Native, attempting to share code across platforms. It's definitely exciting, and I'm actually thrilled that people are building these things. In the end, it's usually because we've JavaScript'ed our way out of these things. What is less thrilling is that, nevermind the basic accessibility requirements that are often missing like alt text on images, we stopped letting people do very normal web things. There are a number of avenues to route the blame to: rushing to release something midly usable for testing protocols in the wild, not having a UI engineer on the project, building things in a mobile \"touch first\" experience and ignoring other inputs or devices; the list goes on. In the end, it's usually because we've JavaScript'ed our way out of these things. Here are some things I wish people allowed to continue to work in their web projects: Let me copy text so I can paste it. Please. This is often cause by removing pointer-events or layering elements on eachother that are meant to be clickable. This happens a lot with clickable \"card\" components. If something navigates like a link, let me do link things. Let me right click on the link without it navigating so I can open the context menu that lets me do other link things (like copying link text, copying link address, etc.) Let me use usual link keyboard shortcuts (like ctrl + click on Windows) to open in a new tab. Just normal link things. This is that dreaded thing that us front-end folks are always harping on about: using a div with an on-click to navigate instead of an anchor element. Let me zoom in on my browser without the website getting all out of whack. I just want to be able to read. Do responsive things I didn't spend most of my early career convincing clients to let us do a responsive website just for you to serve me up a boring layout that kicks down to your mobile layout as soon as you are less than 1200px. I actually think Mastodon and Twitter do a good job at this. The UI feels familiar if you drag your browser down to a small narrow viewport. The space mostly gets used. Let me have hover styles I've seen too many React Native ports to the web that have zero :hover or :focus styles beause \"you can't hover or tab on mobile, right?\" (wrong) or weird disabled looking :active styles. Do normal interaction state things for the web in your web app. This issue in particular almost always makes it glaringly obvious when some poor soul ported their RN app to the web to save time. If the UI completely changes when I click on something, as if I've navigated to a new page, give me a browser history update and a new url It's annoying not being able to link to a state in the UI that appears to be it's own page and that is lost to the void if I navigate away. Let me see scroll bars Please don't hide them for the sake of your \"slick\" ui. Sometimes I want to click on the scrollbar and drag it. Just a normal web thing. Stop hijacking my typical browser shortcuts for use in your own app I've seen this happen with ctrl + f for opening a custom in-app search bar. I don't want that. It doesn't always search the page as usual. I stopped myself from adding a lot of things that would usually fall under accessibility violations though there is definitely a lot of crossover in the list above. What did I miss?

Nobody complained, but that meant ctrl click was useless, right click did not give you the options you wanted.This is the only thing I&#x27;m a dictator about. There is zero room for negotiation when it comes to links. reply tacker2000 I also hate this. More and more of this JS nonsense is coming along and abusing the correct way of doing things.There is a documentation platform called archbee (its even funded by YC) where if you run a search you cant open the search results in new tabs, you have to open one result in the current tab, and if its not what you want, you have to go back, search again and open the next result. This is incredibly infuriating.You can see this behaviour here for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.sparklayer.io&#x2F; reply inferiorhuman Try clicking on the \"parent\" link on HN. reply runnerup Seems to work as expected? reply inferiorhuman Javascript scrolls to the target and the browser history is clobbered. I expect it now, but it was an unwelcome change. reply johnnyanmac 11 The parent option isn&#x27;t returning a new URL. it simply scrolls to the target. I don&#x27;t see where it is impacting my internet history. reply phist_mcgee >More and more of this JS nonsense is coming along and abusing the correct way of doing things.There&#x27;s no such thing as this. reply bottled_poe It’s like saying you can drink a milkshake using your mouth or your nose. Sure, both work, but.. reply dpacmittal The new reddit web version has all the links as buttons. You cannot open these links in a new tab. It drives me crazy and really strange that such a huge internet giant gas such glaring accessibility issues. reply dekatron New Reddit also messes with text selection with unnecessary JS crap. Wherever you select some text, they show an \"Embed\" button that prevents you from dragging the text to a new tab to perform a web search.Thankfully this behaviour can be blocked with uBlock Origin by adding these rules: www.reddit.com##+js(aeld, mousedown, isSelectionOutOfRange) www.reddit.com##+js(aeld, mouseup, shouldShowButton) reply philsnow > dragging the text to a new tab to perform a web searchI had no idea that this worked. I don&#x27;t \"get\" intentionally dragging if there&#x27;s any alternative.I feel like one of those people who tells people that frowning takes more muscles than smiling, but: dragging seems like it requires so many more muscles to be engaged than the keyboard shortcuts for copy&#x2F;newtab&#x2F;paste and then enter. reply LeonenTheDK 55 The way I see it, it&#x27;s a feature that exists which some people use and prefer. Breaking it (intentionally or accidentally) just isn&#x27;t something I want to see. reply pwdisswordfishc The worst thing: i.redd.it no longer returns the image alone, but wraps it in a \"viewer\" page. I can’t even write an uBlock filter for this, because it relies on an Accept HTTP header.Imgur does the same, but that at least can be remedied by stripping the Referer header. I wonder how long this will last.I predict Sec-Fetch-* will be abused for the same purpose. It may be already. reply josephg Yep. Sometimes reddit has an image that’s either incorrectly cropped or it’s zoomed out so far that it’s unreadable. How many times do I need to click on the image before I can see it properly? I’ve counted as many as 4 taps through various awful image viewer things. Sometimes no about of tapping and zooming will render the image properly. The irony is my browser is great at showing images already - panning and zooming works beautifully.I miss Apollo. The friction with Reddit’s awful design and coding choices makes me use their site a lot less. I think that might be a good thing in the long run. It leaves me hungry for something better. reply MostlyStable 1This is probably 50% of the reason I use nitter instead of twitter. Aside from not having to have an account, it lets me right click to open tweet threads in a new tab. Which, given the nature of twitter conversations, seems like pretty key behavior! I want to be able to view conversational threads, but I also want to keep my place in the original page so that I can keep opening new threads! It&#x27;s really not that hard and the actual twitter UI makes it very difficult (although you can get around it with some browser tweaks, but it&#x27;s still more annoying than a simple right click) reply ushakov You can open tweets in new tab in regular Twitter by clicking on the date of the tweet (which happens to be a link) reply maximinus_thrax 1> This is the only thing I&#x27;m a dictator about. There is zero room for negotiation when it comes to links.This is a hill I&#x27;m always willing to die on. Few things bother me more. Maybe fucking with my browser history... reply Buttons840 1Finish the story. Did you die on this hill?Whenever I push for things that are technically correct I&#x27;m ignored and&#x2F;or not treated well it seems. reply BlargMcLarg 1Wait until you get asked, by CTOs and business people, to disable F5&#x2F;refreshing because it breaks the process flow but building a resilient process flow into an old app takes 10x-100x as long. Only for them to realize if you restart the system, disconnect the network, have a timeout, etc. the problem still exists. They even contemplated physically removing F5 before realizing \"wait people can just click refresh or remap F5, that won&#x27;t work\".Same people will also claim \"we don&#x27;t need a frontend dev or a UX designer\". reply jholman Physically removing F5? Like going around to individual computers and modifying the keyboards? reply undebuggable Watching DOM events on the document and disabling key events for the key code 116. One can still trigger document refresh by remapping F5 to other physical key in OS settings, or by clicking refresh button in browser toolbar. reply johnnyanmac 7 That seems unnecessarily complex compared to watching for a request to the same webpage, intercepting, and dropping the request. I believe that is all the refresh function is doing.Now ofc I wouldn&#x27;t give any executives that idea. Don&#x27;t mess with expected user functionality, that&#x27;s like UX 101. if I see my navigation tampered with, I flag that site as spam. josephg Does that work? I’m surprised browsers allow websites to disable the default behaviour of F5. reply undebuggable 37 Yes absolutely. It&#x27;s possible to remap the entire keyboard at the website level. reply paulddraper Yeah I don&#x27;t understand either reply BlargMcLarg This was a webapp to be used internally in an enclosed system, so yes, modifying the keyboards. Company&#x27;s own hardware. reply golergka If I understand correctly, they are talking about an in-house system where toy would be able to do exactly that reply Swizec 1I always attempt to die on the links should be links hill. So far the only times I didn’t get my way was when the thing was in fact semantically a button, it just happened to use navigation to achieve its aim. Usually in these cases the markup is too complex to shove into a link anyway.Happy to report that our production site has more links that look like buttons than it does buttons that act like links. It’s almost a meme on my team that Swiz will get you if you use onClick for navigation.The other hill I enjoy defending is that we should use more browser built-in components instead of trying to design our own. reply xp84 > browser built-in components instead of trying to design our own.Ugh. Let me know if you have any tips. All the art-school “UX designers” have to have custom date pickers and stupid knockoffs of iOS switches and custom drop-downs when there are actual, better, and automatically-accessible, versions of all those. How do you fight against this vanity design without making an enemy of the whole design team? reply danjac Any artist or designer has to learn their medium before they are allowed to produce designs for it. If you want to learn to sculpt, you have to learn what you can and cannot do with clay; if you want to learn to design clothes, you have to learn about fabrics, sewing and tailoring (Jean Paul Gautier and Versace worked as tailors in the industry while they were doing their early work).Yet there seems to be a free pass where a \"web designer\" is allowed to dictate how a site should work and look without knowing the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. reply toastal Please tell my your hill also doesn’t let folks use target=_blank without a very good reason to break the user agent&#x27;s default behavior. reply noman-land 1I&#x27;m the same way. If someone is committing code that violates web standards it is not going in unless there&#x27;s a thorough discussion and an excellent reason for doing so. Lean on the web. reply sonofhans 1Oh, you and the OP are both making me happy. Plenty of people seem to use nothing but DIV, SPAN, and maybe A or BUTTON. You don’t have to use all the semantic richness of HTML, but damn, at least treat links right. Thepattern is awful. reply kieranimo 45 In my experience, people were abusing links and making everything a button without React. The actual defining attribute - IMO - is that they didn&#x27;t care about web semantics. reply trealira 1Since we&#x27;re on the topic of how people should learn to build web things: what do you think are the most important things to learn first to make web stuff? The \"right\" way? Just raw HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (Typescript?)? It seems common among programmers to criticize the overuse of web frameworks. Are there a lot of people who learn only web frameworks? reply josephg 1> what do you think are the most important things to learn first to make web stuff? The \"right\" way? Just raw HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (Typescript?)?Yes. I think all web programmers need to know HTML and CSS. CSS is still just as relevant no matter how you build websites. People should also spend time learning HTML. Like, learn how to make content using raw HTML. Read the HTML of some of your favorite sites. This will improve everything you do with react and friends.> Are there a lot of people who learn only web frameworks?Yes.Web programming probably has more programming beginners than any other area of software development. Its easy to learn - there are no C pointers in sight and no manual memory management. Websites work everywhere. And everyone needs a website - so there&#x27;s lots of demand for web programmers. The debugging tools are also great (and you already have them if you have chrome installed). And frontend engineering is visual and obvious - so when you mess it up, you can usually tell.So, yes. There&#x27;s lots of people who learn just enough to scrape by and start making websites. Its great and terrible. I&#x27;m glad web programming is such an on-ramp for beginners. But npm is a disaster, and lots of websites are insecure, slow, amateurish messes. reply matheusmoreira The right way to start is with HTML and motherfucking website.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motherfuckingwebsite.com&#x2F;Really. At this point this is what websites should strive to be. Text on the screen.Everything about HTML can be learned from the MDN documentation:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTMLIt can be written by hand but that&#x27;s way too verbose. Pug is a great solution to that problem: it&#x27;s just HTML but much less verbose. I integrated it with GitHub Pages so pug sources get compiled to HTML and published when commits are pushed. Great experience.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pugjs.org&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pugjs&#x2F;pugAfter this, the next step is to learn CSS so you can make it look a little nicer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;CSSJavascript should only be necessary if you want to do something like this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ciechanow.ski&#x2F;mechanical-watch&#x2F; reply austin-cheney Set the proper goals. The end state is some software product, such as a website. Far too common beginners will attempt to redefine the goal to something more familiar, something like \"how to write code\". There are people who spend their entire careers mastering exactly how to write the code. This can be described as \"expert beginners\".Somebody needs to be the adult in the room and stop the children from running the daycare. As developers we should already know how to write code, or know how to figure it out, and that shouldn&#x27;t be open to discussion. The discussion must only be upon defining the goals and stepping backwards one step at a time. This is called planning and proper planning will ensure the necessary automated checks are in place. Then \"how to write the code\" becomes straight forward as it either conforms to the automated checks or becomes a matter for discussion. reply satvikpendem 1> Are there a lot of people who learn only web frameworks?Yes, because many people learn web development through bootcamps or other such courses (modern web dev is not usually taught in college, in my experience) which rush you to \"job readiness\" thus incentivizing using React over vanilla JS since most web dev jobs use React nowadays. reply blq10 What would a college that aimed to teach Web Development as a specialty actually look like?People look down on bootcampers, but it always feels to me that 99% of what is taught in university programs is similarly only useful in specialized situations. The actual good thing is having had to sit down and write a lot of code before anyone lets you touch anything.What does such a program look like for Web? reply satvikpendem Probably something like The Odin Project&#x27;s JS courses. reply firefoxd 1I think it&#x27;s still a good idea to learn by writing HTML pages, then adding a style and script tag in the head. The scripts and styles become enhancements to the page.If you go to a code bootcamp, you are learning react. A lot of new developers come from these places. Not a bad thing, but they could spend more time on fundamentals reply cletusw I don&#x27;t think vanilla HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS is the way to go for beginners because of the \"time to visually interesting results\" problem. Starting with a framework that has widgets you can reuse is much more interesting and motivating.That said, I&#x27;d argue that the selected framework should be one that doesn&#x27;t completely obscure all the underlying HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS (I&#x27;d avoid TypeScript at first) from them so it&#x27;s easy to learn that when needed, plus it makes debugging using browser dev tools easier and means they&#x27;ll have transferable skills for learning a second framework.GWT (RIP, thank goodness) would be the extreme negative example, but React is on that side of the spectrum as well.Vue, Svelte, Lit, and Angular seem to be the most popular frameworks on the \"closer to HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS\" side of the spectrum, though I only have experience with the last two. Lit&#x27;s great; Angular&#x27;s not my favorite. reply MrVandemar > I don&#x27;t think vanilla HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS is the way to go for beginners because of the \"time to visually interesting results\" problem.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth beginners learning the road rules and safety protocols, because of the \"time to being responsible for a heavy, fast motor-vehicle sharing a road with other people\" problem. reply danjac In the 90s complete amateurs were able to make \"visually interesting results\" with little more than Notepad and a copy of \"HTML for Dummies\". reply pjmlp 1The coolest framework of them all, vanilaJS. reply varrock 1I&#x27;d argue the link is the most influential and historic element of the web. Its behavior should rightfully be preserved. reply GloomyBoots 1The link and the URL are what made hypertext hyper. They turned words in a document into portals to other documents.But that web isn’t the one we’re dealing with anymore. We’ve moved from documents to applications. Like tabindex, I’m sure browsers or frameworks will gradually find ways to make any element behave link-like in every way. Which isn’t really a bad thing, it’s just development of the core idea of the web. reply KRAKRISMOTT 1It also made things slow. Modern SPA links have pre loading optimizations baked in. It&#x27;s quite important especially if your users are on mobile. reply shove The average modern SPA pulls in far more unnecessary JS than the average plain HTML site pulls in via redundant tag structure following the initial page load. Moreover, server-rendered HTML renders far more quickly because there tends to be fewer total requests and there’s no hiccup parsing the JS when it lands, much less the time it takes to execute it. reply cyberax And don&#x27;t forget that gzip works wonders, removing most of the network overhead of transmitting redundant tags. reply matheusmoreira Browsers are perfectly capable of prefetching pages on their own. reply quickthrower2 It is the H in HTML and HTTP! reply ksec Well you say this now, for nearly a decade no one gives a crap about Web as in HTML, it is all about JS Front End. The current resurgent and support of HTML is relatively new on HN. Other than the very few vocal ones about how the Web should not be an \"App\". But an interactive web page.I still wish they should merge 90% if not 100% of HTMX into official HTML 5 spec. reply austin-cheney To me this sounds hyper immature. It sounds like you don&#x27;t really know what you are doing as a technician and instead you are checking whatever box whatever employer at the time tells you to check. Then when confronted with the reality that your output is clearly wrong you instead shift blame to something about tools, because diddling the tools is all you really know what to do. reply makeitdouble At this point I wonder if browsers couldn&#x27;t be adjusted to this, and have link behavior on any element that indirectly behaves like a link.For instance if a user ctr + cliks a button, have the navigation happen in a tab window even if the URL change is pushed by a JS module down the line. reply matheusmoreira Would be better if browsers adjusted so as to deliberately break React and its brethren instead instead of fixing the mess they made. The web used to work great, now look at what it&#x27;s become. People can&#x27;t even put a link in the document properly. reply paulddraper ?You need a href for the browser to know where to navigate to.Just use RouterLink.It uses a native anchor tag. If you click (without Ctrl&#x2F;cmd) it prevents default and does the navigation without reload. reply jakelazaroff What is RouterLink? A quick Google search turns up some Angular thing, but I don’t think anyone was talking specifically about Angular. reply whstl GP is talking about the component&#x2F;feature present in React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;etc routers that allows links to behave like normal anchor links (allowing to open in another window, etc) but also use the SPA router for navigation when possible.I&#x27;m not making any argument here, just explaining. Also makeitdouble&#x27;s idea would apply even to non-SPAs or to pages without javascript. For example, I might want to submit a form but in a new tab. reply jezzamon It would be nice if the JavaScript APIs made it easier to do that. Like, obviously you can wrap an element in atag, but its just enough of a hassle that people don&#x27;t. Seems like a good API could fix a lot of sites reply cowsandmilk 1I’ve run into this, but it is coming from the UX designer for the product. There is an organization component library, with a corresponding figma library. They insist on using the button component instead of the link component. reply nosefurhairdo 1Most react component libraries correctly returntags forcomponents with an href property, while still styling them as buttons. This preserves the expected link behaviors while satisfying the design obsession with buttons over traditional links. reply chefandy Specifying button-looking elements for regular navigation actions is definitely wrong, and nearly all UX and UI designers will understand that.If it triggers an action with consequences, or even navigates users to a single-purpose page where they can select options or confirm the action-- e.g. &#x27;cancel subscription now&#x27; or similar-- then it probably should look like a button. reply tough 1 reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 Is it possible the absence of \"links\" is unintentional.As a web user, this sort of \"design\" has made me focus as a practical matter more on HTTP (requests) instead of HTML (links). It&#x27;s easy for me to make the links myself once I know where the requests need to go.It&#x27;s easy to take JSON and make own HTML. No Javascript needed. reply SilasX 1Ugh. Yes. Bane of my web existence: a site will have a list view and a detail view. Can’t right click (or use extensions) to open one item in its detail view.Even then, it would almost be forgivable if going back to list view (via their button or the browser button) were instant and seamless, but…It never is! Going back means waiting for all the content to reload again and losing my position.Why do you designers keep allowing this?Edit: and for the final kick in the balls, some websites force all tabs to be the same in some respect! Like, Facebook makes it (or at least did one time) so that you have to have the same chats popped up in every tab. If you close one in one tab, it closes in all other tabs. Why?! There’s a reason I have multiple tabs open! reply scatters 1Sometimes you can duplicate the tab then open the detail view in the duplicate. I agree, it&#x27;s ridiculous. reply tough 1But not all buttons are links surely? reply nosefurhairdo 1Of course not, but if your button pushes&#x2F;replaces history then it should be antag with an href property. reply traverseda 1They should for accessibility reasons. If they&#x27;re not assistive tools might not know they&#x27;re even click-able.Maybe if you&#x27;re doing like a painting app or something you don&#x27;t need to. reply Raicuparta 1Button elements and other clickable elements are all detected by accessibility tools as such. If links were the only thing they could click, the modern web would be almost completely unusable, which isn&#x27;t the case. reply iamnotjay I never knewwas a thing :D nice thread reply sergiotapia 1This is one of the first things I changed at a new job.

My blood pressure increased just reading your comment. The web is run by a bunch of amateurs who don’t know the single core concept of the web: links. reply jfarmer 1Love this.The way I think about it is that you assume a level of responsibility whenever you tinker with default affordances. Your \"feature\" isn&#x27;t restricted to whatever narrow conception or intention you had when you designed it. It consists in the totality of a visitor&#x27;s actual experience.If I change the logic of the the back button, I&#x27;m changing what the back button affords on this particular website and become responsible for whatever happens as a result.That includes confused and frustrated users saying \"Screw you and your broken website.\"Or take, e.g., the way scrollbars work, which can be very browser-and-OS-specific. Are you sure you want to assume responsibility for that? How sensitive are you to the downside, really?Essentially, you&#x27;re making your website speak a kind of creole. You&#x27;ve forgone any right to be upset if your visitors don&#x27;t speak it and shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they persist in \"misinterpreting\" it.Forget about avoiding such \"features\" because you want to be nice to your visitors. It always seemed to me they offer limited upside and unlimited downside. reply loeber 1Yep, this is exactly right. Websites benefit from design idioms that have been carefully crafted over many years. Every website that disregards these idioms makes itself harder to use because it doesn’t speak the same language as what the user is (perhaps without noticing) used to. I wrote about the loss of design idioms at length: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loeber.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;4-bring-back-idiomatic-design reply counterpartyrsk What gets me is when fancy-pants JS devs disguise complexity and features nobody has asked for behind native html looking controls like select menus.I see this most often with the city and state inputs, where city is a text input and state is a drop-down&#x2F;select menu.As a Texan, I will type my city, tab to the State select menu and type \"t\" followed by another \"t\" then tab to the next form element.But what I&#x27;m seeing lately is a text input (search field) dressed up like a drop-down menu... So my t , t input results in a text search for a literal \"tt\" instead of selecting Tennessee then Texas. It&#x27;s so aggravating.Now if someone chooses to click the triangle in the drop-down menu, and scroll through the states, the element would work as expected... If you only wanted to interact with the element with you mouse.If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. reply cletusw This is (was) largely a problem caused by holes in the web platform. Historically it was incredibly hard (if not impossible) to style or otherwise extend the behavior of a true , so most apps had to reimplement it (poorly).seems to be the new styleable built-in replacement.And then because code sharing across apps&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;companies&#x2F;etc was historically very hard, only really big companies had enough headcount to build fully functional, accessible, customizable replacements for built-in components. Web Components solve this, allowing global collaboration on common leaf node components like .Related: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.windows.com&#x2F;msedgedev&#x2F;2022&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;styling-selec... reply samwillis 1I think of this as the \"appification of websites\", we need to stop doing it. We need to move back to SSR and sprinkles of JS on websites.On the other hand web apps absolutely can play a little more with the UX if it provides value to the user. But if it&#x27;s in the browser, some of this really do still apply. I&#x27;m all in on web apps, its a universally accessible platform for development outside the walled gardens of app stores.What we need to stop doing is treating every single website as an app!If you want your page to appear in search results on a search engine, it&#x27;s not a web app it&#x27;s a website. reply bunga-bunga 1I really wish we could have browser “Accept: text&#x2F;markdown” for raw documents, but that boat sailed the moment we got CSS. reply aerzen 1Why though? We could have the browser apply the styles. And even allow user preferences to affect the presentation! kinda like firefox \"article mode\".But that text&#x2F;markdown would have to be restricted not to include any html tags, which are allowed in the \"common\" md spec. reply bunga-bunga Article mode isn&#x27;t perfect and not compatible with non-articles. Markdown forces content to be just content.> would have to be restricted not to include any html tagsThe point of this would be to deliver pure content, so \"any tag\" would definitely not be allowed.

These were invented for an earlier, innocent, more generous era.The idea of hyperlinks was that the world will self-organise all its information by connecting resources across the WWW. A noble, idealistic vision for the role of computing.Thats not how it worked out. There is now a self-appointed organizer of all the world&#x27;s information and a few addictive walled gardens that want you to never follow any outside link.Software technologies adjust to serve business models. The SPA-fication of websites is part of that process. An existing, widely available stack (WWW browsers, web servers etc) is repurposed selectively to meet altermative objectives. Anything not serving business needs will sooner or later be deprecated.While various niche protest movements exist, they are really fancyfull, escapist, even elitist affairs.Who knows, the economics of how we organize the world&#x27;s information may change yet again (LLMs say hi), bringing yet new tech approaches but i) dont bet on it and ii) the new pattern might be even worsePositive scenarios do exist, eg Web 3 as the fediverse but they will float on sink on the back of their business models. reply sneak There is still a web outside of those walled gardens, and it is bigger than it has ever been, even when you remove all the corporate websites and NPCs that use them. reply ajimix 1Why bank websites remove the ability to paste? You have already copied the text when you realize you cannot paste. So what is the point? Writing things by hand are prone to errors and if your clipboard is poisoned you have already copied the stuff by the time you realize you cannot paste… reply undebuggable The banks protect you from malicious clipboard manipulation by manipulating the clipboard content (\"we let you paste but complete some digits manually\") and&#x2F;or entirely disabling pasting text into text fields. Yes, they employ at least one \"security expert\" who will elaborately explain you why it&#x27;s better for your security. reply epivosism 1I always imagine there is an \"intro to forms programming\" which includes code to disable copy and paste, and its concepts now have thousands of descendants across the web, to the point that people start imagining it&#x27;s a security measure and proactively copy it. I agree w&#x2F;you and don&#x27;t see the point in stopping users from pasting in the first place. reply mgkimsal 1I don&#x27;t think it specifically violates any accessibility regulations, but preventing pasting has always come across to me as an accessibility violation. reply capableweb Usually it starts with a company having issues with robot traffic. So they try a bunch of things to hinder the robot(s). They do something, the robot stops working, but after a while it comes back, it&#x27;s a cat and mouse game essentially.One day, they (developers pushed by middle managers) disable copy-paste on the login page, and the robot temporary stops working, until a couple of days later, when the robot found a way around it.On to the next thing to do to stop the robot, but that previous \"fix\" is still there, with the thinking that \"maybe that stops some of the robots\", but it probably doesn&#x27;t.But there it sits, some ~10-ish lines of JS that will hang around until rewrite v6 when they&#x27;ll begin from the beginning, and some months&#x2F;years later come around to disabling it once again.No, I&#x27;m absolutely not speaking from experience. reply KirillPanov Just give up.You can&#x27;t win; you&#x27;re going to get robot traffic unless everybody does something like Web Environment Integrity. Seriously.Just allocate your finite resources in a hierarchical 32-level binary tree based on bit prefixes of the client IP address. Exactly what the root DNS servers do. And exactly what the only mitigation for slowloris attacks does. Then get on with your life. reply drowsspa Honestly, robot traffic seems like an issue just because websites are horrendously inefficient. Hundreds of round-trips to external servers, languages that require some orders of magnitude more resources than needed...

It shouldn&#x27;t be so expensive to just serve a page, even considering robotsThis is not a priority. The features are implemented by more abstraction, ie. TypeScript and web frameworks.

Desktop clipboard is a shitshow. Any app can read it willy nilly, certainly if focused but I wouldn’t be surprised if it works in the background on some platforms.It is one of the prime candidates for a global redesign from scratch, including even physical keys (since copy-paste is so common, certainly more than say caps lock). All the APIs are riddled with decades of tech debt and are entirely platform-specific. reply asaddhamani Clipboard managers exist so it definitely can be read in the background on some platforms at least. reply Falkon1313 It&#x27;s to reduce security.Of course a long, random, unique password from a password manager is best for security, everyone knows that.So forcing people to instead use a short, easy-to-type, memorable password clearly couldn&#x27;t possibly be anything else but an attempt to undermine the user&#x27;s security and put their account at increased risk. That bank does not have your best interests in mind. With that in mind, it doesn&#x27;t matter why they don&#x27;t.So switch to another bank (or better yet, a credit union) that does. reply bobbylarrybobby 1This is why I have an automation on my computer to type out the clipboard character by character. reply extraduder_ire 1IME, middle-clicking on a linuxy computer still works as expected most places.

It&#x27;s insane. Said \"password\" is just a 6 digit number (we&#x27;re not allowed to set our own passwords, because 6 digits is definitely way more secure than the 16 character random strings my password manager generates) and it forces me to enter it using buttons on the page itself with randomized positions. No idea how any of this is supposed to help with security, if my device is already compromised to the point that all my keypresses and clicks are being logged, the attacker can probably also just read the password from the browser&#x27;s memory... reply porridgeraisin I agree with your overarching point.But, how exactly does being able to install a keylogger on someone&#x27;s computer mean you can also break memory integrity and steal data from the browser&#x27;s memory?From what I know, windows keylogger \"services\" were very popular some 10 years ago and hence the banks rushing to \"fix\" it. reply bakugo > But, how exactly does being able to install a keylogger on someone&#x27;s computer mean you can also break memory integrity and steal data from the browser&#x27;s memory?On Windows at least, any process can read any other process&#x27; memory as long as it&#x27;s running under the same user. reply russelg Is this ING? Sounds very similar to how ING does it. reply undebuggable Polish ING modifies IBAN on pasting it during bank transfer and forces to enter manually first two digits \"for your security\". They also disable IBAN selection in transfer summary view, so one cannot copy it and double check before confirming the transfer.

Because this event is too low-level and now my listener needs to check modifier keys. What I really want is to somehow tell the browser \"if the current window URL is about to change via this anchor element, call this function instead\". The user is still free to open their links in new windows or tabs and my code will not be triggered for those cases.A CSS example: I don&#x27;t really want to set cursor images for every element and pseudo-class. I&#x27;m forced to list every element that uses the cursor I&#x27;m overriding. What I really want is to tell the browser \"use this custom cursor image wherever you were going to use the default (hand&#x2F;wait&#x2F;resize&#x2F;etc) cursor\". My code would then be future-proofed for new elements&#x2F;UI.Sometimes I feel that certain browser APIs suffer from the XY problem. reply josephg 1> What I really want is to somehow tell the browser \"if the current window URL is about to change via this anchor element, call this function instead\".This is pretty doable using javascript - just register an onclick on thetag and have your event handler cancel the default navigation behaviour. Your website will then continue to work great even if the user has javascript disabled. And all the built in browser behaviour (like the right click \"link\" menu, and ctrl+click) still works perfectly.That said, this is a pretty obscure \"trick\". It would certainly be nice if the DOM API made this easier to do. reply wwweston 1Is there really anything easier to do? If you&#x27;re disabling the default event, you&#x27;re doing it to provide some other functionality, which is necessarily going to involve writing a function to attach to a handler, and adding event.preventDefault() at the top is about as easy as it gets. Anything easier would involve eliminating the attached handler, which doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense.Also, .preventDefault() wasn&#x27;t obscure in the jQuery era; if it&#x27;s obscure now that&#x27;s a sad commentary. reply dlisboa https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Navigation_...I believe that’s the use case for the Navigation API. reply bunga-bunga 1Finally I read my sentiment online. We don&#x27;t need clicks nor pointer events, we need high-level “visit” event. reply KronisLV 1I remember the first time when I looked at the Flutter Gallery and was surprised at how things felt just broken in a web browser, for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gallery.flutter.dev (I think it was the Reply example in particular)Ctrl + click or middle mouse button didn&#x27;t work on links, right click didn&#x27;t work, selecting and copying text didn&#x27;t work, inspect element didn&#x27;t work (due to how the technology is built), even attempting to zoom the page did nothing.This article does ring true both because of that experience, as well as some of the SPA implementations I&#x27;ve seen even with more conventional technologies. reply asaddhamani It also seems to be doing something weird with text selection, at least on mobile browsers. But I guess the promise of flutter is it’s the same everywhere so this demo should be equally bad on desktop. reply phist_mcgee Flutter is another dead-end on the road to unified development frameworks.I haven&#x27;t once been convinced by any flutter demo, web or mobile, that feels like it has even passably good UX. reply rounakdatta 31 A very recent example of how \"doing normal things\" has been sabotaged in the ChatGPT app is the Ctrl+Shift+C shortcut to open the Dev Console. It now copies the last generated answer. reply muhehe 1One of many things I hate on crappy modern web is messing with history (API). You click a interesting-looking link somewhere (like HN), go to page. You scroll down, either reading or just skimming, and every funcking header (or even something less important) add entry to you history. To get back to original site you have to click back like a million times.Fuck everyone who does that. reply Falkon1313 I&#x27;ll also add &#x27;infinite scroll&#x27;. Just use a pager. It&#x27;s linkable, searchable, browseable, works correctly with the history. Infinite scroll breaks all of that for no good reason. reply asaddhamani Not to mention the sites that make it impossible to see their footer because of infinite scrolling. reply lacoolj Some of the things on this list I&#x27;ve never encountered and seem a little like fluff for the post (not being able to copy stuff? hijacking regularly used keystrokes? how often is that happening to you, really?).Navigation&#x2F;history tracking is an ongoing battle within SPAs. Not rocket science but if not part of initial planning definitely becomes a problem to implement after-the-fact. Agreed this is something to work on across the web.But I will take the scrollbar thing into consideration in my next site. I am very guilty of this. reply voiper1 28 Yep, copy&#x2F;paste issue on desktop is an issue.It&#x27;s even worse on mobile where I&#x27;ll often have to send myself a link (sometimes one step back to how I got there) to deal with it on desktop. reply ozyschmozy I feel like I suffer from the copy issue at least once a week. My go to solution is inspecting the page source to copy directly from there but it&#x27;s still extremely annoying. Please make your text selectable&#x2F;searchable.The worst offender for this is my bank which doesn&#x27;t provide a way to copy my IBAN. reply undebuggable Somehow banks decided it&#x27;s a good security practice to hinder copying and pasting of IBANs, especially when user defines a bank transfer. So here you are, multiple tabs and files open at once, entering IBAN digit by digit and checking multiple times, now you are secure. reply grishka Another thing I&#x27;d like to add: don&#x27;t override the scrolling behavior. Don&#x27;t try to \"improve\" the scrolling by making it \"smoother\", because while it may work okay on Windows, on Mac, when using Apple input devices, there&#x27;s a one-to-one correspondence between you moving your fingers on the trackpad or mouse and scrollable things scrolling. These \"improvements\" usually feel like scrolling through molasses.In general, don&#x27;t try to improve browser&#x27;s default behavior. reply ovao > Let me zoom in on my browser without the website getting all out of whack.This, weirdly, is a remarkably hard problem. I always like to think that I build sites that will be responsive and will scale correctly when zoomed, but not only is that not the case, but different browsers also handle zooming in substantially different ways such that I don’t even have a target to aim at.Suffice it to say that it’s difficult to get even an okay representation of any sufficiently complex layout when zoomed, so I just have to settle for “okay”. reply austin-cheney 1There are really only two problems here, and they are as old as the web itself:1) Low Expectations2) No definitions, standards, baselines defining people and&#x2F;or practiceAs I have been looking at job posts quite a bit lately everything now is a \"Senior Fullstack Engineer\" position. This is just so lazy. Then you dive into it and what they really want is some combination of Java or Python, R, Spring, and SQL. Not fullstack. You are wasting peoples&#x27; time and worse you are advertising to the public that you either don&#x27;t understand the technology or just don&#x27;t care about it.Sigh.In programming we call this an \"X&#x2F;Y\" problem. You want to solve for \"X\", a desired end state. Instead of X all you can talk about is \"Y\", the approach you wish you could take. This is a tremendous anti-pattern. Its also why employers are getting 500 resumes for open positions and nobody seems qualified.Instead start with the goal: \"We are hiring to build a client&#x2F;server app that can do &#x27;_____&#x27;. We expect candidates to write&#x2F;support features X, Y, Z. Your constraints are: A, B, C.\" The reason why companies don&#x27;t do this is typically because they have no idea what they are actually doing and they have also gone down several wrong paths already and have a bunch of broken technology to support. That&#x27;s why they call this tech debt.Then when it comes to interview time the employer and the candidates know exactly what the goals are and can ask the appropriate questions to appropriately eliminate each other. Otherwise, its just some horrible combination of a blind date and a game show where an audience gets to ridicule the contestants.Here is a quick hypothetical example:We are hiring to build a highly distributed media conferencing application. Developers are expected to write TypeScript, pipe stream data from sockets, work both in the browser and the server, and write test automation. Operating constraints include WCAG AA conformance, a privacy conformance checklist drafted by our legal department, and various performance considerations targeting both execution speed and network latency. Ideal candidates will demonstrate solutions during interview time for network latency, writing application logic in the browser, and state management of streamed data. reply brigadier132 1> nevermind the basic accessibility requirements that are often missing like alt text on imagesIt&#x27;s easier than ever to make websites accessible and a lot of these new tools enable this.

An inaccessible website would be equivalent to a low quality prompt for an LLM. reply p1mrx 1I&#x27;m aware of 5 operations that a standard link should support:- Left-click (obvious)- Right-click (context menu)- Middle-click (open in new tab)- Ctrl-click (open in new tab)- Shift-click (open in new window)Most sites support at least one of right&#x2F;middle&#x2F;ctrl-click, though sometimes you have to Duplicate the tab and then left-click. If none work, and duplicating the tab loses context, it&#x27;s probably time to abandon hope and find another website. reply eyelidlessness 1Note: if at all possible, don’t implement these yourself! You’ll very probably do it wrong for at least some users. For example, ctrl-click for new tab is platform specific: on macOS it should be cmd-click, and ctrl-click should open a context menu. Most if not all are or can be user-configurable, which might not be detected by JS. But the default behaviors will do the right thing unless you override them. reply p1mrx 1I&#x27;m the parent commenter and I approve this message. reply Y-bar 39 Click-hold-drag is another one I use occasionally. For example to:* Save the link as a .loc file on the desktop* Open the link in a tab in another browser window, or another browser altogether.* Add it to a terminal prompt (e.g. curl&#x2F;wget)(try it with some links on this site into the text box or your text editor of choice) reply jezzamon There&#x27;s a set of events for mobile too, e.g. long-press should pop up menu reply lapcat 1[self-promotion] The article author appears to be using Windows, but on Mac and iOS there&#x27;s StopTheMadness: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;underpassapp.com&#x2F;StopTheMadness&#x2F; reply bobbylarrybobby 1One of my favorite extensions! reply bob1029 1> Let me zoom in on my browser without the website getting all out of whack. I just want to be able to read.This is my new OCD obsession when doing layout. I will keep my browser at 250% zoom for the first 3-4 hours of development. Periodically, I will spot test things like tables up to 500%.I had no respect for the humble non-breaking space or automatic table layouts until I started doing this. reply skybrian 1A very specific but related tip about not disabling zoom:You can stop using user-scalable=no and maximum-scale=1 in viewport meta tags now https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukeplant.me.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;you-can-stop-using-user-s... reply shadowgovt I hate when people do this on mobile. The Mastodon web app does this, and it&#x27;s real unfortunate when I hit a picture in someone&#x27;s stream and I can&#x27;t make it bigger even though I have more pixels than cones in my eye.Please, dear God, I just want to see the whiskers on the cat. reply arcanemachiner Here&#x27;s my understanding of the current situation: iOS now ignores the viewport setting altogether, while in Chrome, there is a setting in the Accessibility section to \"Force enable zoom\".So IIRC there&#x27;s a workaround (if you want to call it that) for both platforms. reply jbeninger \"Do responsive things. I didn&#x27;t spend most of my early career convincing clients to let us do a responsive website just for you to serve me up a boring layout that kicks down to your mobile layout as soon as you are less than 1200px.\"Can anyone elaborate on this? I feel like I&#x27;m missing some context because a desktop layout that kicks down to a mobile layout at a breakpoint sounds like the essence of doing responsive things.Obviously there are a ton of other aspects of responsiveness, but specifically calling out the layout change makes me think I misunderstood something. reply zelphirkalt Many elements can be responsive by just letting things float in them. Their width can be governed by their content and outer constraints. One can then define minimum widths for things. This way most of the responsiveness becomes simple and there is usually no need for media queries reacting to a specific width of arbitrarily chosen 1200px or similar. Elements float to the next line, when they don&#x27;t have enough space any longer.I understand this as criticism against designs, that are \"responsive\" in a way, that they simply \"snap\" at a specific width into a full blown \"mobile\" looking view, instead of seamlessly adapting to available width. reply cletusw Having two completely unrelated UIs – one for mobile, one for desktop - isn&#x27;t really responsive. When done that way there&#x27;s some point (e.g. 1199px width in the OP&#x27;s example) where you suddenly have a tiny mobile web site with a ton of blank space on either side (or worse, it stretches it all out to fit and all the blank space is within every single button and widget).There should either be several progressively more \"mobile\" breakpoints, or even better, use component queries so individual chunks of the page can rearrange their contents as their available area shrinks. reply rshaban Hi! I love it. The magic of original HTML inspired my current website : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;razi.psI remember the days as a kid when I just threw together CSS and HTML to see how things worked.

I don&#x27;t want that. It doesn&#x27;t always search the page as usual.You can bypass this by selecting the url bar before using ctrl-f. reply rjh29 1Ctrl-f is often overriden for a reason, though. On modern shitty React sites content outside the viewport may not be loaded into the DOM, so the browser find won&#x27;t even work. It is quite frustrating the scroll past some text, ctrl-f for it and get \"no results\". reply Falkon1313 That&#x27;s just a broken site. Breaking it in a different way doesn&#x27;t fix it. reply rjh29 Such \"broken\" sites happen to include some of the most popular sites on the internet, so I don&#x27;t think anyone cares. reply shadowgovt Correct. The most common perpetrator of \"stealing\" ctrl-f I use is the Google drive suite (Sheets, Docs, &c) and it&#x27;s basically necessary. That operation is executed server-side. The client doesn&#x27;t have the data to do the search.But that should be an exception, not the rule. reply eddd-ddde Google at least gets it right, I almost never used a generic site&#x27;s search function cause they never help me find what I want reply archerx 1I agree with everything in this post and the thing that gets me the most is broken back buttons on ecommerce sits. reply simonbarker87 1Here here!On the last point, the sites that hijack ctrl-f (or CMD-f) often let you through to the normal page browser search with a second attempts at it if their search UI is still on the page.So on the sites I know do it I just double tap CMD-f and I get the normal page search. reply megous 1And often they don&#x27;t give a poopoo, like github.com. reply flagsarecolored 1I agree with the sentiment, but why is this still attributed to JavaScript. This applies to essentially everything exposed to UX, well beyond JS and web. We didn’t JavaScript it away, we bad-developered ourselves through a narrowing hallway until a point where we ended up with a black sheep. JavaScript didn’t enable this, there’s as many issues in this space in environments where JavaScript is not even a player, it may have been a carrier but not the root cause. reply austin-cheney I don&#x27;t blame the developers for this at all. I consider myself strong with accessibility and yet at the last job I was intimidated to bring it up. There accessibility was an anti-pattern. At many places they are just struggling to put text to screen. At these places you need a billion lines of code in multiple frameworks to display \"hello world\". How can you blame the JavaScript developer when nobody knows what they are doing and everybody points fingers at each other?This doesn&#x27;t just apply to accessibility. It also applies to security, performance, and a variety of other things that never happen unless a law suit is coming or a major client stops paying. reply pwdisswordfishc > Stop hijacking my typical browser shortcuts for use in your own app> What did I miss?

I do most of my web dev in React and I don&#x27;t remember encountering difficulties with these items. reply agumonkey You just get sucked in state&#x2F;props and integrating ui libs and the common ergonomics start to slip from your mind. reply Kiro 1> Let me copy text so I can paste it.I&#x27;m guilty of doing this because in my game people kept accidentally double clicking and selecting all the text in the UI. What are the best practices around this? reply noduerme 1There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. A game UI is where you should block text selection. Web-based games that let you accidentally select UI text look unprofessional. I think the author is talking about informational or business apps. reply yonatan8070 1I was reading some article a while back, and as I read I like to highlight what I&#x27;m reading with my mouse, but that particular website decided that when I try to highlight text, the appropriate reaction from the site would be a tooltip saying that highlighting is not allowed... So I opened the devtools and copied the whole thing out of spite reply ricardo81 I&#x27;ve seen pages that listen for the console being opened, and would redirect to a Rick Roll when you did. It was a dodgy site though. reply ricardo81 1I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;d be to limit your custom behaviour to the element it applies to, rather than potentially the whole doc, or multiple pages etc. reply creata 1Imo that&#x27;s fine. In fact, it&#x27;s annoying when people (e.g., the \"5 seconds\" rewind in the YouTube player) don&#x27;t do this.Even if it&#x27;s often abused, user-select exists for a reason.[But if there is some text in your game that you think users might ever want to copy, please make it selectable!] reply nicbou 1CSS lets you set that behaviour per element reply shadowgovt In an ideal world, we really should have had another button or key combo for \"I want to select the text\" that isn&#x27;t overloaded on \"I want to select in general.\"The old way was fine when word processors and other apps were completely separate beasts, but the web has blurred all of that and we are unfortunately albatross&#x27;d to decisions made in the past.I want a fifth mouse button where 5-drag always means \"select text\" independent of all other UI content and as a result all text is selectable because text selection and other manipulations are totally different operations (at the event layer; \"mouse down\" and \"mouse textselect\" would be two different events).Wishful thinking; we&#x27;re stuck with the UI we have. reply 8organicbits 1> beause \"you can&#x27;t hover or tab on mobile, right?\" (wrong)I&#x27;m guessing you do this by adding an external mouse and keyboard? reply rakenodiax Or touchscreen laptops&#x2F;tablets, depending on what they use for detection reply shadowgovt Right, or any one of many assistive devices.

But:>Let me see scroll bars Please don&#x27;t hide them for the sake of your \"slick\" ui. Sometimes I want to click on the scrollbar and drag it. Just a normal web thing.I don&#x27;t see any on FF Android :P reply Waterluvian 1This blog doesn’t touch on the actual issue at hand: businesses make business decisions, not engineering decisions. It’s easy to enumerate a bunch of technical asks and then blame their absence on technical reasons, because it doesn’t require any exploration of the business details. It stays in a nice, safe realm.To be clear, I personally agree with, and want every single item listed in this blog. I’m a big nerd. But I also recognize that I’m nowhere near anything resembling a typical user. What I want is probably not even on the radar of 99% of users of these websites.It’s easy to say, “I want X and having X would make me a happier user.” The real question is, “is implementing X an appropriate expenditure of resources if the goal is to build a profitable business?” Usually not. Most users don’t know or don’t care about X. Be careful with the nerd echo chamber we live in that makes us think these things matter to the common person.For all of this, one could argue, “yeah but they’re being foolish. Long term this is going to bite them.” You might be right! I think you’re right, too. But that’s a business position, not a technical one. reply megous 1> is implementing X an appropriate expenditure of resourcesLot of these things just require devs to not actively try to damage the usability of the defaults. It costs money to break the basics that work for free:- missing keyboard focus indicator? yeah, dev had to go out of his way to remove it, instead of just doing nothing and focusing on the job&#x2F;content- can&#x27;t paste into inputs? someone had to think about preventing this and implemented it- ctrl+k &#x2F; ctrl+f is broken? it works if you just write you page and do nothing extra!- page is blank for people with JS disabled? someone wasted money on a person who had to learn a whole damn programming language and multi-billion dollar company&#x27;s framework instead of just html&#x2F;css reply kijin 1For many businesses, there&#x27;s a simple incentive that should make them care: SEO.Although Google and other search engines have said for more than a decade that their bots can execute javascript and navigate SPAs, the truth is that they are not going to simulate a click on every random element with onClick events attached. In many cases, they will not even execute any javascript.Even in 2023,is the best way to make search engines pay attention.Popular frontend development patterns have also made it nearly impossible to figure out the semantic structure of a page. Everything is anow. But if you care about how your website looks in a search result, you might still want to designate some parts of the page asorand other parts asor . This is especially important if your website contains short user-generated snippets (like tweets) along with a lot of auxiliary information, as semantic tags make it easier for search engines to determine what the main content of each URL is.In short, many websites would still benefit from enforcing proper semantic markup, like we used to do in the good ol&#x27; days of the \"no tables for layout\" crusade.Now if the business doesn&#x27;t care about SEO at all (an increasingly common attitude as websites become app-ified), there&#x27;s always the atomic option: talk to the legal department about the possible consequences of ignoring accessibility. reply cratermoon > businesses make business decisions, not engineering decisions.And that&#x27;s how we get things like the 737Max reply Julesman 1Someone those businesses hired sold them on shortcuts that are just bad. Trading UX for production speed isn&#x27;t a thing. Claiming bad UX is a business decision isn&#x27;t a thing. Bad UX is bad for business. Sure, some of these concerns aren&#x27;t as important as others. But generally speaking, the idea that saving time on development at the expense of observing very basic UI conventions is just silly. reply Given_47 1> Stop hijacking my typical browser shortcuts for use in your own app I&#x27;ve seen this happen with ctrl + f for opening a custom in-app search bar.Ah the Discourse classic.

Functional programming has some interesting ideas, but it&#x27;s not useful in practical applications. Procedural programming is the simplest and fastest way to make the computer do things. reply Zambyte OOP is orthogonal to FP vs procedural. You can use or not use OOP in both.Also, OOP is fine. Class oriented programming (often called OOP by accident) is the real flawed paradigm. reply msla 49 OOP is how large-scale procedural programs are organized. It allows programmers to try to reason about medium-scale parts of the system. (Mesoscale programming? Is that a thing yet?)FP is a set of guarantees (maybe even enforced by the compiler) about program behavior which enable optimizations, for the compiler, and reasoning about small parts of the system in isolation, for the programmers.Enough FP can allow you to abstract away the procedural parts, but even a little FP in a procedural codebase can be a good thing. Ditto a little OO, which is why C programmers reinvent bits and pieces of Smalltalk every so often. reply aleku Was this \"M{kel{_Juhani_NOK@smail.elisa.fi\" an effort to mask your address from scrappers?

So much history can be found in one place, along with everything we need to (re)experience what things were like back in the day.As someone who runs an Aminet mirror (us3.aminet.net, which happens to be hosted on a real Amiga), I&#x27;m always grateful and appreciative we have resources like these that aren&#x27;t based on popularity or on the OS du jour.Thanks, FUNET! reply Delk 1Some of the appreciation should go to the academic roots, culture and tradition of the early internet. The internet originated at DARPA but many of the earliest participants and adopters were academic institutions.FUNET is the Finnish University and Research Network. They provide backbone connectivity and networking facilities to universities in Finland and have done so for decades. They&#x27;ve also run the public FTP archive (actually HTTPS by now) since 1990.It seems to me that at the time, providing a server that distributed freely distributable and open source software was part of an academic culture of sharing and of providing a public good. (The free software movement also has its roots in the academia. Of course \"open source\" as a term didn&#x27;t exist back then, but some of the culture did, without the commercial connotations of open source necessarily.)In today&#x27;s rather commercialized world, I appreciate it that a public institution still runs such an archive in a similar spirit with no direct commercial interest. (FUNET is run by a state-owned enterprise.) reply juhanima Totally agree and thank you for being so perceptive! It was swell to hear someone say aloud \"academic culture of sharing and providing for public good\". I think that&#x27;s what humankind would be wise to aim and seek for: equality of all and caring for the welfare of the weakest.University education does not need to be expensive. On the contrary, it can be free. reply anthk 19 Not FUNET but from IBIBLIO I&#x27;ve got the sun multimedia sounds for notifications in my machine along herbe.

However, the intersection of {Features defined in RFCs} and {Features implemented in FTP Servers} is much smaller than the sizes of either set. Many useful things are implemented outside of the spec, and most of the spec is not implemented in servers. reply smokel 1I had to look this up, but FTP uses TCP&#x2F;IP, so it being older than TCP would be a bit odd.It turns out that FTP has gone through some stages of specifications, dating back to 1971. TCP originated in 1974, according to Wikipedia that is.The current version of TCP (RFC 793, 1981) predates the current version of FTP (RFC 959, 1985), and normality is restored. reply dn3500 There were several application protocols in use at the time of the TCP cutover (1981?), including ftp and telnet. We didn&#x27;t just throw them away, we ported them over from TCP&#x27;s predecessor NCP. The one we did throw away was email, which was not a separate protocol, but was implemented as part of ftp. We got rid of that and replaced it with smtp. But the new ftp&#x2F;tcp servers still supported email for several years as a transition. reply yencabulator 1FTP predates TCP&#x2F;IP, TCP wasn&#x27;t the first stream transport. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File_Transfer_Protocol> Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP&#x2F;IP. reply Delk 1The \"FTP\" archive is also served over HTTPS nowadays, and has been for a long time.

It potentially allows things like one machine setting up file transfer between two servers. Not sure if this was done, but could be done.Lot of stuff was rather interesting design, which we really have gotten away with how our current networks are build. Like multi and broadcasting for actual content. reply tssva It is much more complicated than using two ports. There are two modes of ftp, active and passive.In active mode the client connects to the server on port 21. It then issues a PORT command which tells the server which port on the client to connect to for data. The server connects to destination port on the client using port 20 as the source port.In passive mode the client connects to the server on port 21 and issues the PASV command. The server chooses a random port for data and responds back to the client with a PORT command indicating this port. The client then connects to this destination port on the server using a random high port as the source port. reply jgtrosh 1A nice post about the weirdness of FTP: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;computer.rip&#x2F;2020-05-20-file-transfer-pseudoprotocol... reply voytec 1Even funkier!> FTP was historically allocated ports 20, 21, and 22. reply akikoo http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slacksite.com&#x2F;other&#x2F;ftp.html(my brother was an aminet maintainer at nic.funet.fi in the 90s :) reply wkat4242 1Yeah and the server connecting to the client for a transfer is kinda weird too.

For the Zoom model they trained a new model with data gathered from Zoom. They call it a practical side channel attack but they didnt do anything to see if this approach could generalize at all reply OtherShrezzing 1I believe that is the generalisable version of the attack. You&#x27;re not looking to learn the sound of arbitrary keyboards with this attack, rather you&#x27;re looking to learn the sound of specific targets.For example, a Twitch streamer enters responses into their stream-chat with a live mic. Later, the streamer enters their Twitch password. Someone employing this technique could reasonably be able to learn the audio from the first scenario, and apply the findings in the second scenario. reply TechBro8615 1Finally, a real security weakness to cite when making fun of people for their mechanical keyboard. Time to start recording the audio of Zoom calls with some particularly loud typers... reply Spooky23 I used to work in an office space with an independent contractor whose schtick was that he was a genius. The affectations around his genius-ness included casually bringing up Mensa meetings, dropping magazines like Foreign Affairs and academic journals around the office, and his fucking keyboard.The keyboard had custom switches that were very loud. And he typed fast - it was like living on a gun range. Everyone in the office probably would have chipped in for a hitman, but alas, the CTO, whose office had a solid door, was “inspired” that the mechanical feedback helped fuel inspiration in boy wonder.Had we thought of the security risks of the keyboard, I would have brought good scotch to the infosec dude while expressing my concerns. reply harles Somewhat tangential: clicky switches, like Cherry Blues, tend to click twice for each stroke. I think this leads to people assuming there are twice as many strokes going on. Tactile switches tend to only click once (when they bottom out). So, fancy keyboards can make people sound faster than they are. reply leni536 Add a guy that bottoms out the keys and you will have an additional \"click\". reply _the_inflator > it was like living on a gun rangeThanks for this metaphor. I know off at least one guy, to which this metaphor could be applied as well. reply throwaway290 Not inspired enough to hire him properly apparently... reply tharne Mechanical keyboard user here. Most of us use mechanical keyboards because they&#x27;re a lot more fun to type on. That&#x27;s it. Because if you&#x27;re not having fun, what&#x27;s the point? reply coldtea I don&#x27;t know, typing?Else, something like Mai Tais on the beach sounds more fun, maybe it&#x27;s just me... reply vasco 23 Mai tais on the beach don&#x27;t let you signal what a cool hacker you are. When the point of a thing is signaling, normal arguments don&#x27;t apply. reply whatisyour but mai tais on beach don&#x27;t get you money, and if you are going to type on something, its better to make sure its comfortable for you. reply vladvasiliu 16 But isn&#x27;t one of the reasons for using mechanical switches to be able to not bottom out, hence avoiding the repetitive shocks on the fingers? This is what I do with my tactile keyboards, and I&#x27;m actually quieter when I type quickly than my colleagues who bottom out on their cheap hollow HP keyboards like no tomorrow. reply sgu999 40 But inconfortable for others. Surely you all know it bothers a good amount at least some of your colleagues, right? replyjayd16 I&#x27;ll just have to add significantly more background clickity clacks as obfuscation. reply fatfingerd Not according to the article.. Microphones are sensitive enough to mount the attack on quieter keyboards. reply Aerroon Microphones are surprisingly sensitive. I can listen to music in my closed-back headset at a regular volume. My desk mic can pick this up. Without boosting the audio it&#x27;s barely audible that there&#x27;s music, but after adding some gain you get almost the full song profile (and background noise).I can even pick out some of my breathing from the recording.If I turn on noise suppression and noise gate it&#x27;s fine. reply pests I was two rooms away from someone playing music on a smart Google device. I could very barely hear that music was playing at all and only just barely made out it was a song I had been interested in but kept missing. I pulled out my S22+ and used Shazam. somehow it was able to pick it up easily. reply thereisnospork What we clearly need are louder keyboards - which overload the mic so as to render keystrokes indistinguishable. reply TheCleric Adding a gain knob to my keyboard, be right back. reply someplaceguy My mechanical keyboard already has a knob that I&#x27;ve configured to control the system audio volume, all that&#x27;s left is configuring Linux to play an audio recording of a keypress every time I press a key... reply yjftsjthsd-h > all that&#x27;s left is configuring Linux to play an audio recording of a keypress every time I press a keyI unironically think I&#x27;ve seen that config recently - someone had an actually quiet keyboard but wanted the full Mechanical Keyboard Effect™ so they just... have it play the sound per keypress. (It was not 100% clear to me whether it was an elaborate joke or a real aesthetic choice) reply danieldk The Kinesis Advantage2 and the Moonlander have a piezo speaker to give keystroke sounds. However, they are not for, as you might expect to give the full Mechanical Keyboard Effect™.If you have mechanical switches, you want to learn to type just past the actuation point and not until the switch bottoms out. This is relatively easy with tactile switches (the have a bump and the actuation point is immediately after the bump). However in linear switches, you don&#x27;t feel when you have hit the actuation point. So the piezo speaker can be used during the first weeks to train your muscle memory of where the actuation point is, so that you can type lightly.I had this on my Kinesis Advantage with Cherry Reds, and it was really nice during the initial days&#x2F;weeks, after which I turned it off. reply dasyatidprime You want https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zevv&#x2F;bucklespring then.Lagniappe: “To temporarily silence bucklespring, for example to enter secrets, press ScrollLock twice” reply idbehold When conducting coding interviews remotely I often switch from my mechanical keyboard to my laptop keyboard (for taking notes) because I know how annoying&#x2F;distracting that sound can be on calls. Suffice it to say, having a gain knob on my mechanical keyboard would be wonderful. reply tiltowait Some old IBM keyboards (beamsprings, the predecessor to the Model F, which preceded the Model M) had solenoids inside to make them louder and sound more like typewriters. I wonder if such a setup would defeat this attack, or if it would still be possible to discern the actual keypress alongside the solenoid. reply filchermcurr Not just limited to old IBM keyboards! The new reproduction Model F keyboards also have a solenoid option! It&#x27;s fantastically loud with it banging on the solid metal case along with the buckling springs. Great keyboards in general. reply doix I&#x27;m guessing it would be easier (assuming you trained it on that keyboard), because each solenoid would be fairly unique due to manufacturing tolerances. Just my gut feeling, I have no data to back it up. reply Gh0stRAT I know nothing about this keyboard, but I&#x27;d assume it just has one solenoid because the expense and space of 100+ solenoids is impractical if all you&#x27;re using them for is simulating the vibration&#x2F;sound of a typewriter. reply meepmorp I&#x27;ve wanted to integrate a cap gun into a keyboard, basically a an old fashioned roll of paper caps and solenoid to whack &#x27;em, triggered by exclamation points. reply busyant Or auto-mute upon key press. reply Aerroon Or just use a password manager. reply addandsubtract Alternatively, constant random key press sounds playing in the background. reply marvin It’s so fascinating to watch this play out live. Once again, an ambitious kid can implement software hacks that are very funny when used for a joke, but also have massive real-world implications. reply worthless-trash Good luck with my mech steno keyboard. reply yowzadave 1I guess more reason to just use a password manager to autofill your password? reply jgtrosh 1Only if it doesn&#x27;t only rely on a master password reply apendleton A nice thing about master passwords though is that since you don&#x27;t have to type them in as often, they can be very long. 95% accuracy probably isn&#x27;t good enough to reliably reproduce a sentence-length master password, at least if it&#x27;s only captured once. reply coldtea >a sentence-length master passwordIj on-tep of sentenca lentg, it&#x27;s alio sentemce-bused (\"corvect harse batterg stapfe\") then ut would be quiti eady to guess even wits worse accurasy.(If on-top of sentence lenth, it&#x27;s also sentence-based (\"correct horse battery staple\") then it would be quite easy to guess even with worse accuracy.) reply Gh0stRAT potential solution: keep a few intentional typos in your passphrases. It also makes dictionary attacks much harder. reply GhostWhisperer 0 now you have to remember the the typos koolba The master password is also offline and require the key file to u lock the rest of the passwords. So by itself it’s not enough to compromise the accounts in the key file. The attacker would need the key file as well. reply SideQuark 95% accuracy means for each stroke, the most likely key is the top choice. Most models return a probability distribution per key, and it&#x27;s very like the other keys are in the top 2 or 3.Then you simply have the password cracker start trying passwords ordered by probability, and I bet it breaks your sentence within very few tries. reply belval 95% means that on average only 1 in 20 keystroke will be wrong. Even if your password is very long (40-60) that means only 2-3 errors. Since more people are not machines their long password will be a combination of words like the famous \"horsestaplebatterycorrect\" example from xkcd.Even if you flip a few letters from something like the above a human attacker will easily be able to fix it manually.\"horswstaplevatterucorrect\" for example is still intelligible. reply TheCleric On average 2-3 errors. However the real thing we want to look at is what is my chance of guessing right across ALL characters. For 1 it&#x27;s 95%, for 2 it&#x27;s 90.2%, and it gets worse from there. The formula for accuracy would be .95^c where c is the number of characters in the password. So the chance of getting EVERY key correct in a 40 character password is < 13% and < 5% for 60 characters. reply llbeansandrice Right. The comment above is saying even if you are incorrect in 2-5 keystrokes it’s not hard to guess the correct keystrokes if you’re using a sentence style password.You don’t need to guess every character. reply rightbyte What if the password is typed twice? You can easely figure it out then. reply whelp_24 that&#x27;s pretty high when you can use a computer to run the guesses reply Guvante Doesn&#x27;t everybody not require only a password?Offline you need the database which isn&#x27;t public.Online you usually need something else on new machines to get at the true master password. reply tedunangst What actually are you going to do if you spy on my zoom call and learn my master password is bigjarofpickles? reply Sai_ Hacker: tedunangst, what’s your email? Wanna invite you to that thing!Hacker: man, I hate typing passwords. Do you use password managers? Any reccos?… I am become hacker, destroyer of tedunangst’s bank account. reply danieldk 1Password requires an extra key upon the first login that you never have to type afterwards. So, have fun trying to log in to that password manager, even if you have the master password.Also, you can also use and require a hardware FIDO2 token as second factor. reply lamontcg Don&#x27;t type your master password on zoom calls reply jeromegv Or use your fingerprint reply worthless-trash why is that ? reply danieldk 1Password allows unlocking with a fingerprint (Touch ID) or Apple Watch, at least on a Mac. So you can unlock your password manager during a Zoom call, and nobody can snoop your master password.(With 1Password, the master password is not enough to do a remote account takeover, you also need the second-factor key. And you can&#x27;t snoop it, since it is only required during the first login, so a user will never type it after that.) reply kristopolous [insert yubikey plug]I don&#x27;t use one but I know people who swear by them.Also this is an extremely obvious result. Typing is obviously a form of \"penmanship\", it was well known that telegraph operators could identify each other by how they tapped out Morse code in the 1800s.People have been able to do this based upon key stroke latency and even identify people based on habitual mouse patterns for decades.Audio recordings work as yet another reliable proxy? Shocked!!I am amazed that people can do such obvious things and get published, have articles written on them... I need to get in on that, sounds easyI can make a web demo. You turn on the microphone type a couple things into a box on the web browser.Then you go to a different window and continue typing and then the model predicts What you are typing. As long as it&#x27;s proper grammar you can get to effectively 100% accuracy. It&#x27;ll appear to be spooky magic.I just might take the time. reply mercer You sound confident enough that&#x27;d I&#x27;d like to see you show that off :P. reply kristopolous sounds like a good exercise although it&#x27;ll literally just be for my own personal amusement.

Of course, this is bad 2FA, but it is popular. reply gleenn 1Perfect is the enemy of good. Text based 2FA is compromisable relatively easily but at least it&#x27;s an extra hurdle. reply 3np It&#x27;s the \"or just\" being the issue there, not the \"use 2fa\". reply barrotes Now that I know about the existence of this generation of acoustic attacks I would like to have the possibility to insert a second \"master password\" different from the main one, that instead of letting me directly access to my passwords just allows me to use fingerprint to get them. Guess if it&#x27;s already possible reply dools And there are therefore millions of hours of video that could be attack surface area already in the wild reply bitshiftfaced I think maybe you wouldn&#x27;t even need to see the keystrokes.

One advantage of a Zoom attack is that you get “plaintext” shortly after hearing the “ciphertext” if you can get the target to type into the chat window. And when you hear typing in other contexts it’s likely to be something that matches a handful of grammars that an LLM can recognize already (written languages, programming languages, commands, calculation inputs) - and when it doesn’t, that’s probably a password. reply failuser How come keyboard sound suppression is not a standard option in all online communication apps? It’s not that hard, keyboard sounds are pretty distinct. reply Galanwe Maybe because it&#x27;s easier said in an HN comment than in real life reply Geee 1It&#x27;s for a targeted attack. It doesn&#x27;t need to be generalized. reply tehwebguy Do keystrokes still come through Zoom? The noise filtering has become extremely aggressive lately, often hear people say “Sorry about that engine &#x2F; ambulance &#x2F; city noise” but nobody knows what they’re talking about. reply omgJustTest The answer is that likely all the above are used.Asking for “what signal it is detecting” might be better asked from a “what is the greatest signal bearing information” being used… which would help in averting attacks.This kind of stuff could be real menacing in all sorts of public places like airports, coffee shops and etc. reply moonchrome Seems simple to defend - use a password manager. reply cmod until you have to type your password to unlock it reply moonchrome 45 Biometric unlock or PIN ? I have to type my master password on restart, hopefully you can do that off screen. reply tomjakubowski your password manager hopefully uses an additional factor to enable it on a new device, so definitely avoid typing that in on Twitch reply voytec 1Good enough for PoC. reply snet0 I did a similar acoustic side-channel attack as final year project at uni. There&#x27;s a treasure trove of findings in this area, I&#x27;m just waiting for someone to combine methodologies. There are pretty good results using geometric models, trained and untrained statistical models like this and others, and combining these features with assorted language models.Here&#x27;s a few random papers I read along the way:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10207-019-00449-8 - SonarSnoop, which uses a phone&#x27;s speaker to produce ultrasonic audio that can be used to profile the user&#x27;s interaction (e.g. entering swipe-based passcodes).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~daw&#x2F;papers&#x2F;ssh-use01.pdf - \"Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH\", a paper from 2001 that uses statistical models of keystroke timings to retrieve passwords from encrypted SSH traffic.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;1609956.1609959 - \"Keyboard acoustic emanations revisited\", which uses hidden Markov models and some other English language features to recover text based on classification via cepstrum features.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;2660267.2660296 - \"Context-free Attacks Using Keyboard Acoustic Emanations\" which uses a geometric approach, using time-difference-of-arrival to estimate physical locations probabilistically. reply juancroldan 15 This idea could also be used for good at some point. Imagine “connecting” any keyboard to a device just by enabling the microphone.It would have its own set of problems: not two people using it at once, eavesdropping would be really easy… but it’d have its own set of interesting applications reply crazygringo Fascinating. I&#x27;m really curious what the acoustic properties are that it&#x27;s recognizing.Is it more of a physical fingerprint of each key, such that if you swapped keys&#x2F;springs the model would need to be updated? So it&#x27;s produced by manufacturing inconsistencies, the way individual typewriters used to be forensically identified?Or is more each key being identical, but producing a different resonance pattern within the keyboard&#x2F;laptop due to the shape of all of the matter surrounding it? If you move the keyboard in the room, do you have to re-train the model?I also wonder how much it varies depending on how hard you press each key -- not at all or a great deal? And what about by keyboard -- when you compare thin MacBook keys with an external full-height keyboard, is one easier&#x2F;harder to recognize each key on than the other? reply rocqua I presume typing style matters aswell. How quickly you reach each key, rythm, how hard you tend to hit a specific key.My sense is that they profile the person more than the keyboard. reply xpe Building on what you said: (1) just the key&#x27;s properties; (2) key properties relative to other keys; (2) sound transmission and environment between key and microphone; (3) relationship between key and finger; (4) relationship between key and associated dendritis reply iainctduncan I&#x27;m not clear why people are poo-pooing this as if it&#x27;s not a big deal. From a security and espionage point of view this is pretty significant - the audio learning has got to the point that a sensitive audio bug can bascially be key logger. There are a ton of context where an audio tap would be much easier to get in place than a traditional network attack (and with modern shotgun mics, might not even require being in the building). That is applicable to much more than just password stealing.I&#x27;ve always been a bit fascinated by this attack vector and wondered if would get to this point. reply nine_k I wonder if playing the typing sound constantly could help. Not an abstract sound, but recording of your actual typing on this particular keyboard, mixed to play some realistic-sounding phrases &#x2F; sequences. It should pause for a split second to let your actual keystrokes mix in. That would be really hard to decipher, or to correlate your typing with whatever other events (time to enter a password).Better yet, play some white noise around you. I heard that it&#x27;s actually done sometimes at really important meetings.If you&#x27;re not such a VIP, just type important things only on your phone; touch screens don&#x27;t produce enough sound, hopefully. reply drvdevd Yes it seems like any possible physical side channel (eg Tempest as well) is now amenable to machine learning approaches. Very interesting indeed. reply hackernewds you would need to tie microphone input with the actual keys typed, and enough of it to train a model. nothingburger reply AltruisticGapHN 23 Wow that&#x27;s kinda worrying for streamers on Twitch and Youtube etc. They sometimes enter passwords while buying a game on Steam or purchasing something on Amazon. Now they&#x27;re going to have to think about muting as they are already targets of doxing. reply crazygringo By the way, some (most?) videoconferencing software removes keyboard sounds from the audio, because it&#x27;s particularly a distracting problem with laptops where the microphone is right next to the keys.I&#x27;m pretty sure Zoom does this by default as part of its noise cancellation (it&#x27;s potentially even easier since you can use keydown events to help identify, not just the audio stream).So as long as basic default noise cancellation is on, that would at least prevent this over regular videoconferencing. And because of this, I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking of when else this would be a realistic threat, where the attacker wouldn&#x27;t already have enough physical access to either install a regular keylogger or else a hidden camera. reply bo1024 If any random webpage is granted access to the microphone, I would think this could be a problem. reply 1123581321 Meetings between organizations, multi-office cafeterias, or coffee shops, perhaps. reply mxwsn 1The example figure shows a key hit every half second, which suggests a pecking style of typing at around 24 wpm. This way the model gets very clean waveforms. I wonder how their approach would work with average or fast typists. The sound profiles might be much harder to link to characters. reply fbdab103 Even if there was ambiguity, some data is better than none. Given enough training data, I suspect you could find repeatable patterns in standard typists: on a qwerty layout, after typing an \"A\", \"Q\" takes 1.2-2.3x as long to type as a \"J\" kind of pairwise tempo patterns. Anything to reduce the search space from brute-forcing every candidate character.Even better if the target uses a passphrase, \"hXXXse battXXX stXXXXX cXXXXXX\" becomes interpretable given a few landmark letter identified with high probability. reply zaxomi Sovjet listened successfully to typewrites back in the 1970s. reply mejutoco Impressive.

I never got past a few days worth of work, but open-sourcing it has been on my mind for a minute. This post kicked me into action. Getting some more data, basic CNN examples, etc. could provide a nice starting point for a lot of research and tools.There is still separate code I&#x27;d have to find and make intelligible to create the recordings and split the audio.Anyway, in case anyone finds part of this process interesting or useful. reply hoosieree 1Using an image classifier on spectrograms is pretty funny.

I can&#x27;t imagine any other proper solution. reply antegamisou This is hardly a new concept btw.In 2005 ACM&#x27;s CCS Zhuang, Zhou and Tygar presented Keyboard Acoustic Emanations Revisited [1] We examine the problem of keyboard acoustic emanations. We present a novel attack taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters. There is no need for a labeled training recording. Moreover the recognizer bootstrapped this way can even recognize random text such as passwords: In our experiments, 90% of 5-character random passwords using only letters can be generated in fewer than 20 attempts by an adversary; 80% of 10- character passwords can be generated in fewer than 75 attempts. Our attack uses the statistical constraints of the underlying content, English language, to reconstruct text from sound recordings without any labeled training data. The attack uses a combination of standard machine learning and speech recognition techniques, including cepstrum features, Hidden Markov Models, linear classification, and feedback-based incremental learningwhich builds up on Asonov & Agrawal&#x27;s work [2] who came up with the idea the previous year (2004). We show that PC keyboards, notebook keyboards, telephone and ATM pads are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys. Our attack employs a neural network to recognize the key being pressed. We also investigate why different keys produce different sounds and provide hints for the design of homophonic keyboards that would be resistant to this type of attack.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;1609956.1609959[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;1301311 reply 6510 maybe...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2014&#x2F;algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vib... reply thedookmaster 1I don&#x27;t use the qwerty layout, I use colemak.

Have a TRNG or a CSPRNG (if too poor for a TRNG) choose the next layout at random for you, ideally with every keystroke. Good luck cracking that! reply segfaultbuserr 1Some places use touchscreen keypads for PIN entry exactly for this reason: to allow randomization, e.g. for opening a locked door, or for authorizing a transaction. reply bee_rider 1That is interesting.I’m sure it depends on the application to some extent. I can type my pin in without looking at all, so I can cover it up while doing it. If I had to hunt and peck, it’d easier for an onlooker to observe my slower motions I think.But if I used the same machine often enough to produce wear specific to me, this randomization would be really useful. reply zootboy I use a randomized PIN pad on my phone, and I&#x27;ve gotten quite used to it.

Auto (the default) is designed to filter out keystrokes along with other noises, precisely because typing on the laptop is horrible for the reason you mention.Keystrokes should only be a problem when noise suppression is set to low&#x2F;off, which you want to do for e.g. playing music.But noise suppression is applied to sending audio, not receiving it. So you might need to tell your coworkers to re-enable their noise suppression. reply bee_rider 1In this case the parent comment is considering Zoom as an ally, while you are considering it an adversary.So, in case that “what” was intended to denote some confusion, there is the most likely source. reply woadwarrior01 1If you’re on macOS, you can use the voice isolation mic mode. reply transportgo 1I think about this attack when streamers on Twitch logs into websites etc. reply nmeagent 1I think an attacker would find that many streamers with high quality audio have properly setup their mics with noise gate filters to remove their relatively quiet keystrokes. reply sandworm101 Encrypted keyboards.

And if a sufficiently paranoid person is aware of this attack vector, they could just manually mute the mic at any time they are typing in any sensitive information. I initially was thinking that using a Dvorak or even better custom layout would help, but upon further reflection I think not -- the first-pass output would be equivalent to a substitution cipher, and quickly solved as such.This topic has me wondering though if it&#x27;s possible to detect finger positioning or for that matter screen information from the reflection off the typist&#x27;s eyeballs&#x2F;eyeglasses shown in a webcam, or perhaps even if possible in principle, in practice most webcam resolution is simply too poor for that. reply devsda 1Some systems have a setting to disable touchpad for x milliseconds after a key press.Do we need something similar for microphones too? reply eimrine Users will do anything and everything for not getting rid of using FOSS which doesn&#x27;t spy against a user by definition. reply whoopdedo 1If this means the end of those loud mechanical keyboards then good.

    "originBody": "Skip to Content Blog Team Introducing MK-1 Aug 1 Do you ever wonder how companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google serve their large language models economically? For instance, they are able to generate dozens of tokens per second for each user while keeping the costs to a fraction of a penny per request. While these feats of engineering are proprietary, you can be sure that they employ every technique available to optimize their inference stack. Enter MK-1. Our mission is to give every company running AI models similar (or better) capabilities as these elite AI powerhouses. We're obsessed with performance and efficiency, and have developed our own tools that rival anything out there. Today, we’re announcing our first product, MKML. MKML is an inference runtime that can reduce LLM inference costs on GPUs by 2x with just a few lines of Python code. And it is plug and play with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch. For a quick demo, here’s a Llama-2 7B running over twice as fast with MKML compared to the baseline model (FP16) on an RTX 4090 GPU. Video is not available or format is not supported. Try a different browser. Currently, MKML is in closed beta release. If you are interested in becoming an early partner and getting access to new features first, please contact us below. How can MKML help? Suppose you want to run a chatbot on the cloud using a Llama-2 13B model. Despite being one of the smaller Llama models, it requires 26GB (FP16) of memory – just for the parameters! This has two implications: Loading the model requires a GPU instance with enough memory, such as a pricey A100 40GB. Running the model requires reading all 26GB from GPU memory for each forward pass, and this can impact the speed of token generation. The key observation is that the model’s large memory footprint is the critical bottleneck. MKML solves this: we have a one-time procedure that shrinks its size by ~60% while keeping a very high fidelity to the original model, which we will explain later in this post. So the 13B model shrinks from 26GB all the way down to 10.5GB. And crucially, MKML reduces the inference time for the forward pass by up to 2.3x compared to the base model on the same GPU, and these gains are multiplicative with system-level optimizations like continuous batching. Let’s explore two scenarios of how you might leverage MKML to optimize a Llama-2 13B chatbot. Case 1: Cost optimized With our compression, the Llama-2 13B model now fits on a single A10 24GB instance, which is ~45% less expensive than the A100. And incredibly, despite the A10 being less powerful than the A100 in terms of compute and memory bandwidth, MKML token generation on the A10 is still faster than the baseline model on the A100. Case 2: Speed optimized If the budget allows for the A100 instance, MKML’s performance really starts to shine. In this case, MKML is ~2.0x faster than the baseline, which translates to serving more users. In addition, the memory saved on the A100 from the smaller model can be used to support larger context windows across users. In summary, there are multiple ways MKML can help an engineer optimize their inference stack depending on their use case. In this example we picked a Llama-2 model, but MKML will work out of the box with other popular language models such as Falcon, MPT and GPT-J. MKML is Easy to Integrate Our approach with MKML is to bring production-level performance to the most flexible and widely used ecosystems out there. Here is an example workflow using Hugging Face. Model Compression: First, we load in an original Hugging Face model, and compress it using one of our MKML model codecs. Here we chose our MK600 codec, which shrinks the model’s size by ~60%. The compressed model is then saved to disk so it can be later loaded for inference. It's important to note that model compression is a one-time process and only needs to be repeated if the weights change, say from fine-tuning. It usually takes under a minute for a 7B parameter model. from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM import mkml model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16) model = mkml.compress(model, codec=\"mk600\") mkml.save(model, output_path) Model Inference: Next, we load our model using MKML and use it immediately for inference. You can interact with it the same way you would the Hugging Face model, so it is plug and play with all your normal workflows. The main difference is that it now takes less memory and is more performant 🤗🔥. # Only change required: Load model with mkml instead of Hugging Face # from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM # model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(args.model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16) import mkml model = mkml.load(model_path, device=device) # ------------------------------------------------------ # Code from this point on is the same as usual from transformers import AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path) prompt = \"What are some differences between a llama and an alpaca?\" input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.cuda() tokens = model.generate(input_ids) response = tokenizer.decode(tokens[0, input_ids.shape[1]:]) Benchmarks MKML supports a wide range of model sizes and system configurations. We benchmarked the speed for Llama-2 7B and 13B for different batch sizes and GPUs, and MKML is consistently faster than baseline on a coldstart speed test. Specifically, coldstart measures the rate of token generation during auto-regression, and is a key metric for estimating model latency and throughput. In this test, we generate 128 tokens starting from a single token prompt. mk600 FP16 4090, batch=32 A100, batch=32 A10, batch=32 4090, batch=16 A100, batch=16 A10, batch=16 4090, batch=1 A100, batch=1 A10, batch=1 2800 2100 1400 700 0 Llama-2-7B: mk600 vs FP16 tokens/s over batch size, coldstart-128 Download SVG Download PNG Download CSV Note that for the Llama-2 13B, some baseline FP16 models do not even fit on certain GPUs at all due to their large memory footprint. However, MKML models do run on these GPUs and we report these numbers accordingly. mk600 FP16 4090, batch=32 A100, batch=32 A10, batch=32 4090, batch=16 A100, batch=16 A10, batch=16 4090, batch=1 A100, batch=1 A10, batch=1 1600 1200 800 400 0 Llama-2-13B: mk600 vs FP16 tokens/s over batch size, coldstart-128 Download SVG Download PNG Download CSV We also benchmarked model fidelity using a standard perplexity measure for all the different Llama-2 models. The takeaway is that our compressed model is around 0.01 difference from the baseline model, which for all intents and purposes is a negligible difference. Stay tuned for a more detailed analysis on model fidelity where we will introduce our other model codecs with different compression ratios. Perplexity (wikitext2) Llama-2-7B Llama-2-13B Llama-2-70B FP16 5.472 4.884 3.319 mk600 5.485 4.887 3.324 What’s next for MK-1? Currently, we believe that MKML offers the best balance between model fidelity, memory footprint and speed with the added benefit of being easy to use. We are just getting started. Our long-term vision is to push the performance of AI to the very limits of what’s physically possible across the entire inference stack. We have an ambitious roadmap that we are excited to share as we make progress. If you are interested in keeping up to date with our journey please sign up below.

I normally try to give benefit of the doubt, but there&#x27;s really no way they&#x27;re not aware that there are already widely used techniques for accomplishing this same thing, so the comparison benchmarks really should be there.To fill in the gap, here&#x27;s llama.cpp&#x27;s comparison chart[0] for the different quantizations available for Llama 1. We can&#x27;t compare directly with their Llama 2 metrics, but just comparing the percent change in speed and perplexity, MK-1 looks very similar to Q5_1. There&#x27;s a small but not insignificant hit to perplexity, and a just over 2x speedup.If these numbers are accurate, you can download pre-quantized Llama 2 models from Hugging Face that will perform essentially the same as what MK-1 is offering, with the Q5 files here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;TheBloke&#x2F;Llama-2-13B-GGML&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp#quantization reply andy_xor_andrew Also, using the word \"codecs\" kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re trying to sound like they invented an entirely new paradigm, with their own fancy name that reminds people of video compression. reply nabakin I&#x27;d go so far as to say this entire post is grossly misleading and should be flagged. reply throwanem Sure. How else are they supposed to sell it? reply paul_mk1 Hi, one of the founders here.Attempting to address some of the comments in a single message.To help understand why we decided not to compare to existing methods: I think it would be difficult to do so fairly, since there are many tradeoffs and different use cases. It&#x27;s not always the case that one technique is bad and the other is good, it&#x27;s more about the targeted design point (say, cloud vs local). We are openly offering our numbers &#x2F; benchmarks and looking for early partners that are aligned with our current value proposition (hence the closed beta).A good example is that llama.cpp is a fantastic framework to run models locally for the single-user case (batch=1). While llama.cpp supports different backends (RPi, CPU, GPU), I don&#x27;t think it would be particularly fair to compare and show that MKML is better at a given perplexity, compression ratio, and speed on GPU for a multi-user case (batch >> 1), when that is not llama.cpp’s targeted use case (afaik). For example MKML achieves ~2700 tok&#x2F;sec at batch 32 (i.e. 32 prompts in parallel) on a 4090 for a Llama-2 7B, with a ~4̶.̶2̶G̶B 5.2GB memory footprint, and perplexity that is ~fp16.Also, we&#x27;re not currently wrapping any open source tools or techniques for quantization. Everything is our own and there’s more news to come soon.If anyone has specific technical questions I&#x27;d be happy to answer as best I can.Cheers, Paul Merolla reply lolinder > A good example is that llama.cpp is a fantastic framework to run models locally for the single-user case (batch=1).

As I understood it, MKML is a compression step that then feeds into another framework like HF&#x27;s Transformers or PyTorch. If that&#x27;s the case, then comparing MKML to llama.cpp is apples to oranges—the correct comparison would be to GGML and the various quantization methods. The inference engine and its intended use cases aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s in question here.If a model compressed with MKML outperforms a standard quantized model in a batch setting, that&#x27;s useful information! It would not be at all unfair for you to cite that as a strength, and it would increase your credibility because you wouldn&#x27;t seem to be dodging the question of how you compare to your substitutes. reply paul_mk1 Appreciate your response.We compared MKML mk600 (5.2GB) against llama.cpp Q5_1 (4.7GB) and Q6_k (5.1GB) on a 4090 for llama-7B. The test is the same in all cases: we generate 128 tokens from a single token prompt (batch=1) and measure performance of the forward pass during auto-regression.(llama-7B, single prompt, batch=1)MKML mk600: 125t&#x2F;sLlama.cpp Q5_1: 84 t&#x2F;sLlama.cpp Q6_k: 78 t&#x2F;sOur llama.cpp test: Build (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp#cublas):make -j12 LLAMA_CUBLAS=1Run:.&#x2F;main -t 16 -ngl 32 -m llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q6_K.bin -p \"?\" -n 128Please feel free to post your llama.cpp results if they are different.>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding MKML. As I understood it, MKML is a compression step that then feeds into another framework like HF&#x27;s Transformers or PyTorch.MKML is not a compression tool that feeds into another framework. It is an inference runtime (like FasterTransformers or vllm) except that MKML is also plug and play with existing frameworks like Hugging Face. reply az226 Agreed. This apples-to-apples comparison being obviously missing here is quite telling. reply polishgladiator > [...] llama.cpp is a fantastic framework to run models locally for the single-user case (batch=1) > [...] I don&#x27;t think it would be particularly fair to compare and show that MKML is better at a given perplexity, compression ratio, and speed on GPU for a multi-user case (batch >> 1)Ok so you agree that llama.cpp etc are great for batch==1, right?And I agree their targeted use case is not batch==32 (because who is doing that really?)But if we extended llama.cpp or some other faster batch==1 implementation to support batch==32, why do you suppose it wouldn&#x27;t still be faster than MKML? It seems to me that if you can do batch==1 faster, you could easily do batch>>1 faster too -- it is just that no one really needed that (yet?) reply polishgladiator > If anyone has specific technical questions I&#x27;d be happy to answer as best I can.What is the context size for these measurements? Is it the full 4k for llama-2? And just to be clear, when you say memory footprint, this is the entire memory foorprint right? Weights, 4k KV cache etc?And more generally, I&#x27;m curious about the use case for running puny models like Llama-2 7B in the cloud on desktops GPUs (like 4090) with batch==32? reply polishgladiator I&#x27;ve been doing some hacking with Llama2 on an AMD 7900 XTX this weekend, using llama.cpp and q5_k_s quantization.Compared to MK600 on an RTX 4090 in their data, I am measuring higher throughput and lower perplexity (again, note that I am using a cheaper GPU!)... reply kapildev MKML says that they reduced the size of Llama2-13B model from 26GB to 10.5GB. Similar offering from TheBloke (your first link) is a 10.7GB Q6_K model. Maybe, they are using GGML and llama.cpp and packaging it in an attractive way while making people believe it is some proprietary tech. reply polishgladiator Based on the integration examples, I don&#x27;t think they are simply repackaging llama.cppRather it looks like they are reimplementing their own quantization scheme, in such a way that it is a little easier to integrate for basic python users, at the cost of performance (compared to llama.cpp and others).Given that the bar for integrating something with higher perf like llama.cpp isn&#x27;t very high (and that&#x27;s the way the world is heading -- ask any 15 year old interested in this stuff), I can&#x27;t see anything of value here. reply moffkalast Q5_1 is already old news too, K quants are faster and more space efficient for the same perplexity loss.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LocalLLaMA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;142q5k5&#x2F;updated... reply lolinder For sure, but I couldn&#x27;t find numbers for the K quants that included inference speeds, so I settled on the older one. If MK-1 were trying to be honest they&#x27;d definitely want to benchmark against the newest methods! reply xianshou Not a single mention of existing quantization techniques? Ten bucks says this is just a wrapper around bitsandbytes or ggml. reply lyapunova I don&#x27;t think I can use this if it&#x27;s not open source... sorry.The field moves too fast and the convenience is just not there otherwise.edit: also the branding makes me think of MK-ultra which is probably something to avoid reply Scene_Cast2 I&#x27;ve worked on ML model quantization. The open source 4-bit or 8-bit quantization isn&#x27;t as good as one can get - there are much fancier techniques to keep predictive performance while squeezing size.Some techniques (like quantization-aware training) involve changes to training. reply lolinder I&#x27;m sure there are better methods! But in this case, MKML&#x27;s numbers just don&#x27;t look impressive when placed alongside the prominent quantization techniques already in use. According to this chart [0] it&#x27;s most similar in size to a Q6_K quantization, and if anything has slightly worse perplexity.If their technique were better, I imagine that the company would acknowledge the existence of the open source techniques and show them in their comparisons, instead of pretending the only other option is the raw fp16 model.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LocalLLaMA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;142q5k5&#x2F;updated... reply Scene_Cast2 From what I remember, non-power-of-2 compression schemes tank inference speed (assuming Q6_k is 6-bit; I haven&#x27;t actually verified if ggml q6_K llama is slow). Meanwhile, the site claims a speed-up.But I do actually agree with you - they should really be benchmarking against popular competitors. In my experience, fancier quantization is a _lot_ of work for fairly little gain (at least for neural nets). I also think that ML techniques such as quantization (or fancy param sweeps, feature pruning, that kind of stuff) tend to either get in-housed (i.e. the model will come quantized from the source) or get open-sourced.In-housing of ML techniques tends to happen more often if there&#x27;s a money-making model where the hardware running the model costs money, but running the model brings in money. reply KRAKRISMOTT What about Unum&#x27;s quantization methods?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unum-cloud&#x2F;usearch reply Scene_Cast2 Not familiar with Unum. From a quick glance, it seems that they truncate Least Significant Bits, which is the simplest but fastest quantization method. reply Philpax 1...isn&#x27;t this just quantization? reply amelius If you look at the demo video, the output is exactly the same for both cases, so I doubt it uses quantization. reply atlas_hugged Exactly what I was thinking. Everyone already does this. Unless they’re doing something else, they’ll have to show why it’s better than just quickly quantizing to 8 bits or 4 bits or whatever. reply bhouston 1Whatever it is, it will likely be copied into the open source tooling like llama.cop soonish or something similar will arrive in llama.cpp. It doesn’t seem defensive advantage. It seems like a feature and fighting against fast moving open source alternatives. reply metadat Too bad it&#x27;s not an open source effort.I&#x27;m not a fan of proprietary dependencies in my stack, full stop. reply lolinder I seriously doubt this will go anywhere. The open source community has already achieved basically the same performance improvements via quantization. This feels like someone has repackaged those libraries and is going to try to sell them to unwary and uninformed AI startups. reply modeless How does this compare to mlc-llm with 4 bit quantization? It runs llama2 13B incredibly fast on my 4090. Multiples of the speed of llama.cpp even on GPU with the same 4 bit quantization. reply brucethemoose2 Yeah, that TVM Vulkan autotuning is incredible. And its not even using the matmul Vulkan extension, I dont think.MLC&#x27;s 4 bit quantization is \"dumb\" compared to llama.cpp, which reduces perplexity (and also explains some of the speed difference), but the biggest missing feature is CPU offloading (which would allow you to run 70B reasonably well on a 4090).I think the holy grail of local llm inference is llama 70B, run in TVM, split between the GPU and IGP. It feels like we are inches away... All the pieces are there, but there are no front end devs connecting those dots. reply modeless Wow, using the IGP for the parts that don&#x27;t fit on the discrete GPU is a great idea. reply brucethemoose2 Yeah. It might be possible in llama.cpp soon, but the vulkan implementation may or may not be fast on the IGP. reply radicaldreamer You can do this stuff on a MacBook Pro these days... not sure why you&#x27;d want to be locked into another vendor here. Either use the best (OpenAI, Anthropic) or just roll your own. reply hardwaresofton Is this the true effect of Ultra Instinct^H^H Llama2?Facebook is effectively supercharging the ecosystems and tool builders and smaller inference services.This company had access to a credible, popular model (with an actual OSS license), and the relevant weights so they could optimize on it and sell the optimization without worrying about the license&#x2F;restrictions on the weights themselves. reply ipsum2 Isn&#x27;t FasterTransformer (NVidia, OSS) and text-generation-inference (Huggingface, not OSS) are faster than this? reply rvz Another AI startup grift, using GGML and closing it up to beg for VC cash.Yet another AI wrapper company doing the same thing and jumping on the LLM hype train before it dries up.If it is not open source and it is closed, it is immediately dead in the water. reply ushakov This seems more like a VC Pitchdeck rather than a technical paper explaining why their approach is better reply drtournier MKML == abstractions and wrappers for GGML? reply pestatije 1> Today, we’re announcing our first product, MKML.

Bram Moolenaar was Vim's creator/maintainer/benevolent-dictator for life. Early this morning his family shared sad news on the Vim-announce Google Group. \"It is with a heavy heart that we have to inform you that Bram Moolenaar passed away on 3 August 2023.\" Moolenaar was 62 years old, and died from \"a medical condition that progressed quickly over the last few weeks.\" \"Bram dedicated a large part of his life to VIM and he was very proud of the VIM community that you are all part of.\" Anyone who's used Vim has seen evidence of Moolenaar's generosity. \"Vim is Charityware,\" Moolenaar wrote in its pioneering license. \"You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.\" Moolenaar pioneered the concept of charityware decades ago, and also helped to popularize its adoption. To this day Vim users can still view the license by typing the command :help Uganda or :help ICCF. And Vim's sponsor FAQ notes that \"Each registered Vim user and sponsor who donates at least 10 euro will be able to vote for new features.\" Moolenaar's personal web site also includes photos from his travels around the world, and YouTube has some videos of talks and interviews with Moolenaar. He was still committing changes to Vim up until a month ago. In the comments below long-time Slashdot reader bads shares a link to a post from long-time Vim contributor Christian Brabandt : Bram was a great leader to the Vim community and I really enjoyed working with him over the past years, since I became involved with the development of Vim almost 20 years ago. Bram was of great inspiration in creating a great community, helping people with his charity and he was a great mentor. And now he left too soon. We lost a great leader and I regret never having met him in person. However to all of the community: I will continue and I hope all of the other contributors will also keep up the good work. I do have access to the Vim homepage and the Vim organization (not sure if all the rights, but I am sure we will work on the details in the near future...) I hope together we will be able to continue successfully. ← You may like to read: → NASA Finally Restores Communication with Voyager 2 After Two Weeks Nord Stream Rupture May Mark Biggest Single Methane Release Ever Recorded, UN Says Queen Elizabeth II Has Died - Ruled for Nearly 7 Decades; World's Longest-Reigning Monarch Era of Global Boiling Has Arrived, UN Chief Says The Climate Issue Government Leaders Aren't Addressing: Livestock Farming Biden is Canceling Up To $10K in Student Loans, $20K For Pell Grant Recipients Scientists in Japan Develop Experimental Alzheimer's Vaccine Showing Promise in Mice Sponsored Content ?

In the Middle Ages people invented a rather neat solution for this problem: go live together in a big building, work together, pray together, cook together and call it a monastery. reply vladvasiliu 5 How so? As a single person, one of my best purchases was an instant-pot type appliance (not the actual one, but one probably inspired by it, with less control over the temperature and especially the pressure release).In less than one hour from start to finish, I can chop the vegetables, cook, clean the kitchen utensils while cooking, move the finished food into a big container for storage (or one per serving if you have a big fridge and enough containers) and clean the cooker. The longest part of all this is waiting for the food to cool down before putting it in the fridge. With the size of my cooker, I could prepare enough food to eat 5 to 7 times. The longest recipe I know has me cook dry beans for half an hour, and cook rice afterward. This could probably be improved by pre-soaking the beans.Except when I fail for some reason, which is extremely rare, the food is incomparably better tasting and healthier, and also quite cheaper, than whatever I can get when at work outside of restaurants (which is even pricier, and not necessarily healthier). This allows me to avoid all the mystery sauces they put in, probably laden with vegetable oils and sugar, that make me hungry two hours later. reply Ekaros 54 Then guilt trip others to donate to you money and their inheritance and end up filthy rich... Still doing the same...Kinda weird end result... Who did profit anyway, apart from upper management. reply random_upvoter 50 Sure such systems tend to end up getting corrupt if they amass too much power. That was not my point. I guess my point was that given the bleak state of today&#x27;s social landscape, I wonder if there&#x27;s opportunity for some kind of renaissance of communal living, in one form or another. And maybe these monasteries didn&#x27;t only exist because of fervent religiosity but also as a practical way for single men and women to have a better life. reply hutzlibu 24 \"I wonder if there&#x27;s opportunity for some kind of renaissance of communal living, in one form or another.\"Sure and it is happening since a while, take a look here for example:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.org&#x2F;So far most of the projects are rather in dreamland than in reality, but some are well established and working.edit: you will also find actual monasterys there if that is your thing reply gcr 37 You might be confusing \"monastery\" with \"church.\"EDIT: damn, I stand corrected! reply caskstrength 30 \"An English medieval proverb said that if the abbot of Glastonbury married the abbess of Shaftesbury, their heir would have more land than the king of England.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dissolution_of_the_monasteries reply Ekaros 34 Not really, quite many monasteries themselves ended up very wealthy. Though they could have acted as proxies by churches. But did not mean they did not hold land what was the wealth back then. And did not have to divide it as inheritance had to. reply rewmie 26 > You might be confusing \"monastery\" with \"church.\"Many religions besides the catholicism have monasteries, and exploit the same social loophole. Countless Buddhist monasteries also operate as a spa hotel of sorts. reply gorgoiler Fantastic, I adore it!In a weird way, this also serves as a training manual for becoming a good cook. Take plain ramen and understand its cooking process through different methods. Now build a sense of how to flavor and season food by adding additional ingredients. What is a potato and how do you cook it? Solid, back to basics stuff.At the other end of the spectrum is an absolute classic of the genre, Slater’s Real Fast Food:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nigelslater.com&#x2F;real-fast-food_bk_25It’s a bit more omnivore forward — lamb chops grilled in yogurt is a favourite — and comes from a time when these books were aimed more at young Islington professionals rather than Amazon drivers. reply coolvision My food for when I can&#x27;t be bothered is pasta with canned pesto sauce (+optional parmesan).

What&#x27;s yours go-to recipes? reply qubyte 28 Do some rice in a rice cooker. When that’s done, slap a good helping of kimchi in a hot frying pan (no need for oil). Let it sizzle for about thirty seconds, then crack an egg in and muddle it up some. When it’s nearly done add the rice. Add a bit of sesame oil at the end if you feel fancy. Eat.I got through a kilo of kimchi a week this way when I was a depressed 20-something living in a share-house abroad. reply Saturn5 Tray bake: just throw any potatoes, veggies and meat (replacement) in a single layer on a baking sheet with some oil, and spices and put it in the oven until it’s done. Maybe toss it around halfway through.For meat we use anything from chopped-up Italian sausage, bacon strips, chick peas, chicken wings to an entire chicken.Veggie wise anything from classic roasting veggies like carrot, oignon and pumpkin to broccoli, beans, zucchini…Spice the laziest is just dried rosemary. But I also like some southern spicy bbq rubs, plain garam massala. Or just plenty of garlic.It has become much easier since we have a “proper” oven instead of a cheap countertop one, as it is much faster and heats up more easily. reply chromanoid Yeah, this even works well when you cook for a family.If you have pasta left from the day before and don&#x27;t mind sweet dishes you can fry the pasta with some butter and eggs (scramble with the pasta) in a pan and add some sugar. Pretty sating meal...In a late hour after work delirium I like to eat air fried pre-seasoned chicken or turkey breast with toasted gray bread and arugula with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The latter usually only when I have the energy left or there is some already clean in the fridge... Is of course only for lazy people when you have an air fryer. The 15 min of waiting are enough time to toast the bread and to put the salad into a bowl and season it. In Germany you can buy cheap organic pre-seasoned poultry in most supermarkets... reply maccard 46 We meal plan every week, but when I&#x27;m feeling less bothered I lean on a few dishes.

Beans make a good protein.Fast, cheap, easy. Nutritionally complete-ish. reply sureglymop You can also make cheese pepper pasta easily. Make pasta, leave some pasta water and add pecorino cheese (shredded), then some pepper. Easy and good so you don&#x27;t always have to use canned sauce. Another (easiest) option is to just add cold pesto to the pasta. reply zeusk cacio e pepe; easily the best pasta dish vs effort imo. reply ShellfishMeme 50 I love cacio e pepe. It&#x27;s such an amazing dish for how simple it is.One thing that can be tricky is keeping the emulsion smooth and not suddenly have the cheese turn chunky. What I&#x27;ve found very useful there is to put aside some of the pasta cooking water and then blend it up with the cheese on the side using an immersion blender. When you reach a good level of creaminess, you pour it back into the pot with the now drained pasta and use the residual heat of the pot and pasta to slightly reduce it down to the perfect level while constantly stirring.This should make the whole process a lot more reliable while not changing the flavor by adding more complex ingredients. reply dubeye Sounds more like a treat than a daily meal. canned pesto sauce more often than not, (but not always) has lots of salts, sugars and fats. reply alpaca128 23 You can call it whatever you want, if it&#x27;s the only thing quick and tasty enough to motivate one to eat at all that can be good enough.

E.g. one pot, frying pan, etc. all the way up to, well a normal kitchen. reply Savely As a student myself I’d appreciate all those recipe sites to have a filter by appliances. Seems half of recipes involving meat requires a stove I don’t have. reply denkmoon https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NutriChef-Portable-Induction-Cooktop-...Perhaps a single burner induction cooktop is in your budget, which you can use to brown&#x2F;fry meat. reply SapporoChris Thank you for posting this. It made me realize that with this very portable device I can eliminate a stove from dwelling requirements. reply cinntaile A lot of dishes would require more than one of these, at which point you might as well get an actual stove. reply Eisenstein With an Instant Pot, an induction burner, and a toaster oven you can make anything that would require a normal kitchen, just in smaller portions (as in, you aren&#x27;t cooking a whole turkey or a giant casserole). reply TeMPOraL 40 On that note, I&#x27;ve been wondering about the recent hype about \"air fryers\", which - best I can tell, after looking into it repeatedly - are basically countertop, underpowered version of fan ovens that have been, in my life, a standard appliance in every kitchen I&#x27;ve ever seen. But maybe it&#x27;s a sign of worsening economical prospects of the generation - people no longer own, only rent, increasingly worse quality apartments, so a basic kitchen with a fridge, a stove, an oven and maybe dishwasher and microwave, are things people no longer can rely on, or expect to have? reply Eisenstein 6 Maybe having modular devices that can do things as necessary and then be stowed are more practical than having large appliances bolted into counters taking space? I think that it is impractical for everyone in the world to have as much space as we currently think we need. We can get along just fine with smaller living spaces -- it is not a sign of poverty to be efficient. Scoundreller Yeah, my “dream” kitchen that I’ll never have would have those instead of a range. And maybe a big slow cooker that could do a turkey.Edit: oh yeah, add an air fryer and bread machine. And kettle obvs. Preheats water for a pasta pot faster than the stove. Immersion >> conduction heating.The amount spent on a range buys a lot of gadgets. Not even wiring one up saves a circuit and dedicated run.I couldn’t live without a dishwasher though… reply Eisenstein How many people are you cooking for? I find that a dishwasher when only used for one or two people is more of a nuisance than washing dishes as they are used, mostly because you have to basically use all of your dishes before running it. reply Scoundreller Usually two, but I usually rinse plates if they have something that I know cakes on.When I empty it, I’ll let anything that needs another run in for the next run.Don’t need to run it every night. reply SergeAx 38 You cannot achieve a dishwasher quality with your hands only. Partially because of the temperature, partially because of chemicals. I will never even try to wash wine glasses by hands. replyx3m157 53 If you can get one of those countertop convention ovens (typically marketed as an air fryer&#x2F;toaster oven combo) you can do quite a bit of what an oven&#x2F;range can do. I use mine more than my actual oven now, and with some creativity I could probably use it almost entirely if I didn&#x27;t have a range. reply doctor_eval Just want to second this. My family of four have been waiting for more than a year for our new kitchen (long and boring story) and we’ve managed fine after buying two of these to get by. And we enjoy cooking.So if you’re just starting out this is a great buy. A full size stove will have a larger element and better heat control but you won’t notice. And they are way better than a gas camp stove. reply amluto 23 If you upgrade to a Breville Control Freak (not cheap, but cheaper than your new kitchen) and you get used to it (it require recalibrating your concept of how to use a stove a bit), you might find that you never use your new stove in your new kitchen.The Control Freak has:Better heat control. (That’s the entire point. It smokes essentially everything else in the market.)Painless preheating. Put on your pan, turn it on and set a temp, and go back ingredients. Done. (Warning: it can substantially overshoot with cast iron, so be a bit careful.)Element size: it seems to produce more even heat on a 12” or even 14” pan than most gas ranges, even fancy ones. And you can use it with cheaper pans that have thick bottoms and thin sides without burning everything on the side. Your gas burner won’t be able to do this.Did I mention the heat control? You can cook pancakes without messing up the first batch (350F). You can do soft scrambled eggs pretty easily (240F or so and turn it off a bit before they look done). You can make chai easily (211F or so, then reduce to 185F before adding milk, then wait at least 20 min if not much longer). Perfect golden onions: 300F or so and stir occasionally — they won’t burn. Perfect chopped garlic: 230F or even cooler and be patient, although this is a matter of taste.Caution: the numbers are a bit different with different pans.It even doubles as a pretty good deep fryer if you’re careful.It caused me to change my opinion of cast iron skillets a bit: the high thermal may actually mostly be a crutch that compensates a bit for the lack of closed loop control in most stores. Once you have closed-loop control, I suspect what you actually want is just enough thermal mass to get good control performance combined with enough thermal conductivity to maintain a decent temperature under inhomogeneous loads (pancakes, onions, etc) while those loads are busily sinking heat from the parts of the pan they’re on. Cast iron has under half the thermal conductivity of aluminum. reply defrost Who needs a stove?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lvVplicKlrc?t=185 reply bbarnett My perspnal hotel&#x2F;dorm microwave+toaster grilled cheese sandwich.Toast bread in toaster first, well toasted. Put cheese slices on toast and nuke until it melts.The result is not mushy, due to the bread already being warm, and the minimal time in the microwave. reply plufz Or the sad microwave cooking https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TTp1iWAHHko reply erik_seaberg I&#x27;m reminded of Dave Barry explaining a more advanced recipe as using two pots or pans, two \"units of food\", two stoves... reply carabiner Chatgpt is REALLY good at coming up with reasonable recipes under arbitrary constraints. You have X ingredients and Y minutes to cook a meal for Z persons, with ABC cookware. It&#x27;ll do it. reply tcmb 42 I just canceled my HelloFresh subscription, because the meals took too long to make, occasionally some ingredients were missing or wrong, I had no space to store all the ingredients that were delivered, and I hated the amount of cleanup I had to do afterwards. This cookbook is exactly what I need. reply ulnarkressty 11 Just get an instant pot, it&#x27;s an incredibly versatile kitchen gadget, even without the pressure cooking. You can make all sort of bean, rice, wheat etc. dishes. Add whatever condiments and frozen veggies you can find and leave it alone for half an hour. Do it once for the whole week.Once you master the stews and want to get fancy, you can make stock from meat and vegetable left overs, it beats the store bought flavor enhancers by a mile. reply ehPReth I wish I could just take one pill a day (or three) for nutrition (and satiating hunger) and not have to eat meals at all. That would be amazing, not to have to deal with food. Buying, preparing, ordering, over eating. reply floitsch 43 As others already mentioned, there are lots of shakes for that.I have tried the following (mostly European):- Soylent: the original (first). Ok, but not my favorite.- Mana: I like their powder version (more than the drinks). Especially good with some bread sticks.- Bertrand.bio: tastes very much like cereals. Pretty good.- Jake food: one of my friend&#x27;s favorite. I prefer others. reply rrgok 6 Do you have any suggestion for cheap shipping in Switzerland? Damn, that Mana try bottle cost 3.99 Euro but shipping costs 65Euro? reply cheschire 26 If you’re concerned at all about quality of ingredients, also consider Huel. It’s available in Europe and the US. reply maerF0x0 14 What makes you believe the ingredients are better? What&#x27;s the benefit of Huel over, say, Soylent? reply snthpy Have you ever tried not eating at all?Fasting is actually easier than you think once you get over the initial hunger humps.Obviously seek proper medical advice first but just to point out that it&#x27;s possible and I&#x27;ve personally done up to five day fasts while still working and going to gym as normal. reply thih9 (trigger warning: eating problems) For me, when I have trouble cooking, and especially when I don&#x27;t cook because of an overwhelming lack of energy, fasting is actually the problem. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s what I do by default, it&#x27;s the easiest after all. It&#x27;s forcing yourself to make the effort to eat something that can be difficult. reply seer Hah strange that people are downvoting this answer, I think the parent referred to skipping a meal rather than not eating for the rest of (now short) life.I’ve been skipping a meal for 5 years now, with just having lunch and dinner, and for the last year have been trying to do only dinner some of the days with relative success. Benefits include staying fit, having more energy, having more time, enjoying the food I actually eat more, and being able to skip any meal any time without feeling too bad about it. reply riffraff perhaps people are wary of people who actually believed you could live on air and sun. Yes, people died because of this.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jasmuheen reply swarnie Not sure why this got such a negative reception, intermittent fasting has been shown to have multiple benefits.Its probably closer to what we spent generations evolving towards than the typical diet of shoving processed meats + Big Gulps in your face hole 19 hours a day. reply alpaca128 7 > Not sure why this got such a negative receptionBecause for people struggling to prepare meals getting used to fasting can be seriously dangerous. It doesn&#x27;t take long to learn ignoring hunger, add potential psychosomatic symptoms that mess with your weight and you&#x27;re in deep shit really fast. reply maerF0x0 44 I&#x27;m going to venture a guess is that the reason is it solves nothing, it simply batches the effort.You cannot fast forever. At some point you need to average your TDEE (lets say 2k calories). Intermittent fasting means you go from eating 2k calories in like 4 meals across ~16hrs to as few as 1 meal in 15 minutes (OMAD). I&#x27;d suggest the longest sustainable (ie, doesnt _eventually_ result in starvation) intermittent fast would be a 1:1 fast where you&#x27;re eating 4k calories on the day you eat.Saves a lot of ceremony, but you still have to eat the same amount of food. reply padjo Fasting for more than ~36 hours can be quite dangerous without medical supervision. Probably why it’s downvoted. reply maerF0x0 14 I&#x27;d like to see a source for that, my experience is you need to be pushing 4-5 days before it&#x27;s really risky. Let&#x27;s assume the individuals are intelligent enough to take in basic electrolytes. eg: There are mixes made for this purpose such as LMNThttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.outlookindia.com&#x2F;outlook-spotlight&#x2F;22-best-elect... reply bbarnett Its probably closer to what we spent generations evolving towards than the typical diet of shoving processed meats + Big Gulps in your face hole 19 hours a day.That&#x27;s kind of two extremes though, isn&#x27;t it? You fast, or eat crap?And people get all upset about eating animal fat in quantities equal to protein, but that&#x27;s what we did until the 70s. Then we stopped, and everyone ended up overweight.So I agree, traditional diets seem best, and maybe a fast or two. But if we fast, it should be in the late winter, and we should faten up in the late summer&#x2F;fall too, yes?That&#x27;s most inline with humans prior to cities&#x2F;agriculture.Then again, we have what... 20,000? 50,000? generations of humanity using animal husbandry, and farming, to change that cycle? reply brugidou Farming is about 10,000 years old so I would say more like 500 generations? reply wodenokoto There are quite a few companies that deals with this, usually in the form of a shake rather than a pill. I think Soylent was the name of one of the early entrants. reply ajmurmann Now I feel old. It feels like yesterday that everyone was talking about Soylent and its eccentric founder who ordered new shirts from China instead of washing the ones he had and tried to find a diet that allows you to not to have to use the bathroom. reply Scoundreller I think he was just trying to conserve as much water as possible. Cotton uses lots of water so he bought some synthetic overalls.He also took some antibiotics to minimize poop, which I wouldn’t recommend unless strictly necessary.It’s all here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200401135943&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;robrhineha... reply fbdab103 I am strangely intrigued by the bathroom avoidance. Did he find much success? Although, I seem to recall a correlation between low fiber&#x2F;defecation frequency and colon cancer, but not sure how strong the association was supposed to be. reply mst Most of those seem to be US based, but there&#x27;s a European company https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jimmyjoy.com as well. reply Daneel_ 29 Or qota.com.au if you’re in Australia. They used to be called Aussielent, but recently renamed. I’ve been using them for around 8 years quite happily. reply klohto There is like 50 different companies all over the world nowadays. It’s hardly a new thing. reply carabiner Soylent is sold in over 28,000 stores nationwide (US) today. reply Daneel_ If you’re in Australia then look up Qota. They used to be called Aussielent.Basically powdered meal - I’ve been eating it for about 8 years now. I get the vanilla and add just a little bit of honey, using warm&#x2F;hot water. It’s like smooth porridge.Meal dealt with in ~2mins. reply Ekaros A pill alone doesn&#x27;t work do to well just how much mass is needed for it to contain enough usable calories. You need to eat the same amount of calories to survive and these have non-trivial mass&#x2F;volume.Just one thing from Sci-Fa... Still there has been meal replacement products for a long time now. From diets to lifestyle changes. reply thegabriele 37 Yep, i would do it 5&#x2F;7 and having normal food as a ceremony the other two days.Still, don&#x27;t forget that chewing is important for your general health reply nsomaru 27 This has been my dream, inspired from watching the Jetsons when I was younger reply swader999 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.completefoods.co&#x2F; has exactly what you wish for in diy powder form. Or as others have mentioned, there&#x27;s a lot of products that try to do the same that you can buy directly. reply vacuumcl One pill a day perhaps not, but you can definitely sustain yourself on meal replacement products like the ones from Soylent or Huel. I get about 1&#x2F;3rd my calories from those and it saves a lot of time. reply SergeAx 36 You will miss a lot of sensory sensations with that. You may treat your body as a brain-riding bipedal machine, but it is not a healthy approach. reply alpaca128 3 It&#x27;s more healthy than not treating your body at all. reply Daneel_ 30 I don’t eat for sensation though. I don’t crave it or need it. I can happily eat the same thing every day and not care.For some people that’s insanity, and for others that’s normal.I just don’t care about food, I see it as a waste of time and effort. The less time spent preparing, eating and cleaning up the better.I understand that chewing is good for your health, which is why I eat solid food a fair bit, but otherwise I wouldn’t care, honestly. reply SergeAx 22 Are you doing anything for bodily sensations then? I mean like swimming, jogging, massage, sex? reply Magi604 I&#x27;m with you there! reply sneak This is why ready-to-drink Soylent exists. It&#x27;s not a pill, it&#x27;s a bottle, but it is precisely this.It&#x27;s extremely convenient. reply asah +1 also Huel and energy bars. reply ralferoo 30 odd years ago, there was a similar book: How to boil an egg - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;How-Boil-Egg-Jan-Arkless&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0716022... reply madmax108 35 Great resource. For stuff in a similar vein, check out the YouSuckAtCooking Youtube channel[1]. Absolutely hilarious, while still being helpful to get better at cooking! :-)[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@yousuckatcooking reply qwertox Making your life more miserable by giving you instructions on how to eat an apple or store-bought Mac & Cheese.If it at least had some high quality photographs of the end result maybe it could push you towards saying \"Ok, I&#x27;ll eat\". Because if you&#x27;re really hungry, you&#x27;re going to eat anyway, even if it&#x27;s just an apple. But one does not need such a book for that.I&#x27;m sorry, but stuff like this doesn&#x27;t excite me. reply jmspring How many commenting &#x2F; voting actually followed through and downloaded the content? The content itself is a mess (they admit to it) and sensible alternatives are an easy first pass.The link is worth looking at and the recipes aren&#x27;t bad. But \"so you don&#x27;t die\" is hyperbole and you can survive on less.I live in a food void and cooking is a passion. The link isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s approach is over the top. reply mst The \"so you don&#x27;t die\" is both black humour and a reference to it being things you might be willing&#x2F;able to both assemble and eat while exhausted, depressed or otherwise impaired.I&#x27;ve had days when I can&#x27;t get past the activation energy required to use a frying pan, but a microwaved poached egg on toast is just about within my mental capacity. I&#x27;ve had days when I can&#x27;t deal with anything with a significant flavour or complicated texture, but I can manage to eat a bowl of ramen over the course of an hour or so.It&#x27;s not about what you -can- survive on, the anticipated limiting factor here is the human themselves. reply yuppiepuppie My wife and I both did. I thought the downloaded content is great. It’s a cookbook that I actually find entertaining to read instead of the typical over the top cookbooks out there. I also enjoyed its sense of humor and sarcasm. Perhaps it flies over the head of some people… reply Daneel_ I did. It’s good. It’s aimed at people like me whose sole thought is “ugh, cooking? Again?”Food is nutrients. Cooking is time spent making the nutrients edible. The more I can minimise that wasted time (both cooking and eating) the more time I have to spent on useful things.Think of how exciting your laundry is to do. Now do it three times a day and listen to people who gush about how much they love it. That’s what it’s like. Sorry, it’s laundry; I hate it.“So you don’t die” is basically my real thought process - 3pm rolls round and I’m thinking “I should probably eat something.. ugh” reply williamdclt 44 I’ve heard that before, it always blows my mind as food is probably ~half of all enjoyment I get from life.I don’t have a particularly developed palate or anything, I wonder if this difference in appreciation is physical or psychological reply Daneel_ 23 The world would be a boring place if we were all the same. I’m glad there are people like you who care so much, and I’m also glad there are people like me :)Be glad you have something you can enjoy so much every day! reply stOneskull > How many commenting &#x2F; voting actually followed through and downloaded the content?i did and like it. i find it funny light reading. reply euazOn 29 My favourite cooking youtuber made a very information-dense video about exactly this.

Salads, PBJs, Ramen, rice and veggies, english muffins &#x2F; rice cakes and PB&#x2F;nutella. I&#x27;m not sure why this is a thing. reply cooper_ganglia The funny thing is, I’m not even sure if you mean that this is ridiculous because it’s so simple or because it’s so complicated. I say this, because, when I was at the worst of my depressive state, and still occasionally every now and then, I get to the point where I just can’t do anything at all and if there’s more than one or two steps between me and eating, I’ll just go days without eating at all, this kind of depression menu is the exact kind of menu that I was looking for that period of time. Something simple, something fast, something easy. I didn’t even have clean dishes available because I was too depressed to do anything, so if it required any level of cooking more than what the microwave and a paper bowl could handle, then I just wouldn’t eat. I literally would go days without eating because the mental energy to even chew and swallow wasn’t there. I’m glad there are people making cookbooks like this. reply theideaofcoffee I hope you are doing better now. reply anders_p It exists because some people barely have enough money to get by.It exists because there are people who weren&#x27;t fortunate enough to have parents that taught how to cook.It can be a challenge to get a varied diet, when you only have spare change and lack the skills & knowledge that many take for granted.You sound like you lack some ability to empathize with other people&#x27;s struggles in life - and that you are blind to the privileges you&#x27;ve had in your own life.Not everyone has access to the same resources & knowledge that you have.I know how to cook, but have been dirt-poor in periods of my life. A book like this one (with 50 recipes that cost less than $10) helped me get through those times without having to eat the same 2-3 dishes for months. reply kseistrup I believe the point is “… for the zero spoons crowd.”Some days there are just not drive or energy (“spoons”) enough to think about what to eat, and much less to prepare it.

When that ran out it was cornflakes and tea. Last week in the month was just tea.

    "originBody": "IBM  Newsroom Press Releases Blog Latest News Media Contacts Media Center Leadership Global Newsrooms About Subscribe IBM and NASA Open Source Largest Geospatial AI Foundation Model on Hugging Face Effort aims to widen access to NASA earth science data for geospatial intelligence and accelerate climate-related discoveries Aug 3, 2023 YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., Aug. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and open-source AI platform Hugging Face today announced that IBM's watsonx.ai geospatial foundation model – built from NASA's satellite data – will now be openly available on Hugging Face. It will be the largest geospatial foundation model on Hugging Face and the first-ever open-source AI foundation model built in collaboration with NASA. Access to the latest data remains a significant challenge in climate science where environmental conditions change almost daily. And, despite growing amounts of data — estimates from NASA suggest that by 2024, scientists will have 250,000 terabytes of data from new missions — scientists and researchers still face obstacles in analyzing these large datasets. As part of a Space Act Agreement with NASA, IBM set out earlier this year to build an AI foundation model for geospatial data. And now, by making a geospatial foundation model available via Hugging Face — a recognized leader in open-source and a well-known repository for all transformer models — efforts can advance to democratize access and application of AI to generate new innovations in climate and Earth science. \"The essential role of open-source technologies to accelerate critical areas of discovery such as climate change has never been clearer,\" said Sriram Raghavan, Vice President, IBM Research AI. \"By combining IBM's foundation model efforts aimed at creating flexible, reusable AI systems with NASA's repository of Earth-satellite data, and making it available on the leading open-source AI platform, Hugging Face, we can leverage the power of collaboration to implement faster and more impactful solutions that will improve our planet.\" \"AI remains a science-driven field, and science can only progress through information sharing and collaboration,\" said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face. \"This is why open-source AI and the open release of models and datasets are so fundamental to the continued progress of AI, and making sure the technology will benefit as many people as possible.\"  \"We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data is analyzed and help us to better understand our planet,\" said Kevin Murphy, Chief Science Data Officer, NASA. \"And by open sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact.\" The model – trained jointly by IBM and NASA on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 satellite data (HLS) over one year across the continental United States and fine-tuned on labeled data for flood and burn scar mapping — has demonstrated to date a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniques using half as much labeled data. With additional fine tuning, the base model can be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses. IBM and NASA researchers are also working with Clark University to adapt the model for applications such as time-series segmentation and similarity research. The news follows IBM's announcement earlier this year to collaborate with NASA to build an AI model that could speed up the analysis of satellite images and boost scientific discovery. It's also part of NASA's decade-long Open-Source Science Initiative to build a more accessible, inclusive, and collaborative scientific community. NASA, along with the White House and other federal agencies, has declared 2023 a Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes created through the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge. The model leverages IBM foundation model technology and is part of IBM's larger effort to create and train AI models that can be used for different tasks and apply information from one situation to another. In July, IBM announced the availability of watsonx, an AI and data platform that allows enterprises to scale and accelerate impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. A commercial version of the geospatial model, which is part of IBM watsonx, will be available through the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS) later this year.

It&#x27;s not a very large model, esp for geospatial. And the data set is microscopic, not even 1k image tiles.A typical geospatial UNET would be trained on any where from 10x to 100x this much data.This is more like a toy dataset I would give an intern to play on. But to be clear, one would need much much much more data do do something interesting on. Likewise, there are a lot of data filtering and data processing considerations that come into play with satellites like clouds, ascension or descenion, averaging to try and get fewer clouds. Satellite and all remote sensing ML is tricky stuff. reply joshvm I&#x27;m not sure this is a correct assessment. The baseline ViT model (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;ibm-nasa-geospatial&#x2F;Prithvi-100M) is presumably trained on a much larger dataset from HLS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hls.gsfc.nasa.gov&#x2F;) in an unsupservised setup.Vanilla UNET is around 7-8M parameters, this is 100M(?) so the model itself is an order of magnitude larger. There are larger models though as pointed out in the other Hacker News thread.The fine-tuning datasets are much smaller, but that&#x27;s the point - they don&#x27;t need to be large, because of the foundation model underneath. reply pm_me_your_quan Yeah, I&#x27;m surprised they released the demo about multi-temporal crop prediction. Their accuracy is, frankly, pretty terrible. It&#x27;s basically what I managed the first time I tried to run a classifier against the CDL dataset across years. reply fnordpiglet I feel like this is the interesting bit:It will be the largest geospatial foundation model on Hugging Face and the first-ever open-source AI foundation model built in collaboration with NASA.Perhaps it’s a sad statement that this is the largest GIS model on HF etc, but at least it’s out there. I would love to see more and better and larger and less entangled with IBM or other megacorps out there. reply version_five 1Discussed two days ago, 296 points and 78 comments: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36985197 reply Roark66 49 Wait, it&#x27;s a 100M model. It&#x27;s certainly very good they open sourced it, but its definitely not big considering we have 330B models. Perhaps it&#x27;s big for this type of a model?I for one would love to see a lot more highly capable small models that can be run on mobile devices and if on desktops, they don&#x27;t need fiber to download. reply pkdpic 1In case anyone&#x27;s wondering what the model does (like I was).> With additional fine tuning, the base model can be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses. IBM and NASA researchers are also working with Clark University to adapt the model for applications such as time-series segmentation and similarity research. reply DrZootron > has demonstrated to date a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniquesA-mazing reply hardware2win 1Whats the deal about hf? reply geraltofrivia HuggingFace or HF was a incorporated entity writing some well engineered and easy to use Deep Learning libraries. Notably, around the time when the Transformer paper was released, and when the NLP community started using them en masse, HF’s implementation became very popular. They started hosting pretrained models that you can download and start using in a single python line. Then they started doing the same for common datasets. Now it’s one of the larger AI startups with a brilliant set of programmers, engineers, and have multiple revenue streams (I’m guessing). reply RosanaAnaDana Think of it like a GitHub for sharing datasets and weights.I&#x27;d like &#x27;huggingface&#x27; to the face hugger alien. You can just rip off the front and back of models and train them on new data. Although I&#x27;ve been told explicitly by the HF this is not the case, it&#x27;s my preferred head cannon. reply codersfocus It was a consumer facing AI chat app similar to Replika. They pivoted to being a repository for AI stuff. reply phero_cnstrcts 1Dunno, but I’m not sure I like the name. reply kbutler AI model-sharing platform, named after the emoji: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emojipedia.org&#x2F;emojiology-hugging-face&#x2F;(I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever attempted to paste an emoji into HN before, and I&#x27;m rather glad to learn it strips them out, though they&#x27;re fine in other contexts.) reply flangola7 Seems kind of biased to prevent some Unicode characters but not others. Those characters exist for a purpose: to more accurately convey human communication. reply version_five 1I don&#x27;t like it, on one hand it&#x27;s really sappy in a non-endearing way, on the other, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avp.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Facehugger (which incidentally is probably some foreshadowing of the time when the VCs start trying to get their returns)It&#x27;s mildly embarrassing to have to refer to it in a professional context. replyAliza657 prev [–] This is an exciting and commendable collaboration between IBM and Hugging Face, together with NASA&#x27;s involvement, to democratize access to AI technology and further climate and Earth science research. The announcement of the open-source availability of IBM&#x27;s watsonx.ai geospatial foundation model, built from NASA&#x27;s satellite data, on Hugging Face is a significant step forward in advancing AI applications for climate science.The fact that this model is trained on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 satellite data and fine-tuned on labeled data for flood and burn scar mapping, resulting in a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniques using half as much labeled data, is impressive. This model has immense potential to aid in various environmental tasks, such as tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, and monitoring greenhouse gases, making it a valuable tool for addressing pressing environmental challenges.Moreover, the commitment to open-source principles and information sharing demonstrated by IBM, Hugging Face, and NASA is laudable. By open-sourcing the model and datasets, they are enabling researchers and scientists worldwide to access and utilize this valuable resource, fostering collaboration and accelerating progress in the field of AI.Additionally, it&#x27;s great to see IBM&#x27;s dedication to creating flexible and reusable AI systems, as well as their focus on developing models that can be adapted for different tasks and scenarios. The commercial availability of the geospatial model through the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite later this year further underscores IBM&#x27;s commitment to advancing AI technologies for practical applications.In summary, this collaboration represents a significant step forward in utilizing AI for the betterment of our planet and addressing climate and Earth science challenges. It&#x27;s heartening to see leading organizations coming together to harness technology for positive global impact and promoting the open sharing of knowledge to foster innovation and progress. reply anigbrowl Don&#x27;t do chat GPT summaries on HN.

Twitter in particular has a long and storied history of this sort of thing.I think the move should have been, if one were going to start on Twitter, to slowly funnel the largest possible portion of their 11M followers to their own external site, or collaborated with I don’t know Spotify to funnel people there for cash. reply isykt Wildly ahistorical take. 16 years ago nobody had “Diamond mine trust fund baby takes over Twitter and yoinks handles” on their bingo card for 16 years into the fucking future.In 2007, the housing market hadn’t crashed. George W Goddamn Bush was President. The Web seemed wide open for the taking, and scrappy startups seemed like fun places to share your life or your words or whatever.

Even by 2008 you could probably have looked at Facebook apps as an example. I remember some startup for music sharing became the most popular service on there then one day FB changed some integration detail and their business died overnight. reply nazka 33 He didn’t wake up 16 years later to finally realize how Twitter operates. Sure at the very start it’s hard to predict this. But through the years&#x2F;decade seeing how Twitter do this many times, he should have implemented other options a long time ago. reply constantly The downside risk you’re protecting against isn’t “billionaire buys company and steals your account” but is instead the much more general, “I lose access to my account,” which you will agree is a much more likely thing to happen, particularly given that it has happened on Twitter, so it’s not exactly speculative. reply drcode every investment and activity has tail risks that you have to factor into your decision making, there are always things that can happen outside of your controlIn 2007, social media was still the \"Wild West\" and having expectations one way or another was not a sensible, it was not something you should have gotten involved in if you wanted low tail risks reply notyourwork At what point should a username be expected to be qualified with conditions beyond first come first serve? reply wheels We manage non-unique names in a lot of domains. It&#x27;d be a shit-show if given names had to be unique. It&#x27;d be acceptable to have an ID in the background that helped regain specificity. (Kind of like social security numbers in the US, though those also notably are not unique.) reply motoxpro Their account, musicfan, has ~500k the new music is a rename from some twittermusic handle I think reply monero-xmr There is no such thing as true digital ownership for things built on anyone else’s platform. If you want to truly own something you need to use open protocols - like websites and bespoke software. If you build on someone’s API, or rely on “owning” a Twitter account which you literally have zero right to and is at the whim of the platform’s owner, don’t be shocked when it’s taken from you.Of course, you can always use Bitcoin &#x2F; Ethereum and the Ethereum Name Service which is true, legitimate digital ownership. But few on HN like that. There is a lot of cognitive dissonance when arguing that blockchain has literally zero use cases and then being angry when Twitter or Facebook or Google rugs you. reply appplication > Of course, you can always use Bitcoin &#x2F; Ethereum and the Ethereum Name Service which is true, legitimate digital ownership.Why is this legitimate digital ownership vs other forms? Bitcoin and ETH are stolen all the time, and it’s not recoverable, even if you can prove it rightfully belonged to you.People are wary of crypto because it’s controlled by a cabal of extraordinarily entrenched early adopters, many of whom established themselves on speculation, grift, and fraud. It’s no better than the centralized banking it purports to supplant, and worse in most measurable regards. reply monero-xmr A lot of early people sold, it’s hard to buy and hold when you 10x. Then people in at $1 sell at $10, those buyers sell at $100, those at $1000, and so on. It takes deep, deep conviction to sit on 10000% gains and not sell.And those people are true believers in the tech, and IMO deserve their riches. Same as anyone who bought FB or AMZN or GOOG at IPO and held until now.As a separate issue, do the longer term holders pose a threat to the crypto ecosystem? You are so naïve - the traditional economic and banking system is the same! Except for centuries! Do I sound conspiratorial? Well, you said crypto has a “cabal”. Pot meet kettle.At least in crypto it’s open source, and the addresses and balances are public. A fundamentally more equitable system at its core. reply appplication I have no love for the banks. But crypto is open source in name only. The deflationary nature of it ensures that expansion of adoption is exclusively to the enrichment of current holders. It’s a glorified ponzi scheme, posturing behind sham principles of openness and inclusion. reply monero-xmr I feel like you are at an inflection point of understanding. The fiat economic system, which has been the global system since the gold standard went away, is a glorified Ponzi scheme! You are so close reply leereeves Neither is a ponzi scheme, but I think you&#x27;re both trying to say that each rewards the already rich, which is true.But replacing one \"rich get richer\" economic system with another is not an improvement, except for a very few people who might become rich during the transition. reply monero-xmr I am using a rhetorical technique to point to the traditional economic system to contrast it with the crypto system, and in this way crypto is at least equally bad (if not (much!) better). That technique is for observers of the thread.Unfortunately, if you have a problem with “rich get richer”, I believe you are arguing against fundamental requirement of technological improvement.It takes patience to do anything of value. Anything. Learning a skill, mastering a job, earning the trust of your peers, becoming a leader - this requires time, dedication, and discipline. A government cannot simply mandate that everyone can read, or everyone can be rich for that matter.All risk has tradeoff. It takes those with more stuff in order to risk enough stuff to subsidize a lot of experiments, some of which will bear fruit. I would argue that even in the smallest communities, with everyone starting equal, very soon some will have more and some have less. This is simply human nature. reply leereeves 9 > Anything. Learning a skill, mastering a job, earning the trust of your peers, becoming a leader ...How is any of that comparable to \"buy and hold crypto\", an action that contributes nothing to the world?In a world that used crypto currency as the economic standard, other people would work hard to increase the total wealth in the world, while crypto holders would just sit and watch their holdings increase in value.mptest >controlled by a cabal of extraordinarily entrenched early adopters, many of whom established themselves on speculation, grift, and fraudAka buying the stuff while you lot were laughing at it and calling them magic internet beans over on &#x2F;r&#x2F;buttcoin reply tracerbulletx That&#x27;s true of literally everything and yet we have figured out in other spheres how to have fair dealings, and have things like leases, and insurance, and other fair ways of working together when dealing with things owned by other people. As people build businesses on these platforms it is completely necessary that standards and duties between these parties be formalized, predictable, and non-capricious. reply monero-xmr No I have a constitutional right to the property I own, except in exceptional circumstances. Your Twitter handle is not land, nor a physical object in your house, and the laws we have won’t protect you if the contract says you can’t own it.Cryptocurrency is simply a different thing in terms of digital ownership. It’s not the same as other digital things. reply moralestapia What about domain names?I have a really nice .app site and fear this every time I renew it.(For those who don&#x27;t know: .app is owned by Google) reply monero-xmr https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eth.limo&#x2F; is one attempt of several to map ENS domains to web addressable domains. Ideally all the major browsers will support ENS for domain-to-IP mapping and the issue is solved. reply presson This cannot happen with domains. If you were to drop the domain, they could potentially reserve it for themselves, but as long as you&#x27;re not breaking laws and pay for renewals, the domain is yours. reply moralestapia I hope you&#x27;re right!(I&#x27;m quite honored to get your first comment on this site after lurking for around 3 years and a half, lol) reply presson lololol the web as a distribution platform is very important to me! :-P reply hackernewds Replace \"digital platform\" with the Internet and it sounds like a terrible dystopia. Just because the policies existed doesn&#x27;t make it right. What next? @POTUS is claimed by X and is put up for bidding to the highest bidder. reply TheAceOfHearts When this was initially announced I saw multiple people posting on Twitter how the the non-Musk version of the company would also occasionally take over short name accounts and give them to government officials and large corporations.Some of the replies when @x and @music got transferred were also complaining about not being compensated monetarily, which honestly seems like a bizarre expectation. Elon paid $44 billion for the company already. Paying people for their accounts sets up a poor precedent if they decide to take over other accounts in the future, and determining the amount to pay seems arbitrary. However, maybe giving these people a free Blue subscription for some number of years, or even for life, would&#x27;ve been a good move since it encourages them to continue participating on the platform. reply okprod I think it&#x27;s similar to some users believing they have a right to privacy or a right to \"their\" data on platforms like Facebook. Use at your own risk because they&#x27;re not free services; they have a profit motive by nature of what they are. reply LudwigNagasena Squatter&#x27;s rights and privacy rights are not very similar imo. reply PaulHoule People gotta quit bitchin&#x27; about Twitter and just move to Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads or whatever. Bankruptcy is the one language that Elon Musk will understand and it&#x27;s absolutely necessary because his behavior is contagious. Donald Trump set a precedent for him and Scott Adams, only their destruction will send a message this behavior is just not cool. reply evandale The thing about people is they&#x27;ll whine and cry about how awfulis but if it gives them convenient access to a dopamine hit they&#x27;ll put up with whatever they&#x27;re complaining about.Putting your money where your mouth is and using your wallet as your vote are rare values to find in people anymore. Most people want cheap entertainment and they want it now. reply dralley Bluesky is busy Google+ing themselves with the eternal invite system. reply pessimizer There&#x27;s no relationship between Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Scott Adams other than that they&#x27;re people you don&#x27;t like. reply actionfromafar Pretty sure none of’em would like me either. reply Supermancho > There&#x27;s no relationship between Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Scott Adams other than that they&#x27;re people you don&#x27;t like.They understand how to manipulate people specifically or intrinsically. They are, each, sociopaths for better or worse. reply kfrzcode I don&#x27;t agree reply praisewhitey In 2015 twitter changed favorites to likes, but since the username \"likes\" was taken, the url to view your likes switched from twitter.com&#x2F;favorites to twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;likes (later on they changed it to twitter.com&#x2F;username&#x2F;likes)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;likes reply wilde I mean yes Elon doesn’t want to spend money. Whether he has to would be determined by a court, if the handle owners decided to sue for unfair trade practices or the like. reply shrubble @AOC comes to mind. Very likely that Twitter curried favor with that. reply nullfield This is the consequence of lack of self-sovereignty, along with the lack of an agreed universal naming system.That said, I’m not sure that first-come-first-wins is simultaneously fair, in such a universal environment. Nor, really, do I want it to be a “whoever can pay most gets the desirable names”, like DNS works.I don’t have a better solution right now, but acknowledge that there’s a problem with the combination&#x2F;intersection of “rarity” and “ownership” and such.Are there any solutions that are even close to … some kind of fairness, or even approximation of a system that respects… anything? reply terribleperson A mandatory random set of numbers at the end of every name is an approach I quite like. Not only does it directly make every name available to 10,000 people, it should reduce the demand for these desirable names in the first place since you have to share them with thousands of other people.Platforms should also consider accommodations for trademark holders. Most have some sort of program, but it seems to be a mess. If every normal screen name has a numeric code at the end, there&#x27;s room to give trademark holders a non-numeric name without having to seize a handle from someone else. The spot normally occupied by the numeric code could be replaced with an indication that that account is owned by the trademark holder or with the name of the entity that owns the trademark, to differentiate it from normal accounts and also from any accounts that might hold a similar mark in a different business. reply rectang I like that you&#x27;re making concrete proposals and the append-random-numbers approach is thought-provoking.Removing the numbers for trademark holders is an imperfect solution though, though, since multiple entities can hold the same mark so long as they are in different markets.A critical test for trademark violation is \"does it cause confusion in the marketplace?\" and if nobody confuses Oracle Software with HiSpec Oracle trailer tires or Oracle Lighting, they&#x27;re all allowed to hold a trademark on \"Oracle\". But if you&#x27;re talking about a namespace where \"there can be only one\", which of the entities who holds a registered trademark wins? reply terribleperson That&#x27;s why I followed on with the suggestion of replacing the numbers with the owning entity. \"Apple|Apple Inc.\" would be separate from \"Apple|Apple Records.\" Of course, this is complicated when a trademark is owned by different companies in different countries or when a trademark is licensed to a company including the right to advertise with that trademark. An alternative thought I had was replacing the numbers with the business the trademark is in, but plenty of trademarks apply to more than one business and the &#x27;primary&#x27; one can change over time.There are assuredly better solutions, but even an imperfect solution is better than the current state of things. First-come-first-serve with unique per-site screen names just plain sucks. reply tiltowait Beyond making each name available to 10,000 (or more) people, randomizing the numbers puts everyone on a playing field. It’s an elegant solution—and why it’s such a baffling shame that Discord recently abandoned it for the terrible, outmoded “one unique username for everyone” approach. reply terribleperson Yes, I was quite annoyed that Discord decided to abandon their 4-digit numbers. The first place I saw the approach was Battle.net, and was happy to see it when I joined Discord. I&#x27;m glad Discord decided to provide the ability to have a separate nickname from your actual handle, but there was no good reason to dump the numbers.edit: I agree the randomness is important. Without random numbers, the first person to get in will pick \"0069\". reply fluoridation >Are there any solutions that are even close to … some kind of fairness, or even approximation of a system that respects… anything?One way could be have names mean nothing in terms of identification. You can call yourself \"music\" if you like, but so can anyone else. You&#x27;re better off calling yourself something unique and then building a following, so that future potential followers can distinguish you from copycats. reply andrepd Discord kinda had that with username#1234 (4 digits). But that&#x27;s being phase out. reply tagamma Is there an explanation anywhere of their reason for doing the phase out?

The right handle and recognition could literally be tied to someone&#x27;s wellbeing at this point.

No, they learned that the domain name is worthless by itself. reply morkalork How is a twitter handle different? reply rglullis Are TWitter handles overseen by ICANN and IANA? Are they bound by any type of international agreement?The problem in your example is that the people behind TPB work with the principle that any domain name might be taken away from them at any moment, unlike Mr. @music, who was naive enough to think he was immune to any takeover just because he called dibs on the name. reply morkalork Still sounds like someone else&#x27;s land, just with more faith in their behaviour. reply rglullis To go back: the problem with your analogy is that it&#x27;s not about the land, it&#x27;s about the house.ThePirateBay didn&#x27;t build their solution on the premise that they would have an irrevocable right to their domain name. If the land owner decided to take back the land (like they did, many times) TPB could simply take their things and move elsewhere (like they did, many times).I don&#x27;t think I ever saw someone from TPB saying \"oh, they took our domain, it&#x27;s so unfair!\", instead what I hear them saying is \"we are building magnet-links and a bunch of redundant proxies so that our service continues to exist even if we lose all the domains we have. reply zajio1am In case of domain registries there is a contract with clear terms.In case of twitter handle or other free services there is no consideration on user&#x27;s side so there is no binding contract, therefore the service could be revoked at any time. reply drcode I hate being that guybut if you have a self-hosted bitcoin account or ether account or use some of the naming services on those platforms, this isn&#x27;t the case reply fluoridation Some land does, in fact, have private owners. reply throwaway98797 that’s so smarta good excuse to never build anythinglife is riskthis sucks, no doubt but this snark is so unproductive reply ovao It’s not a good excuse to not build anything, but quite a good excuse to not build on what others own in such a way that you’re entirely reliant on them. Yes, unless you’re self-hosting your product on a solar-powered server via community-owned networks, you’re going to be beholden to someone, and often that’s multiple parties. But that’s not the same as being completely beholden. reply threatofrain Many businesses start with single points of failure. The goal is to get enough money to where this is not true, but they all start this way. Ultimately the goal is managing risk, and that often means not building out your own data center as the first thing you do. reply ovao This, more increasingly, doesn’t mean building out your own data center. Often this just means you can deploy services to multiple platforms without a dramatic or upending burden of effort. I don’t think startups should necessarily burn capital on federation, but startups can at least make engineering decisions and trade-offs to ensure a future livelihood not contingent on single points of failure.Unless you’re Apple or Google, you’ll have some single points of failure. But that’s not the same as the livelihood of what you’re setting out to do being reliant on a single vendor for over a decade. reply rglullis There is quite a lot between \"building your own data center\" and \"building your tech stack in a way where you are not locked to one specific vendor\". reply hedgehog It&#x27;s a reason to not stop building. You have to start somewhere but you have to stay in that place. That&#x27;s why you see successful public personalities diversify away from just the platform &#x2F; schtick that got them started, they know that to succeed long term they need many ways to reach their audience or organize their community. reply hedgehog (_don&#x27;t_ have to stay) reply nightski Maybe, if you only focus on the endgame.

You can use it entirely without an app. And there is no reason Uber or WhatsApp couldn&#x27;t work on the web. reply sneak You used to not be able to access the camera or camera roll from webapps on iOS. The only way to take or upload photos was with a native app. The file upload input control on websites simply did not work on an iPhone.This is a relatively recent development. I&#x27;m fairly convinced it didn&#x27;t happen sooner in an anticompetitive move to promote native apps over the open web.

Essentially you are a nomad, reconfiguring your business to changing conditions, accepting that things will change over time. reply corndoge I hope they keep doing it, maybe it will lead to users understanding that they do not control or own the platform. Unfortunately the odds of that seem slim.

I think it&#x27;s fine for them to take it, but they should have left a link up to his new account, and publicly thanked him for keeping an eye on this url for so long.

Would you like that? reply constantly I would not like that, but also understand how purchased real property, which has a long history dating thousands of years and a whole legal system and framework on point getting into even minutiae (Rule Against Perpetuities anyone?) is different than squatting on a generic username on someone’s new tech platform for free.In the former case, I would usually have legal recourse, unless this is a dystopian future where Twitter can leverage eminent domain.It’s a bad comparison. reply mackatap If x owned the entire entire street than yes. It isn&#x27;t even remotely a good comparison. reply Aachen A \"would you like something being taken away from you?\" is not a thought experiment but a suggestion on what to think.Secondly, I don&#x27;t think this comparison with an address by a random stranger for no apparent reason is correct to begin with reply pedroma Thought experiment:Someone takes something* away from you.

I suspected as much. reply timeon So it is completely ok? reply pessimizer It&#x27;s pretty awful to look at people who point out dishonesty on your side and see a supporter of the enemy. Without that premise, directing your question at somebody who pointed out an error&#x2F;deception that you did not bother to dispute would be a non-sequitur.Why do you think that somebody who points out dishonesty would think what happened is \"completely ok\"? reply twelve40 no, it seems pretty dumb, but they don&#x27;t have to lie and exaggerate it either reply HenryBemis As any father says in any Hollywood movie: my house, my rules.So... the &#x27;thermostat&#x27; is theirs and theirs alone. You are just allowed to eat&#x2F;sleep in your parents house.

It&#x27;s not a topic that interests me reply pessimizer The only point is to talk about how much you hate Twitter. If they didn&#x27;t talk about hating Musk and Twitter constantly, you wouldn&#x27;t notice the slightest difference between their behavior pre- and post-Musk.I honestly think the Musk hate has been gradually dialed down because the people who set mainstream agendas thought it was going to take attention away from Trump hate going into the campaign season. reply bradgranath Fuck around on private platforms, find out. reply ecf Guess what, you don’t own anything on the internet. Nothing is private. Everything flows through a domain name, and you never actually fully own a domain.All these comments about “shouldn’t have done it on a private platform”. Well, new flash, the internet as a whole is a private platform.I sincerely hope you have a problem like this in the future so others can mock you over your misfortune. reply anigbrowl On the one hand, it&#x27;s unsurprising that platforms would do this, users sign up for TOS with terrible policies and realize too late that they&#x27;re the product. Too, a handle like &#x27;@music&#x27; was also an opportunistic bet on hub status of one&#x27;s own.On the other hand, the sense of arrogance and entitlement on display here marks an impressive new nadir in fuck-you capitalism. Contractual arguments are sort of meaningless since most user agreements are extremely one-sided contracts of adhesion and the judicial establishment often rejects equitable arguments in favor of narrow technical ones, notwithstanding the vast asymmetries between user and service provider. All the legal, economic, and (increasingly) social incentives favor abusive behavior.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;i-made-this reply numpad0 Are TOS even real? I can&#x27;t immediately recall high profile cases that actually had to do with TOS. My impression is that TOS had disconnected from actual internal operations sometimes during past 20 years, and are now just filler texts for posthoc justification for internal code behaviors and manager ramblings. reply specialist I feel bad for Vaught. Most have been misquoting Musk, creating a great deal of confusion. So of course Vaught, like many more to come, was unwittingly caught betwixt.Musk is a Freemium Speeches™ absolutist.If you wanna have your say, then you&#x27;re gonna have to pay. A lot.PS- In totally unrelated news: Stackoverflow hit $1.6b (?) valuation from exploiting uncompensated labor. Retailers, MLMs, gig economy titans, among other grifters, have since been furiously studying this sterling example of plantation inspired ventures. reply Dalewyn It is generally (almost always) the case that user accounts on a given service are the property of said service, you merely have the privilege of using them according to terms and conditions set forth by said service.Which is to say you shouldn&#x27;t rely on them for anything critical; they can and in certain cases will be seized by said service for any or no reason at any given time. This can be said of Twitter, regardless Musk, as well as any other online service (eg: Reddit, Hacker News, Slashdot, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Google...).Journalism of this sort is merely stoking the emotional flames for sensationalism (clickbait!) and driving the mainstream narrative that Twitter is a goner and an evil that must be slain. reply ecf My god this story might make me leave HN again. I hope every “too bad” Musk-riding commenter here has their domain names names taken from them or something. reply XorNot Keep in mind that Musk&#x27;s stated ambition with X is to make it \"the everything app\".Imagine if Google started grabbing Gmail addresses it wanted for products. reply pard68 Google doesn&#x27;t use @gmail though I know what you mean. X&#x2F;Twitter should do like Google and use another designation for their own \"handles\"&#x2F;services. \"@\" is pedestrian because everyone on that platform is \"@something\". A different pattern for official accounts would make sense to me. Just as Google doens&#x27;t use \"@gmail.com\" for their own product emails. reply mackatap You mean like youtube owning gaming, music etc? reply paulpauper fun fact: @elonmusk originally did not belong to elon musk reply zapdrive Something something free market. reply internet2000 How do you spend 16 years building a username? reply HenryBemis I assume he means \"building the following by posting good content, etc. etc. for 16 years\".This @music is a nice OG.. too bad they ruined it for him. reply valianteffort Fact of the matter is using twitter for 16 years provides no additional value to the company than someone using it for a day. No one cares how old your facebook is for example.Platforms that wanted to provide user pages at the top level were always gonna have this issue. Nobody would want a user to name himself \"support\" or \"customerservice\". reply Aachen How long you&#x27;ve been doing something for matter a lot and it appears in lots of places. If I work somewhere for years, I can&#x27;t be let go from one day to the next. If I rent a place for a decade, I can&#x27;t just be thrown out with the three months&#x27; notice that are enough if I lived there for only a year. When the government updated the privacy law, even if you should never have been tracked without consent based on the 1995 law as well as article 8 of the human rights convention, businesses were still given two years to update their processes (2016–2018), during which time they could only get warnings. \"Things always used to be this way\" matters a lot.And as I understand it, they didn&#x27;t impersonate support and cause harm in that way, or pretend to be official in any other way, as in your example of calling yourself @customerservice.I don&#x27;t think either of these arguments work, especially because you did in fact draw customers to the website for 16 years so you did provide them value (your content in between their ads) reply pessimizer > If I work somewhere for years, I can&#x27;t be let go from one day to the next.What country is this?

    "originBody": "Menu News Sports Weather Obituaries Community CEOs’ pay climbed before layoffs at tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft, data shows By Max Zahn, ABC News Aug 5, 2023 | 2:27 PM Steve Taylor/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images (NEW YORK) — While some tech giants neared or imposed widespread layoffs last year, compensation for their CEOs climbed as much as tens of millions of dollars, according to an ABC News analysis of data released by research firm Equilar in May and June. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was awarded compensation worth more than $225 million in 2022, which marked a staggering 3,474% increase from the previous year, making him the nation’s highest-paid CEO, according to Equilar data. Near the outset of 2023, Alphabet announced plans to lay off 10,000 workers. At Microsoft, which initiated plans to lay off 10,000 workers in January, CEO Satya Nadella received compensation worth nearly $55 million in 2022 — a 10% jump from the prior year, the data showed. Meta, Uber and Salesforce are also among more than a dozen tech companies that gave their CEOs a compensation increase last year, despite announcing layoffs at some point since the start of 2022, according to the ABC News analysis of the Equilar data. Roughly 389,000 tech workers have been laid off since the beginning of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks layoffs. The job cuts have befallen some of the nation’s most well-known and large companies. Alphabet, Meta, Uber and Salesforce did not respond to ABC News’ requests for comment. The rise of CEO pay amid a cascade of job losses at some household-name tech firms draws attention to the divergent fates of executives and workers in one of the nation’s most lucrative fields, which matches an economy-wide trend of a widening gap between the pay of CEOs and workers, analysts told ABC News. CEO compensation often includes a base salary and a performance bonus but is typically made up in large part by stock awards that align the CEO primarily with shareholders, analysts added. The incentive structure can push a CEO to safeguard the health of a company but also reward short-term cost cuts that imperil workers, they said. The disparate outcomes for CEOs and workers at some tech firms heightens an ongoing dispute about whether companies should shift consideration toward other stakeholders beyond investors, such as employees and customers, David Larcker, a professor of accounting, Emeritus, at Stanford University who researches corporate governance, told ABC News “It’s a huge question,” Larcker said. “From a CEO’s perspective, if you have to shut down something that isn’t profitable, you can obviously increase the stock price and earnings and get a big bonus out of that.” From workers’ point of view, meanwhile, “companies have a lot to say about how employees are their most important assets and sometimes actions seem a lot more shareholder-friendly,” Larcker added. To be sure, Equilar calculated the value of CEO compensation packages when they were awarded at the outset of last fiscal year. For many companies, the stock price had dropped by the end of the year, leaving the CEO’s compensation lower than the figure listed by Equilar. The value of Pichai’s compensation package, for instance, fell to about $205 million by the end of fiscal year 2022, according to a follow-up Equilar analysis shared with ABC News. Under the terms of Pichai’s compensation package, he will not receive the full value unless the company achieves a set of goals, including strong stock performance relative to other large companies, a government filing shows. Meanwhile, the ultimate value of the compensation package received by Nadella is dependent on a range of company performance metrics that “are intended to be difficult but attainable,” Microsoft told shareholders in December. Months earlier, in May 2022, Microsoft announced an increase in its budget devoted to pay and stock compensation for employees that year. The company will not provide raises for salaried employees in 2023, according to a company memo first reported by Insider in May. In response to ABC News’ request for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson noted that the compensation awarded to Nadella last year preceded the layoff plans announced in January. The vast majority of the compensation awarded to Zuckerberg in 2022 is devoted to his security and use of a private plane, Meta told shareholders. Since 2013, Zuckerberg has received an annual salary of $1. The value of a stock award made up 70% of the typical compensation package for the 100 highest-paid CEOs last year, Amit Batish, director of content at Equilar, told ABC News. Company performance thresholds often found in CEO compensation packages include stock performance, sales growth and product user totals. Job losses in the relatively well-paid industry, meanwhile, have coincided with otherwise robust hiring across the economy, which boasts an unemployment rate hovering near a 50-year low. “Especially in tech, I think it’s a shock to tech workers who have always been in such high demand to be experiencing these layoffs,” Lisa LaViers, a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business who studies executive pay and its effect on workers, told ABC News. At tech firms where CEOs received an increase in compensation alongside layoffs, the divergent fortunes likely exacerbated worker dismay, LaViers added. “If you gave the CEO a large bonus and you laid off a lot of workers, I can’t imagine a scenario under which that wouldn’t upset employees,” she said. Key attributes of executive and worker compensation complicate the moral outrage, however, LaViers said. Executive compensation sometimes includes stock options that cannot be sold within a year of when a CEO receives them, meaning that compensation received in a given year does not necessarily equate to money brought in by an executive. Meanwhile, many non-executive level tech employees receive stock options as part of their compensation, tying their income to that of shareholders, she said, though employee stock options are a fraction of what CEOs receive. Uber, which has laid off hundreds of employees this year, gave CEO Dara Khosrowshahi compensation worth about $24 million in 2022, which amounted to a 22% increase from the previous year, Equilar data showed. A corporate worker laid off by Uber this year, who requested anonymity for fear of negative consequences if they spoke publicly, described the dynamic of job cuts alongside pay increases as “very frustrating.” Responding to Khosrowshahi’s push for a “culture change” that focused on the mission-based aspirations of Uber, the laid-off worker asked, “Did Dara really care about doing the right thing?” “There’s a lot of lip service paid to ‘Oh, we want to have a culture’ but it’s all in the service of profitability,” the laid-off worker added. After imposing a round of layoffs last month that affected up to 50 employees at Uber’s trucking subsidiary, Uber Freight, a company spokesperson told outlet Freight Waves in a statement: “On the back of efficiency gains realized across the business and to ensure continued alignment between our cost structure and the current market realities, we are reducing the workforce in our Brokerage business across a small number of roles.” The full compensation package awarded to Khosrowshahi is dependent upon the company’s fulfillment of key objectives, Uber told shareholders. Similarly, a worker interviewed by ABC News who was laid off this year by data-storage firm Western Digital expressed disappointment after finding out that CEO David Goeckeler received a 42% pay increase in 2022, according to Equilar data. “I was making money for this guy instead of making money for myself,” said the worker, who requested anonymity due to the terms of a severance agreement. “It’s the sickness of the whole system.” To receive the full value of his compensation package, Goeckler must achieve a variety of short- and long-term company performance goals, Western Digital told investors. Western Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Larcker, of Stanford University, said that a corporate shift in focus away from shareholders and toward other constituencies could limit instances of egregious divergence between the outcomes of CEOs and workers. Though layoffs, he added, are unavoidable, especially in tech. “Tech is a risky business,” Larcker said. “But companies can be better off when they change course in a way that doesn’t crush workers.” Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

But holy guacamole, whatever is the angle I look at it 225MM pear year does not make any f_ing sense to me and it is simply obscene for the 99.99% of the world population as would be enough to retire 5 or 6 generations of regular people. reply swozey I worked for a guy a decade ago who spent 8-10 years building a company to sell it for $300-400 million and he hasn&#x27;t worked a day since. Owns a 30k acre ranch that a bunch of friends&#x2F;family live on. Learjets. Villas in the islands, things like that. I can&#x27;t think of one thing he hasn&#x27;t done or is limited financially in doing. Last time I saw him he had a $120k watch on, some type of Hublot big bang.And Pichai gets that yearly...Here, check out the type of trash he spends his money on now. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drivetanks.com&#x2F; Absolute waste to society. reply jvmfjvfjvf Why is that trash? I would love to drive and shoot a real tank as a civilian. reply swozey His ranch is on the MX&#x2F;TX border and he owns domains (to resell) such as roaches.com, illegal.com, molest.com, etc. Take with those what you will of the sort of person he is. That&#x27;s just the few I remember otoh. He has hundreds. reply kcplate Not unheard of to squat on domains to prevent them from being used for nefarious purposes. Not saying that is what he is doing, but unless he starts using them for racist purposes, I am not going to hold this against him. reply whatshisface One of those is not like the others (it&#x27;s roaches.com). reply swozey Either I&#x27;m missing a joke or you need to travel more. Calling mexican immigrants roaches is a thing. reply toomanyrichies My assumption was that it referred to this [1], but then I’m not a racist POS so maybe I’m out of the loop.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roach_(smoking) reply swozey Yeah that&#x27;s definitely not the situation here unfortunately. reply durumu Never heard that before either, but personally, I would prefer not to travel to wherever immigrants are called roaches. reply _a9 I haven&#x27;t heard that word being used in years living around there and also being hispanic.To me it just looks like parent is cherry-picking some domains to try and put words in their mouth.If the person owns roaches.com out of hundreds of domains then you&#x27;re going to try to make it racist so the owner looks racist?I never understood why trying to make innocent things racist isn&#x27;t considered racist itself. reply hedora I’ve only heard of hispanic comedians using it in recent years:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;john-leguizamo-latinos...I first heard that joke in a 1990’s standup routine, fwiw. It could have been the same person telling the joke, I guess.Anyway, it used to actually be used by white american racists; it’s been weakened to just self deprecating humor, kind of like jewish comedians like to tell jew jokes. reply swozey lol Yeah you know more than me bud, because my initial intention clearly was to portray someone as a racist. it didn&#x27;t just come up through organic conversation.It&#x27;s totally normal to own a domain like molest.com. Totes normal every day stuff. I&#x27;m totally crazy for cherrypicking a few! hehe!I can&#x27;t believe someone is going to argue with me about the meaning of a domain name someone that I know owns and they don&#x27;t have any clue about. I&#x27;m totally just making things up here. Eyeroll. replyQuarrelsome can we argue carbon footprint? reply jvmfjvfjvf A tank is 1 mpg. I am guessing they are not driving more than 1 or 2 miles on an excursion. This is hardly harmful to the environment compared to other entertainment options. reply DropInIn A quick Google shows 0.6 mpg....Imma call for a citation from ya reply paulryanrogers - Ecological impact- finances that could feed&#x2F;house&#x2F;treat people- reinforces militant&#x2F;gun culture- wear on roads reply roenxi While we&#x27;re on it, can we get some negative energy for holidays in general? It bugs me that most people have no savings and then we have people just swanning around burning resources for fun. The waste of drawing hard-working people into the tourism sector when they could be working on improving their own communities directly is just appalling. Let alone the environmental damage caused by the travel and the lost productivity from people literally just having fun.Am I being sarcastic? Not even I am sure. The arguments are truthful. But the fairest way to organise things is that people who made a big economic contribution (represented by money) should be allowed to waste a similar-magnitude-but-smaller amount of resources. That is, ironically, the path to prosperity. reply swozey Did you see the backlash the Kardashians got over COVID and flying all their friends to private islands? It was pretty entertaining. reply bin_bash that tank thing isn&#x27;t a great example, even blue collar folk could pretty easily afford some of them. It&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper than a Disneyland hotel! reply swozey It&#x27;s on a $50million dollar ranch, dude. Where are you shooting your new blue collar tank? Your backyard? reply jjtheblunt what was this company he sold for so much? reply bratao HostGator reply swozey That&#x27;s incredibly impolite but I don&#x27;t really care. In the future there might be reasons people don&#x27;t directly name call something that should be a huge hint for you to not do it yourself to them. You aren&#x27;t swooping in like a white knight answering some searing question, you&#x27;re potentially throwing someone under the bus, CTO guy. You should know better.You literally added it after I posted my own response. I hope you&#x27;re proud answering the $10mil question when I clearly wasn&#x27;t going to. reply satvikpendem This is a weird response, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not public information, there&#x27;s nothing \"impolite\" about it. reply Forgotthepass8 Why are you afraid to name companies? reply swozey You literally just read my previous comment and went \"hmm, lets ask him to expound?\" My god, some people. reply swozey A webhost that was encroaching on godaddy popularity back then (nowhere near that now) reply mycentstoo I wish I understood why so many options are granted in the first place. If they offered 10,000 fewer options, would performance be any worse? Wouldn&#x27;t a lot of people be vying for that same position and couldn&#x27;t the company use that to drive down compensation? Couldn&#x27;t a company in fact, trade on the idea that the extra power and prestige offsets the need for additional stock compensation? And how much of the stock price change can be reduced to a CEO&#x27;s impact anyways? If it can&#x27;t be reduced, then why care so much as to overcompensate for their impact in the first place? reply opportune Sundar, like many other Google insiders, almost certainly has so much money he could just retire and live a life of luxury if he wanted to. And almost certainly he could probably choose a position within Alphabet with less responsibility like Chief Product Officer. To me it’s almost certainly a matter of the founders thinking he’s the best person in the world for the job of CEO and paying him a ton to justify the responsibility and stress of a position he could just decline.This will sound insane but $200mm at Google scale is not even that much. All in, it’s about the cost of having another 200 SWE org or increasing earnings by like 1%. If it’s enough to keep him happy it’s easily worth it reply Quarrelsome > it’s easily worth itbut is it really? How do we accurately measure CEO performance? We can barely measure developer productivity in any sort of meaningful fashion. Blowing $200m on what is effectively a faith based assessment seems a bit questionable. reply anurag6892 when dealing with 1%, what is the need for accurate measurements? they calibrate his pay to other CEOs in tech and other industries, and that is good enough. reply Sai_ > calibrate his payIt’s circular dependency if ever there was one. reply rubicon33 Honest to god, how hard do you think his job really is? How much of it simply comes down to just brokering connections afforded to him by his position? It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s responsible himself for generating truly novel and useful engineering deliverables. I seriously struggle to see how he possesses some talent that warrants his pay, vs. just being a lucky sob in a world where boards will shell out ridiculous checks on faith alone that if they don&#x27;t, earnings will suffer. reply opportune Pay is not about how hard any job is. My job is not nearly as hard as many people who make much less than me. It’s about the supply and demand of the role and how much value someone in the role can generate (which you can think of as an upper bound on pay). When you’re making decisions for >100k people earning >$100B&#x2F;year it’s easy to argue that the person trusted with that much responsibility provides that much value.I personally don’t think Sundar is an amazing CEO. He is very conservative and boring. But at the same time Google has tended to be too reckless and fund many projects with speculative ROI, or with no cohesive strategy. Google is making the shift to selling to enterprise and government where a level-headed conservative CEO inspires a lot more confidence than an ambitious reckless one. Also, they have one of the greatest businesses ever to exist (search ads) which, compared to any other >$100bb business, is a lot more precarious: it’s not contingent on long term enterprise contracts or lock-in or a physical moat (supply chain, brick and mortar presence).His job is to keep the golden goose laying eggs and to make sure Google succeeds the transition to enterprise software. Believe it or not he’s more qualified for the job than all the other SVPs at Google and because he’s well connected with the founders he’s not a wildcard like an outsider would be. reply tbihl The correct analogy is sports, so if you&#x27;re comparing CEO pay to salaried SWEs rather than European football stars, you&#x27;re going to distract yourself.Team Google is a juggernaut with the funds to match, so they see value in putting up the money to get the top performer. They don&#x27;t care how much luck the guy had to get where he is or how fair the pay is. They operate at a scale where small performance gains mean huge impact, so getting the guy who can make things go well (or who is less likely to drive the whole org off a cliff) is a bargain at any price. And let&#x27;s not pretend we all know how to be CEOs of giant companies. reply cudgy No one knows how to be CEO of a giant company until they do it, but there are many better qualified people that could perform that job for a whole lot less money. One could argue that taking such a huge pay increase immediately before laying off thousands of people is an example of poor CEO decision making skills, resulting in a loss of goodwill to the employees and potential future hires. The temporary $99 a night hotel deal for employees is an equally vivid middle finger to employees. reply bushbaba A 200 person swe org is not 200MM&#x2F;year of cost at google reply opportune In the highest comp regions (where new revenue generating projects almost always get staffed) it’s a common ballpark estimate of the allin cost of a SWE including all benefits, office, hiring, infra costs, ancillary roles. Consider that a senior SWE alone is pulling about $400k in direct comp. Also consider Google’s total spending per employee (not even just SWE) is about $1mm and many of those are not engineers or in high comp regions. Of course a new org with no big sales&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;compute costs will have different cost structure vs search ads but it really is a workable ballpark. reply bushbaba Google isn’t spending 1M on an employee making 400k. replycrazygringo To be clear, it&#x27;s an accounting artifact, NOT what he actually makes per year -- as the rest of the sentence might clue the reader into:> which marked a staggering 3,474% increase from the previous yearFor whatever reason, Google pays their CEO using a \"triennial\" stock award. It vests over 3 years.So just to be accurate, his yearly compensation is more like $75 MM. Still obviously a lot of money for anyone, but now a number that actually makes sense to compare with other CEO&#x27;s. reply thomasahle > So just to be accurate, his yearly compensation is more like $75 MM.But do you know he doesn&#x27;t get a new \"3 year vesting stock award\" every year? It seems like he was paid 3% less the year before.That&#x27;s normally the approach with vesting schedules like this, to stagger them, so there&#x27;s never a \"good time point\" for him to leave. reply TearsInTheRain CEOs at his level dont just leave on a whim. They have multi year transition plans. replyopportune If you are running something worth over $1 trillion that makes hundreds of billions of dollars per year it makes sense though, right? You can argue even a mediocre CEO could do ok, and I’d agree, but at the same time you could easily justify paying huge amounts of money to get a CEO who will only perform better by 1%&#x2F;year.To me it’s really the size of the big tech companies that’s mind boggling. The fact companies that didn’t, or barely, even existed 25 years ago can make hundreds of billions of dollars is just insane. reply pravus >If you are running something worth over $1 trillion that makes hundreds of billions of dollars per year it makes sense though, right?But he isn&#x27;t running it. He has legal control over it, but in terms of sweat equity he only gets 24 hours in the day like everyone else and you can&#x27;t tell me he somehow converts that to 1000x the labor of an average, capable, willing, working employee. reply tester756 > and you can&#x27;t tell me he somehow converts that to 1000x the labor of an average, capable, willing, working employee.Yes, I can&#x27;t tell you that because CEO isn&#x27;t about labor.I can tell you that impact of decisions of the CEO that I work for is at least 1000x bigger than mine.If you don&#x27;t believe that I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.CEO is not about writing lines of code, he doesn&#x27;t write 1000x more LoC than I do, but he has at least 1000x more impact than I do.You think great CEOs like Satya of MSFT or Dr. Lisa Su of AMD aren&#x27;t at least 1000x average employee? reply rpastuszak I think this misses one important point though: why would any human being need this amount of money and could these resources be allocated better? If we look more broadly than a single employee or a single business entity fwiw, this feels like a huge waste of resources. reply satvikpendem Compensation is not about need, it&#x27;s about supply and demand. If I as a Google shareholder could pay 225 million to receive billions in profit and thereby drive up the stock price and my stock value, then I&#x27;ll take that deal, and that&#x27;s how every other shareholder thinks, too. Because if not, then they could simply vote to not pay for the CEO&#x27;s compensation. reply erik_seaberg We want our best decision makers launching and backing companies, not retiring because that&#x27;s all they&#x27;re able to do. Musk and Bezos need more competition. reply effingwewt JFC, stop putting them on a pedestal.I&#x27;ve said this before but it bears repeating: CEO&#x27;s aren&#x27;t special. Bob Iger came back to Disney to finish it off. Shit, look at Elizabeth Holmes.No one deserves that much of a multiple over the people actually creating products or value.When CEO&#x27;s fail they get golden parachutes. When they get lucky they are praised as some sort of rare superhuman.The cult of CEO and HR needs to wither and die reply opportune Sure, but he decides how to allocate resources, make acquisitions, etc. across over 100k employees. If he decided to pull another Google+ he could easily destroy many tens of thousands of engineers’ worth of labor. And it’d only take him a few hundred hours to make that decision, set up the org to lead the project and delegate the execution to them. Putting those engineers on something that actually makes money and is a viable business like Cloud could do the opposite.It’s not about the time it takes him to make these decisions so much as the quality of his decisions having potentially massive $ impacts on the company’s performance. reply Klinky None of that is really his call to make alone, upper management & the board also has influence & burdens much of the load. This idea that he&#x27;s the only man in the room or on the planet that could do this position seems pretty absurd. reply cudgy Any moron knew it was time to invest in da Cloud once AWS was successful. I’d expect more interesting ideas than the old tried and true “get some lucrative government and enterprise contracts”, “guess we better dust off our AI tech and react to OpenAI”, etc. He seems to be a reactionary not a visionary. reply WalterBright Jobs and Nadella certainly did contribute more than 1000x the labor of a [...] employee. reply Klinky How? Jobs did have some original ideas, but it&#x27;s not like NeXT was a resounding success on its own that toppled Apple & Microsoft. Being the ideas guy is different than the implementation guy, and in some cases he was neither. reply WalterBright Jobs turned 90-days-bankruptcy Apple into the wealthiest company in the world. reply cscurmudgeon He pays 1000x taxes too, does he use 1000x more resources of the country? reply jayd16 Its not like the individuals actually need the money like, perhaps, a new product line would. Its just about getting paid the most. If you look at it that way, we would do well to deepen the progressive tax. reply sinatra Just to be fair, for 90% of the world, the kinds of compensation many hacker news readers have (a Silicon Valley engineer who gets a high base plus bonus plus equity) would also be considered “holy guacamole, whatever is the angle I look at it … does not make any f_ing sense” reply abeppu Honestly, I get that.I work at a company with engineers mostly in the US and in an EU country, and my understanding is that, though our salaries in that EU country are top of the range, they are still meaningfully lower than for US engineers. The international talent pool is very good, and available at considerable savings. While I am glad I have my job, and that companies still seem willing to pay Bay Area salaries, I don&#x27;t fully get why. reply jayd16 If you look at the cost of living in SF and what you get, it starts to make sense. What is the equivalent argument for hundreds of millions? reply oars Janitors, baristas, waiters, waitresses, bus drivers are also living in the Bay Area on nowhere close to those salaries.SF engineer salaries are still insane to these people. And they need to deal with the cost of living in SF. reply cscurmudgeon Why should there be a justification? The only argument should be between Google and Pichai.Strangely, why aren&#x27;t we doing the same for actors and sports stars? reply cudgy Poor example. How many people bought or used a tech product solely based on the CEO of the company? Virtually noneHow many movies do people attend solely based on the actors in the movie? Or sporting events due to a player on a team? Many reply bmitc That is a fair critique and overall true. But it also highlights the pay of these CEOs to be so absurd as to be barely comprehensible. It makes me wonder what types of personalities these people are. If I even had that salary for a year, max three, I&#x27;d retire and spend time learning and doing non-profit and foundation work. reply welshwelsh That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll never make CEO pay. Most people, myself included, will happily retire with a couple million.A lot of these people have ambitions that require a lot more money than that. Maybe they want to cure aging or explore space or something.Another way of looking at it: if someone makes 100m a year and they are thinking about retiring, how much would you need to offer for them to choose to work another year instead? That&#x27;s how much you need to pay them next year. reply bmitc And it&#x27;s honestly not really anything to do with retirement. It&#x27;s about doing something with my life that isn&#x27;t just following someone else&#x27;s ideas, who just happens to be higher in the pecking order than me. reply bmitc Has there ever been a case of a CEO singularly or even collectively achieving said ambitions? No. A lot of these people are cut throat, near sociopaths in personality. I guess we should be lucky they&#x27;re just CEOs. If they&#x27;re not of that personality, it&#x27;s often largely due to luck. James Simons, who has had a large impact via his foundation work, in which he ensures funding for people to drive their own ideas versus his, readily and humbly admits that luck is very underappreciated in success. reply ghaff People for whom being an important executive is at least almost as important as having as much money as they can reasonably consume.Certainly there’s a vast range of FIRE styles and even what constitutes retirement but at some level it’s a combination of keeping score, feeling valued relative to peers (see also sports), and the industry recognition. reply bmitc In other words: ego. Executives exist to play a game of ego. reply SteveNuts And then you get guys like Bill McGuire who get caught backdating stock options. His punishment? A $1.6Bn golden parachute of course.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;William_W._McGuire#UnitedHea... reply jvmfjvfjvf He did not get a golden parachute. He was compensated that amount over time. He grew a company from $400MM in revenues to $70Bn and was rewarded $1.6Bn for it. I fail to see any issue with this. reply SteveNuts I mean, he broke the law. I&#x27;d consider every dime of his payout to be ill gotten gains. reply Nifty3929 I imagine the shareholders and board members that approve these pay packages are rational, self-motivated actors who believe that doing so is in their best interest.Also, keep in mind that the terms are determined well in advance if these payouts, and tied to stock price or performance. So if the stock does well the amount can be very high, or if the stock does poorly then it can be (relatively) much lower.And since layoffs hopefully mean that society is getting equivalent output (ads, I guess?) with correspondingly less input (labor), it’s not a sign of weakness or mistake when they are implemented. reply ralph84 The shareholders have all delegated their voting rights to money managers who don’t care as long as they keep getting a percentage of assets under management and the board members are all obscenely paid executives at other companies who don’t care as long they keep the executive pay cartel going. reply ActorNightly >whatever is the angle I look at it 225MM pear year does not make any f_ing sense to meWhenever a company starts, its not like the salary is auto set at 225M. The salary of the CEO is tied to the stock price to incentivize growth. Initially CEOs make way, way lower amounts (ignoring bullshit VC capital and inflated salaries).If it so happens that the stock goes up with growth, then the increase in salary represents the responsibility amount that the CEO has, as bad decisions can cost lots of peoples jobs and so on.Whenever you have market upswings that cause these ridiculously high 225M, its in a weird way the people saying the CEO wants to get paid that much. People spend more money that they have due to wfh and stimulus (granted by the people and who they vote for), causing revenues to go up, causing investment capital to go up (with a tieback to people putting money in things like 401k that depend on this as well), causing the market to go up, and so on.TLDR, its not optimal, but it makes sense. reply cudgy “ then the increase in salary represents the responsibility amount that the CEO has, as bad decisions can cost lots of peoples jobs and so on.”He made bad decisions that caused people to lose jobs and they knew this well before the layoffs were announced. So he gets a raise and continued support? reply hanniabu > The salary of the CEO is tied to the stock price to incentivize growthIf it were a more reasonable amount I would agree, but with the amount they&#x27;re given they could do a piss poor job, tank the stock value 90%, and still come out with $22M.... not much of an incentive reply ShowalkKama only 5 or 6?4k a month is way more than the average person makes in my country, that&#x27;s 3.84M for 80 years.225 &#x2F; 3.84 = 58.59 peoplethere is no fucking way you can justify that number but oh well, what can you do about it? reply Davidzheng Each generation can have more than one person reply satvikpendem To shareholders (including many of us on HN, even), it&#x27;s an investment of 225 million to receive profits of billions, thereby increasing the stock price for us. It makes perfect sense from that lens. If I could pay 1 dollar to turn it into 1000 dollars, I&#x27;d take that deal every time. reply cudgy If only you actually knew that he was the reason for that increase in performance. reply satvikpendem I do know it because I&#x27;ve also been in places where CEOs essentially destroyed the entire business. Just as absolute power in kings can create despots or benevolent dictators, so too can it occur in the chief executive officer. reply AndrewKemendo The entire purpose of compensation like this at the highest levels is to ensure that no other possible group could incentivize you to betray in any way the board or shareholdersThink about it like they are paying based on the question of: how much does it cost to keep this person protecting all of our Crown Jewels AND will never support unionization or anything that gives meaningful power to employees?The bigger the risk to shareholders if something goes wrong with the stock, or if the CEO defected to a competitor, the more pay they offer. reply ocdtrekkie It&#x27;s stunning how you can make that much money while also pretty much completely burning the company to the ground. Destroyed nearly all trust with consumers, the core product is mostly a joke, every legal jurisdiction out there has a case against Google pending, and oh, yeah, even Google&#x27;s own employees have been shaken by the layoffs and many of the usual shills for the company have gone quiet because, well, they stopped getting paid.If CEO pay is supposed to have any relationship to actual outcome, dude should be long gone, not be getting salary increases.Sure, shareholders have gotten some short term gains, but the company no longer has a positive long-term outlook. reply jvmfjvfjvf 225MM is not salary. It is stock compensation based on performance. reply RugnirViking A distinction without a difference. Nobody is getting cash in that amount reply jvmfjvfjvf There is a huge difference, If Google stock underperforms, he is not getting that compensation unlike salaried folks. reply hanniabu Stock fluctuations are irrelevant with this amount... stock could tank 20% and here&#x27;s still getting $175M reply jvmfjvfjvf The stock would be worth less than his options price. Why would he still get $175M? reply djcapelis They’re not options, they’re grants of stock units which vest over time. A unit of stock is a share granted and vesting at its full price, not an option to buy stock at some price later.While startups use options, most large public tech companies typically do not. replymycentstoo Aren&#x27;t there too many variables to reduce stock movement to a single individual? reply PartiallyTyped The claim is that you want the CEO to be aligned with the shareholders, and therefore you incentivize them with high salaries.Who cares about future shareholders or consequences for that matter when you earn 225MM ? Go move to some country that doesn&#x27;t tax capital gains, sell it all, and live on 4% of it, which is 9MM per year; live like a king, buy absurd amounts of land and multiply your passive income. Obscene is an understatement. reply vouaobrasil That makes sense to you and me but...if the world were only populated by people who were happy to just have enough to live a comfortable life as soon as they could, or even a very rich life as soon as they could cash out, then we would not have half the insanity we do today. And Sundar Pinchai and other CEOs could have quit a long time ago if they wanted to do that. If I were in the place of ANY CEO today of Google, Microsoft, Facebook, of course I would quit immediately with far LESS money and do something else....but they don&#x27;t, speaking of the incredible pathology that lies within them. reply ethanbond Not to mention you can keep CEOs “aligned with shareholders” by firing them if they behave in ways that are misaligned. reply PartiallyTyped CEOs usually don&#x27;t join without a golden parachute, and shareholders seem to only care about immediate gains.To see the insanity, Selipsky in Q1 AWS all hands was talking about growth of the rate of growth, i.e. second order. Not steady income, not income increasing (which is already exponential across years), but super-exponential; i.e. 20% , then 25%, then 30% growth.Who cares about sustainable and organic growth! We have to milk those pesky engineers and all our customers! reply s1artibartfast You can&#x27;t move countries to avoid capital gains. reply JJMcJ What often happens is that corporation in high tax country has subsidiary in low tax country that they find a way to funnel profits too.Not sure on details myself. It has to be done just right.I believe Ireland and the Netherlands are often host countries.Now this is different than money laundering, which is big time illegal, of course. reply s1artibartfast I think you&#x27;re talking about the double Irish corporate inversion loophole, which applied to multinational companies, and was closed 10 years ago.As a US individual you get taxed no matter where in the world you live, and you must pay capital gains on all of your assets before giving up citizenship reply JJMcJ I believe the Netherlands one, which I don&#x27;t fully understand, is still in place. reply seneca > What often happens is that corporation in high tax country has subsidiary in low tax country that they find a way to funnel profits too.That has nothing to do with individual taxes. reply ultrasaurus In the US, different states have different rates. At X00,000,000 he&#x27;s basically all in the top bracket so ~13.3% in California (it&#x27;s taxed as income), other states have lower, some states have 0%. reply PartiallyTyped Why not? I know in Poland I am not taxed until I sell the stock; and if I am out of the country for X amount of time, I am not considered a taxed resident.I am fairly certain the US is different, but I know that I can do that in Europe. reply jimbob45 I guess the counterargument would be that the $225MM is imaginary money - he doesn’t actually make that much until he cashes out and cashing out at the wrong times is what we should actually condemn.That said, the rules for stock, stock ownership, and splits are all made up on the fly anyway so I don’t want to defend any of this. Stock dilution in particular seems like legal theft. reply whitepaint Google is a $1.6T company. For a guy that runs it to earn $200 M a year is basically nothing. Can he do good enough of job? Great, he&#x27;s then definitely worth it (and, actually, he&#x27;s worth much more). reply empyrrhicist > (and, actually, he&#x27;s worth much more).Bullshit. Fucking nonsense, bullshit.I fail to understand how thinking people could ever believe that this is true - it&#x27;s got to be innumeracy and a healthy dose of propaganda. Would Google lose the now-equivalent of 200m annual if any one of the top 100 leaders within the corp ascended to the goddamned throne? Fuck no. It&#x27;s nonsense to believe any one person is worth compensating at that level. reply Aunche Keep in mind Google executive compensation appears to be biannual (his compensation in 2021 was 6M). Overall, his compensation for the past 2 years is less than .05% of Google&#x27;s revenue during the same period. If the performance of a Google CEO even slightly better or worse Pichai going to have a much larger impact on Google than 225M. I&#x27;m sure plenty of the top 100 leaders at Google would be better than Pichai, but others would be worse and shareholders can&#x27;t distinguish who until after the fact, so they saw Pichai as the best option. reply empyrrhicist You&#x27;ve inadvertently highlighted the actual problem - our economic system allows for megaliths like Google to exist and dominate, and we can&#x27;t help but measure everything against them.Like, run the clock forward and imagine Google monopolizes half of GDP. Should the CEO be compensated as a percentage of that? It&#x27;s a fallacious view - how many super hard working and ultra educated people could be recruited to that post for, oh, say a cool 1M per year with a good retirement plan and no stock nonsense. Tons - a huge list of people who don&#x27;t have the right connections to sit atop the money pyramid. reply ztrww > how many super hard working and ultra educated peopleBoth attributes seem to be somewhat tangentially related to being a highly successful CEO.There are plenty of examples of “super hard working” and educated CEOs running their companies to the ground and costing much, much more than just $200 million.. reply jvmfjvfjvf What are your thoughts on NFL player Josh Allen having a $250MM contract? I fail to understand why there is more controversy over CEO pay than athletes. reply empyrrhicist I don&#x27;t follow sports, but at least those people are doing actual, physically comparable things with clear connections to revenue (more like music artists than CEOs).Maybe that analogy is more apt than you intended though, in that the valuations are made for shallow human&#x2F;society reasons that are quite decoupled from reality. reply jvmfjvfjvf There are many players who don&#x27;t live up to their $100MM+ contracts. I fail to understand why physicality should be relevant to high compensation. reply evandale > There are many players who don&#x27;t live up to their $100MM+ contracts.Do you have examples? The ticket sales alone that big name players drive to home games make far more than 100MM over the course of their contacts.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;294166&#x2F;toronto-blue-jays...That doesn&#x27;t even include all the merchandise and the food&#x2F;drink sales and all the other benefits that come from signing big name stars. The CEO of a company doesn&#x27;t have the same \"star\" power a pro athlete, musician, or actor has. reply rubicon33 Physicality is far more measurable in its results than the product of a thousands strong multi-national company.In other words one can pretty clearly attribute the performance of an athlete to said athletes talents and ability. In the case of the CEO making the same money, it&#x27;s much harder to measure their performance, and even harder to attribute the success of the company to their direct performance. This point becomes even more true as companies grow in scale, such as Google has done. reply ztrww > it&#x27;s much harder to measure their performanceThat doesn’t mean that their performance can’t significantly affect their companies stock price to a much higher degree than similarly paid athletes could.> Physicality is far more measurableWho cares. Do you believe that only people whose output could be precisely measured should be highly compensated?Of course there is a lot of inefficiency considering Pichai seems to be a very poor CEO who’s quite replaceable. reply bugglebeetle If Sundar Pichai ever had to compete against other companies at the level of an NFL player, vs. be asleep at the wheel of Google’s money-printing advertising monopoly, he would immediately crumple. This is obvious in their fumbling all the AI stuff, half of which they invented. reply raincole Because it&#x27;s easier to measure an athlete&#x27;s performance than to measure a CEO&#x27;s.And athletes usually have no right to fire people (at least not a lot of people at once). reply evandale You don&#x27;t think LeBron has any say in the teammates they sign?Tom Brady famously got Gronk out of retirement and Brown was on the team because of Brady despite having a horrible reputation and being essentially blacklisted from the NFL.Star players are a dime a dozen in professional sports and I don&#x27;t think their influence on the team makeup is as rare as you think. In fact, a big name star might have _more_ hiring power than a typical CEO in a public company. reply kibwen Attempting to change the subject doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this obscene compensation amounts to stealing from the pockets of his own employees. Rather than structuring Google as a dictatorship, how about we structure it as a democracy and ask Googlers what they think the CEO should be paid, at their own expense. Do you think they would come up with a number that is less or more than the current figure? reply ztrww Which would likely end with only being able to hire significantly less competent CEOs than other companies.Only on average over long term of course. There is quite a lot of variance considering how useless someone like Pichai seems to be. reply mkarrmann Why&#x27;s it so hard to believe that a worse CEO for one year would result in a 0.01% lower market cap? Given that framing, 200m is a very drastic under estimation. reply empyrrhicist It&#x27;s not hard to believe. What&#x27;s hard to believe is that you couldn&#x27;t possibly find a better CEO for a much more modest compensation package. reply mkarrmann I share that intuition, although I don&#x27;t see any reason to trust the intuition of an outside (either myself or presumably yourself) making 2 second back-of-envelope calculations of that of the Alphabet board. reply scyzoryk_xyz That “he runs” it is entirely made up as well. It’s a $1.6T company - one person doesn’t run the show.Is he worth more? Is he worth less? Literally all of this stuff is not anyone’s business outside of their company and their stakeholders. We can’t truly have a clue what doing a “good job” is with them, or what the compensation should be.They want to ruthlessly hire-fire talent - it’s all entirely on them as a company. Being outraged about any of it is just as naïve as buying into the idea that their monopolies are built on merit and not on elite credentials and pedigree required to join the club.For what it’s worth, I think the enormous payouts are there so that these guys’ judgement and decision making is 100% directed only on the company’s value and well-bring. They’re supposed to be in-bribeable. replybradleyjg Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was awarded compensation worth more than $225 million in 2022, which marked a staggering 3,474% increase from the previous year, making him the nation’s highest-paid CEO, according to Equilar data.There’s a whole rabbit hole to go down, but CEO compensation is not well defined. In this case it’s likely that Pichai was granted options with a multiyear vesting schedule, plus perhaps performance targets, and the entire net present value is being counted for 2022. Meanwhile he likely vested substantial options in 2021, but since it was granted in a prior year it’s not counted as compensation in that year.This kind of accounting makes for extremely lumpy numbers and the evergreen opportunity to write articles about 3400% increases!!1! I don’t think it’s a particularly useful way to think about executive compensation and we shouldn’t pay attention to such articles. reply HDThoreaun I disagree. Yes we should think about option grants differently, but not that differently. At the end of the day I don&#x27;t think anyone would say Sundar has been that much better than his replacement level CEO. Certainly not better enough to deserve 225 million in equity. The stock is up 10% this year, still below 2021 levels. reply anurag6892 why should he be better than replacement level CEO? why can&#x27;t we assume 225 million is what an average CEO running a Google sized company deserves? Like how we accept 300-500K is what an average Google SWE deserves? reply bradleyjg Do you think he “actually” earned less than one million in 2021? Because that’s what accepting this framing means.Did his pay actually increase? We don’t know.Maybe I’m an odd duck, but I expect journalists to journalist. reply somewhereoutth Probably we can argue the rights and wrongs of individual cases, but surely now is the time for swinging wealth taxes. Clearly the system has got out of control, and everyday people are suffering while the rich lead gilded lives.50% on everything over say 2MM, into a sovereign wealth fund. Prison for attempts at evasion.Maybe next year we won&#x27;t do another 50% on what they have left. reply 23B1 I&#x27;ve been working on a solution for this, have pitched a handful of investors and every time I&#x27;m met with blank stares, probably because what I&#x27;m proposing would cut into their own dividends.I know this comment will get lost in the sauce, but if you know an investor who is brave, cares about staving off the forthcoming proletarian revolution, I&#x27;d love to hear your ideas. reply charles_f I don&#x27;t know one but I&#x27;m curious to hear about it reply whimsicalism I am extremely skeptical that at the higher levels of CEO pay there is any marginal utility.I just don’t think the improved management quality you get from an additional $1M is actually making the company more than $1M in profits. Seems like a failure of markets reply JJMcJ When Ford went public around 1956, the man who ran that got $250,000, about $2.8 million today, with much higher taxes than today. But he also got a thank you letter from Henry Ford II, so he had that going for him.That was the largest IPO at the time, very complicated. I believe all the shares offered publicly were held by the Ford Foundation, for complicated tax and dynastic reasons.But the main point here is how little the manager of the offering received. Imagine that today. $2.8 million would be nothing. reply opportune $1mm&#x2F;year is such a drop in the bucket for a company making $100,00mm&#x2F;year it almost doesn’t matter.It’s not about the marginal benefits of paying the same guy just a tiny bit more anyhow, it’s about paying that guy enough that he doesn’t just decide to retire, or run a competing company, or start his own. Imagine if you think some guy is the most qualified person in the world to run your company, even if they only do a 1% better job growing revenue than the second best or “average”, when your revenue is measured in the hundreds of billions it’s easy to justify paying them such huge quantities of money. reply medvezhenok The answer is actually antitrust and to break up Google (and other Tech giants) into smaller pieces. That should lower his compensation by a bit, since his individual power would be lower.Yes, we would lose some synergies, but we would gain in terms of a more equitable society. Sometimes more stuff is not better. reply whimsicalism Right, I understand the justifications for CEO pay. I am just saying that I absolutely do not believe that for large public companies he is 1% better than the second choice. reply opportune Google as it grew basically had two tiers of outcomes for insiders. The inner circle of insiders like Sundar and Susan had Google grow “under” them so they stayed near the top. A lot of this inner circle has either retired or left, isn’t fit to run the company (some of the purely technical folks) because of their skills, or was forced out because they did bad controversial things (there’s a joke that Sundar won by default because he was the only one that didn’t try to dip his pen in company ink).The other early employees and insiders got layered with outside middle management as Google grew.Since Google is basically controlled by the founders still there are actually very few people left who are qualified on paper to run the company, already work at Google, and have the trust of founders. Now I’m not saying that means nobody could do better than Sundar, but I do think the founders earnestly believe he is 1% better than any second choice. reply whimsicalism I agree, but I think this reveals how dual class voting structures lead to market failures which is already well studied.The founders believe he is 1% better, but what do the markets believe? reply bobthepanda I mean, nobody has really solved succession planning in any industry, and tech is still quite young. And the markets often guess wrong about which successors will do well. See: Disney and its failure to get a decent successor to Bob Iger replyvouaobrasil That might be true if the goal were to maximize the profits and long-term health of companies to deliver value to society. It&#x27;s more as though the goal is to maximize shareholder wealth and minimize the dependence on expensive employees by encouraging a bitter atmosphere that in turn results in high turnover, which is in turn good for profits because it uses up the best 5-10 years of a young person&#x27;s life in generating new ideas before they wake up and realize that they are not in any way contributing to the good of society. reply liftIO > $225 million in 2022, which marked a staggering 3,474% increase from the previous yearThis is obviously a \"creative\" calculation done in order to get the highest number possible, which makes the best clickbait. I&#x27;m disappointed that so many Hacker News commenters are stupid enough to fall for this. reply baazaa I don&#x27;t mind inequality but I hate this is always framed as &#x27;the market&#x27; at work. There is no market here, there&#x27;s no price discovery, and the people actually paying Pinchai&#x27;s salary (shareholders) have incredibly little say in the matter. No economist would ever assume governments exclusively act in the public&#x27;s best interest, but it&#x27;s bizarrely common to assume boards and senior executives act in the shareholders&#x27; best interest. reply jtode It&#x27;s become tiresome, reading things that pretend this is not business as usual. reply vouaobrasil Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing to repeat it again and again so we can see how ridiculous it is. Sometimes people really need to be hit on the head. reply jvmfjvfjvf Why is it ridiculous when NFL and NBA players have $500MM contracts? Why shouldn&#x27;t Google be allowed to pay these large contracts too? reply jtode You&#x27;re conflating two kinds of people: one type is very talented and perhaps overpaid, the other has connections and has never done a shred of actual productive work in their life. reply jvmfjvfjvf Sundar Pichai managed many successful Google products before he became CEO. reply jtode I said work, not sit in a boardroom. reply bmitc What were they? Aren&#x27;t most core Google products on rails, even getting slightly worse over time? And the non-core products just get buried in the desert. reply somsak2 Feel free to find this information on Wikipedia. reply bmitc Oh, sorry. I thought this was a discussion forum. reply satvikpendem Discussion requires modica of effort on both sides. Don&#x27;t ask an easily googleable (hah) question on a discussion forum, they&#x27;re not question and answer sites. reply warning26 And after he became CEO, he has presided over exactly zero successful Google products! reply charles_f This is a pure \"what about\" argument. Both of these examples are ridiculous. reply klyrs If I kicked a puppy every day for 20 years, it would be “business as usual\" if I were to kick a puppy today. That doesn&#x27;t make it okay to kick puppies. reply somsak2 Do you also find it reprehensible if people eat meat? Much worse things than just kicking of animals happens in the delivery of that food to us. reply charles_f What&#x27;s tiresome is that this is business as usual, not the fact that it&#x27;s reported on. You can remain outraged to something profoundly unjust even if it&#x27;s the systemic norm. reply jtode What we have here is a case of \"English Detective\" style journalism, when what this particular epoch requires is more \"Hard Boiled Detective\" journalism.The English Detective - Miss Marple, Holmes, Poirot (Belgian, but he is an English Detective archetype) - exists within a stable and permanent social system, class-based, in which all are basically happy with their lot, aside from a few malcontents and neerdowells, who sometimes try to cheat their way into power or privilege that is not theirs to have.It is the job of the English Detective to root out this degenerate from the ranks of the decent, expose him to the world and the nearby incorruptible agents of the law (funnier if read in an Inspector Clouseau accent), and restore the harmony and justice of the status quo, and perhaps attend a wedding of two young lovers that he has reunited through his genius efforts to expose the truth!That&#x27;s who this writer is.We also have another kind of Literary Detective, that of the Hard Boiled genre from about the 30s-50s, approximately. The Hard Boiled detective, based in cheap pulp novels and most famously played onscreen by Bogart as characters like Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon) and Philip Marlowe (The Big Sleep), is usually living in the USA or some even less lawful place, and exists in a world of inherent corruption all around him. Like the Victorian Detective, he is a creature of this world and fully adapted to its conventions, but he also retains some form of stripped-down basic integrity that he uses as his own yardstick of what is acceptable and what goes too far, even for him.When someone goes too far over the line, the Hard Boiled detective takes it as a matter of necessity, and possibly honor or respect, to deal with it, but the most important thing about a Hard Boiled mystery is that he is not really trying to \"fix\" anything. In The Maltese Falcon, Spade sticks his neck out in the first place strictly because someone kills his business partner; murdering someone who has distanced themselves from the shenanigans of the establishment is a good example of something the Hard Boiled detective has no choice but to do something about, and that is why the story, a fantastic story by the way, exists.It&#x27;s not that I see myself as Hard Boiled here, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I want a Douglas Adams future, not a Blade Runner future. But, to write about Capitalism - because what we&#x27;re talking about is Capitalism, whether you like that fact or not - from the perspective of the English Detective, the defender of the established and perfect system of justice in society - is not the perspective that leads to action about anything. We are living in thoroughly Hard Boiled times, we all know it, and we have no use for a fucking Poirot just now.The writer needs to point out that CEOs are murdering people this summer in Arizona, by sending their dogs to Washington to block action on Climate Change, which has tornadoes touching down up here in Canada now by the way, and subjecting the Southwest - which has a lot of poor people in it - to a summer of death for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have AC or whose AC breaks down and cannot get outside to some shade.He needs to point out that someone who has distanced themselves from the shenanigans of the establishment - an infirm grandmother living on a pension in downtown Phoenix, perhaps, with only a small fan to cool her, and no ability to get up and walk outside, and all her family in other cities - has been murdered for profit. Because none of the people who are going to die that death in America this summer, deserve that particular death. That is the sort of thing that the Hard Boiled detective cannot simply sit behind his desk and opine about, that&#x27;s something that he has to get up and make something happen about.Now, the Hard Boiled detective, after he has cracked the case, generally hands over the evidence whatever perpetrators are still alive to the authorities - the corrupt authorities, who because of his work have no choice but to prosecute them or face The Press - but it was never his goal to shore them up or help them to perpetuate their system; he was pursuing his own sense of honor, one that is at odds with the reigning hegemonic rhetoric, and which would not have been serviced if not for his sometimes-legally-questionable methods. This Poirot here is expecting the incorruptible agents of the law to swoop in and deal with this, and boyo, just shut up if that&#x27;s all you got.Cause what we need right now, is people with a sense of honor and justice that is completely at odds with the Capitalist system and ready to say murder when it&#x27;s clearly murder, however many degrees of separation they put between their lobbying, their layoffs, their union squashing, their endless need to surveil us all, etc etc.I know I&#x27;m not speaking to those people in this forum, but I am speaking for them. reply baby I know for a fact that people in the Csuite of medium size companies can easily make 400k&#x2F;month total comp (specifically if they’re public companies, but private companies have outrageous paychecks also). Not even talking about the CEO, and not even talking about FAANGs and similar companies. Chances are that the leadership team of your company is making an absurd amount of money. reply JJMcJ Writer named Graef Crystal, who for many years had been a compensation advisor to executives who were negotiating their employment contracts, estimated that each extra dollar the CEO received ended up costing the corporation $32. Extra pay to other C-Suite occupants so they can keep pace with the CEO, more elaborate staffs, more lavish travel.So it absolutely is not a rounding error. reply bambataa That’s $5m&#x2F;y.Nick Clegg makes not much more for being Facebook’s global punching bag.Not doubting your sources but why are they so generous? reply kibwen Maybe Google employees should take a vote and replace their C-suite with an AI. It would pay for itself within days.And yet, somehow, why do I get the funny feeling that of all the jobs that will be made obsolete by AI, \"CEO\" somehow isn&#x27;t one of them? reply gkoberger This isn&#x27;t really a surprise.We&#x27;ve created a society that depends on growth. CEOs sign up for a job where they&#x27;re responsible for growing a company, so they&#x27;re obviously the type to value growth and want more for themsleves too – there&#x27;s not a lot of CEOs who do it out of the goodness of their hearts. The investors, from the board down to individual nameless shareholders, all demand more money every quarter... even the employees want growth so their equity is worth more and they can get a raise.I don&#x27;t think most people are Gordon Gekko types... it&#x27;s mostly normal people who depend on a 401k or a pension or their house to appreciate in value. Even just cost-of-living salary adjustments is a form of growth. That money has to come from somewhere.There&#x27;s no limit to the growth; there&#x27;s no Good Enough. Nobody at Apple or Amazon has ever said \"Hey, we did it, we won capitalism! Congrats!\". There&#x27;s always more to grow. There&#x27;s literally no incentives for anyone, from employee to investor to CEO, to do anything but maximize growth. We don&#x27;t celebrate companies that don&#x27;t do layoffs, and the ones who do take a quick hit followed by a WSJ article the following quarter talking about how they hit their revenue goals.It&#x27;s a depressing treadmill that keeps speeding up. But my point is... this is a symptom of a much bigger mindset we have, mainly in America. We all read this and are upset, but we are propping it up indirectly... via stock portfolios, 401ks, pensions, salary, equity, etc. Growth is good! But unbridled, never-ending growth is exhausting. reply Brybry I don&#x27;t think this is true for all of us, possibly not even for most people in the US.I know plenty of people who took lower paying jobs because they valued other things more than \"growth\": quality of life, family, passion, etc.I know people who have enough to meet their needs and are not actively working towards having more.People who retire by \"aging in place\" who do not care about the value of their home because they have no intention of selling it while they&#x27;re alive. reply Calavar I think this is somewhat naive. The growth mindset pervades the entire economy, and virtually everyone&#x27;s interests are bound into it one way or another.Yes, of course there are people who prioritize lifestyle over chasing money. No one will debate that. But if those people&#x27;s retirement plans are dependent on a 401k or drawing payments from a pension fund and not just cash savings, then they are amongst the growth-obsessed shareholders, whether they realize it or not. reply gkoberger Yup, this was the point I was trying to make, and you made it much better.I think 99.9% of people have good intentions. But so much of everything we do depends on growth without us even realizing it. reply t_serpico To add on to this, unbridled capitalism also leads to more goods and services affordable for the average consumer. This makes the idea of taking a lower paying job appealing because you can still live a fairly comfortable life. reply paulryanrogers Is it unbridled that accomplishes that? Before regulations and unions people worked more hours per week, even children, and were exploited to a criminal degree. Mostly the profits went to capital owners. Collective assets like the environment suffered. Progress was certainly made and highly visible, yet at great cost. reply somsak2 > Mostly the profits went to capital ownersprobably not the best example, today this is much worse vs. during the early days of the Industrial Revolution reply blackbear_ > more goods and services affordable for the average consumerThe one key missing ingredient for this is competition. Without competition there is just a monopoly&#x2F;cartel, leading to rent seeking behavior and products&#x2F;services with too low quality and too high prices. reply ericd I think one of the challenges is that if a society gets richer around you, and you don’t, then normal services get more expensive as people demand higher salaries to do the same things, and houses get more expensive. reply hgs3 \"Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.\" ~ Edward AbbeyWhat irks me is lots of products are \"done\" but continue to receive pointless changes - whether that be UX changes, half-backed features, or regressions in functionality. And for what? So the marketing department has something to market, so engineers can justify their continued employment?This problem isn&#x27;t limited to the business world either. Even in the open source community there is a tendency to assume that if a project isn&#x27;t receiving regular code changes, then it must be \"dead\" or \"unsupported\" when in actuality it _might_ be a sign the project is mature and stable. reply paulryanrogers In the case of FOSS the reputation for old being worse has something to do with ever evolving platforms.You can still use unchanged GNU utilities and apps from the mid 90&#x27;s. But you&#x27;d have to run it with layers of emulation or shims. And it couldn&#x27;t handle newer formats or protocols. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 The treadmill is entirely opt-in. Why do you participate? Your profile says that you are a founder. reply gkoberger Because you can both participate in society and be critical of it at the same time. I am a founder, but we&#x27;ve worked hard to focus on profitability and staying healthy. I started a company because I wanted a place where people could feel safe, do good work, and as much as possible not worry about the things I detailed.(I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s opt-in. If everyone around you makes more money and you don&#x27;t, you have decreasing buying power. You need to grow just to stay neutral.) reply jokoon I&#x27;m tired of capitalism.The less it&#x27;s regulated, the more it opens the road to planned economy or tightly managed socialism.I&#x27;m glad I live in Europe. At least I can just retreat from this system with welfare and still eat and have a roof.Every time alternatives to capitalism are brought up, every time people come and say Stalin was worst than Hitler. It&#x27;s impossible to discuss change or alternatives. reply zmnd You are saying like it&#x27;s any different in Europe. Dassault Systèmes CEO Bernard Charlès makes €20.6m with company revenue of $6.05 billion. For reference, Google CEO made $226 million (~10x) with company revenue of $279.8 billions (~46x). reply xcdzvyn I really wish there were some platform to responsibly argue things. It could also offer establishing axioms to build arguments out from and whatnot.I&#x27;m not aware of anywhere for people to argue their positions on most things in a civil manner. reply slowmovintarget The problem is not capitalism. The problem is perverse incentives of Wall Street.Why did these CEOs get huge pay bumps? They improved their primary product: shares of the company. So many of these publicly traded companies don&#x27;t have the product or service they claim to sell as their highest-priority market. Instead it is the stock market that has become their primary concern which incentivizes short term \"value\" extraction over everything else, including viability of the company&#x27;s goods sold in consumer markets.I don&#x27;t know how we put the genie back in the bottle. Perhaps taxing capital gains from securities as income?Were these companies private, they wouldn&#x27;t have hired to trend, and fired to trend. They would have ensured their focus on their actual product, and their ability to continue to compete and deliver it.I don&#x27;t know why Apple seems able to do this. Perhaps they&#x27;ve just hit escape velocity. reply hgs3 > I&#x27;m tired of capitalism.I&#x27;m tired of Free Market capitalism.The problem is companies have become too large and command too much political influence. We need proactive laws that break up companies if they grow beyond a certain size criteria. Ideally, the criteria would be aggressive enough to kill the corporation leaving behind mostly small businesses with a low barrier of entry for new competitors.Increased competition would mean lower prices, more product variety, more opportunities for employees to find quality employers or become small business owners themselves, and the elimination of Big Corp&#x27;s big money political influence.Companies are their \"best\" when small and nimble so why not force them to remain that way? If this came to pass there might be less need for socialism. reply somsak2 >I&#x27;m tired of capitalism.>I&#x27;m glad I live in Europe. reply behringer I&#x27;m reminded of the song by Christy Moore about being laid off:It seems to me such a cruel irony &#x2F;He&#x27;s richer now then he ever was before &#x2F;And now my cheque is spent, I can&#x27;t afford the rent &#x2F;There&#x27;s one law for the rich, one law for the poor &#x2F; reply taberiand The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.- Anatole France reply power I love that song and found out recently it was actually written by Peter Hames. reply nine_zeros CEOs pay is tied to the stock price. They will do whatever it takes to boost the stock price, until they are out with a golden parachute. From their perspective, the business is all about boosting the stock price. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the boost comes from innovation, or from polluting the planet, or from unscrupulous addictive practices, or from culling the employees.Employees are merely, an often undesired, side-effect in the business of boosting stock prices. reply madballster That is a very narrow and frankly sweepingly incorrect description of \"CEOs\" or \"companies\". They&#x27;re not all the same. I for one (alongside many other investors) carefully study incentive programs and compensation oversight executed by the board of directors. There are many thoughtful companies (and CEOs) who e.g. align over very long-term targets, such as &#x27;5 year return on capital\". Investors have found out a long time ago that incentivizing by short-term measures such as share price (or revenues, or EPS) can bring about very adverse long-term investing outcomes. reply treprinum Are you a CEO of a public company or still private? There is a huge difference in incentives from institutional shareholder pressure. reply somsak2 private companies can also have institutional shareholders. reply nine_zeros Concurred but...Let&#x27;s imagine that shareholders agree on a 5 year return on capital plan. Now let&#x27;s say some missteps&#x2F;economic circumstances make revenue go down in the 4th year. The CEO will get heat from the investors. This is especially true if the board contains an investor representative who can vote the CEO out.What choice does the CEO have at that time but to boost short term?Look at the same story from an employee perspective. Imagine that employee worked for 4 years and the downturn arrives. They invested a lot of time of their precious life, much like the shareholders invested their precious money.In the downturn, the CEO gets to make a choice and the choice ALWAYS is to boost the stock price for shareholders (and for themselves). Often, at the expense of employees. reply Salgat Exactly. It&#x27;s more accurate to say \"we look at long term as long as the short term stock price also looks good\". reply whimsicalism Do you all not understand that the stock price reflects the long term prospects of the company? It’s literally priced in reply cudgy Did you just learn this in Finance 101? The real stock market is priced based on many factors including interest rates, future growth expectations, etc, but the biggest factor of all is psychological. reply somsak2 It&#x27;s really crazy how just a few months ago Facebook&#x27;s long-term prospects were worth just 1&#x2F;3 of what they are now! What do you think changed so much during that time to warrant the 3x increase? reply ohgodplsno >Very long term>5 yearsThat is so laughably short sighted that you could not have given a better example as to why CEOs are all the same. reply somsak2 Average CEO tenure is less than 7 years, not sure how you&#x27;d practically be able to accomplish any kind of compensation plan on a longer time horizon. What is the person supposed to do in the meantime, life off of savings? reply ChuckMcM And if you make them subject to \"alternative minimum tax\" where their stock based compensation is considered regular income for the year it is awarded based on the difference between the strike price and the market price, you \"moderate\" that process somewhat.But if you&#x27;re a politician and your donors are all rich elites who really hated that aspect of AMT you get repeal it for them: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bowlesrice.com&#x2F;tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-2018-change... reply sjs7007 > compensation is considered regular income for the year it is awarded based on the difference between the strike price and the market priceIsn&#x27;t that exactly how it works? Your grant price just determines your number of your shares. When your shares vest they get taxed as regular income for the entirety of the vest amount. reply dmoy > When your shares vest they get taxed as regular income for the entirety of the vest amount.This describes restricted stock units. Stock options are taxed differently. reply mjevans Executive stock prices should vest at the first of 25 years from the date earned or 10 years after they&#x27;ve left the company. That would encourage long term strategies rather than pump and dump. reply kqr2 Some companies such as Toyota supposedly have 100 year business plans:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gongol.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;economics&#x2F;100yearplans&#x2F; reply nine_zeros That would certainly be one way of attaining long term vision.But who will enforce this requirement? Only pension funds and other large shareholders have any (and often impractical) leverage over the board C-suite. Wall-street shareholders demand faster growth until they themselves can exit out. They don&#x27;t care about the business or the services or the employees. They want a high growth return, year-over-year until their own investment carry continues to exist. reply toomuchtodo Stock buybacks used to be illegal. Lots of ways to use policy to encourage long-term shareholder value if boards and corporate bylaws won’t. reply s1artibartfast Stock BuyBacks have nothing to do with long or short-term vision. reply toomuchtodo The previous restriction on them was an example of controlling capital markets with statute. That was the point. These are all just words on power and numbers in a database. We can change the rules whenever we collectively choose to. reply nine_zeros Stock buyback is equivalent to paying a dividend. If stock buybacks are prevented, companies will continue to layoff and pay out dividends. It doesn&#x27;t solve the root cause that employees don&#x27;t have a seat at the decision-making table.At a minimum, if corporation laws were modified such that every laid off employee must be issued 1 year worth of shares as a golden parachute, the incentives will all get aligned very quickly and employees will not be abruptly thrown away. reply mrcode007 It is not the same as a dividend. Not even close.By definition, one returns cash, the other doesn’t.The stock buyback also prevents market price discovery because of an artificial price floor.The buyback is also a subject to buyback tax, transaction fee at the broker, and the benefits of the buyback are not captured by the long term holders, only by short term holders, e.g. insiders, who often sell into the buyback guaranteeing a price floor and effectively an execution price. replys1artibartfast I disagree with pretty much everything you say except this.>Employees are merely, an often undesired, side-effect in the business of boosting stock prices.Employees are worse than a side effect, they&#x27;re a cost center to be avoided if possible. You want to achieve your goals with as few employees as possible. reply cudgy So you are not interested or see any value in providing jobs for your fellow citizens?At the least, don’t hire thousands of people over 1-2 years and then lay them all off. That shows poor ethical, leadership and management skills. reply mistrial9 it is truly a product of the computer age, to come up with self-centered ego BS like this.You do not acknowledge different industries or business models, distribution of physical goods or market brand activity, let along \"things that take more that one person to do\" .. This is a rote recital of an inner dialog of an ill \"investor\" CEO who might as soon throw his secretary off of a bridge than give a bonus for winter holidays.There are not enough words to scourge this infantile, Ayn Randian nonesense from the page. reply s1artibartfast Never in history have companies hired more employees for the sake of having more employees. This isn&#x27;t a new modern or even libertarian hypothesis.Do you think people in 1000 bc hired more employees than they needed just maximize headcount. Of course not. You want enough to get the job done and not more. reply sackbut People in 1000 BC is maybe not the best example here considering practically the entire population of Egypt was tasked with building or supporting the building of the pyramids among many other projects. reply s1artibartfast I think that&#x27;s just as good of an example as any. Do you think pharaohs hired and fed more slaves than they needed to build a pyramid just to maximize worker numbers, or so the extra could sit around and take it easy?Egypt had shops and Merchants too.Can you think of any time between then and now where things worked that way? reply hotpotamus If you&#x27;re a middle manager, what is your goal? Is it to have as few reports below you, or as many? reply s1artibartfast If you&#x27;re a middle manager then you&#x27;re not a company owner. Your incentives depend on how well your company is being run on behalf of the owners.If your company is run well, you&#x27;re incentivized to do more with less. If not, then the opposite.Shareholders want the CEO and Company to do the best job they can, and do it with the lowest employee cost possible reply kccqzy And frankly layoffs had almost no effect on their stock prices. Announcing new products, even if quite half-baked AI efforts, had much bigger impact on stock prices than layoffs. reply nine_zeros > And frankly layoffs had almost no effect on their stock prices. Announcing new products, even if quite half-baked AI efforts, had much bigger impact on stock prices than layoffs.This is true but you know what? Every action of the CEO is meant for the investors and large shareholders. The layoff is merely a signal that says\"I am willing to do what it takes to give you your return. Buy more shares\" reply henry2023 Ask facebook reply filoleg Meta stock price is almost back to its all time high. 149% up since the beginning of the year, 249% up since its lowest point of the crash. reply mertd Meta stock performance is not really attributable to layoffs. reply tootie Employees do work and that work is meant to be profitable. If it is, then great. More employees, more profit. If it isn&#x27;t, they get cut. That&#x27;s exactly what CEOs are responsible for determining. reply romafirst3 Billionaires are a choice and CEOs earning 225 million while sacking swathes of employees are a choice.There is relatively little sympathy in these instances though because the laid of people are shockingly rich engineers (by normal people’s standards) but this is how you get a revolution. reply romafirst3 Not sure why I’m getting downvotes, maybe a lot of people think they might someday become alphabet CEO and need to protect their future wealth. Some &#x2F;s there but I honestly don’t understand the support base for the hyper rich.Regardless, insane wealth inequality is exactly how you get revolutions. reply Geezus_42 Is anyone surprised? reply paulpauper big tech CEO pay is almost always going up, so it&#x27;s only coincidental that it came before layoffs reply silverkiwi 1prev [–] Deciding to layoff or not is a complex decision. Here the article only looks at Companies that did layoff. Although more difficult, would be interesting to also look at companies that also made this decision and decided not to layoff. Essentially widening the group of Companies evaluated to one step before the layoffs&#x2F;no layoffs decision is made. reply tyingq Or to look at companies that were more conversative about ramping up, used natural attrition more effectively to avoid the need for layoffs, used early retirement or separation incentives before layoffs, etc. Of course, that&#x27;s difficult to research since it&#x27;s not as newsworthy to do the right thing :) reply lock-the-spock prev [–] Is there really such a thing as to non-decide? This seems to me a pretty impossible study to do. reply",
