Heaven and earth begin in the unnamed: name’s the mother of the ten thousand things. So the unwanting soul sees what’s hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants. Two things, one origin, but different in name, whose identity is mystery. Mystery of all mysteries! The door to the hidden. Note UKLG: A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible. It contains the book. I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges’s story: if you can see it rightly, it contains everything. 2 SOUL FOOD Everybody on earth knowing that beauty is beautiful makes ugliness. Everybody knowing that goodness is good makes wickedness. For being and nonbeing arise together; hard and easy complete each other; high and low depend on each other; note and voice make the music together; before and after follow each other. That’s why the wise soul does without doing, teaches without talking. The things of this world exist, they are; you can’t refuse them. To bear and not to own; to act and not lay claim; to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay. Note UKLG: One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let go of that belief is to find safety. 3 HUSHING Not praising the praiseworthy keeps people uncompetitive. Not prizing rare treasures keeps people from stealing. Not looking at the desirable keeps the mind quiet. So the wise soul governing people would empty their minds, fill their bellies, weaken their wishes, strengthen their bones, keep people unknowing, unwanting, keep the ones who do know from doing anything. When you do not-doing, nothing’s out of order. Note UKLG: Over and over Lao Tzu says wei wu wei: Do not do. Doing not-doing. To act without acting. Action by inaction. You do nothing yet it gets done... It’s not a statement susceptible to logical interpretation, or even to a syntactical translation into English; but it’s a concept that transforms thought radically, that changes minds. The whole book is both an explanation and a demonstration of it. 4 SOURCELESS The way is empty, used, but not used up. Deep, yes! ancestral to the ten thousand things. Blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, the way is the dust of the way. Quiet, yes, and likely to endure. Whose child? born before the gods. Note UKLG: Everything Lao Tzu says is elusive. The temptation is to grasp at something tangible in the endlessly deceptive simplicity of the words. Even some of his finest scholarly translators focus on positive ethical or political values in the text, as if those were what’s important in it. And of course the religion called Taoism is full of gods, saints, miracles, prayers, rules, methods for securing riches, power, longevity, and so forth -- all the stuff that Lao Tzu says leads us away from the way. In passages such as this one, I think it is the profound modesty of the language that offers what so many people for so many centuries have found in this book: a pure apprehension of the mystery of which we are part. 5 USEFUL EMPTINESS Heaven and earth aren’t humane. To them the ten thousand things are straw dogs. Wise souls aren’t humane. To them the hundred families are straw dogs. Heaven and earth act as a bellows: Empty yet structured, it moves, inexhaustibly giving. Note UKLG: The “inhumanity” of the wise soul doesn’t mean cruelty. Cruelty is a human characteristic. Heaven and earth -- that is, “Nature” and its Way -- are not humane, because they are not human. They are not kind; they are not cruel; those are human attributes. You can only be kind or cruel if you have, and cherish, a self. You can’t even be indifferent if you aren’t different. Altruism is the other side of egoism. Followers of the Way, like the forces of nature, act selflessly. 6 WHAT IS COMPLETE The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy. 7 DIM BRIGHTNESS Heaven will last, earth will endure. How can they last so long? They don’t exist for themselves and so can go on and on. So wise souls leaving self behind move forward, and setting self aside stay centered. Why let the self go? To keep what the soul needs. 8 EASY BY NATURE True goodness is like water. Water’s good for everything. It doesn’t compete. It goes right to the low loathsome places, and so finds the way. For a house, the good thing is level ground. In thinking, depth is good. The good of giving is magnanimity; of speaking, honesty; of government, order. The good of work is skill, and of action, timing. No competition, so no blame. Note UKLG: A clear stream of water runs through this book, from poem to poem, wearing down the indestructible, finding the way around everything that obstructs the way. Good drinking water. 9 BEING QUIET Brim-fill the bowl, it’ll spill over. Keep sharpening the knife, you’ll soon blunt it. Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade. Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin. To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing. 10 TECHNIQUES Can you keep your soul in its body, hold fast to the one, and so learn to be whole? Can you center your energy, be soft, tender, and so learn to be a baby? Can you keep the deep water still and clear, so it reflects without blurring? Can you love people and run things, and do so by not doing? Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven, can you be like a bird with her nestlings? Piercing bright through the cosmos, can you know by not knowing? To give birth, to nourish, to bear and not to own, to act and not lay claim, to lead and not to rule: this is mysterious power. Note UKLG: Most of the scholars think this chapter is about meditation, its techniques and fulfillments. The language is profoundly mystical, the images are charged, rich in implications. 11 THE USES OF NOT Thirty spokes meet in the hub. Where the wheel isn’t is where it’s useful. Hollowed out, clay makes a pot. Where the pot’s not is where it’s useful. Cut doors and windows to make a room. Where the room isn’t, there’s room for you. So the profit in what is is in the use of what isn’t. Note UKLG: One of the things I love about Lao Tzu is he is so funny. He’s explaining a profound and difficult truth here, one of those counter-intuitive truths that, when the mind can accept them, suddenly double the size of the universe. He goes about it with this deadpan simplicity, talking about pots. 12 NOT WANTING The five colors blind our eyes. The five notes deafen our ears. The five flavors dull our taste. Racing, chasing, hunting, drives people crazy. Trying to get rich ties people in knots. So the wise soul watches with the inner not the outward eye, letting that go, keeping this. 13 SHAMELESS To be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear. To take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer. What does that mean, to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear? Favor debases: we fear to lose it, fear to win it. So to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear. What does that mean, to take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer? I suffer because I’m a body; if I weren’t a body, how could I suffer? So people who set their bodily good before the public good could be entrusted with the commonwealth, and people who treated the body politic as gently as their own body would be worthy to govern the commonwealth. Note UKLG: Lao Tzu, a mystic, demystifies political power. Autocracy and oligarchy foster the beliefs that power is gained magically and retained by sacrifice, and that powerful people are genuinely superior to the powerless. Lao Tzu does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped. He does not see power as virtue, but as the result of virtue. The democracies are founded on that view. He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anybody who follows the Way. This is a radically subversive attitude. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends. 14 CELEBRATING MYSTERY Look at it: nothing to see. Call it colorless. Listen to it: nothing to hear. Call it soundless. Reach for it: nothing to hold. Call it intangible. Triply undifferentiated, it merges into oneness, not bright above, not dark below. Never, oh! never can it be named. It reverts, it returns to unbeing. Call it the form of the unformed, the image of no image. Call it unthinkable thought. Face it: no face. Follow it: no end. Holding fast to the old Way, we can live in the present. Mindful of the ancient beginnings, we hold the thread of the Tao. 15 PEOPLE OF POWER Once upon a time people who knew the Way were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating, unfathomable. Since they’re inexplicable I can only say what they seemed like: Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river. Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors. Polite and quiet, like houseguests. Elusive, like melting ice. Blank, like uncut wood. Empty, like valleys. Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water. Who can by stillness, little by little make what is troubled grow clear? Who can by movement, little by little make what is still grow quick? To follow the Way is not to need fulfillment. Unfulfilled, one may live on needing no renewal. Note UKLG: In the first stanza we see the followers of the Way in ancient times or illo tempore, remote and inaccessible; but the second stanza brings them close and alive in a series of marvelous smiles. (I am particularly fond of the polite and quiet houseguests.) The images of the valley and of uncut or uncarved wood will recur again and again. 16 RETURNING TO THE ROOT Be completely empty. Be perfectly serene. The ten thousand things arise together; in their arising is their return. Now they flower, and flowering sink homeward, returning to the root. The return to the root is peace. Peace: to accept what must be, to know what endures. In that knowledge is wisdom. Without it, ruin, disorder. To know what endures is to be openhearted, magnanimous, regal, blessed, following the Tao, the way that endures forever. The body comes to its ending, but there is nothing to fear. Note UKLG: To those who will not admit morality without a deity to validate it, or spirituality of which man is not the measure, the firmness of Lao Tzu’s morality and the sweetness of his spiritual counsel must seem incomprehensible, or illegitimate, or very troubling indeed. 17 ACTING SIMPLY True leaders are hardly known to their followers. Next after them are the leaders the people know and admire; after them, those they fear; after them, those they despise. To give no trust is to get no trust. When the work’s done right, with no fuss or boasting, ordinary people say, Oh, we did it. Note UKLG: This invisible leader, who gets things done in such a way that people think they did it all themselves, isn’t one who manipulates others from behind the scenes; just the opposite. Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force. An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers. 18 SECOND BESTS In the degradation of the great way come benevolence and righteousness. With the exaltation of learning and prudence comes immense hypocrisy. The disordered family is full of dutiful children and parents. The disordered society is full of loyal patriots. 19 RAW SILK AND UNCUT WOOD Stop being holy, forget being prudent, it’ll be a hundred times better for everyone. Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous, people will remember what family feeling is. Stop planning, forget making a profit, there won’t be any thieves and robbers. But even these three rules needn’t be followed; what works reliably is to know the raw silk, hold the uncut wood. Need little, want less. Forget the rules. Be untroubled. Note UKLG: This chapter and the two before it may be read as a single movement of thought. “Raw silk” and “uncut wood” are images traditionally associated with the characters su (simple, plain) and p’u (natural, honest). 20 BEING DIFFERENT How much difference between yes and no? What difference between good and bad? What the people fear must be feared. O desolation! Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit! Everybody’s cheerful, cheerful as if at a party, or climbing a tower in springtime. And here I sit unmoved, clueless, like a child, a baby too young to smile. Forlorn, forlorn. Like a homeless person. Most people have plenty. I’m the one that’s poor, a fool right through. Ignorant, ignorant. Most people are so bright. I’m the one that’s dull. Most people are so keen. I don’t have the answers. Oh, I’m desolate, at sea, adrift, without harbor. Everybody has something to do. I’m the clumsy one, out of place. I’m the different one, for my food is the milk of the mother. Note UKLG: The difference between yes and no, good and bad, is something only the “bright” people, the people with the answers, can understand. A poor stupid Taoist can’t make it out. This chapter is full of words like huang (wild, barren; famine), tun (ignorant; chaotic), hun (dull, turbid), men (sad, puzzled, mute), and hu (confused, obscured, vague). They configure chaos, confusion, a “bewilderness” in which the mind wanders without certainties, desolate, silent, awkward. But in that milky, dim strangeness lies the way. It can’t be found in the superficial order imposed by positive and negative opinions, the good/bad, yes/no moralizing that denies fear and ignores mystery. 21 THE EMPTY HEART The greatest power is the gift of following the Way alone. How the Way does things is hard to grasp, elusive. Elusive, yes, hard to grasp, yet there are thoughts in it. Hard to grasp, yes, elusive, yet there are things in it. Hard to make out, yes, and obscure, yet there is spirit in it, veritable spirit. There is certainty in it. From long, long ago till now it has kept its name. So it saw the beginning of everything. How do I know anything about the beginning? By this. Note UKLG: Mysticism rises from and returns to the irreducible, unsayable reality of “this.” “This” is the Way. This is the way. 22 GROWING DOWNWARD Be broken to be whole. Twist to be straight. Be empty to be full. Wear out to be renewed. Have little and gain much. Have much and get confused. So wise souls hold to the one, and test all things against it. Not showing themselves, they shine forth. Not justifying themselves, they’re self-evident. Not praising themselves, they’re accomplished. Not competing, they have in all the world no competitor. What they used to say in the old days, “Be broken to be whole,” was that mistaken? Truly, to be whole is to return. 23 NOTHING AND NOT Nature doesn’t make long speeches. A whirlwind doesn’t last all morning. A cloudburst doesn’t last all day. Who makes the wind and rain? Heaven and earth do. If heaven and earth don’t go on and on, certainly people don’t need to. The people who work with Tao are Tao people, they belong to the Way. People who work with power belong to power. People who work with loss belong to what’s lost. Give yourself to the Way and you’ll be at home on the Way. Give yourself to power and you’ll be at home in power. Give yourself to loss and when you’re lost you’ll be at home. To give no trust is to get no trust. 24 PROPORTION You can’t keep standing on tiptoe or walk in leaps and bounds. You can’t shine by showing off or get ahead by pushing. Self-satisfied people do no good, self-promoters never grow up. Such stuff is to the Tao as garbage is to food or a tumor to the body, hateful. The follower of the Way avoids it. 25 IMAGINING MYSTERY There is something that contains everything. Before heaven and earth it is. Oh, it is still, unbodied, all on its own, unchanging. all-pervading, ever-moving. So it can act as the mother of all things. Not knowing its real name, we only call it the Way. If it must be named, let its name be Great. Greatness means going on, going on means going far, and going far means turning back. So they say: “The Way is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and humankind is great; four greatnesses in the world, and humanity is one of them.” People follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Way, the Way follows what is. Note UKLG: I’d like to call the “something” of the first line a lump -- an unshaped, undifferentiated lump, chaos, before the Word, before Form, before Change. Inside it is time, space, everything; in the womb of the Way. The last words of the chapter, tzu jan, I render as “what is.” I was tempted to say, “The Way follows itself,” because the Way is the way things are; but that would reduce the significance of the words. They remind us not to see the Way as a sovereignty or a domination, all creative, all yang. The Way itself is a follower. Though it is before everything, it follows what is. 26 POWER OF THE HEAVY Heavy is the root of light. Still is the master of moving. So wise souls make their daily march with the heavy baggage wagon. Only when safe in a solid, quiet house do they lay care aside. How can a lord of ten thousand chariots let his own person weigh less in the balance than his land? Lightness will lose him his foundation, movement will lose him his mastery. Note UKLG: I take heaviness to be the root matters of daily life, the baggage we bodily beings have to carry, such as food, drink, shelter, safety. If you go charging too far ahead of the baggage wagon you may be cut off from it; if you treat your body as unimportant you risk insanity or inanity. The first two lines would make a nice motto for the practice of T’ai Chi. 27 SKILL Good walkers leave no track. Good talkers don’t stammer. Good counters don’t use their fingers. The best door’s unlocked and unopened. The best knot’s not in a rope and can’t be untied. So wise souls are good at caring for people, never turning their back on anyone. They’re good at looking after things, never turning their back on anything. There’s a light hidden here. Good people teach people who aren’t good yet; the less good are the makings of the good. Anyone who doesn’t respect a teacher or cherish a student may be clever, but has gone astray. There’s a deep mystery here. Note UKLG: The hidden light and the deep mystery seem to be signals, saying “think about this” -- about care for what seems unimportant. In a teacher’s parental care for the insignificant student, and in a society’s respect for mothers, teachers, and other obscure people who educate, there is indeed illumination and a profoundly human mystery. Having replaced instinct with language, society, and culture, we are the only species that depends on teaching and learning. We aren’t human without them. In them is true power. But are they the occupations of the rich and mighty? 28 TURNING BACK Knowing man and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world. Being the world’s riverbed of eternal unfailing power is to go back again to be newborn. Knowing light and staying dark, be a pattern to the world. Being the world’s pattern of eternal unerring power is to go back again to boundlessness. Knowing glory and staying modest, be the valley of the world. Being the world’s valley of eternal inexhaustible power is to go back again to the natural. Natural wood is cut up and made into useful things. Wise souls are used to make into leaders. Just so, a great carving is done without cutting. Note UKLG: The simplicity of Lao Tzu’s language can present an almost impenetrable density of meaning. The reversals and paradoxes in this great poem are the oppositions of the yin and yang -- male/female, light/dark, glory/modesty -- but the “knowing and being” of them, the balancing act, results in neither stasis nor synthesis. The riverbed in which power runs leads back, the patterns of power lead back, the valley where power is contained leads back -- to the forever new, endless, straightforward way. Reversal, recurrence, are the movement, and yet the movement is onward. 29 NOT DOING Those who think to win the world by doing something to it, I see them come to grief. For the world is a sacred object. Nothing is to be done to it. To do anything to it is to damage it. To seize it is to lose it. Under heaven some things lead, some follow, some blow hot, some cold, some are strong, some weak, some are fulfilled, some fail. So the wise soul keeps away from the extremes, excess, extravagance. Note UKLG: For Lao Tzu, “moderation in all things” isn’t just a bit of safe, practical advice. To lose the sense of the sacredness of the world is a mortal loss. To injure our world by excesses of greed and ingenuity is to endanger our own sacredness. 30 NOT MAKING WAR A Taoist wouldn’t advise a ruler to use force of arms for conquest; that tactic backfires. Where the army marched grow thorns and thistles. After the war come the bad harvests. Good leaders prosper, that’s all, not presuming on victory. They prosper without boasting, or domineering, or arrogance, prosper because they can’t help it, prosper without violence. Things flourish then perish. Not the Way. What’s not the Way soon ends. Note UKLG: This first direct statement of Lao Tzu’s pacifism is connected in thought to the previous poem and leads directly to the next. The last verse is enigmatic: “Things flourish then perish” -- How can this supremely natural sequence not be the Way? I offer my understanding of it in the note on the page with chapter 55, where nearly the same phrase occurs. 31 AGAINST WAR Even the best weapon is an unhappy tool, hateful to living things. So the follower of the Way stays away from it. Weapons are unhappy tools, not chosen by thoughtful people, to be used only when there is no choice, and with a calm, still mind, without enjoyment. To enjoy using weapons is to enjoy killing people, and to enjoy killing people is to lose your share in the common good. It is right that the murder of many people be mourned and lamented. It is right that a victor in war be received with funeral ceremonies. 32 SACRED POWER The way goes on forever nameless. Uncut wood, nothing important, yet nobody under heaven dare try to carve it. If rulers and leaders could use it, the ten thousand things would gather in homage, heaven and earth would drop sweet dew, and people, without being ordered, would be fair to one another. To order, to govern, is to begin naming; when names proliferate it’s time to stop. If you know when to stop you’re in no danger. The Way in the world is as a stream to a valley, a river to the sea. Note UKLG: The second verse connects to the uncut, the uncarved, the unusable, to the idea of the unnamed presented in the first chapter: “name’s the mother of the ten thousand things.” You have to make order, you have to make distinctions, but you also have to know when to stop before you’ve lost the whole in the multiplicity of parts. The simplicity or singleness of the Way is that of water, which always rejoins itself. 33 KINDS OF POWER Knowing other people is intelligence, knowing yourself is wisdom. Overcoming others takes strength, overcoming yourself takes greatness. Contentment is wealth. Boldly pushing forward takes resolution. Staying put keeps you in position. To live till you die is to live long enough. 34 PERFECT TRUST The Great Way runs to left, to right, the ten thousand things depending on it, living on it, accepted by it. Doing its work, it goes unnamed. Clothing and feeding the ten thousand things, it lays no claim on them and asks nothing of them. Call it a small matter. The ten thousand things return to it, thought it lays no claim on them. Call it great. So the wise soul without great doings achieves greatness. 35 HUMANE POWER Hold fast to the great thought and all the world will come to you, harmless, peaceable, serene. Walking around, we stop for music, for food. But if you taste the Way it’s flat, insipid. It looks like nothing much, it sounds like nothing much. And yet you can’t get enough of it. 36 THE SMALL DARK LIGHT What seeks to shrink must first have grown; what seeks weakness surely was strong. What seeks its ruin must first have risen; what seeks to take has surely given. This is called the small dark light: the soft, the weak prevail over the hard, the strong. Note UKLG: There is a third stanza in all the texts: Fish should stay underwater: the real means of rule should be kept dark. Or, more literally, “the State’s sharp weapons ought not to be shown to the people.” This Machiavellian truism seems such an anticlimax to the great theme stated in the first verses that I treat it as an intrusion, perhaps a commentator’s practical example of “the small dark light.” 37 OVER ALL The Way never does anything, and everything gets done. If those in power could hold to the Way, the ten thousand things would look after themselves. If even so they tried to act, I’d quiet them with the nameless, the natural. In the unnamed, in the unshapen, is not wanting. In not wanting is stillness. In stillness all under heaven rests. Note UKLG: Here the themes of not doing and not wanting, the unnamed and the unshapen, recur together in one pure legato. It is wonderful how by negatives and privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene, inexhaustible fullness of being. 38 TALKING ABOUT POWER Great power, not clinging to power, has true power. Lesser power, clinging to power, lacks true power. Great power, doing nothing, has nothing to do Lesser power, doing nothing, has an end in view. The good the truly good do has no end in view. The right the very righteous do has an end in view. And those who act in true obedience to law roll up their sleeves and make the disobedient obey. So: when we lose the Way we find power; losing power we find goodness; losing goodness we find righteousness; losing righteousness we’re left with obedience. Obedience to law is the dry husk of loyalty and good faith. Opinion is the barren flower of the Way, the beginning of ignorance. So great-minded people abide in the kernel not the husk, in the fruit not the flower, letting the one go, keeping the other. Note UKLG: A vast, dense argument in a minimum of words, this poem lays out the Taoist values in steeply descending order: the Way and its power; goodness (humane feeling); righteousness (morality); and -- a very distance last -- obedience (law and order). The word I render as “opinion” can be read as “knowing too soon”: the mind obeying orders, judging before the evidence is in, closed to fruitful perception and learning. 39 INTEGRITY Those who of old got to be whole: Heaven through its wholeness is pure; earth through its wholeness is steady; spirit through its wholeness is potent; the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers; the ten thousand things through their wholeness live; rulers through their wholeness have authority. Their wholeness makes them what they are. Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate; without what steadies it, earth would crack apart; without what makes it potent, spirit would fail; without what fills it, the valley would run dry; without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die; without what authorizes them, rulers would fall. The root of the noble is in the common, the high stands on what’s below. Princes and kings call themselves “orphans, widowers, beggars,” to get themselves rooted in the dirt. A multiplicity of riches is poverty. Jade is praised as precious, but its strength is being stone. 40 BY NO MEANS Return is how the Way moves. Weakness is how the Way works. Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of nothing. 41 ON AND OFF Thoughtful people hear about the Way and try hard to follow it. Ordinary people hear about the Way and wander onto it and off it. Thoughtless people hear about the Way and make jokes about it. It wouldn’t be the Way if there weren’t jokes about it. So they say: The Way’s brightness looks like darkness; advancing on the Way feels like retreating; the plain Way seems hard going. The height of power seems a valley; the amplest power seems not enough; the firmest power seems feeble. Perfect whiteness looks dirty. The pure and simple looks chaotic. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is never finished. The great tone is barely heard. The great thought can’t be thought. The Way is hidden in its namelessness. But only the Way begins, sustains, fulfills. 42 CHILDREN OF THE WAY The Way bears one. The one bears two. The two bear three. The three bear the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry the yin on their shoulders and hold in their arms the yang, whose interplay of energy makes harmony. People despise orphans, widowers, outcasts. Yet that’s what kings and rulers call themselves. Whatever you lose, you’ve won. Whatever you win, you’ve lost. What others teach, I say too: violence and aggression destroy themselves. My teaching rests on that. Note UKLG: Beginning with a pocket cosmology, this chapter demonstrates the “interplay of energy” of yin and yang by showing how low and high, winning and losing, destruction and self-destruction, reverse themselves, each turning into its seeming opposite. 43 WATER AND STONE What’s softest in the world rushes and runs over what’s hardest in the world. The immaterial enters the impenetrable. So I know the good in not doing. The wordless teaching, the profit in not doing -not many people understand it. 44 FAME AND FORTUNE Which is nearer, name or self? Which is dearer, self or wealth? Which gives more pain, loss or gain? All you grasp will be thrown away. All you hoard will be utterly lost. Contentment keeps disgrace away. Restraint keeps you out of danger so you can go on for a long, long time. 45 REAL POWER What’s perfectly whole seems flawed, but you can use it forever. What’s perfectly full seems empty, but you can’t use it up. True straightness looks crooked. Great skill looks clumsy. Real eloquence seems to stammer. To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving; to be comfortable in the heat, hold still; to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear. 46 WANTING LESS When the world’s on the Way, they use horses to haul manure. When the world gets off the Way, they breed warhorses on the common. The greatest evil: wanting more. The worst luck: discontent. Greed’s the curse of life. To know enough’s enough is enough to know. 47 LOOKING FAR You don’t have to go out the door to know what goes on in the world. You don’t have to look out the window to see the way of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. So the wise soul doesn’t go, but knows; doesn’t look, but sees; doesn’t do, but gets it done. Note UKLG: We tend to expect great things from “seeing the world” and “getting experience.” A Roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but not their soul. Other poets, untraveled and inexperienced, Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson, prove Lao Tzu’s point: it’s the inner eye that really sees the world. 48 UNLEARNING Studying and learning daily you grow larger. Following the Way daily you shrink. You get smaller and smaller. So you arrive at not doing. You do nothing and nothing’s not done. To run things, don’t fuss with them. Nobody who fusses is fit to run things. Note UKLG: The word shi in the second stanza, my “fuss,” is troublesome to the translators. Carus’s quite legitimate translation of it is “diplomacy,” which would give a stanza I like very much: To run things, be undiplomatic. No diplomat is fit to run things. 49 TRUST AND POWER The wise have no mind of their own, finding it in the minds of ordinary people. They’re good to good people and they’re good to bad people. Power is goodness. They trust people of good faith and they trust people of bad faith. Power is trust. They mingle their life with the world, they mix their mind up with the world. Ordinary people look after them. Wise souls are children. Note UKLG: The next to last line is usually read as saying that ordinary people watch and listen to wise people. But Lao Tzu has already told us that most of us wander on and off the Way and don’t know a sage from a sandpile. And surely the quiet Taoist is not a media pundit. Similarly, the last line is taken to mean that the wise treat ordinary people like children. This is patronizing, and makes hash out of the first verse. I read it to mean that the truly wise are looked after (or looked upon) like children because they’re trusting, unprejudiced, and don’t hold themselves above or apart from ordinary life. 50 LOVE OF LIFE To look for life is to find death. The thirteen organs of our living are the thirteen organs of our dying. Why are the organs of our life where death enters us? Because we hold too hard to living. So I’ve heard if you live in the right way, when you cross country you needn’t fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger; when you’re in a battle you needn’t fear the weapons. The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns, the tiger nowhere to stick its claws, the sword nowhere for its point to go. Why? Because there’s nowhere in you for death to enter. 51 NATURE, NURTURE The Way bears them; power nurtures them; their own being shapes them; their own energy completes them. And not one of the ten thousand things fails to hold the Way sacred or to obey its power. Their reference for the Way and obedience to its power are unforced and always natural. For the Way gives them life; its power nourishes them, mothers and feeds them, completes and matures them, looks after them, protects them. To have without possessing, do without claiming, lead without controlling; this is mysterious power. 52 BACK TO THE BEGINNING The beginning of everything is the mother of everything. Truly to know the mother is to know her children, and truly to know the children is to turn back to the mother. The body comes to its ending but there is nothing to fear. Close the openings, shut the doors, and to the end of life nothing will trouble you. Open the openings, be busy with business, and to the end of life nothing can help you. Insight sees the insignificant. Strength knows how to yield. Use the way’s light, return to its insight, and so keep from going too far. That’s how to practice what’s forever. Note UKLG: This chapter on the themes of return and centering makes circles within itself and throughout the book returning to phrases from other poems, turning them round the center. A center which is everywhere, a circle whose circumference is infinite... 53 INSIGHT If my mind’s modest, I walk the great way. Arrogance is all I fear. The great way is low and plain, but people like shortcuts over the mountains. The palace is full of splendor and the fields are full of weeds and the granaries are full of nothing. People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes, carrying weapons, drinking a lot and eating a lot, having a lot of things, a lot of money: shameless thieves. Surely their way isn’t the way. Note UKLG: So much for capitalism. 54 SOME RULES Well planted is not uprooted, well kept is not lost. The offerings of the generations to the ancestors will not cease. To follow the way yourself is real power. To follow it in the family is abundant power. To follow it in the community is steady power. To follow it in the whole country is lasting power. To follow it in the world is universal power. So in myself I see what self is, in my household I see what family is, in my town I see what community is, in my nation I see what a country is, in the world I see what is under heaven. How do I know the world is so? By this. Note UKLG: I follow Waley’s interpretation of this chapter. It is Tao that plants and keeps; the various kinds of power belong to Tao; and finally in myself I see the Tao of self, and so on. 55 THE SIGN OF THE MYSTERIOUS Being full of power is like being a baby. Scorpions don’t sting, tiger’s don’t attack, eagles don’t strike. Soft bones, weak muscles, but a firm grasp. Ignorant of the intercourse of man and woman, yet the baby penis is erect. True and perfect energy! All day long screaming and crying, but never getting hoarse. True and perfect harmony! To know harmony is to know what’s eternal. To know what’s eternal is enlightenment. Increase of life is full of portent: the strong heart exhausts the vital breath. The full-grown is on the edge of age. Not the Way. What’s not the Way soon dies. Note UKLG: As a model for the Taoist, the baby is in many ways ideal: totally unaltruistic, not interested in politics, business, or the proprieties, weak, soft, and able to scream placidly for hours without wearing itself out (its parents are another matter). The baby’s unawareness of poisonous insects and carnivorous beasts means that such dangers simply do not exist for it. (Again, its parents are a different case.) As a metaphor of the Tao, the baby embodies the eternal beginning, the ever-springing source. “We come, clouds of glory,” Wordsworth says; and Hopkins, “There lives the dearest freshness deep down things.” No Peter Pan-ish refusal to grow up is involved, no hunt for the fountain of youth. What is eternal is forever young, never grows old. But we are not eternal. It is in this sense that I understand how the natural, inevitable cycle of youth, growth, mature vigor, age, and decay can be “not the Way.” The Way is more than the cycle of any individual life. We rise, flourish, fail. The Way never fails. We are waves. It is the sea. 56 MYSTERIES OF POWER Who knows doesn’t talk. Who talks doesn’t know. Closing the openings, shutting doors, blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, be one with the dust of the way. So you come to the deep sameness. Then you can’t be controlled by love or by rejection. You can’t be controlled by profit or by loss. You can’t be controlled by praise or by humiliation. Then you have honor under heaven. 57 BEING SIMPLE Run the country by doing what’s expected. Win the war by doing the unexpected. Control the world by doing nothing. How do I know that? By this. The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world, the poorer people get. The more experts the country has the more of a mess it’s in. The more ingenious the skillful are, the more monstrous their inventions. The louder the call for law and order, the more the thieves and con men multiply. So a wise leader might say: I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves. I love to be quiet, and the people themselves find justice. I don’t do business, and the people prosper on their own. I don’t have wants, and the people themselves are uncut wood. Note UKLG: A strong political statement of the central idea of wu wei, not doing, inaction. My “monstrous” is literally “new.” New is strange, and strange is uncanny. New is bad. Lao Tzu is deeply and firmly against changing things, particularly in the name of progress. He would make an Iowa farmer look flighty. I don’t think he is exactly anti-intellectual, but he considers most uses of the intellect to be pernicious, and all plans for improving things to be disastrous. Yet he’s not a pessimist. No pessimist would say that people are able to look after themselves, be just, and prosper on their own. No anarchist can be a pessimist. Uncut wood -- here likened to the human soul -- the uncut, uncarved, unshaped, unpolished, native, natural stuff is better than anything that can be made of it. Anything done to it deforms and lessens it. Its potentiality is infinite. Its uses are trivial. 58 LIVING WITH CHANGE When the government’s dull and confused, the people are placid. When the government’s sharp and keen, the people are discontented. Alas! misery lies under happiness, and happiness sits on misery, alas! Who knows where it will end? Nothing is certain. The normal changes into the monstrous, the fortunate into the unfortunate, and our bewilderment goes on and on. And so the wise shape without cutting, square without sawing, true without forcing. They are the light that does not shine. Note UKLG: In the first verse, the words “dull and confused” and “sharp and keen” are, as Waley points out, the words used in chapter 20 to describe the Taoist and the non-Taoists. In the last verse most translators say the Taoist is square but doesn’t cut, shines but doesn’t dazzle. Waley says that this misses the point. The point is that Taoists gain their ends without the use of means. That is indeed a light that does not shine -- an idea that must be pondered and brooded over. A small dark light. 59 STAYING ON THE WAY In looking after your life and following the way, gather spirit. Gather spirit early, and so redouble power, and so become invulnerable. Invulnerable, unlimited, you can do what you like with material things. But only if you hold to the Mother of things will you do it for long. Have deep roots, a strong trunk. Live long by looking long. 60 STAYING PUT Rule a big country the way you cook a small fish. If you keep control by following the Way, troubled spirits won’t act up. They won’t lose their immaterial strength, but they won’t harm people with it, nor will wise souls come to harm. And so, neither harming the other, these powers will come together in unity. Note UKLG: Thomas Jefferson would have liked the first stanza. “Troubled spirits” are kwei, ghosts, not bad in themselves but dangerous if they possess you. Waley reads the second stanza as a warning to believers in Realpolitik: a ruler “possessed” by power harms both the people and his own soul. Taking it as counsel to the individual, it might mean that wise souls neither indulge nor repress the troubled spirits that may haunt them; rather, they let those spiritual energies be part of the power they find along the way. 61 LYING LOW The polity of greatness runs downhill like a river to the sea, joining with everything, woman to everything. By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him. So a great country submitting to small ones, dominates them; so small countries, submitting to a great one, dominate it. Lie low to be on top, be on top by lying low. 62 THE GIFT OF THE WAY The way is the hearth and home of the ten thousand things. Good souls treasure it, lost souls find shelter in it. Fine words are for sale, fine deeds go cheap; even worthless people can get them. So, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven when the Three Ministers take office, you might race out in a four-horse chariot to offer a jade screen; but wouldn’t it be better to sit still and let the Way be your offering? Why was the Way honored in the old days? Wasn’t it said: Seek, you’ll find it. Hide, it will shelter you. So it was honored under heaven. Note UKLG: I think the line of thought throughout the poe has to do with true reward as opposed to dishonorable gain, true giving as opposed to fake goods. 63 CONSIDER BEGINNINGS Do without doing. Act without action. Savor the flavorless. Treat the small as large, the few as many. Meet injury with the power of goodness. Study the hard while it’s easy. Do big things while they’re small. The hardest jobs in the world start out easy, the great affairs of the world start small. So the wise soul, by never dealing with great things, gets great things done. Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless, and taking things too easy makes them hard, the wise soul, by treating the easy as hard, doesn’t find anything hard. Note UKLG: Waley says that this charmingly complex chapter plays with two proverbs. “Requite injuries with good deeds” is the first. The word te, here meaning goodness or good deeds, is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the Way. (“Power is goodness,” he says in chapter 49.) So, having neatly annexed the Golden Rule, he goes on to the proverb about “taking things too lightly” and plays paradox with it. 64 MINDFUL OF LITTLE THINGS It’s easy to keep hold of what hasn’t stirred, easy to plan what hasn’t occurred. It’s easy to shatter delicate things, easy to scatter little things. Do things before they happen. Get them straight before they get mixed up. The tree you can’t reach your arms around grew from a tiny seedling. The nine-story tower rises from a heap of clay. The ten-thousand-mile journey begins beneath your foot. Do, and do wrong; Hold on, and lose. Not doing, the wise soul doesn’t do it wrong, and not holding on, doesn’t lose it. (In all their undertakings, it’s just as they’re almost finished that people go wrong. Mind the end as the beginning, then it won’t go wrong.) That’s why the wise want not to want, care nothing for hard-won treasures, learn not to be learned, turn back to what people overlooked. They go along with things as they are, but don’t presume to act. 65 ONE POWER Once upon a time those who ruled according to the Way didn’t use it to make people knowing but to keep them unknowing. People get hard to manage when they know too much. Whoever rules by intellect is a curse upon the land. Whoever rules by ignorance is a blessing on it. To understand these things is to have a pattern and a model, and to understand the pattern and the model is mysterious power. Mysterious power goes deep. It reaches far. It follows things back, clear back to the great oneness. Note UKLG: Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to withhold? “Once upon a time,” maybe, in the days of myth and legend, as a pattern, a model, an ideal? The knowledge and the ignorance or unknowing Lao Tzu speaks of may or may not refer to what we think of as education. In the last stanza, by power he evidently does not mean political power at all, but something vastly different, a unity with the power of the Tao itself. This is a mystical statement about government -- and in our minds those two realms are worlds apart. I cannot make the leap between them. I can only ponder it 66 LOWDOWN Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys. Why? Because they’ll go lower. So they’re the lords of the hundred valleys. Just so, a wise soul, wanting to be above other people, talks to them from below and to guide them follows them. And so the wise soul predominates without dominating, and leads without misleading. And people don’t get tired of enjoying and praising one who, not competing, has in all the world no competitor. Note UKLG: One of the things I love in Lao Tzu is his good cheer, as in this poem, which while giving good counsel is itself a praise and enjoyment of the spirit of yin, the water-soul that yields, follows, eludes, and leads on, dancing in the hundred valleys. 67 THREE TREASURES Everybody says my way is great but improbable. All greatness is improbable. What’s probable is tedious and petty. I have three treasures. I keep and treasure them. The first, mercy, the second, moderation, the third, modesty. If you’re merciful you can be brave, if you’re moderate you can be generous, and if you don’t presume to lead you can lead the high and mighty. But to brave without compassion, or generous without self-restraint, or to take the lead, is fatal Compassion wins the battle and holds the fort; it is the bulwark set around those heaven helps. Note UKLG: The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me. The three final verses are closely connected in thought to the next two chapters, which may be read as a single meditation on mercy, moderation, and modesty, on the use of strength, on victory and defeat. 68 HEAVEN’S LEAD The best captain doesn’t rush in front. The fiercest fighter doesn’t bluster. The big winner isn’t competing. The best boss takes a low footing. This is the power of noncompetition. This is the right use of ability. To follow heaven’s lead has always been the best way. 69 USING MYSTERY The expert in warfare says: Rather than dare make the attack I’d take the attack; rather than dare advance an inch I’d retreat a foot. It’s called marching without marching, rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles, being armed without weapons, giving the attacker no opponent. Nothing’s worse than attacking what yields. To attack what yields is to throw away the prize. So, when matched armies meet, the one who comes to grief is the true victor. Note UKLG: A piece of sound tactical advice (practiced by the martial arts, such as Aikido, and by underground resistance and guerilla forces), which leads to a profound moral warning. The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion. The yielder, the griever, the mourner, keeps that prize. The game is loser takes all. 70 BEING OBSCURE My words are so easy to understand, so easy to follow, and yet nobody in the world understands or follows them. Words come from an ancestry, deeds from a mastery: when these are unknown, so am I. In my obscurity is my value. That’s why the wise wear their jade under common clothes. 71 THE SICK MIND To know without knowing is best. Not knowing without knowing it is sick. To be sick of sickness is the only cure. The wise aren’t sick. They’re sick of sickness, so they’re well. Note UKLG: What you know without knowing you know it is the right kind of knowledge. Any other kind (conviction, theory, dogmatic belief, opinion) isn’t the right kind, and if you don’t know that, you’ll lose the Way. This chapter is an example of exactly what Lao Tzu was talking about in the last one -- obscure clarity, well-concealed jade. 72 THE RIGHT FEAR When we don’t fear what we should fear we are in fearful danger. We ought not to live in narrow houses, we ought not to do stupid work. If we don’t accept stupidity we won’t act stupidly. So, wise souls know but don’t show themselves, look after but don’t prize themselves, letting the one go, keeping the other. 73 DARING TO DO Brave daring leads to death. Brave caution leads to life. The choice can be the right one or the wrong one. Who will interpret the judgment of heaven? Even the wise soul finds it hard. The way of heaven doesn’t compete yet wins handily, doesn’t speak yet answers fully, doesn’t summon yet attracts. It acts perfectly easily. The net of heaven is vast, vast, wide-meshed, yet missing nothing. 74 THE LORD OF SLAUGHTER When normal, decent people don’t fear death, how can you use death to frighten them? Even when they have a normal fear of death, who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn’t? When people are normal and decent and death-fearing, there’s always an executioner. To take the place of that executioner is to take the place of the great carpenter. People who cut the great carpenter’s wood seldom get off with their hands unhurt. Note UKLG: To Lao Tzu, not to fear dying and not to fear killing are equally unnatural and antisocial. Who are we to forestall the judgment of heaven or nature, to usurp the role of “the executioner”? “The Lord of Slaughter” is Waley’s grand translation. 75 GREED People are starving. The rich gobble taxes, that’s why people are starving. People rebel. The rich oppress them, that’s why people rebel. People hold life cheap. The rich make it too costly, that’s why people hold it cheap. But those who don’t live for the sake of living are worth more than the wealth-seekers. Note UKLG: How many hundreds of years ago was this book written? And yet still this chapter must be written in the present tense. 76 HARDNESS Living people are soft and tender. Corpses are hard and stiff. The ten thousand things, the living grass, the trees, are soft, pliant. Dead, they’re dry and brittle. So hardness and stiffness go with death; tenderness, softness, go with life. And the hard sword fails, the stiff tree’s felled. The hard and great go under. The soft and weak stay up. Note UKLG: In an age when hardness is supposed to be the essence of strength, and even the beauty of women is reduced nearly to the bone, I welcome this reminder that tanks and tombstones are not very adequate role models, and that to be alive is to be vulnerable. 77 THE BOW The Way of heaven is like a bow bent to shoot: its top end brought down, its lower end raised up. It brings the high down, lifts the low, takes from those who have, gives to those who have not. Such is the Way of heaven, taking from people who have, giving to people who have not. Not so the human way: it takes from those who have not to fill up those who have. Who has enough to fill up everybody? Only those who have the Way. So the wise do without claiming, achieve without asserting, wishing not to show their worth. 78 PARADOXES Nothing in the world is as soft, as weak, as water; nothing else can wear away the hard, the strong, and remain unaltered. Soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong. Everybody knows it, nobody uses the knowledge. So the wise say: By bearing common defilements you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth; by bearing common evils you become a lord of the world. Right words sound wrong. 79 KEEPING THE CONTRACT After a great enmity is settled some enmity always remains. How to make peace? Wise souls keep their part of the contract and don’t make demands on others. People whose power is real fulfill their obligations; people whose power is hollow insist on their claims. The Way of heaven plays no favorites. It stays with the good. Note UKLG: This chapter is equally relevant to private relationships and to political treaties. Its realistic morality is based on a mystical perception of the fullness of the Way. 80 FREEDOM Let there be a little country without many people. Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred, and never use them. Let them be mindful of death and disinclined to long journeys. They’d have ships and carriages, but no place to go. They’d have armor and weapons, but no parades. Instead of writing, they might go back to using knotted cords. They’d enjoy eating, take pleasure in clothes, be happy with their houses, devoted to their customs. The next little country might be so close the people could hear cocks crowing and dogs barking there, but they’d get old and die without ever having been there. Note UKLG: Waley says this endearing and enduring vision “can be understood in the past, present, or future tense, as the reader desires.” This is always true of the vision of the golden age, the humane society. Christian or Cartesian dualism, the division of spirit or mind from the material body and world, existed long before Christianity or Descartes and was never limited to Western thought (though it is the “craziness” or “sickness” that many people under Western domination see in Western civilization). Lao Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist, who tries to ignore the body and live in the head, and the religious dualist, who despises the body and lives for a reward in heaven, are both dangerous and in danger. So, enjoy your life, he says; live in your body, you are your body; where else is there to go? Heaven and earth are one. As you walk the streets of your town you walk on the Way of heaven. 81 TELLING IT TRUE True words aren’t charming, charming words aren’t true. Good people aren’t contentious, contentious people aren’t good. People who know aren’t learned, learned people don’t know. Wise souls don’t hoard; the more they do for others the more they have, the more they give the richer they are. The Way of heaven profits without destroying. Doing without outdoing is the Way of the wise. NOTES Concerning This Version This is a rendition, not a translation. I do not know any Chinese. I could approach the text at all only because Paul Carus, in his 1898 translation of the Tao Te Ching, printed the Chinese text with each character followed by a transliteration and a translation. My gratitude to him is unending. Sources Notes on Some Choices of Wording The Two Texts of the Tao Te Ching Notes on the Chapters",

    "commentBody": "Tao Te Ching translated by Ursula Le Guin (1997) (github.com/nrrb)251 points by martythemaniak 21 hours agohidepastfavorite112 comments sophyphreak 15 hours agoI've studied classical Chinese. Ursula Le Guin's translation does not retain much feeling or meaning from the original. I don't fault her on this though because most translations of the Daodejing are like this. I recommend Philip J. Ivanhoe's translation, which has its own flaws as well. If we want to go out into the weeds a bit, I think this text is ethereal in the original but despite this, most translations tend to be quite similar. Wang Bi, the oldest commentary writer and popularizer of the Daodejing, argued that the text supports a large number of divergent meanings. If this is true, we should expect translations to be vastly different from one another. But despite the Daodejing being the second most translated book in history after the Bible, most translations keep the feel and content of the others. On another topic, translators usually translate the text as poetry when most of the text is best translated as prose. The text itself is a work of philosophy and not poetry, hence the author's name ending in 子 and the subject matter about correctly running a state and following the Dao. Although the text is doubtlessly more mystical than other Chinese philosophy texts such as The Analects of Confucius, in China today, the Daodejing is correctly placed next to the other great philosophers of ancient Chinese philosophy: Confucius, Mencius, and Zhuangzi. And finally, it's important to note that classical Chinese rarely used punctuation marks like those we find it modern reproductions like you see here: https://www.daodejing.org/1.html . Commas and periods are usually modern additions to aid in reading but usually did not appear in the original. Importantly, we have evidence that even the chapter breaks are themselves mostly inserted, that the original Laozi did not put them there. If we take out these punctuation marks, the text lends itself to still more possible translations and interpretations. And this ignores the inherently inexact and inferential nature of classical Chinese, which itself supports many translations. Someday in the distant future we'll have a hundred unique lenses on this text, but today we have relatively meager pickings. And they all sort of sound like Ursula Le Guin's translation. reply karencarits 12 hours agoparent> the Daodejing being the second most translated book in history after the Bibl I know this is difficult to quantify accurately, but Wikipedia lists Daodejing behind the Little Prince and Pinocchio https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_literary_works_by_nu... reply ralferoo 7 hours agorootparentJust to nit-pick, I think he meant number of different translations, not number of languages it was translated into. I doubt there are multiple translations of Little Prince into each of those languages. What makes it important for this book is that the source is from classical Chinese which is far more ambiguous than say the French that Little Prince was written in. Consider the first sentence: 道可道非常道 名可名非常名. It's written as two parallel structures, with 道 replaced by 名 in the second half. In both halves, 道/名 could be functioning as a verb or a noun in any of its usages. Let's consider 道: amongst other things, 道 as a noun could mean road, path, way, principle, reason, skill, art, but also as a general class of objects like rivers, barriers, etc. 道 as a verb can mean to travel, to say, to express, etc. And of course, as a result of this text, 道 stands as a shortcut for the entire text - more than just a principle, but The Principle, more than just a way, but The Way. Even the other words aren't simple. 可 is often just thought of as part of 可以 to mean may nowadays, but 可 itself means can, may, able to, to approve, to permit, to suit, certainly, etc. 非常 is an odd one, as I'm sure the modern day meaning (extremely) completely throws you off track. 非 on its own means not, wrong, to not be, to blame, etc. 常 means always, ever, constant, often, frequently, common, general, etc. I'm not saying any of these examples I'm giving now are good translations, but you could, for example, have translations that are diverse and extreme as \"the road which could be traveled is not often traveled\", \"to travel on something that could be a road is rarely the correct way\", \"travelling on something that might be a road but was not always a road\", \"the road you may travel on is often not a road\" or \"the road you may travel on is never the right way\". None of these are like any existing translations I've seen, but that was done on purpose, because they're all legitimate (but unlikely) interpretations of the original. If you look at the meanings given in this translation: \"The way you can go isn’t the real way.\" In the same repo, Jane English's version is \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\" My bilingual version translates it as \"The Dao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Dao\" (James Legge, 1815-1897). You can see that the linked-to translation has chosen a quite different approach to at least two others. Which is correct? Perhaps all of them, perhaps none of them. There's a reason why these texts are considered so enlightening - there's no one correct answer, you have to really meditate on the meaning and come to your own conclusion. But anyway, back to the point - the nature of the text means that if you're reading a translation it'll miss a lot of the inherent ambiguities of the text and instead direct your thinking down specific lines. That's why, for this text the number of different translations is more important than number of languages it's translated into. reply srean 8 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the very interesting list. I was expecting Euclid's Elements to be up there. Perhaps the filter \"literary work\" disqualified it. If you all pardon an off topic digression, the nebulosity of the definition of a straight line in elements has always bothered me. I wanted something free of reference to a physical artifact (straight edge, taught rope etc) and free of algebra. Its sometimes defined in terms of reflections or rotations or translations, but then that begs the question what is a straight axis (or direction of translation). Playfair's version is almost satisfactory. The standard I guess is Hilbert's. reply mci 7 hours agorootparent> If you all pardon an off topic digression... IMHO, Euclid's definition of a straight line in today's terms would be \"a line that has the same direction on its entire length\". His definition of a plane angle would be \"a plane angle is the difference between the directions of two straight lines that have a common end in one point\". What are Playfair's and Hilbert's definitions? reply srean 6 hours agorootparentThe problem I have with that version of Euclid's definition is that direction is not defined. Playfair interprets Euclid as follows, I am using my own words here, a straight line is that figure which has the property that if it intersects its moved copy at 2 points it necessarily coincides with it everywhere. \"Movement\" is undefined, it has to be an isometry. Hilbert's is more abstract and based upon sets. Line is a primitive (undefined name) that interacts with two other undefined names (points and planes) according defined relations (lies on, lies between and is_congruent).

My gratitude to him is unending. reply jrochkind1 17 hours agoparentThe foreward (or was it an afterword?) in the edition I have on my shelf has quite a bit on how she produced it, and it is very interesting. It was a process of very intensively studying and comparing all existing English translations she could find, using the Carus Chinese character-by-character translation as a sort of rosetta stone. While of course using her own literary sensibilities to phrasing too, as an author. I could easily believe this would result in a product that is a more faithful conversion to English than many translations. It's interesting to think about how this in some ways can combine and synthesize various subjectivities over time in a way that you actually couldn't do if you read the original language and believed your \"own\" take on the original translation was the \"correct\" one! In the forward she also names a scholar of the Tao Te Ching (who was able to read and study in the original language) she had been in communication with for advice, who had complimented and supported her work. (although of course LeGuin takes responsibility for all errors or misconceptions!) I wonder if any other conversions/renditions/translations have been done of other works through similar method, I guess if any they would be to other ancient texts (the bible?) that have had many translations. [I don't think we really have a good word for what she did, since it's not really a thing done much, so I understand the poster using the word \"translation\" although OP does not and just says \"English version by\" -- but we jump to figure that means a \"translation\", right?] It doesn't look like the foreward (I think unless it was an afterword, I don't have the book in front of it me!) that discusses this is included in this online (and presumably copyright-violating pirated?) copy? If you can find a copy (pirated or not I don't judge) of the foreward, which isn't very long, where she describes her process, I definitely recommend it! (Or is it here?) Something about the process seems especially interesting to the HN crowd to me... I want to say it's perhaps about \"abstraction\"?

It's interesting to think about how this in some ways can combine and synthesize various subjectivities over time in a way that you actually couldn't do if you read the original language and believed your \"own\" take on the original translation was the \"correct\" one! The problem with that is that you can \"creatively interpret\" meaning into the text that wasn't there in the original. [ADDED: Not trying to imply she was deliberately mistranslating it, just that it's very easy to think about a word's varied meanings in your own language and not only miss the connected meanings in the other language, but also see false connections that were never there.] Leaving aside the problems with classical Chinese for a moment, the problem is that words in languages map to concepts in our heads, and these rarely correspond exactly to another word in another language. Take \"computer\", we might say \"ordinateur\" in French or \"电脑\" (literally \"electric brain\") in Mandarin but neither of these translations are able to capture the older meaning in English of a person who calculates something, which would be \"calculateur\" in French or \"计算着\" (lit. \"person who calculates\") in Mandarin. Going to the text again, the main word is 道 which means way, path, principle, etc. and many more. These are usually translated as way for this text, but just that word alone has many other meanings in English that wouldn't be translated back into Chinese as 道 - for instance \"way\" in English could mean \"method\" or \"possibility\", but neither would make sense as a translation for 道. Another way of looking at it might be the colour chart for men vs women, which is meant as a joke but has a serious side showing that some groups of people split up and categorise things very differently. What I dislike about her first line is the word \"real\". The translation is already kind of \"out there\" a bit (in line with some of the ones I listed in another post as possible interpretations due to the textual ambiguities, but which differed a lot from how most people interpreted the text). To me, \"real\" isn't implied by any of the words. I can see how she got there, because 道 is understood as \"the one true way\", but as a mental abstraction from a physical path that you should walk done to live life safely, to the \"path\" that you should walk spiritually to \"not stray off the path\". The problem is that none of the words in the text are concerned about truth vs lies, reality vs imaginary, rather this abstract concept of \"the way\". To translate \"isn't the real way\" she is using 非 for \"not/isn't\", seemingly completely ignoring 常 \"always, constant, often, usual\" and imbuing the already ambiguous 道 with another meaning that isn't really there. [ADDED 2: Just re-reading this again, and it sounds a bit too critical. I think my point is not that her translation is \"bad\" or anything like that, and it can definitely be used to think about the text in ways that other translations might not lead you to. But I wouldn't use this as my primary source, and where her translation differs substantially from others it should be an indication that there's something particularly difficult to translate, and so you definitely need to consider other translations at that point and ask yourself why they are different.] reply jrochkind1 2 hours agorootparentThanks for your comments! I'm afraid I'm not in the city where my copy of the Le Guin version is on my bookshelf, but the printed version has per-chapter authors notes at the end for many chapters where she often discusses her word choices -- I'm not sure if the notes included in this online version capture those or not? If I remember right, there were a few footnotes (which i'm thinking may be what's captured in OP), but then separately additional notes at the end which I'm not sure are captured here. I'm curious if she says anything additional in foreward or notes about her choice of \"real\". Obviously she was aware it was not a choice other translators typically made. When I'm back home, I'll look! Googling, the scholar who approved of Le Guin's work and worked with her somewhat on it (in some places I see him credited as a contributor to the Tao Te Ching rendition), is J. P. \"Sandy\" Seaton, who on his own seems to have produced plenty of other well-regarded translations of classical chinese poetry. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_P._Seaton reply bbor 16 hours agorootparentprevGreat points, thought provoking! I think LLMs are about to usher in a new era for academic translation. Obviously they have their faults, but philosophy in particular suffers to a much greater degree from language barriers than the layman might guess, so I think there’s a lot of room for improvement. In particular, many German and French authors have works that haven’t been translated yet, and, more relevantly, Chinese philosophy is still only tangentially related to European philosophy. When books do get translated, they often are translated with a significant delay, obviously leading to issues for people trying to form a scientific consensus. I think the work of both great thinkers like Husserl and more underappreciated ones like Edith Stein would benefit greatly from LLM-assisted term-standardization and overall synchronized translation, with their original German-language works fed in alongside the translations we do have, for automated comparison purposes. The academy is efficient, but IMO we’re about to see a scientific revolution in the humanities — aka cognitive science. reply ericra 19 hours agoparentprevYes this is similar to the popular Stephen Mitchell \"translation\" in that neither spoke the original language.

I think it's fair to say that written Chinese simply allows to encode more information than English. So it's \"physically impossible\": translation from Chinese is a lossy operation. We can only provide a reasonable approximation. Even at the character level, some information just can't get through. \"道\" for example contains both \"辶\" (to walk) and \"首\" (head, chief, first (occasion, thing, etc)). In addition to the usual meanings, we could derive some further meanings, coherent in this context, with a \"philosophical\" approach to life (e.g. \"the state of mind of someone who moves forward, one step at a time, without rushing\"). reply jerf 17 hours agorootparentNative English speakers, and especially native English speakers who do not have fluency in another language, also often have a \"familiarity breeds contempt\" situation going on with their own language and are not aware of the fact that English is also a rich language, filled with cultural allusions, subtleties in the connotations versus the denotations, rich histories than span continents behind many words, distinct poetical traditions, and many other quirks. It isn't just Chinese -> English that loses information. The other direction does too. They are two languages that spent thousands of years estranged from each other, so, unlike the European languages which are all different but coevolved, they are both different from each other in a lot of ways. The richness of languages that have grown apart from each other inhibits translations in both directions not just because the concepts in the original language are not precisely present in the other, but also because you can't help but invoke the rich concepts of the target language that don't match. I'm sure a Chinese person reading just this very post could write about the implications carried in the word \"continent\" and how that is wrapped around a lot of cultural assumptions around how things are separated (if you don't know what I mean, google around for discussions around \"how many continents are there\"), the etymology of \"quirk\" and its many nuances, the connotations embedded in the word \"estranged\" and why I chose that one over, say, the more neutral \"separated\", the implications behind \"coevolved\", and make English sound as amazing as English speakers make Chinese sound... and that would be because both are correct. reply mbivert 10 hours agorootparent> It isn't just Chinese -> English that loses information. The other direction does too Yes, definitely. People who think studying \"dead\" languages is a loss of time are foolish. There's even a somewhat \"gain\" of information which can chaotically appear in translation. For example if we decompose \"道\" as \"walking\" and \"head\" and translate it in French we get \"une tête qui marche\", which means both \"a walking head\" or more interestingly, \"a working head.\" But it's not because English is richer than commonly believed than Chinese isn't still more spacious, which I do believe for multiple reasons, one of them being that it's a pictographic language: A picture is worth a thousand words. Some of the \"etymology\" is more readily available, so to speak. But we could also consider \"hidden etymology\" -- ancient character forms -- which, as for Western languages, would enrich the interpretations. reply xanderlewis 8 hours agorootparentprev> not aware of the fact that English is also a rich language Quite.

My suggestion is to assume quotes: \"Dao which is 'dao' is not true dao\", that is, the mere word \"dao\" (and, by extension, any more descriptive and explanatory words) is insufficient to convey the meaning of true dao.

Like, Chinese culture has a big thing for filial piety--one's ancestors, as your creators, with the lack of a 'central power', seem to catch up some of the sovereignty that logos would attribute closer to the divine. In Chinese culture, it's not some weird divine abstract thing you owe existence to, it's just your ancestors. Taoism seems to talk of 'heaven and earth', but 'heaven' seems like the collective of little sovereignties like the emperor, your parents, and simple the pattern of nature itself, the pluralistic part. 'Heaven' doesn't seem like a monolithic entity. In regard to being purposeless, purpose seems acknowledged as emergent, and subservient, like 'the way that can be named is not the eternal way'--there's naming, purpose, and then subservience. It's harder to think of more concrete examples, and it's a bit easy to confuse an acknowledgment of pattern with purpose, but taoism seems rather critical of purposive action on the whole. reply solidsnack9000 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is not really translation, though, once you start doing that. reply j45 15 hours agorootparentprevThank you for sharing this I was gifted with one translation of the Tao Te Ching.

It all depends on how your mind works, or what statement you have. Do you require ambiguity, and inferentialness to be explicitly clothed as such, as in Chinese, or can you take the words themselves, that can be concrete meanings, and use them as a jumping point to infer on your own? As in English. There's also a very strong way in which this statement is not true, because if we assume that the text contains transcendental universal truths, saying that it can only be accurately expressed in Chinese, is suggesting either that it's a uniquely Chinese truth, so it's not universal, or that Chinese has some greater expressive quality than other languages, which is arrogant bullshit and not true. So I think rather than thinking of a translation, think instead of what statement do you have of the truths reflected in a particular form in that original Chinese text. What statement do you have of those truths in whatever material you're working with, be it a language or something else? And it's funny to talk about much being lost, because the text itself readily and repeatedly admits that the truths it talks about cannot be accurately expressed. In fact, it highlights the limitations of language, of the original Chinese it was written in, to accurately and fully convey what it is talking about. So I think it's nonsense to say that, “oh, so much is lost when translating from Chinese”, and it's entirely the wrong way to talk about it, and kind of a lazy worshipfulness that's unworthy of that, I think, in this context entirely. So liberated from those constraints, I think you can be free to consider, well, what is it talking about? And also to think about that and come up with your own translation. So back to the original point, I don't think you have to lose something when you're putting it in English. Here's my attempt: The path that can be walked is not the AllPath.

It's a deep dive interpretation of a somewhat obscure Hans Christian Andersen story, and her insights about the nature of evil and what it means to grow up shook me and then reshaped my life. This paragraph is as decent a tl;dr as can exist, but you really should read the whole essay: > The normal adolescent ceases to project so blithely as the little child did; he realizes that you can't blame everything on the bad guys with the black Stetsons. He begins to take responsibility for his acts and feelings. And with it he often shoulders a terrible load of guilt. He sees his shadow as much blacker, more wholly evil, than it is. The only way for a youngster to get past the paralyzing self-blame and self-disgust of this stage is really to look at that shadow, to face it, warts and fangs and pimples and claws and all – to accept it as himself – as part of himself. The ugliest part, but not the weakest. For the shadow is the guide. The guide inward and out again; downward and up again; there, as Bilbo the Hobbit said, and back again. The guide of the journey to self-knowledge, to adulthood, to the light. > \"Lucifer\" means the one who carries the light. https://johnirons.com/pdfs/shadowleguin.pdf reply leobg 14 hours agoparentSomeone here quoted Kafka the other day who said you should only read books that sting you, and affect you like a blow to the head. From your essay: > Now that is an extraordinarily cruel story. A story about insanity, ending in humiliation and death. Is it a story for children? Yes, it is. It's a story for anybody who's listening. In a sea of all those fluffy “stories made for kids”, that are just reflecting back to children the kinds of things authors think children want to hear and give a child nothing solid, nothing to grapple with, this is such a relief for me to read. Thank you for sharing. reply leobg 14 hours agoparentprev> I hated it when I was a kid. I hated all the Andersen stories with unhappy endings.

Care to explain why you think it’s bad or share a better alternative? reply hotdogscout 19 hours agoprevI have a feeling people who love Le Guin love the idea of her and didn't actually read her books. Her style is impersonal, robotic and kind of boring. Look at her most famous quotes for a snippet: https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/874602.Ursula_K_Le_G... reply teraflop 19 hours agoparentTaste is subjective, and if you find her style boring I can't dispute that, but it doesn't match my experience at all. I think judging her by the most popularly-upvoted snippets on Goodreads is doing her a tremendous disservice. Her language is not particularly flowery, and she writes using simple words, which are often the ones that have the vaguest meanings and the most room for nuance. If you take a single sentence like that from a story or novel, and remove it from its surrounding context, you strip away a lot of that nuance. By reading the sentence in isolation, you only see a pale shadow of its intended meaning. Maybe this is a bad analogy, but it makes me think of how you wouldn't think there was anything interesting about Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture if all you heard was the cannon volleys by themselves, even though they're what make the piece complete. reply t-3 19 hours agoparentprevI think Earthsea and Hainish are both great, but I don't like any of her other stuff, and don't like this TTC (or really any of the English translations I've seen) either. They all lose the poetry which is obvious at a glance in the original. I only know a few words of Mandarin and can't read the glyphs at all, but I've picked my way through with a dictionary and MTL - the structure of the original is obviously not reflected in any of the English translations. I think English is just too explicit and doesn't have enough \"overloading\" to capture the depth. reply yongjik 17 hours agoparentprevHard disagree. I find Le Guin's prose breathtakingly gorgeous. And then it hits you like a brick wall. > The second year I was in Elbow, I was worklister, the mill syndicate cut rations. People doing six hours in the plant got full rations—just barely enough for that kind of work. People on half time got threequarter rations. If they were sick or too weak to work, they got half. On half rations you couldn’t get well. You couldn’t get back to work. You might stay alive. I was supposed to put people on half rations, people that were already sick. I was working full time, eight, ten hours sometimes, desk work, so I got full rations: I earned them. I earned them by making lists of who should starve. (The Dispossessed) reply nestorD 19 hours agoparentprevI strongly disagree. Her essays (?!) and short story might be a good place to demonstrate the breath and width of her style. The one exeption to this, for my taste, might be Earthsea, parts of it definitely fell short of its reputation as far as I am concerned. reply SamBam 18 hours agoparentprevI can't imagine anyone loving \"the idea\" of Le Guin who hasn't read her books. What an idea. It's not like she's famous enough to have acolytes who spout her stuff without having read it. And what's \"the idea\" of Le Guin? Just that she's a female sci fi writer? I'm missing the implication. I love her books and have for over 20 years. And I can't imagine that any author looks good when subjected to the \"GoodReads snippets\" treatment. Can you find an example of an author coming off well? What snippets get upvoted by people? It's all going to sound like trite stuff, for any author. reply wafflemaker 19 hours agoparentprevCan't say I love any books, but I greatly enjoy sci-fi (especially when they respect orbital mechanics). ULG's style reminds me of Strugacky brothers, maybe that was just typical in that era? It might be that my memory is playing tricks on me, it was over 10 years since I read any of them (except for one non-sci-fi ULG book). But generally the writing style evolves end deeply personal style is much more common now then it was before. (I think I've read most of ULG and maybe half of B&A Strugackie's books). reply Barrin92 15 hours agoparentprevA lot of prose in the Dispossessed is great and there's nothing impersonal or robotic about it, quite the opposite. \"We have nothing but our freedom. We have nothing to give you but your own freedom. We have no law but the single principle of mutual aid between individuals. We have no government but the single principle of free association. We have no states, no nations, no presidents, no premiers, no chiefs, no generals, no bosses, no bankers, no landlords, no wages, no charity, no police, no soldiers, no wars. Nor do we have much else. We are sharers, not owners. We are not prosperous. None of us is rich. None of us is powerful. If it is Anarres you want, if it is the future you seek, then I tell you that you must come to it with empty hands. You must come to it alone, and naked, as the child comes into the world, into his future, without any past, without any property, wholly dependent on other people for his life. You cannot take what you have not given, and you must give yourself. You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere\" reply djur 13 hours agorootparentFrom the same book, the \"it is our suffering that brings us together\" passage has burned itself into my mind and has often been a comfort in dark times. I can't imagine finding it impersonal or robotic. Frank and unadorned, perhaps.

    "originLink": "https://duckdb.org/2024/07/05/community-extensions.html",
    "originBody": "DuckDB Community Extensions The DuckDB team2024-07-05 TL;DR: DuckDB extensions can now be published via the DuckDB Community Extensions repository. The repository makes it easier for users to install extensions using the INSTALL ⟨extension name⟩ FROM community syntax. Extension developers avoid the burdens of compilation and distribution. DuckDB Extensions Design Philosophy One of the main design goals of DuckDB is simplicity, which – to us – implies that the system should be rather nimble, very light on dependencies, and generally small enough to run on constrained platforms like WebAssembly. This goal is in direct conflict with very reasonable user requests to support advanced features like spatial data analysis, vector indexes, connectivity to various other databases, support for data formats, etc. Baking all those features into a monolithic binary is certainly possible and the route some systems take. But we want to preserve DuckDB’s simplicity. Also, shipping all possible features would be quite excessive for most users because no use cases require all extensions at the same time (the “Microsoft Word paradox”, where even power users only use a few features of the system, but the exact set of features vary between users). To achieve this, DuckDB has a powerful extension mechanism, which allows users to add new functionalities to DuckDB. This mechanism allows for registering new functions, supporting new file formats and compression methods, handling new network protocols, etc. In fact, many of DuckDB’s popular features are implemented as extensions: the Parquet reader, the JSON reader, and the HTTPS/S3 connector all use the extension mechanism. Using Extensions Since version 0.3.2, we have already greatly simplified the discovery and installation by hosting them on a centralized extension repository. So, for example, to install the spatial extension, one can just run the following commands using DuckDB’s SQL interface: INSTALL spatial; -- once LOAD spatial; -- on each use What happens behind the scenes is that DuckDB downloads an extension binary suitable to the current operating system and processor architecture (e.g., macOS on ARM64) and stores it in the ~/.duckdb folder. On each LOAD, this file is loaded into the running DuckDB instance, and things happily continue from there. Of course, for this to work, we compile, sign and host the extensions for a rather large and growing list of processor architecture – operating system combinations. This mechanism is already heavily used, currently, we see around six million extension downloads each week with a corresponding data transfer volume of around 40 terabytes! Until now, publishing third-party extensions has been a difficult process which required the extension developer to build the extensions in their repositories for a host of platforms. Moreover, they were unable to sign the extensions using official keys, forcing users to use the allow_unsigned_extensions option that disables signature checks which is problematic in itself. DuckDB Community Extensions Distributing software in a safe way has never been easier, allowing us to reach a wide base of users across pip, conda, cran, npm, brew, etc. We want to provide a similar experience both to users who can easily grab the extension they will want to use, and developers who should not be burdened with distribution details. We are also interested in lowering the bar to package utilities and scripts as a DuckDB extension, empowering users to package useful functionality connected to their area of expertise (or pain points). We believe that fostering a community extension ecosystem is the next logical step for DuckDB. That’s why we’re very excited about launching our Community Extension repository which was announced at the Data + AI Summit. For users, this repository allows for easy discovery, installation and maintenance of community extensions directly from the DuckDB SQL prompt. For developers, it greatly streamlines the publication process of extensions. In the following, we’ll discuss how the new extension repository enhances the experiences of these groups. User Experience We are going to use the h3 extension as our example. This extension implements hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data. Using the DuckDB Community Extensions repository, you can now install and load the h3 extension as follows: INSTALL h3 FROM community; LOAD h3; Then, you can instantly start using it. Note that the sample data is 500 MB: SELECT h3_latlng_to_cell(pickup_latitude, pickup_longitude, 9) AS cell_id, h3_cell_to_boundary_wkt(cell_id) AS boundary, count() AS cnt FROM read_parquet('https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/yellow_tripdata_2010-01.parquet') GROUP BY cell_id HAVING cnt > 10; On load, the extension’s signature is checked, both to ensure platform and versions are compatible, and to verify that the source of the binary is the community extensions repository. Extensions are built, signed and distributed for Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebAssembly. This allows extensions to be available to any DuckDB client using version 1.0.0 and upcoming versions. The h3 extension’s documentation is available at https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/h3.html. Developer Experience From the developer’s perspective, the Community Extensions repository performs the steps required for publishing extensions, including building the extensions for all relevant platforms, signing the extension binaries and serving them from the repository. For the maintainer of h3, the publication process required performing the following steps: Sending a PR with a metadata file description.yml contains the description of the extension: extension: name: h3 description: Hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data version: 1.0.0 language: C++ build: cmake license: Apache-2.0 maintainers: - isaacbrodsky repo: github: isaacbrodsky/h3-duckdb ref: 3c8a5358e42ab8d11e0253c70f7cc7d37781b2ef The CI will build and test the extension. The checks performed by the CI are aligned with the extension-template repository, so iterations can be done independently. Wait for approval from the DuckDB Community Extension repository’s maintainers and for the build process to complete. Published Extensions To show that it’s feasible to publish extensions, we reached out to a few developers of key extensions. At the time of the publication of this blog post, the DuckDB Community Extensions repository already contains the following extensions. Name Description crypto Adds cryptographic hash functions and HMAC. h3 Implements hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data. lindel Implements linearization/delinearization, Z-Order, Hilbert and Morton curves. prql Allows running PRQL commands directly within DuckDB. scrooge Supports a set of aggregation functions and data scanners for financial data. shellfs Allows shell commands to be used for input and output. DuckDB Labs and the DuckDB Foundation do not vet the code within community extensions and, therefore, cannot guarantee that DuckDB community extensions are safe to use. The loading of community extensions can be explicitly disabled with the following one-way configuration option: SET allow_community_extensions = false; For more details, see the documentation’s Securing DuckDB page. Summary and Looking Ahead In this blog post, we introduced the DuckDB Community Extensions repository, which allows easy installation of third-party DuckDB extensions. We are looking forward to continuously extending this repository. If you have an idea for creating an extension, take a look at the already published extension source codes, which provide good examples of how to package community extensions, and join the #extensions channel on our Discord. Once you have an extension, please contribute it via a pull request. Finally, we would like to thank the early adopters of DuckDB’s extension mechanism and Community Extension repository. Thanks for iterating with us and providing feedback to us.

Do you expect thousands of concurrent single row writes at a time? If you use embedded duckdb on the client, unless the person goes crazy clicking their mouse at 60 clicks/s, duckdb should handle it fine. If you run it on the backend and expect concurrent writes, you can buffer the writes in concatenated arrow tables, one per minibatch, and merge to duckdb every say 10 seconds. You'd just need to query both the historical duckdb and realtime arrow tables separately and combine results later.

I suspect it has something to do with anti-tracking features, or something along those lines. As someone who's not particularly tech-savvy, that's just my guess. After several days of browsing, I noticed that this bug still occurred once or twice a day, even after turning off all extensions, including uBlock Origin. So, I have now proven my initial guess wrong. Also, my browser version is 120.0.1 (64-bit). Hsin-Yi Tsai (she/her) (REO Fx 129) [:hsinyi] Comment 26 • 7 months ago I am finally able to reproduce this issue, but still not reliably, and it's happening probably once out of tens of attempts. I followed STRs in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860426#c2 ; I seemed to have to select texts from a bookmark page quickly enough, right after I navigated from homepage to the bookmark page, and before the bookmark page was completely loaded. lexlexlex Comment 27 • 7 months ago I believe this is not caused by the bookmark system, since I see it often and almost never use bookmarks. I never have the bookmarks bar enabled, either. I may use a bookmark once per 2 months, yet this bug manifests multiple times per week. Peter Cassidy Comment 28 • 7 months ago I cleared browsing & download, cache and form & search histories then opened and closed Firefox 10 times. Each time I went to the bookmarks menu. I used three different websites for the test, giving the website sufficient time to load. Then selected non-linked text. On the context menu copy was grayed out 4 times out of those ten times. I opened a new tab then went back to the first tab and copy was no longer grayed out. I tested with all extensions, theme, custom settings and userchrome.css enabled. Neil Deakin Comment 29 • 7 months ago Debugging shows that the focus manager for the process for the page being unloaded is receiving WindowHidden() which clears the mActiveBrowsingContextInChrome field. The focus manager for the process for the page being loaded is receiving WindowRaised() which sets the mActiveBrowsingContextInChrome field. On success, the two processes perform those steps in that order. On failure, they perform those steps in the reverse order. There's a bunch of code in ProcessPendingActiveBrowsingContextActionId that is supposed to handle these calls being out of order, but I can't figure out what it is trying to do, but it seems to fail in this case. I can reproduce with the steps in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860426#c2 about 20-30% of the time, but I don't need to exit each time; it is sufficient at step 2 to just open a new window.

Restrict Comments: true Sean Feng [:sefeng] AssigneeComment 81 • 16 days ago So the issue here is that when a page goes to BFCache, it'd set the active browsing context to null, and the page that is about to show would update the active browsing context to itself. And these two operations are racy because they are triggered in different processes with different actionId. We are going to explore some potential solutions. I am first going to try to make the page that goes to BFCache to not updating the active browsing context because we know it'll be updated by the page that's about to show. I'll try this and see what breaks. If the above doesn't work, I'll need to make they use the same actionId, so that the one that sets the active browsing context to non-null will always win. This might requires converting IsInBFCache to be an IPC message rather than synced field, so that the actionId can be passed over from parent to child. If folks have different ideas, let me know!

From reading the comments on the bug, it seems to be an issue that's hard to reliably reproduce, and -- despite how simple it sounds from the editorialized HN title -- it involves interactions between different parts of the browser, and it's hard to track down and fix. Nonetheless, there are some proposed fixes, and I expect a near-future release will have one of them. This isn't that stereotypical \"simple bug has been sitting around unresolved for years because (arrogant|understaffed|uncaring) developers can't be bothered\" story that is unfortunately all too common in software (and not just open source software -- we just don't get to see it on a public bug tracker when it's in a proprietary product).

So I opened dev tools and saw there were network requests for google.com and play.google.com on the ftp page when it loaded even though there is nothing in the page source that would make those requests. When I force reload with cache disabled, these requests are not present. This looks like bad behavior by google.com somehow leaking into the next page. So I found another random ftp page, and I can reproduce all of this there: https://ftp.wildfire.gov/public/incident_specific_data/ Is it the lack of js, not something more arcane in the ftp templating on those sites? I can reproduce all of this at http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ which is js free, and also at https://news.ycombinator.com/, which has js (be careful to select something like \"### points\" below a post, which has no hyperlink) EDIT: I guess my theory was wrong, because I read at the bottom of the bugzilla: So the issue here is that when a page goes to BFCache, it'd set the active browsing context to null, and the page that is about to show would update the active browsing context to itself. And these two operations are racy because they are triggered in different processes with different actionId. We are going to explore some potential solutions. Based on the comments there, by setting BFCacheInParent to false in about:config, this bug is gone for me. reply penguin_booze 11 hours agoparentprevI'm able to reproduce this on vanilla Linux Mint, FF version 127.0.2. reply dishsoap 17 hours agoparentprevhttps://streamable.com/adh0t3 reply heavyset_go 18 hours agoparentprevCan't reproduce it on Wayland reply FactolSarin 18 hours agoparentprevI've recently switched from Firefox to Edge until they fix this bug.

But it's always a matter of choosing the problems you want, I guess. I might argue that this is quite minor in the face of... well... a Microsoft controlled browser, but what do I know reply jchw 17 hours agoprevThis happens often enough to notice (I have seen it a few times) but not really often enough to seriously frustrate me. At least on Wayland it's enough to unfocus and focus the Firefox window for me, then Copy is not greyed out anymore. I know the kneejerk reaction is \"how could something so basic be broken in any way???\" but realistically I think it's just a testament to how complex the entire codepath of something as simple as a \"copy\" menu item has gotten. I mean reading the bug report, it looks like it weaves in and out a surprising number of different components in complex ways involving IPC. It makes sense but at the very least I still never think of a simple UI element like a copy button having this much going on. reply 462436347 19 hours agoprevSpecifically the right-click menu option, which is often greyed out for no apparent reason. This happens on both Windows and Linux. Ctrl+C still works, but how does Firefox break something as basic as the right-click menu and copy in 2024? reply db48x 19 hours agoparentBecause the bug involves sending and receiving messages to multiple other processes. Each webpage you visit is potentially in a different process, and each of those processes maintains its own selection state (that state is visible to javascript running in the page, and you don't want to leak what you copy on this page to any other, so it would be hard to put it anywhere else). There is only one context menu though (in the main process), so it has to send a message to the content process to find out if anything is selected or not. It seems that somehow the message is going to the wrong content process, to a page where nothing is selected. The context menu itself then displays exactly the right thing, based on the data it got back. reply teruakohatu 17 hours agorootparentI hear what you are saying but the entire architecture is build around IPC message passing. A lot of user interaction will work the same way. There is nothing inherently more difficult about this scenario than many others within Firefox. If it has such a convoluted code path that it cannot even be debugged then that’s an issue with the architecture, not that the user has a crazy difficult edge case which every other browser seems to manage. Judging by the comments a lot of people in this thread have been affected by this issue. reply kstenerud 17 hours agorootparentIt's a caching issue, so it's by definition as tricky and elusive as a sasquatch.

I'm sincerely surprised by how many people on Hacker News are apparently copy/pasting with the context menu rather than using Ctrl+C. PSA for some common keyboard shortcuts: Alt+Left to navigate back (Alt+Right to navigate forward) Ctrl+T to open a new tab (Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen previously closed tab) Ctrl+N to open a new window (Ctrl+Shift+N to reopen previously closed window) Ctrl+Shift+P to open a new private window Ctrl+W to close the current tab (Ctrl+Q to close all windows) Ctrl+R to reload the page (Ctrl+Shift+R to do a forced reload of cached assets) Ctrl+Plus to zoom in (Ctrl+Minus to zoom out, Ctrl+Zero to reset zoom level) Ctrl+Tab to focus the next tab in line (Ctrl+Shift+Tab for the previous tab in line) Alt+One to focus the first tab (Alt+Two for the second tab, etc.) Ctrl+F to search the text of the page (/ (forward slash) for quick find) reply fourteenfour 16 hours agorootparentA person selecting text on a webpage is usually using the mouse already. It's reasonable to use the same device to choose the copy command. reply wormius 16 hours agorootparentSometimes people gotta jerk, and that leaves only one hand free, which means. Mouse for interaction, Obviously. But more seriously - FF isn't vim and no I'm not installing vim keybindings. And I do use the keyboard a lot (I've had to teach coworkers the tips for tab navigation for example), when in \"type/entry\" mode (oh maybe VIM is the right metaphor hmm). Anyways, sometimes you're just chilling with a few tabs and wanna pop back and forth between a few, and not be in type mode... So mouse it is. And if you're using mouse and hand off the keyboard it's far easier to just use the right click (I've only started doing this the past year or two... likewise I've taken to right click, back from the popup menu instead of dragging mouse across to the back arrow. (but if on keyboard yeah I alt-arrow it). What i love is how everyone just demands everyone use the interface the exact same way for all purposes and times. I do get frustrated at my roomie who won't just do it my way, when I ask her to search for something or I'm trying to help with something technical and she's in control of her laptop... though, and in those times I'm 100% right and legit. That's the only exception to my paragraph above. reply photonthug 17 hours agorootparentprev> maintains its own selection state This is the real bug. Why is it not global? Probably related to how if you go to google, leave the browser for terminal or ide, you still get a google hover text that brands everything else on your desktop depending on where your mouse was when you left the browser. reply db48x 17 hours agorootparentFor one thing, the selection state is visible to the webpage. For another thing, the webpage is where the text lives. Put that way it sounds funny, but think about it. You have a bunch of content processes, each of which is in charge of loading some number of webpages that the user wants to have open. There is a single UI process that the user can interact with. When the user actually initiates a copy, the UI process doesn’t know what text to put into the clipboard. The text is all in the content process! The UI process merely has to figure out which content process to send the messages to, so that the right text ends up in the clipboard. And that's more complicated than it looks because any given page you are looking at might be stored in multiple processes. A page on domain A with a frame that has content from domain B will often have a different content process for both domains, to ensure maximum separation of state between them. The bug appears to be a race condition in how the state of which content process has the most recent selection is synchronized with the UI process. The patch at the end of the bug report changes it so that when the user unloads a page no message is sent to delete that state. Instead, only whatever page gets loaded or switched to next will send a message to replace the state. This should eliminate the problem. Left–over tooltips are a completely different kind of problem. reply TaylorAlexander 18 hours agoparentprevI have been affected by this one on my Ubuntu desktop for months. It is very annoying!

I've done both mouse and alt-tab, i've ctrl-w'd the tab and ctrl-shift-T'd it. I've opened the same site in a new tab and it still wouldn't work. I've had to completely shut the browser down. Maybe it's different between Windows and Linux, perhaps (I'm using Windows for this). Maybe there's more than one cause, but the reason I hate this bug so much is because simple fixes like just alt-tabbing or even closing and re-opening or full-reload doesn't work. I'm like 99% certain that's the case. I'll have to verify next time this happens. It seems to happen at least a couple times a month. reply stuffoverflow 15 hours agorootparentClicking the URL bar once always fixes it for me. reply goda90 19 hours agorootparentprevMany websites will also prevent highlighting text as well. Reader mode is helpful for that. reply db48x 19 hours agorootparentOr just hold down shift, at least in Firefox. This avoids sending the events to the javascript on the page so that the user can act on the page without being blocked, while still using a page’s own context menu if it really does provide a useful one (Google Docs, for example, has one with actual editing actions in it). reply walrus01 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's the duty and responsibility of a properly implemented browser to not allow a \"website\" to break basic UI functionality because it pushes some javascript. I don't care about how Safari and chrome and edge do it. Firefox should not follow their lead. This is a fine example of why people install plugins like ublock origin and similar. reply db48x 19 hours agorootparentFirefox does it best here, because you can hold shift to get the original context menu back when the page blocks it or provides their own. reply freedomben 18 hours agorootparentExactly. There are legitimate use cases for hijacking the right-click menu to make it better. For example, Google docs, GMail, etc. The best solution IMHO is the shift key to get the normal menu. It's the best of both worlds. reply riiii 18 hours agoprevThey're also deleting downloaded .pdf whilst in private mode. Yes even when I click save as.

I experienced this copy bug for a long while now (for some reason, visiting Wikipedia seems to trigger it most often), and any such hitches seem to take months to resolve. It took five months[1] for Mozilla to fix an issue that made YouTube borderline unusable, especially on higher resolutions. Features like HDR video support have been requested for years and are seemingly not coming despite every other browser supporting it for ages. And yet, there's no viable non-Chromium alternatives.

It's not even that people don't care; people actively make choices that make their privacy situation worse, because apparently enduring the most minor of annoyances is unthinkable as an alternative. (And this isn't even an unloved bug that someone arrogantly thinks doesn't matter, and has been languishing for years.

I'd like to hope that Ladybird will give us a genuine alternative, but Google has ensured that current web standards are so complex that even MSFT (another megacap tech company) threw in the towel on maintaining their own browser engine. reply krsdcbl 16 hours agorootparentprev> the privacy fight is just completely unwinnable I'm afraid it is, in the current state of things. Another depressing example is how we collectively seem to accepted to keep referring to \"unique fingerprinting and observation throughout any activity of the web and apps\" as \"Cookies! :))\", while way too many people even blame EU privacy laws for all the purposefully annoying and misleading dark patterns used by the very entities spying on them. But you can't blame anyone for choosing convenience and preference over a threat that is utterly overwhelming to mitigate, to the point of feeling impossible to avoid anyway. Not to mention that a number of people rely on very specific UI features -- OP could well be my colleague, who has a muscular condition and simply cannot press \"Ctrl + C\" without discomfortable effort, or by constantly moving his other hand between mouse and keyboard. Others in turn may even be completely unable to do either, and fully rely on a pointer device to use GUI applications. The only chance to win the privacy war is by providing and maintaining free and open alternatives that respect and protect your privacy, and are not only on par with, but better and more user friendly than the existing spyware. reply facialwipe 17 hours agorootparentprevI really don't get how people work, sometimes.

I've been using Firefox since it was version 0.1 and was called Phoenix, and I used it because it was better than Internet Explorer 6 and had themes and add-ons and tabbed browsing. Current Firefox hasn't introduced anything unique to the browser and that's why their share is continuing to dwindle. Edge supports vertical tabs natively without any weird hacks to userchrome.css.

WebKit is a great engine, but nearly all good implementations are provided by Corps who's interests have very little to do with providing a good browser, and lots to do with what you do with that browser. Firefox in turn might be one of the last major alternative Engines that is maintained by a company who's mission indeed is in a large parts to provide you with a good browser, but seems to progressively struggle to do so, while the engine is a good part of that problem aswell. I find it harder and harder to deal with the many issues in daily usage -- and from a dev standpoint, FF is slowly surpassing Safari as the main blocker for being able to adopt new web frontend features.

While from an engine side, the situation with bugs lingering for years, and web features that still can't be used way, way after even Safari managed to implement them is not insignificant. It's not broken or actually bad software, but it's struggling to keep up with the Browsers it's meant to be an independent alternative for. This makes UX and feature parity a HUGE concern! Loosing market share through inconveniencing users in turns means web devs will have increasingly less incentive to. work around it's quirks and issues, which even further shifts the Browser market towards a handful of huge, profit oriented companies - which is without exaggeration a threat to maintaining an open web. reply kelnos 18 hours agoparentprevYeah, if this was some bug that had been languishing for years without anyone caring to look at it, I'd consider this a stain on Firefox's reputation. But that's not what's happening: it's a bug that manifests in what probably looks to the user like a simple way, but tracking down the problem and fixing it is not simple at all.

You seem to have quite new GPU compared to me so I guess AV1 isn't a likely culprit, but perhaps Firefox is unable to offload AV1 to the GPU even if supported? For me this caused YouTube to use CPU for AV1 decoding (as my GPU has no decoding support), resulting in stuttering, dropped frames etc. I disabled AV1 support in my browser so that YouTube is \"forced\" to serve me VP9 and after that video decoding was offloaded to my GPU resolving the issue. YouTube started serving AV1 by default rather recently for the higher bitrate quality settings. reply SuperNinKenDo 18 hours agoprevI thought I'd stuffed up my system clipboard, or sites had found some way to obfuscate with JS or something.

    "originBody": "Here’s how you can build and train GPT-2 from scratch using PyTorch Ready to build your own GPT? July 3, 2024 ByAmit Kharel 10 min read Are you tired of always using ChatGPT and curious about how to build your own language model? Well, you’re in the right place! Today, we’re going to create GPT-2 , a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, from scratch that can generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence. To dive deeper into the theory and architecture of GPT-2, I highly recommend reading The Illustrated GPT-2 by Jay Alammar. This article provides an excellent visual and intuitive explanation of GPT-2 and its inner workings. I’ll be referring to some of the visuals from the article to explain things better. I have tried to make this as simpler as possible. Anyone with any level of Python or machine learning can follow along and build the model. Resources This project will take you through all the steps for building a simple GPT-2 model and train on bunch of Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran songs. We’ll see what it will come up at the end :). The dataset and source codes for this article will be available in Github. I’ll also add a Jupyter Notebook which replicates this article so you can follow along with running code and understanding side-by-side. Building GPT-2 Architecture We will take this project step-by-step by continuously improving a bare-bone model and adding layers based on the original GPT-2 implementation. Here are the steps we will follow: Building a custom Tokenizer Building a Data Loader Train a simple language model Implement GPT-2 architecture (part 2) 🔗 This project is divided into two parts, the first one goes through the basics of language modelling and Part 2 jumps straight into GPT-2 implementation. I suggest you to follow along with the article and build it yourself which makes learning GPT-2 more interesting and fun. Note: This whole project will be done in a single python file so it will be easy for you to follow along block by block. Final Model: Final Model output: Your summer has a matter likely you trying I wish you would call Oh-oh, I'll be a lot of everyoneI just walked You're sorry\"Your standing in love out, And something would wait forever bring 'Don't you think about the storyIf you're perfectly I want your beautiful You had sneak for you make me This ain't think that it wanted you this enough for lonely thing It's a duchess and I did nothin' home was no head Oh, but you left me Was all the less pair of the applause Honey, he owns me now But've looks for us?\" If I see you'll be alright You understand, a out of theWait for me I can't call Everything Oh, no words don't read about me You should've been so You're doing what you so tired, If you, you got perfect fall Like the song? Then let’s get building.. 1. Building a custom Tokenizer Language models don’t see text like us. Instead they recognize sequence of numbers as tokens of specific text. So, the first step is to import our data and build our own character level Tokenizer. data_dir = \"data.txt\" text = open(data_dir, 'r').read() # load all the data as simple string # Get all unique characters in the text as vocabulary chars = list(set(text)) vocab_size = len(chars) Example: If you see the output above, we have a list of all unique characters extracted from the text data in the initialization process. Character tokenization is basically using the index position of characters from the vocabulary and mapping it to corresponding character in the input text. # build the character level tokenizer chr_to_idx = {c:i for i, c in enumerate(chars)} idx_to_chr = {i:c for i, c in enumerate(chars)} def encode(input_text: str) -> list[int]: return [chr_to_idx[t] for t in input_text] def decode(input_tokens: list[int]) -> str: return \"\".join([idx_to_chr[i] for i in input_tokens]) Example: Convert our text data into tokens: Installation: pip install torch Code: import torch # use cpu or gpu based on your system device = \"cpu\" if torch.cuda.is_available(): device = \"cuda\" # convert our text data into tokenized tensor data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtyppe=torch.long, device=device) Now, we have the tokenized tensor data where each characters in the text is converted to the respective tokens. So far: import torch data_dir = \"data.txt\" text = open(data_dir, 'r').read() # load all the data as simple string # Get all unique characters in the text as vocabulary chars = list(set(text)) vocab_size = len(chars) # build the character level tokenizer chr_to_idx = {c:i for i, c in enumerate(chars)} idx_to_chr = {i:c for i, c in enumerate(chars)} def encode(input_text: str) -> list[int]: return [chr_to_idx[t] for t in input_text] def decode(input_tokens: list[int]) -> str: return \"\".join([idx_to_chr[i] for i in input_tokens]) # convert our text data into tokenized tensor data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtyppe=torch.long, device=device) 2. Building a Data Loader Now, before building our model, we have to define how we are going to feed the data into the model for training and what the data looks like in terms of dimensions and batch size. Let’s define our data loader as below: train_batch_size = 16 # training batch size eval_batch_size = 8 # evaluation batch size context_length = 256 # number of tokens processed in a single batch train_split = 0.8 # percentage of data to use from total data for training # split data into trian and eval n_data = len(data) train_data = data[:int(n_data * train_split)] eval_data = data[int(n_data * train_split):] class DataLoader: def __init__(self, tokens, batch_size, context_length) -> None: self.tokens = tokens self.batch_size = batch_size self.context_length = context_length self.current_position = 0 def get_batch(self) -> torch.tensor: b, c = self.batch_size, self.context_length start_pos = self.current_position end_pos = self.current_position + b * c + 1 # if the batch exceeds total length, get the data till last token # and take remaining from starting token to avoid always excluding some data add_data = -1 # n, if length exceeds and we need `n` additional tokens from start if end_pos > len(self.tokens): add_data = end_pos - len(self.tokens) - 1 end_pos = len(self.tokens) - 1 d = self.tokens[start_pos:end_pos] if add_data != -1: d = torch.cat([d, self.tokens[:add_data]]) x = (d[:-1]).view(b, c) # inputs y = (d[1:]).view(b, c) # targets self.current_position += b * c # set the next position return x, y train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, train_batch_size, context_length) eval_loader = DataLoader(eval_data, eval_batch_size, context_length) Example: Now we have our own customized data loader for both training and evaluation. The loader has a get_batch function which returns batches of batch_size * context_length. If you are wondering why x is from start to end and y is from start+1 to end+1, it’s because the main task for this model will be to predict next sequence given the previous. So there will be an extra token in y for it to predict the (n+1) token given last n tokens of x. If it sounds complicated look at the below visual: Figure 2: GPT-2 Input & Output flow from “The Illustrated GPT-2” by Jay Alammar. 3. Train a simple language model Now we are ready to build and train a simple language model using the data we have just loaded. For this section, we will keep it very simple and implement a simple Bi-Gram Model where given the last token predict the next token. As you can see below we will be using just the Embedding layer while ignoring the main decoder block. An Embedding layer represents n = d_model unique properties of all the characters in our vocabulary and based on which the layer pops out the property using the token index or in our case the index of our character in the vocabulary. You will be amazed how well the model will behave just by using the Embeddings. And we will be improving the model step by step by adding more layers, so sit tight and follow along. Initialization: used to define size of embeddings d_model = vocab_size The embedding dimension or d_model is vocab_size currently because the final output has to map to the logits for each character in vocab to calculate their probabilities. Later on we will introduce a Linear layer which will map d_model to vocab_size and then we can have a custom embedding_dimension. Model: import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F class GPT(nn.Module): def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model): super().__init__() self.wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model) # word token embeddings def forward(self, inputs, targets = None): logits = self.wte(inputs) # dim -> batch_size, sequence_length, d_model loss = None if targets != None: batch_size, sequence_length, d_model = logits.shape # to calculate loss for all token embeddings in a batch # kind of a requirement for cross_entropy logits = logits.view(batch_size * sequence_length, d_model) targets = targets.view(batch_size * sequence_length) loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, targets) return logits, loss def generate(self, inputs, max_new_tokens): # this will store the model outputs along with the initial input sequence # make a copy so that it doesn't interfare with model for _ in range(max_new_tokens): # we only pass targets on training to calculate loss logits, _ = self(inputs) # for all the batches, get the embeds for last predicted sequence logits = logits[:, -1, :] probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=1) # get the probable token based on the input probs idx_next = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1) inputs = torch.cat([inputs, idx_next], dim=1) # as the inputs has all model outputs + initial inputs, we can use it as final output return inputs m = GPT(vocab_size=vocab_size, d_model=d_model).to(device) We have now successfully defined our model with just one Embedding layer and Softmax for token generation. Let’s see how our model behaves when given some input characters. 😄 Pretty interesting!! But we are not quite there yet. Now the final step is to train our model and give it some knowledge about the characters. Let’s setup our optimizer. We will use a simple AdamW optimizer for now with 0.001 learning rate. We will go through improving the optimization in later sections. lr = 1e-3 optim = torch.optim.AdamW(m.parameters(), lr=lr) Below is a very simple training loop. epochs = 5000 eval_steps = 1000 # perform evaluation in every n steps for ep in range(epochs): xb, yb = train_loader.get_batch() logits, loss = m(xb, yb) optim.zero_grad(set_to_none=True) loss.backward() optim.step() if ep % eval_steps == 0 or ep == epochs-1: m.eval() with torch.no_grad(): xvb, yvb = eval_loader.get_batch() _, e_loss = m(xvb, yvb) print(f\"Epoch: {ep}tlr: {lr}ttrain_loss: {loss}teval_loss: {e_loss}\") m.train() # back to training mode Let’s run: So we got a pretty good loss result. But we are not there yet. As you can see, the error decreased by a higher amount until epoch 2000 and not much improvements afterwards. It’s because the model doesn’t yet have much brain power (or layers/neural networks) and it’s just comparing embedding of one character with another. The output now looks like below: 😮 OK!! Not very pleasing but definitely some improvements than the first generation which was without any training (Obviously). The model is starting to know how the songs are formatted and the lines and everything which is pretty impressive. Now, as this article is getting too longer, I will add rest of the sections in the Part 2 below: Build and Train GPT-2 (Part 2) Thanks for reading the article. I hope you learned something new.

He keeps bringing you back to first principles, again and again, does not let a single doubt remain, and the code is very accessible and practical. The intersection between those who can teach and those who truly understand the deepest essence of a subject is much smaller than we would hope. People like Feynman, Tanenbaum, Sussman, Susskind, and now Karpathy are exceedingly rare. Each of them is a gift for generations to come. So, when you find one whose style resonates with the way you think, I suggest watching their videos multiple times. :) reply frognumber 8 hours agorootparentprevConvert video to text with this one simply secret trick: * yt-dlp * whisper (whisper is surprisingly good for a lot of educational videos) Even better is to connect text to images. but that's less of a simple trick (although I do have the code). reply omerhac 7 hours agorootparentThats cool but not exactly the same as reading text that was written to be consumed as text.

The value is in communicating ideas and understanding. You don't need to skim through the 4 hour video long to see it's full of whys and hows and explanations and demonstrations that massively dwarf the blog post. It's basically a mini course. Programming is an interactive process, so transcribing the video to text also removes a lot information. The video isn't just an audio form of what could've been a long text tutorial. You're watching someone do something. reply nottorp 7 hours agorootparent> The value is in communicating ideas and understanding. And those ideas absolutely can't be communicated in concise writing, I have to waste my life on listening to talking heads? reply jamescmartinez 4 hours agorootparentThis is an option for those who want to learn from a more interactive medium instead of from a textbook. Different people learn in different ways. I wouldn’t call any of it a waste. reply hombre_fatal 7 hours agorootparentprevYes. Skim the video.

Otherwise it's like learning to build a website and stopping short of actually doing the final bit where you put it on a webserver and run it live. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

So nothing but the deepest pockets will challenge them. reply jsheard 8 hours agorootparentprev...is the official App Store not built on predatory free to play gaming money? The top grossing games on iOS are all \"free\", and they have no rules against the most exploitative types of F2P monetization (gacha/pseudo-gambling). They have even featured gacha games like Genshin Impact during their launch events. Apple had no qualms about Fortnites monetization model when it was in the App Store either, other than the fact that Epic tried to cut them out of the payment loop. reply nottorp 6 hours agorootparentYes so?

Tencent's reach is in nearly every industry in China. >And please don't tell me Tencent is a minority investor or that there are non predatory IAPs I won't, but do you really believe all add-ons are predatory? This attitude is exactly why you can't make premium mobile anymore. No one wants to pay, and the minority that do will pay a lot. \"Piracy is a service problem\" is a very common thing touted in argument against such tactics, but when you can sell your service for \"free\" to get people in the door, that argument falls apart quickly. reply nottorp 7 hours agorootparent> This attitude is exactly why you can't make premium mobile anymore Premium? Freemium? The few mobile apps that I bought since i got a smart phone are all pay once and most of them cost more than 0.99. However, for example, I do not even bother to look at mobile games any more because I \"know\" they'll be an IAP crapfest. And if i look at applications, it's because they have been mentioned and deemed useful by a third party i trust. reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentIt varies per app. Most common models: - ad supported, pay once to remove ads - subscription model. Get basic features and maybe ads, pay some 2-5 dollars a month for premium features. These may or may not have a \"lifetime\" option which is basically pay once. - the dying breed of \"demo mode\". You play X levels and then you pay once for a \"full game\". - and then freemium models which is basically a free game with small and large tricks to encourage spending over time.This is probably where you are. But outside of that, yes. There are still premium games you buy like a console game (they are often ports of console games). But it's a niche because they are competing against a sea of \"free\" games. And many mobile gamers do just want 10-20 minutes of a quick fix, not even long enough to get past tutorials in larger games. reply wellthisisgreat 2 hours agorootparentprev> all add-ons are predatory? All gaming IAP that are not full on expansions (not skins, not standalone characters, etc.hm) are predatory reply DEADMINCE 8 hours agorootparentprevNone of that matters. The owner of a game doesn't dictate whether the game is predatory or not, the behavior of the game does. The free to play model isn't inherently predatory, either, although certain companies certainly are. Call of Duty seems especially predatory. reply nottorp 8 hours agorootparentLet me translate “it’s only cosmetic” for you, because it’s probably what you think when you say there are non predatory IAPs. It means “keep the players playing until they get bored and buy some cosmetics”. They design the game to not only fleece you for money, but to waste your time until you do. reply DEADMINCE 7 hours agorootparentTranslate what you like, it doesn't change my point: Free to play is not inherently predatory. There's a big difference between free to play and using as many dirty tricks as they can to fleece as much info as possible (and/or being pay to win), and a company that genuinely makes a free to play game and makes money off skins, because it made better business sense than charging $50 up front. reply nottorp 7 hours agorootparent> Free to play is not inherently predatory. See below. > genuinely makes a free to play game [...] because it made better business sense than charging $50 up front. So the free to play model fleeces you for more money. It's not predatory. At all. Honest. reply DEADMINCEDOS 6 hours agorootparent> See below. See above. > So the free to play model fleeces you for more money. It's not predatory. At all. Honest. Ah, I see the cause of the misunderstanding. You're assuming the free to play model fleeces people for more money always when that simply isn't true. It's obviously true when companies are playing dirty, but not all companies do. Consider little indie studios, for example. Quite often, free to play can end up costing people less money. Case in point, I played CSGO for 10+ years and spent less than $5 on it. If I had bought the game when it came out it would have cost $20 or so. reply nottorp 3 hours agorootparent> Consider little indie studios, for example.

Case in point, I played CSGO for 10+ years and spent less than $5 on it. If I had bought the game when it came out it would have cost $20 or so. Someone else paid $2000 for hats or whatever CSGO sells in the same period to cover the $20 you and other 98 players haven't paid. And the game design and development effort went towards making those hats so the whales can buy them. Any free to play game would have been completely different if it were designed as a pay once game. reply bburnett44 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m not disagreeing with you that it’s predatory but I think the point is that by not charging up front, you get more people in the door. And even if each of those people spend less than the upfront would have been, there are so many more of them that you make money. That basic philosophy isn’t bad, it’s what most tech platforms are based on reply Hamuko 9 hours agorootparentprev\"Gatekeeper approved by Apple\" is not entirely accurate since Apple also gatekeeps what that gatekeeper can actually approve. All apps in third-party app stores must be notarized and Apple has complete control of what apps get notarized. UTM for example is not allowed on iOS even on third-party app stores since Apple has denied them notarization. It's more of a choice between Apple, or Apple + third-party gatekeeper. Well, at least now – I fully expect this to be investigated by the EU. reply DEADMINCE 8 hours agorootparentIt's going to be amazing watching Apple accept that they have to remove their stupid, anti-consumer and limited restrictions, at least in the EU. reply Rinzler89 7 hours agorootparentThey'll fight tooth and nail even with the knowledge they'll eventually loose because they know once they cave in, other countries will want the same pro consumer privacy rules for them and Apple will have already run out of excuses by then. reply Unbefleckt 9 hours agorootparentprevnext [13 more] [flagged] Rinzler89 9 hours agorootparentIt's a problem for those who already bought Apple and didn't know any better or didn't care.

You can definitely de-google AOSP (and I believe a few phones sell on that promise if you don't want to ever interface with that stuff). You can't de-apple IOS as of now. I don't think that problem will be solved anytime soon. Network effects + market capture = no one is going to want to learn a new system. The desktop space has been 3 platforms for decades and the only potential challenger is... Google. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Blackberry, and Palm all dropped out nearly a decade ago and there's nothing new on the horizon. reply nottorp 8 hours agorootparentprevYep, it's not like you have a choice in the mobile space.

I think one understated part of the consoles is that that 30% does go into proper support, compared to apple/google that act more as gatekeepers. Larger studios knowing they can get on-site console developers to help debug, optimize, and maybe even fix API issues is well worth such a cut. reply kibwen 2 hours agorootparent> consoles at best last 8 years before the new generation. Consoles remain alive way longer in poorer regions of the world. The lock-in from console manufacturers is designed to artificially shorten console lifecycles by cutting off supply of newly-manufactured older consoles and new games for those consoles.

The porn company isn't doing anything wrong, and EU laws are irrelevant. At this point they can try to firewall off the company, punish ISPs, maybe punish citizens who do business with that company, because it isn't breaking any EU laws, and has no EU presence that can be fined, sieved, etc. This is very normal, this is the way international laws work barring treaties or other agreements to have a special arrangement outside of that. So, if Apple pulls out of the EU, maybe they can no longer ship mail to the EU, I'm doubtful of that but let's just say. Well, there are plenty of non EU countries close by, including the UK. Not really a problem for EU citizens to get one at all, so again, the EU can only punish people, not the company. > Like, I can’t just ship heroin to Europe from abroad and claim I’m immune.

Because Apple absolutely doesn't need to be the only entity performing this task — I don't trust Epic, I think their business model is predatory on gambling addiction, that doesn't mean they would be incapable of performing the same kinds of security review — and while Apple's smooshing of all the different expenses from API development to review and hosting and processing fees into a fixed sales percentage is convenient, it does make it harder for competitors to emerge for each of those separate tasks. reply johnnyanmac 8 hours agorootparent>Perfect is the enemy of the good.

Of course, corporations are not democracies, so the fight between Apple and Epic is to me as the fight between King John and his barons in 1215 A.D. — and my relative power compared to either corporation is as the power of a, I dunno, franklin or free peasants or something, as to the King and his barons. reply lukeschlather 1 hour agorootparentYou're essentially arguing that King John should have exclusive right to publish books, and that he should be able to prevent the barons from publishing unapproved books - the DMA gives anyone the right to publish apps including you and I and Epic.

It's kind of crazy, because all of the super high numbers and companies that said they'd go bankrupt were looking at the Personal tier, which basically acted as a sales funnel towards the Pro tier, where the prices would not be as outrageous, even in the original version of the Runtime Fee: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/unity-runtime-fee-a-look-at... (under \"How bad is it, really?\") Of course, they since revised it so my article isn't relevant anymore, but if you look at the platform fee cost per install, then it becomes quite obvious and the initial pushback didn't seem to take this into account: https://blog.kronis.dev/images/1/6/-/f/e/16-fee-per-install-... Aside from that, though, I guess companies will always try to take a part of the profits that anything offered through their platforms generates (Apple's App Store, Google's Play Store, Valve's Steam etc.). It's good to see things improving at least somewhat, though, since we can't express a lot of progress overnight. reply AnonC 10 hours agoparentprev> For most developers this will be a deal breaker, because it also applies to free software which most of the time is only supported by donations If the app is taking donations or any sort of payment, then the Core Technology Fee applies after 1 million first installs in a year. If it’s a completely free app, this fee does not apply. This fee also does not apply for educational institutions, nonprofits, and government agencies (with a fee waiver). Quoting from “ Understanding the Core Technology Fee for iOS apps in the European Union” [1]: > Developers whose apps do not surpass one million first annual installs per year and nonprofits, educational institutions, and government entities with an Apple Developer Program fee waiver do not pay the CTF.

Apple has at best, 50% of the market. They sell their own hardware, and the OS is only available on that hardware. They don't force other phone manufacturers to buy iOS licenses even though they're shipping phones without iOS. You can't even buy a license for iOS except to buy the actual hardware from Apple. All the same software, with the singular exception of Apple's own first party software and perhaps some small indie softare, is available on the competing platform. The competing platform is sold by multiple vendors, comes in multiple different options and is just as well supported by 3rd party developers and businesses. The terms and conditions of the Apple store, and the associated fees are as bad or better than they have ever been. There has been no bait and switch, no undercutting the market to oust competitors. In fact, iOS devices as a rule are some of the most expensive devices in their respective classes. They offer access to all of your data in industry standard formats if you decide you want to switch, and Google themselves offer an automatic switching application that will transfer that data for you.

    "originBody": "Properly Testing Concurrent Data Structures Jul 5, 2024 There’s a fascinating Rust library, loom, which can be used to thoroughly test lock-free data structures. I always wanted to learn how it works. I still do! But recently I accidentally implemented a small toy which, I think, contains some of the loom’s ideas, and it seems worthwhile to write about that. The goal here isn’t to teach you what you should be using in practice (if you need that, go read loom’s docs), but rather to derive a couple of neat ideas from first principles. One, Two, Three, Two As usual, we need the simplest possible model program to mess with. The example we use comes from this excellent article. Behold, a humble (and broken) concurrent counter: use std::sync::atomic::{ AtomicU32, Ordering::SeqCst, }; #[derive(Default)] pub struct Counter { value: AtomicU32, } impl Counter { pub fn increment(&self) { let value = self.value.load(SeqCst); self.value.store(value + 1, SeqCst); } pub fn get(&self) -> u32 { self.value.load(SeqCst) } } The bug is obvious here — the increment is not atomic. But what is the best test we can write to expose it? Trivial Test The simplest idea that comes to mind is to just hammer the same counter from multiple threads and check the result at the end; #[test] fn threaded_test() { let counter = Counter::default(); let thread_count = 100; let increment_count = 100; std::thread::scope(|scope| { for _ in 0..thread_count { scope.spawn(|| { for _ in 0..increment_count { counter.increment() } }); } }); assert_eq!(counter.get(), thread_count * increment_count); } This fails successfully: thread 'counter::trivial' panicked: assertion `left == right` failed left: 9598 right: 10000 But I wouldn’t call this test satisfactory — it very much depends on the timing, so you can’t reproduce it deterministically and you can’t debug it. You also can’t minimize it — if you reduce the number of threads and increments, chances are the test passes by luck! PBT Of course the temptation is to apply property based testing here! The problem almost fits: we have easy-to-generate input (the sequence of increments spread over several threads), a good property to check (result of concurrent increments is identical to that of sequential execution) and the desire to minimize the test. But just how can we plug threads into a property-based test? PBTs are great for testing state machines. You can run your state machine through a series of steps where at each step a PBT selects an arbitrary next action to apply to the state: #[test] fn state_machine_test() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { // This is our state machine! let mut state: i32 = 0; // We'll run it for up to 100 steps. let step_count: usize = rng.int_in_range(0..=100)?; for _ in 0..step_count { // At each step, we flip a coin and // either increment or decrement. match *rng.choose(&[\"inc\", \"dec\"])? { \"inc\" => state += 1, \"dec\" => state -= 1, _ => unreachable!(), } } Ok(()) }); } And it feels like we should be able to apply the same technique here. At every iteration, pick a random thread and make it do a single step. If you can step the threads manually, it should be easy to maneuver one thread in between load&store of a different thread. But we can’t step through threads! Or can we? Simple Instrumentation Ok, let’s fake it until we make it! Let’s take a look at the buggy increment method: pub fn increment(&self) { let value = self.value.load(SeqCst); self.value.store(value + 1, SeqCst); } Ideally, we’d love to be able to somehow “pause” the thread in-between atomic operations. Something like this: pub fn increment(&self) { pause(); let value = self.value.load(SeqCst); pause(); self.value.store(value + 1, SeqCst); pause(); } fn pause() { // ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ } So let’s start with implementing our own wrapper for AtomicU32 which includes calls to pause. use std::sync::atomic::Ordering; struct AtomicU32 { inner: std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32, } impl AtomicU32 { pub fn load(&self, ordering: Ordering) -> u32 { pause(); let result = self.inner.load(ordering); pause(); result } pub fn store(&self, value: u32, ordering: Ordering) { pause(); self.inner.store(value, ordering); pause(); } } fn pause() { // still no idea :( } Managed Threads API One rule of a great API design is that you start by implement a single user of an API, to understand how the API should feel, and only then proceed to the actual implementation. So, in the spirit of faking, let’s just write a PBT using these pausable, managed threads, even if we still have no idea how to actually implement pausing. We start with creating a counter and two managed threads. And we probably want to pass a reference to the counter to each of the threads: let counter = Counter::default(); let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); Now, we want to step through the threads: while !rng.is_empty() { let coin_flip: bool = rng.arbitrary()?; if t1.is_paused() { if coin_flip { t1.unpause(); } } else if t2.is_paused() { if coin_flip { t2.unpause(); } } } Or, refactoring this a bit to semantically compress: let counter = Counter::default(); let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); let threads = [t1, t2]; while !rng.is_empty() { for t in &mut threads { if t.is_paused() && rng.arbitrary()? { t.unpause() } } } That is, on each step of our state machine, we loop through all threads and unpause a random subset of them. But besides pausing and unpausing, we need our threads to actually do something, to increment the counter. One idea is to mirror the std::spawn API and pass a closure in: let t1 = managed_thread::spawn({ let counter = &counter; move || { for _ in 0..100 { counter.increment(); } } }); But as these are managed threads, and we want to control them from our tests, lets actually go all the way there and give the controlling thread an ability to change the code running in a managed thread. That is, we’ll start managed threads without a “main” function, and provide an API to execute arbitrary closures in the context of this by-default inert thread (universal server anyone?): let counter = Counter::default(); // We pass the state, &counter, in, but otherwise the thread is inert. let t = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); // But we can manually poke it: t.submit(|thread_state: &Counter| thread_state.increment()); t.submit(|thread_state: &Counter| thread_state.increment()); Putting everything together, we get a nice-looking property test: #[cfg(test)] use managed_thread::AtomicU32; #[cfg(not(test))] use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32; #[derive(Default)] pub struct Counter { value: AtomicU32, } impl Counter { // ... } #[test] fn test_counter() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { // Our \"Concurrent System Under Test\". let counter = Counter::default(); // The sequential model we'll compare the result against. let counter_model: u32 = 0; // Two managed threads which we will be stepping through // manually. let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(&counter); let threads = [t1, t2]; // Bulk of the test: in a loop, flip a coin and advance // one of the threads. while !rng.is_empty() { for t in &mut [t1, t2] { if rng.arbitrary() { if t.is_paused() { t.unpause() } else { // Standard \"model equivalence\" property: apply // isomorphic actions to the system and its model. t.submit(|c| c.increment()); counter_model += 1; } } } } for t in threads { t.join(); } assert_eq!(counter_model, counter.get()); Ok(()) }); } Now, if only we could make this API work… Remember, our pause implementation is a shrug emoji! At this point, you might be mightily annoyed at me for this rhetorical device where I pretend that I don’t know the answer. No need for annoyance — when writing this code for the first time, I traced exactly these steps — I realized that I need a “pausing AtomicU32” so I did that (with dummy pause calls), then I played with the API I wanted to have, ending at roughly this spot, without yet knowing how I would make it work or, indeed, if it is possible at all. Well, if I am being honest, there is a bit of up-front knowledge here. I don’t think we can avoid spawning real threads here, unless we do something really cursed with inline assembly. When something calls that pause() function, and we want it to stay paused until further notice, that just has to happen in a thread which maintains a stack separate from the stack of our test. And, if we are going to spawn threads, we might as well spawn scoped threads, so that we can freely borrow stack-local data. And to spawn a scope thread, you need a Scope parameter. So in reality we’ll need one more level of indentation here: std::thread::scope(|scope| { let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); let threads = [t1, t2]; while !rng.is_empty() { for t in &mut [t1, t2] { // ... } } }); Managed Threads Implementation Now, the fun part: how the heck are we going to make pausing and unpausing work? For starters, there clearly needs to be some communication between the main thread (t.unpause()) and the managed thread (pause()). And, because we don’t want to change Counter API to thread some kind of test-only context, the context needs to be smuggled. So thread_local! it is. And this context is going to be shared between two threads, so it must be wrapped in an Arc. struct SharedContext { // 🤷 } thread_local! { static INSTANCE: RefCell>> = RefCell::new(None); } impl SharedContext { fn set(ctx: Arc) { INSTANCE.with(|it| *it.borrow_mut() = Some(ctx)); } fn get() -> Option> { INSTANCE.with(|it| it.borrow().clone()) } } As usual when using thread_local! or lazy_static!, it is convenient to immediately wrap it into better typed accessor functions. And, given that we are using an Arc here anyway, we can conveniently escape thread_local’s with by cloning the Arc. So now we finally can implement the global pause function (or at least can kick the proverbial can a little bit farther): fn pause() { if let Some(ctx) = SharedContext::get() { ctx.pause() } } impl SharedContext { fn pause(&self) { // 😕 } } Ok, what to do next? We somehow need to coordinate the control thread and the managed thread. And we need some sort of notification mechanism, so that the managed thread knows when it can continue. The most brute force solution here is a pair of a mutex protecting some state and a condition variable. Mutex guards the state that can be manipulated by either of the threads. Condition variable can be used to signal about the changes. struct SharedContext { state: Mutex, cv: Condvar, } struct State { // 🤡 } Okay, it looks like I am running out of emojies here. There’s no more layers of indirection or infrastructure left, we need to write some real code that actually does do that pausing thing. So let’s say that the state is tracking, well, the state of our managed thread, which can be either running or paused: #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Default)] enum State { #[default] Running, Paused, } And then the logic of the pause function — flip the state from Running to Paused, notify the controlling thread that we are Paused, and wait until the controlling thread flips our state back to Running: impl SharedContext { fn pause(&self) { let mut guard = self.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); *guard = State::Paused; self.cv.notify_all(); while *guard == State::Paused { guard = self.cv.wait(guard).unwrap(); } assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); } } Aside: Rust’s API for condition variables is beautiful. Condvars are tricky, and I didn’t really understood them until seeing the signatures of Rust functions. Notice how the wait function takes a mutex guard as an argument, and returns a mutex guard. This protects you from the logical races and guides you towards the standard pattern of using condvars: First, you lock the mutex around the shared state. Then, you inspect whether the state is what you need. If that’s the case, great, you do what you wanted to do and unlock the mutex. If not, then, while still holding the mutex, you wait on the condition variable. Which means that the mutex gets unlocked, and other threads get the chance to change the shared state. When they do change it, and notify the condvar, your thread wakes up, and it gets the locked mutex back (but the state now is different). Due to the possibility of spurious wake-ups, you need to double check the state and be ready to loop back again to waiting. Naturally, there’s a helper that encapsulates this whole pattern: impl SharedContext { fn pause(&self) { let mut guard = self.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); *guard = State::Paused; self.cv.notify_all(); guard = self .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Paused) .unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running) } } Ok, this actually does look like a reasonable implementation of pause. Let’s move on to managed_thread::spawn: fn spawn( scope: &Scope, state: T, ) { // ? ? ?? ??? ????? } There’s a bunch of stuff that needs to happen here: As we have established, we are going to spawn a (scoped) thread, so we need the scope parameter with its three lifetimes. I don’t know how it works, so I am just going by the docs here! We are going to return some kind of handle, which we can use to pause and unpause our managed thread. And that handle is going to be parametrized over the same 'scope lifetime, because it’ll hold onto the actual join handle. We are going to pass the generic state to our new thread, and that state needs to be Send, and bounded by the same lifetime as our scoped thread. Inside, we are going to spawn a thread for sure, and we’ll need to setup the INSTANCE thread local on that thread. And it would actually be a good idea to stuff a reference to that SharedContext into the handle we return. A bunch of stuff, in other words. Let’s do it: struct ManagedHandle { inner: std::thread::ScopedJoinHandle, ctx: Arc, } fn spawn( scope: &'scope Scope, state: T, ) -> ManagedHandle { let ctx: Arc = Default::default(); let inner = scope.spawn({ let ctx = Arc::clone(&ctx); move || { SharedContext::set(ctx); drop(state); // TODO: ¿ } }); ManagedHandle { inner, ctx } } The essentially no-op function we spawn looks sus. We’ll fix later! Let’s try to implement is_paused and unpause first! They should be relatively straightforward. For is_paused, we just need to lock the mutex and check the state: impl ManagedHandle { pub fn is_paused(&self,) -> bool { let guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); *guard == State::Paused } } For unpause, we should additionally flip the state back to Running and notify the other thread: impl ManagedHandle { pub fn unpause(&self) { let mut guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Paused); *guard = State::Running; self.ctx.cv.notify_all(); } } But I think that’s not quiet correct. Can you see why? With this implementation, after unpause, the controlling and the managed threads will be running concurrently. And that can lead to non-determinism, the very problem we are trying to avoid here! In particular, if you call is_paused right after you unpause the thread, you’ll most likely get false back, as the other thread will still be running. But it might also hit the next pause call, so, depending on timing, you might also get true. What we want is actually completely eliminating all unmanaged concurrency. That means that at any given point in time, only one thread (controlling or managed) should be running. So the right semantics for unpause is to unblock the managed thread, and then block the controlling thread until the managed one hits the next pause! impl ManagedHandle { pub fn unpause(&self) { let mut guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Paused); *guard = State::Running; self.ctx.cv.notify_all(); guard = self .ctx .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Running) .unwrap(); } } At this point we can spawn a managed thread, pause it and resume. But right now it doesn’t do anything. Next step is implementing that idea where the controlling thread can directly send an arbitrary closure to the managed one to make it do something: impl ManagedHandle { pub fn submit(&self, f: F) } Let’s figure this FnSomething bound! We are going to yeet this f over to the managed thread and run it there once, so it is FnOnce. It is crossing thread-boundary, so it needs to be + Send. And, because we are using scoped threads, it doesn’t have to be 'static, just 'scope is enough. Moreover, in that managed thread the f will have exclusive access to thread’s state, T. So we have: impl ManagedHandle { pub fn submit(self, f: F) } Implementing this is a bit tricky. First, we’ll need some sort of the channel to actually move the function. Then, similarly to the unpause logic, we’ll need synchronization to make sure that the control thread doesn’t resume until the managed thread starts running f and hits a pause (or maybe completes f). And we’ll also need a new state, Ready, because now there are two different reasons why a managed thread might be blocked — it might wait for an unpause event, or it might wait for the next f to execute. This is the new code: #[derive(Default)] enum State { #[default] Ready, Running, Paused, } struct ManagedHandle { inner: std::thread::ScopedJoinHandle, ctx: Arc, sender: mpsc::Sender>, } pub fn spawn( scope: &'scope Scope, mut state: T, ) -> ManagedHandle { let ctx: Arc = Default::default(); let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel::>(); let inner = scope.spawn({ let ctx = Arc::clone(&ctx); move || { SharedContext::set(Arc::clone(&ctx)); for f in receiver { f(&mut state); let mut guard = ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); *guard = State::Ready; ctx.cv.notify_all() } } }); ManagedHandle { inner, ctx, sender } } impl ManagedHandle { pub fn submit(&self, f: F) { let mut guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Ready); *guard = State::Running; self.sender.send(Box::new(f)).unwrap(); guard = self .ctx .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Running) .unwrap(); } } The last small piece of the puzzle is the join function. It’s almost standard! First we close our side of the channel. This serves as a natural stop signal for the other thread, so it exits. Which in turn allows us to join it. The small wrinkle here is that the thread might be paused when we try to join it, so we need to unpause it beforehand: impl ManagedHandle { pub fn join(self) { while self.is_paused() { self.unpause(); } drop(self.sender); self.inner.join().unwrap(); } } That’s it! Let’s put everything together! Helper library, managed_thread.rs: use std::{ cell::RefCell, sync::{atomic::Ordering, mpsc, Arc, Condvar, Mutex}, thread::Scope, }; #[derive(Default)] pub struct AtomicU32 { inner: std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32, } impl AtomicU32 { pub fn load(&self, ordering: Ordering) -> u32 { pause(); let result = self.inner.load(ordering); pause(); result } pub fn store(&self, value: u32, ordering: Ordering) { pause(); self.inner.store(value, ordering); pause(); } } fn pause() { if let Some(ctx) = SharedContext::get() { ctx.pause() } } #[derive(Default)] struct SharedContext { state: Mutex, cv: Condvar, } #[derive(Default, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)] enum State { #[default] Ready, Running, Paused, } thread_local! { static INSTANCE: RefCell>> = RefCell::new(None); } impl SharedContext { fn set(ctx: Arc) { INSTANCE.with(|it| *it.borrow_mut() = Some(ctx)); } fn get() -> Option> { INSTANCE.with(|it| it.borrow().clone()) } fn pause(&self) { let mut guard = self.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); *guard = State::Paused; self.cv.notify_all(); guard = self .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Paused) .unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running) } } pub struct ManagedHandle { inner: std::thread::ScopedJoinHandle, sender: mpsc::Sender>, ctx: Arc, } pub fn spawn( scope: &'scope Scope, mut state: T, ) -> ManagedHandle { let ctx: Arc = Default::default(); let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel::>(); let inner = scope.spawn({ let ctx = Arc::clone(&ctx); move || { SharedContext::set(Arc::clone(&ctx)); for f in receiver { f(&mut state); let mut guard = ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Running); *guard = State::Ready; ctx.cv.notify_all() } } }); ManagedHandle { inner, ctx, sender } } impl ManagedHandle { pub fn is_paused(&self) -> bool { let guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); *guard == State::Paused } pub fn unpause(&self) { let mut guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Paused); *guard = State::Running; self.ctx.cv.notify_all(); guard = self .ctx .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Running) .unwrap(); } pub fn submit(&self, f: F) { let mut guard = self.ctx.state.lock().unwrap(); assert_eq!(*guard, State::Ready); *guard = State::Running; self.sender.send(Box::new(f)).unwrap(); guard = self .ctx .cv .wait_while(guard, |state| *state == State::Running) .unwrap(); } pub fn join(self) { while self.is_paused() { self.unpause(); } drop(self.sender); self.inner.join().unwrap(); } } System under test, not-exactly-atomic counter: use std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst; #[cfg(test)] use managed_thread::AtomicU32; #[cfg(not(test))] use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32; #[derive(Default)] pub struct Counter { value: AtomicU32, } impl Counter { pub fn increment(&self) { let value = self.value.load(SeqCst); self.value.store(value + 1, SeqCst); } pub fn get(&self) -> u32 { self.value.load(SeqCst) } } And the test itself: #[test] fn test_counter() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { eprintln!(\"begin trace\"); let counter = Counter::default(); let mut counter_model: u32 = 0; std::thread::scope(|scope| { let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); let mut threads = [t1, t2]; while !rng.is_empty() { for (tid, t) in threads.iter_mut().enumerate() { if rng.arbitrary()? { if t.is_paused() { eprintln!(\"{tid}: unpause\"); t.unpause() } else { eprintln!(\"{tid}: increment\"); t.submit(|c| c.increment()); counter_model += 1; } } } } for t in threads { t.join(); } assert_eq!(counter_model, counter.get()); Ok(()) }) }); } Running it identifies a failure: ---- test_counter stdout ---- begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: increment 1: unpause 0: unpause 1: increment 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause thread 'test_counter' panicked at src/lib.rs:56:7: assertion `left == right` failed left: 4 right: 3 arbtest failed! Seed: 0x4fd7ddff00000020 Which … is something we got like 5% into this article already, with normal threads! But there’s more to this failure. First, it is reproducible. If I specify the same seed, I get the exact same interleaving: #[test] fn test_counter() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { eprintln!(\"begin trace\"); ... }) .seed(0x71aafcd900000020); } And this is completely machine independent! If you specify this seed, you’ll get exact same interleaving. So, if I am having trouble debugging this, I can DM you this hex in Zulip, and you’ll be able to help out! But there’s more — we don’t need to debug this failure, we can minimize it! #[test] fn test_counter() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { eprintln!(\"begin trace\"); ... }) .seed(0x71aafcd900000020) .minimize(); } This gives me the following minimization trace: begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: increment 1: unpause 0: unpause 1: increment 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause seed 0x4fd7ddff00000020, seed size 32, search time 106.00ns begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause 1: increment seed 0x540c0c1c00000010, seed size 16, search time 282.16µs begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause seed 0x084ca71200000008, seed size 8, search time 805.74µs begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause seed 0x5699b19400000004, seed size 4, search time 1.44ms begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause seed 0x4bb0ea5c00000002, seed size 2, search time 4.03ms begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause seed 0x9c2a13a600000001, seed size 1, search time 4.31ms minimized seed 0x9c2a13a600000001, seed size 1, search time 100.03ms That is, we ended up with this tiny, minimal example: #[test] fn test_counter() { arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { eprintln!(\"begin trace\"); ... }) .seed(0x9c2a13a600000001); } begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause And this is how you properly test concurrent data structures. Postscript Of course, this is just a toy. But you can see some ways to extend it. For example, right now our AtomicU32 just delegates to the real one. But what you could do instead is, for each atomic, to maintain a set of values written and, on read, return an arbitrary written value consistent with a weak memory model. You could also be smarter with exploring interleavings. Instead of interleaving threads at random, like we do here, you can try to apply model checking approaches and prove that you have considered all meaningfully different interleavings. Or you can apply the approach from Generate All The Things and exhaustively enumerate all interleavings for up to, say, five increments. In fact, why don’t we just do this? $ cargo add exhaustigen #[test] fn exhaustytest() { let mut g = exhaustigen::Gen::new(); let mut interleavings_count = 0; while !g.done() { interleavings_count += 1; let counter = Counter::default(); let mut counter_model: u32 = 0; let increment_count = g.gen(5) as u32; std::thread::scope(|scope| { let t1 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); let t2 = managed_thread::spawn(scope, &counter); 'outer: while t1.is_paused() || t2.is_paused() || counter_modelu32 { pause(); let result = self.inner.fetch_add(value, ordering); pause(); result } } impl Counter { pub fn increment(&self) { self.value.fetch_add(1, SeqCst); } } … we can get a rather specific correctness statements out of our test, that any sequence of at most five increments is correct: $ t cargo t -r -- exhaustytest --nocapture running 1 test all 81133 interleavings are fine! test exhaustytest ... ok real 8.65s cpu 8.16s (2.22s user + 5.94s sys) rss 63.91mb And the last small thing. Recall that our PBT minimized the first sequence it found …: begin trace 0: increment 1: increment 0: unpause 1: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause 0: increment 1: unpause 0: unpause 1: increment 0: unpause 0: unpause 1: unpause 0: unpause thread 'test_counter' panicked at src/lib.rs:56:7: assertion `left == right` failed left: 4 right: 3 arbtest failed!

Seed: 0x9c2a13a600000001 But we never implemented shrinking! How is this possible? Well, strictly speaking, this is out of scope for this post. And I’ve already described this elsewhere. And, at 32k, this is the third-longest post on this blog. And it’s 3AM here in Lisbon right now. But of course I’ll explain! The trick is the simplified hypothesis approach. The arbtest PBT library we in this post is based on a familiar interface of a PRNG: arbtest::arbtest(|rng| { let random_int: usize = rng.int_in_range(0..=100)?; let random_bool: bool = rng.arbitrary()?; Ok(()) }); But there’s a twist! This is a finite PRNG. So, if you ask it to flip a coin it can give you heads. And next time it might give you tails. But if you continue asking it for more, at some point it’ll give you Err(OutOfEntropy). That’s why all these ? and the outer loop of while !rng.is_empty() {. In other words, as soon as the test runs out of entropy, it short-circuits and completes. And that means that by reducing the amount of entropy available the test becomes shorter, and this works irrespective of how complex is the logic inside the test! And “entropy” is a big scary word here, what actually happens is that the PRNG is just an &mut &[u8] inside. That is, a slice of random bytes, which is shortened every time you ask for a random number. And the shorter the initial slice, the simpler the test gets. Minimization can be this simple!

Based on atomic memory ordering, read and write fences etc, perceiving write X may guarantee that write Y must be perceived. It contains what I believe to be the largest set of test cases of the C++/Rust memory model, which is essentially everything I could find in books, the C++ standard, Stack Overflow, blogs, etc. E.g. this is the file for Rust Atomics and Locks by Mara Bos [2] Loom [3], referenced in the article, is a similar and much more complete library, which enables you to exhaustively test higher level constructs like mutexes and queues. Although it doesn't model the memory model as exhaustively as Temper (I've been meaning to port my test cases over to it). I was inspired by a Foundation DB testing talk by Will Wilson [4], who is now over at Antithesis [5], building a hypervisor based solution to perform this style of testing on arbitrary Docker containers. I strongly believe we're going to see much more in this domain in the coming decade. WebAssembly is at the perfect intersection of being a platform that's complete enough to be able to compile arbitrary software to, but simple enough that building something like Antithesis isn't a half decade long project from an elite team that's already shipped a database.

I implemented some shared-memory atomic snapshots in Rust [0] and also did my best to take automated testing very seriously. I started out using loom [1], the library mentioned in the article, but latter switched to shuttle [2]. Shuttle's approach is to be randomized, instead of exhaustive like loom. However, the scheduler does still give probabilistic guarantees about finding bugs. I found that shuttle was faster and scaled to more complicated test scenarios. Similar to the article, shuttle also lets you save the random seed if a particular schedule causes the test suite to fail. Being able to quickly reproduce failing tests is really important and enables you write explicit test cases for bugs that were previously caught and fixed [3].

Consider a cmpxchg loop where the body computation is not quite trivial, but on real hardware (and with real schedulers) is exceedingly unlikely to be interrupted on a given CPU. Thus, if `n` is the number of CPUs, it has a worst-case `1/n` chance of making progress. But with this testing approach, it instead has a `1/t^p` chance, where `t` is the number of tasks (which may be far larger than the number of CPUs) and `p` is the number of pauses (easily at least 3) within the not-quite-trivial loop body; this is sufficient to turn a working algorithm into a broken one. OTOH, if you do want the tester to detect soft forward-progress as a bug (because you want hard forward-progress), this doesn't seem to provide useful tools either. (Regardless this is certainly useful for a lot of concurrency problems). reply ahepp 2 hours agoprev> Well, if I am being honest, there is a bit of up-front knowledge here. I don’t think we can avoid spawning real threads here, unless we do something really cursed with inline assembly. When something calls that pause() function, and we want it to stay paused until further notice, that just has to happen in a thread which maintains a stack separate from the stack of our test. Is there a reason we couldn't use some kind of async runtime? It seems like you're instrumenting atomic operations to achieve cooperative multitasking. Maybe I need to drink more coffee, but it seems simpler without threads. reply claytonwramsey 2 hours agoparentIt would be convenient to use async, but the other requirement is that we don’t want to change the outwardly-observable API of the software under test.

A data race has Undefined Behavior, and is therefore impossible to perform in Safe Rust. [...] However Rust does not prevent general race conditions. This is mathematically impossible in situations where you do not control the scheduler, which is true for the normal OS environment. [...] For this reason, it is considered \"safe\" for Rust to get deadlocked or do something nonsensical with incorrect synchronization: this is known as a general race condition or resource race.

    "originBody": "HOMEOPATHY Research into homeopathy: data falsification, fabrication and manipulation By Edzard Ernst 5th July 2024 Author Edzard Ernst https://edzardernst.com/ Edzard Ernst is Emeritus Professor of Complementary Medicine at the Peninsula School of Medicine, University of Exeter. He is the author of ten books on complementary and alternative medicine. More from this author Auriculotherapy: why poking needles into your earlobe is, essentially, pointless 11th December 2023 John Harvey Kellogg: the ‘Biologic Living’ theories of the inventor of corn flakes 25th October 2023 So-called alternative medicine and vaccine hesitancy 2nd August 2023 Charles appoints alt-med fan Dr Michael Dixon as Head of the Royal Medical Household 24th May 2023 How should alternative medicine practitioners be regulated? 24th April 2023 - Advertisement - We all know that homeopathy is a placebo therapy: its assumptions fly in the face of science, its remedies are normally devoid of active ingredients, and the evidence from clinical trials is uniformly negative. After the UK and France, now even Germany, homeopathy’s home country, agrees with this position. The 128th ‘German Medical Assembly’ recently declared that: “the use of homeopathy … is not an option that is compatible with rational medicine, the requirement for the best possible treatment and an appropriate understanding of medical responsibility and medical ethics”. But such arguments fail to deter homeopaths. They argue that there are plenty of clinical trials of homeopathy that arrived at positive conclusions. And to be fair, they are not even entirely wrong. There have been several studies that did imply that homeopathy works beyond placebo. How come? Why do some studies of homeopathy show positive results? The obvious answer is because these studies are not rigorous; they are not randomised, or not double blind, or not placebo-controlled, for instance. But this assumption might also not be entirely true. In 2020, Frass et al published a trial that seemed to prove it wrong. This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study showed that the quality of life of cancer patients improved significantly with homeopathy compared to placebo. In addition, survival was significantly longer in the homeopathy group versus placebo and control. When it was first published, this study was celebrated by homeopaths, while it raised many skeptics’ eyebrows. The trial seemed rigorous, was published in a highly reputed journal, and was conducted by well-known experts. Its lead author, Michael Frass, was a respected professor at the Vienna Medical School (the institution to which I too once belonged). When I first read his paper, I was nevertheless suspicious, not least because I had previously found that Frass (whom I have never met in person) had published no less than 12 studies of homeopathy all of which arrived at positive conclusions. This had long led me to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with Frass’ research. I was therefore not surprised that, soon after the publication of Frass’ new trial, an in-depth analysis by Norbert Aust and Viktor Weisshäupl disclosed several important inconsistencies. They eventually prompted complaints to both the journal, Oncologist, and the Vienna Medical School about suspected scientific misconduct. The Medical School then referred the case to the Austrian Agency for Scientific Integrity. The agency took their time, but recently, more that 3 years after the Frass study was published, they made available the final on-line summary of their assessment; here is my translation of part of this document: After establishing sufficient suspicion of various violations of good scientific practice, the Commission declared itself responsible and initiated proceedings. In the course of this, the principal investigator was given the opportunity to submit a written statement and to provide the Commission for Research Integrity Annual Report 2022 material that would help to clarify the facts of the case, which the accused submitted in large quantities. In a very complex, comprehensive investigation, which required, among other things, the on-site inspection of original documents, the Commission was able to substantiate the suspicion of data falsification, fabrication and manipulation. In a final statement, the study director, who no longer works for the university in question, and the numerous co-authors were informed in detail about the course and results of the commission’s investigation and informed of the recommendations to the university and journal. The Commission recommended that the university concerned should consider investigating its own responsibilities and act accordingly, and that the publication should be withdrawn as a matter of urgency. The journal responsible for the publication was asked to withdraw the publication on the basis of the findings of the investigation. Unfortunately, the scandal does not end here. Despite the Agency’s urgent call to the journal to withdraw the fabricated study, this has still not happened. Merely an ‘expression of concern’ has been added to the paper on Medline. It has been up for many months and reads as follows: This is an Expression of Concern regarding: Michael Frass, Peter Lechleitner, Christa Gründling, Claudia Pirker, Erwin Grasmuk-Siegl, Julian Domayer, Maximilian Hochmair, Katharina Gaertner, Cornelia Duscheck, Ilse Muchitsch, Christine Marosi, Michael Schumacher, Sabine Zöchbauer-Müller, Raj K. Manchanda, Andrea Schrott, Otto Burghuber, Homeopathic Treatment as an Add-On Therapy May Improve Quality of Life and Prolong Survival in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Three-Arm, Multicenter Study, The Oncologist, Volume 25, Issue 12, December 2020, Pages e1930–e1955, https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13548 In August 2022, the journal editors received credible information from the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity about potential data falsification and data manipulation in this article. While The Oncologist editorial team investigates and communicates with the corresponding author, the editors are publishing this Expression of Concern to alert readers that, pending the outcome and review of a full investigation, the research results presented may not be reliable. Consequently vulnerable cancer patients might still be misled by the fake findings of Frass and colleagues. The sorry story of Frass and his research illustrates some of the fundamental problems with research into homeopathy in particular, and alternative medicine in general. Sadly, scientific fraud is not uncommon in medicine. In conventional medicine, financial interests are often the driving force. This situation is very different in the field of alternative medicine, where ideological conflicts dominate. To put it into a nutshell: researchers in this field tend to initiate studies primarily because they want to prove that their favourite therapy is effective. By not honestly testing their hypotheses, but dishonestly trying to prove them, they abuse research. This enables people like Frass to publish one positive result for homeopathy after another. On my blog, I summarise this growing group of people in the satirically named ‘ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE HALL OF FAME‘. It currently includes 24 (pseudo)scientists, 6 of whom specialise in researching homeopathy. This could all be quite amusing but, of course, it is also very serious. Scientific fraud causes considerable damage. In the case of the Frass study, we even have to ask ourselves how many people’s lives it has shortened. Therefore, we should look for ways to minimise this phenomenon. This would certainly not be an easy task, and there is no patent remedy for achieving it. In the field of alternative medicine, I have long advocated that researchers like Michael Frass, who produce nothing but implausible results that mislead us all, should be barred from receiving public research funding. This, one might hope, would stop at least some of the chronically deluded pseudoscientists of alternative medicine.

I stopped, because belief in homeopathy is the same kind of belief as belief in flat-earth, and you can't be cured off it. People get seduced by a somewhat internal logic. They get a fuzzy feeling of superiority in their discovery that the mainstream ignores. If you point out the absolute lack of evidence of any of what they believe in, it's because pharma is silencing them. They are excited to be enlightened, because only they can see how crooked big pharma is: they need you to be sick so you can buy their \"allopathic medicine\" (derogatory calling of drugs that actually work), so they're trying to kill homeopathy who would really save you ; which to be fair is not helped by the fact that pharmaceutical companies are indeed crooked and want you to be sick. I don't think there's any volume that can be said on homeopathy that will convince anyone who already believes in it that it's all a scam. reply thinkingtoilet 21 hours agoparentThere's more to it. I am someone who has had medical problems that took years to diagnose. I had doctors who were terrific and I had doctors be almost accusatory when the tests they ran came back negative. When the medical establishment fails you it's tough, and there plenty of snake oil salesmen who are happy to sell you a cure THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT!!! I can see the allure when there's literally no one else to turn to. reply strongpigeon 20 hours agoparentprevI've heard of a strategy that can help some people challenge their belief for issues like homeopathy or flat earth. The idea is to ask them to rate on a scale of 1-10 the strength of their belief. As in, \"how convinced are you on a scale of 1-10 that the earth is flat?\". If they give anything less than 10, you then follow up by asking them why that score and why not a higher or lower score as in (if they said e.g., 8/10): \"What would make it a 9/10 or a 10/10?\". Basically having them \"ironman\" the opposite side of the argument can cause people to start to think more objectively about the issue. However, if the person says 10/10 there apparently isn't much that can be done. I've never tried this myself as I don't have any flat earther or homeopathy believers in my entourage, but it does seem to make sense and I've used this to question some of my beliefs myself. Not saying it would work with your family members either though. reply antisthenes 15 hours agorootparentHere's a better strategy: don't waste time on engaging them on that topic. The best possible outcome is that you waste a ton of your time (and theirs), and convince them that the Earth isn't flat. Did anyone benefit?

All the drops have to do is wash off the surface of my eyes, and we don't want them to do anything but that. His point was that because they're homeopathic, they won't actually do anything, and because they're a reputable homeopathic brand, you can be pretty sure they don't contain anything that accidentally does something. Homeopathy as a way to ensure you're not getting medicine. Interesting way to look at it, I thought. reply AlexandrB 22 hours agoprevWhat I don't get about homeopathy is that there's not even a plausible mechanism for it to work. So research into its effectiveness is like studying how well rocks repel tigers[1]. It seems necessary to show that a homeopathic \"medicine\" is substantially different than plain old water first.

They don't know to ask such questions, or perhaps they don't care to. In the worst case scenario, they accept lack of mechanism because \"there are things science doesn't know\", especially if their personal experience (random charlatan demonstration) is duped into belief. reply fabian2k 21 hours agoparentprevThis gets obfuscated by claiming that water has a memory and will \"remember\" those substances. Which is of course entirely implausible for anyone with sufficient physics or chemistry background. You're right that no further study is needed for homeopathy, it simply cannot work at these kinds of dilutions. reply Joel_Mckay 21 hours agoparentprevLike any cult pseudoscience it relies on the placebo and nocebo effects. It also does affect people for sure... For things like a very real ear infection... the a-holes will leave kids in agony for weeks before parents see a proper physician for antibiotics. Note Psychoneuroimmunology is also interesting, but a more legitimate area of scientific study. It takes a deep scientific look into induced immune system disorders, and unlike cult nonsense it has quantifiable scientific studies (usually done with rodents) that can be replicated in your own institutional labs. Cult Homeopathy is just expensive child neglect in my opinion... offering the worst outcomes for the naive and superstitious. reply financltravsty 21 hours agoparentprevThe plausible mechanism is placebo which is mediated by the autonomous nervous system. The same mechanism at play with back pain via either chiropractic (placebo) and the majority of spinal surgeries (placebo). Engineers and logical types take everything too much at face value (e.g. astrology and personality types, as well as health and fitness). The reality is usually that neither camp /really/ knows what they're doing, but have plausible (to them) explanations. Though empiricism is much more mentally rigorous than woo-woo/sham. Generally, if the treatment achieves the patient's desired goals -- I don't think it matters (barring severe ethical concerns like body integrity dysphoria). People not generally educated in a Western background are more likely to be susceptible to placebo or \"magic\" (this includes the less educated in the anglosphere but also the majority in foreign countries). Barring life-saving procedures, most elective medicine is -- imco -- on a similar, if not slightly higher standing compared to homeopathy et al. reply pixelpoet 22 hours agoprevI wish more German doctors would acknowledge what utter quackery homeopathy is.

After some years of that, my wife forced me to try all the hippie shit that I didn't believe in, and the acupuncture lady simply fixed it. Not reduced symptoms, just entirely gone, after a few treatments every year. It still doesn’t make sense to me. The only explanation I can think of is a placebo but wow placebos kick ass then! reply quitit 20 hours agoparentprevDiscussions I have with doctors and pharmacists about this situation are generally unproductive. There is this pervasive resistance to change and deep ties to traditional approaches. A large chunk of the problem is that many common self-selection and over-the-counter medications are only by a doctor's prescription in German speaking countries. Low risk medications, which in other countries a consumer can safely select and administer, are only available over-the-counter at pharmacies, other low risk medications require a script - examples of these include basic pain medication(OTC), NSAIDs(RX), PPIs(RX), skin treatments(OTC), anti-fungals(RX), anti-biotic drops(RX). Pharmacies also generally have short hours on Saturday, and are not open on Sundays. Combining these factors leads to people seeking out a \"solution\", and those \"solutions\" are either homeopathic or merely just alcohol, since neither require a health care professional's assistance. There is also no shortage of homeopathic stores that promise therapeutic benefits, such as addressing fertility issues and chronic pain. Regulators regulate medicine, so non-medicines often fly under the radar, even when they're promoting medical therapies. There's so many ways that this system fails in comparison to modern approaches: Should a woman not have a sufficient stock of pain killers on a sunday during period cramps, her options would be to either beg a neighbour, or got to the emergency department of a hospital. In other countries, she could simply visit a supermarket or convenience store. Children with head lice can't receive a treatment without a doctor's prescription, but there's no shortage of proven ineffective products stocking pharmacy shelves, hoping that some desperate parent will buy it just to see if it works. A person with conjunctivitis needs to first visit a doctor, potentially waiting hours just to get the script, then hope that the pharmacy is still open. (Doctor's offices are frequently bogged down with people visiting for minor ailments because they can't get basic medications without it.) In the realm of sexual health: While other countries have dispensing sexual health clinics with easy access to treatments and prophylactic medications, those afflicted in Germany and similar are often needlessly waiting, or worse simply spreading disease. With some medications and inoculations only available via a hospital appointment. Overall it breeds distrust in the medical system and promotes unhealthy, worthless, scammy \"alternatives\". reply sgerenser 21 hours agoparentprevIn the U.S., sometimes a medicine is marked as “homeopathic” just to avoid regulation, and actually does contain a real active ingredient. This is the case with zinc lozenges (for colds), which contain an actual therapeutic dose of zinc but are presumably marketed as “homeopathic” since the FDA doesn’t regulate herbal or homeopathic “treatments.” Not sure if anything like that happens in Germany as well though. reply plorkyeran 50 minutes agorootparenthttps://www.arnicare.com/about/arnicare-topicals/arnicare-cr... is another example I've seen. The active ingredient is \"Arnica montana 1X HPUS 7%\", meaning they start at 7% and do a single 10:1 dilution, resulting in .7%.

I find this interesting because it was a German example a few years ago that demonstrated that homeopathy could be ethical in a specific case. My mother in law (in Germany) had cancer, and eventually things reached the point where any further chemotherapy was pointless. So she went home. But they stocked her up with homeopathic \"therapies\" and she was quite diligent in taking them in the morning and thropugh the day. At first I was appalled, but then I realised that they gave her a sense of agency over her care. I think this had important psychological value over the beginning of the terminal phase of her life. Now I can't believe this works for everyone -- I can't imagine I would waste my remaining time on such nonsense. But I don't think she had a good grasp of science (she always wanted one of her kids, or me, to go with her to the doctor and to explain things to her) and she never had any access to the Internet to look things up, so she was probably the ideal candidate to benefit from this nonsense. Drinking water out of tiny bottles isn't any different from praying at that stage of your life and that's considered acceptable and even unremarkable in certain circles. PS: The Ukraine war made me think of her cancer -- it was a very unusual one and I have always believed it was due to some Chernobyl fallout. reply gumby 21 hours agoprevIf homeopathy \"theory\" says that the water retains an \"imprint\" of other chemicals it encountered, clearly the tap water coming into your house is horribly contaminated with the fish pee, ozone (from UV purification treatment) and the pipes themselves.

As an example onions and garlic do nothing to cure or address asthma. They do contain an active chemical that vaporized when they are cut which causes uncontrolled tear production. That same chemical agitates the throat in a way that arrests some amount of night coughing induced by asthma. Another example is that wild lettuce is a drug like opium. Opium is a thistle, as are artichokes, and thistles are closely related to the lactuca genus that comprises lettuce. The drugs in both opium and lettuce are found in the plant latex containing two analgesics and a depressant. Lettuce drug, lactucarium, is not known to be habit forming and is minor though. It is just recommended as a topical treatment for minor skin injuries. Another is that common fruits like pears, apples, and citrus contain drug like chemicals that alter the metabolism. This is super potent in grapefruit and has been known to cause fatal drug interactions in people on prescribed medicine. These chemicals are again magnified in commercial fruit juice since commercial fruit juice represents a high concentration of juice than found in actual fruit and without any fiber to slow digestion.

One of their insights is that placebo effect comes from neural modulation of pain receptors, and that the placebo effect has specific limitations.

Nobody went “wtf woa we can cure a % of people with empty pills, how does that work and how can we up the %?” I just don’t get it, it seems to me that the existence of the placebo effect is hard evidence that there’s a mind-body connection and we can cure body stuff with mind stuff (and vice versa, probably), so why does nearly all of that remain firmly in alternative woo-woo land? reply vikramkr 21 hours agorootparentBecause prescribing a placebo while saying it's a medicine involves lying to the patient, which is controversial when ethical standards usually involve informed consent and a belief in patient autonomy. > I just can’t fathom that the entire scientific community just went “ah, hm, right, placebo.

Reading other sections of the wikipedia article you linked, it seems to me that researchers have been stuck at “is the placebo effect even real?” for decades and few try to figure out how it works and why, and whether it can somehow be amplified.

No medication is even cheaper, but the placebo effect works, so if people were to take something, might as well have them take something cheap and harmless. In my opinion, it doesn't justify supporting homeopathy, but health insurances may see it differently. Placebos are an interesting ethical issue. Doctors are not supposed to deceive you, they are people you trust with your life and very personal issues and they are therefore held to very high standards. But even if it is for your own good, the placebo effect is based on deception, so is it ethical for a doctor to give you a placebo? And is fake science that still help people ethical?

I absolutely do not believe in homeopathy beyond placebo effects, and I understand the harm they do by opportunity costs in pursuing other treatments. But at the end of the day I feel like all medications should basically be handled like homeopathy products. They should be available to anyone, barring some kind of competency ruling or disagreement by the pharmacy over what they want to sell to whom, and the FDA should basically ensure that they are what they say they are on the label. I'm glad there's skeptics out there calling BS on homeopathy but where I diverge from them is in somehow preventing it from being available. It's water, it's labeled accurately, so let people do what they're going to do. If they weren't doing this I doubt they'd be doing something more \"mainstream\" anyway, or complying with it. They might even be doing something even more actively harmful. I guess I see it as a slippery slope from banning homeopathy to something much murkier where reasonable experts disagree. Real medical science can get very grey really fast and I'm not sure I trust regulatory authority figures to always make the best decisions about what to do. Better to leave it to the consumer and whichever provider they trust most. Demand product purity, prevent health claims on the label, whatever, but I think my question is \"why aren't more medications sold in American pharmacies?\" reply vikramkr 20 hours agorootparentits not about banning availability, its about making them required to prove the health claims theyre making. If you didn't have any requirements to prove your drug worked before selling it, youd take away a pretty huge market incentive to make drugs that work (health is about as far from a perfect full information free market as you can get -- homeopathy doesn't work at all and those companies are making plenty of money). These regulations also force research into and labeling of side effects, and skimping on that led to an opiod crisis. Honestly don't really see the economic or societal argument for deregulating medicine. If you want a system where to get an fda stamp you have to prove it works but can sell whatever otherwise with no consequences until you kill someone or destroy their gallbladders (https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2024/05/fda-determines-that-t...) - well that's what we already have now so given it hasn't changed in decades, even with recent attempts to do so after all the strip mall stem cell clinics and GRAS issues and all, I don't think your opinion is that out of the mainstream. And in terms of why aren't more sold in pharmacies - no clue what you're talking about there lol. Have you not seen the A-Z supplement whatever aisles full of all this unregulated crap? You can buy whatever you want unless the DEA has an issue with it. reply pdonis 19 hours agorootparent> You can buy whatever you want unless the DEA has an issue with it. Over the counter? No, you can't. You can buy a lot of stuff that doesn't work over the counter. But, for example, if I want a decongestant that actually works (pseudoephedrine HCl), I have to go to the pharmacy and show them my driver's license and make a record of the purchase because the government is afraid I might start a meth lab. And that doesn't even get into all the market failures with prescription drugs. What if I have the same bacterial infection for the umpteenth time and I know that antibiotic X will fix it? Can I just walk into the drugstore and get a course of antibiotic X? Of course not. (At least, not in the US. But in Mexico, I can.) Even if the argument is that I might be misdiagosing my symptoms (which, if it's the umpteenth time I've had the same thing, is not a very good argument), why isn't there a machine in the drugstore that can check my diagnosis?

Which of course concedes my point. reply vikramkr 17 hours agorootparentYou don't have a right to buy stuff that works or that you can trust, the point is that for noncontrolled nonpatented substances, nobody can stop you from buying or synthesizing active ingredients for your own use in the US, even if logically you shouldn't be trusted to have the competence to not hurt yourself, or if frankly there should be way way more regulation. You keep bringing up antibiotics but it's the category of drugs with the most widespread use (animal agriculture) with one of the strongest cases for being drastically under-regulated - they stop working if things become resistent to them and we spray them everywhere like candy. Also you keep acting as if getting a prescription is some sort of actual barrier or burden for non-prescription drugs, which is particularly funny after the whole fiasco with wegovy off label prescriptions before the active ingredient was approved for obesity/launched for obesity. These are not real barriers, even when they probably should be. reply pdonis 15 hours agorootparent> it's the category of drugs with the most widespread use (animal agriculture) with one of the strongest cases for being drastically under-regulated To call this area \"under-regulated\" is not accurate: the whole food production chain in the US, with all of its dysfunctionality, is a product of decades of regulation and government interference and mismanagement. The best way to stop antibiotic use with animals is for people to stop eating meat and other products from those animals, and if anything is going to facilitate that, it's going to be the market, which is already providing plenty of products in grocery stores that are from animals raised with no antibiotics, and will provide more the more people choose to buy them, as I do. reply pdonis 17 hours agorootparentprev> You don't have a right to buy stuff that works or that you can trust We're not talking about rights here. You claimed, and I quote, \"You can buy whatever you want unless the DEA has an issue with it.\" I am simply pointing out that that is not true. Whether it should be true as a matter of right is irrelevant to that factual question. > you keep acting as if getting a prescription is some sort of actual barrier or burden for non-prescription drugs Um, no, I said no such thing. Obviously having to get a prescription is not a barrier or burden for non prescription drugs. But, as you yourself have pointed out, a huge number of those non-prescription drugs, for which there is no barrier or burden, don't work. And, as you have also pointed out, routing around things like prescriptions to get, for example, antibiotics means you can't trust the product. So there are barriers and burdens in the way of getting things that do work and can be trusted. Which was my point, and which contradicts your original claim that I responded to. The question of whether there should be all these barriers and burdens in the way of buying things that work and can be trusted is a separate question. Your argument for why there should appears to be that without such barriers more harm would be done. Of course there will always be people who make stupid choices, and giving people more freedom by removing barriers and burdens will increase that. But you are not recognizing the other side of the barriers and burdens, which is that they prevent people from making good choices, choices that could save their lives. For example, look up the harm done in preventable deaths by the FDA's slowness in permitting beta blockers. The post you responded to that advocated a libertarian approach was saying, in effect, that, on net, the harm done by regulation is greater than the harm done by individual people making bad choices in the absence of regulation. I happen to agree. You apparently do not. But I do not see that you have given any reason to believe that the opposite is true. I certainly don't see anything in what you've posted that makes the opposite claim the slam dunk that you appear to think it is. reply vikramkr 3 hours agorootparentWhen i said buy whatever you want, i was referring to the ingredient in the drug, which you can buy or make with no issues.

It just sucks that every self-claimed decentralized app can easily be blocked. They can block faster than you can host another new instance & migrate users. reply renonce 13 hours agoparentEvery VPN advertised in China takes DPI in account and there is a very huge community around how to circumvent GFW. The previously popular protocol was Shadowsocks (until GFW blocked fully random traffic) and now I use Hysteria2 (which masquerades itself as QUIC) and it has not been blocked yet. In case your favorite VPN provider does not provide these protocols you can buy a VPS and deploy one of these protocols by yourself. reply Waterluvian 4 hours agorootparentIs there any sort of criminal risk to playing cat and mouse with GFW censorship? Or are you generally free to just do your best to subvert the limitations put in place? reply acheong08 3 hours agorootparentA quote from someone I know working in a related agency for “cybercrime” in China: > If you just set it up and use it yourself, at most you will just be given a verbal warning and urged to rectify and confiscate the tools. If you set it up and give it to your friends to use, there may be risks, but in reality, law enforcement agencies usually don't have extra time to manage these small things. If you set it up for your friends to use, the traffic of three or five people is very small, just normal access to the external network, and there is no other illegal behavior such as money laundering, telecommunications fraud, etc. No one cares. If you are the airport owner, that is, the VPN commercial service provider, then your legal risk will be very high, you will be involved in illegal operation of telecommunications services, because this requires you to apply for a license, and VPN commercial service providers usually earn large illegal income, may be sentenced and confiscated for several years. Note that the sentence is due to its illegal operation. Once he has the qualifications, then he will be a legal communication service. > Because such behavior can be subject to administrative penalties at most in the law, which is what I just said, warnings or orders to make corrections and confiscate tools, and at most fines, but generally not. The fine will be determined based on your attitude of admitting your mistakes. If your attitude is good, there will basically be no fine. In addition, if there is illegal income to be confiscated, such as illegal income obtained by browsing the Internet and conducting cross-border money laundering or cross-border telecommunications fraud or computer network crimes with international illegal organizations, it will be confiscated. Funnily enough, he says almost everyone used VPN-like technologies, even within the regulatory agencies. reply erebe__ 12 hours agoparentprevShameless plug, you can use wstunnel which disguise your traffic as websocket to tunnel any traffic you want. I had most success with it, as it uses TCP, than with QUIC/HTTP3 as usually UDP is more heavily restricted. It works behind GFW and let you use your wireguard for example...

We just watched Germany lose to Spain. We walked past a restaurant and saw a bunch of people starting at a screen, and it looked like a good picture to me. I was about to take it, and my friend said \"You cannot take pictures without permission from those people.\" I had no intention of posting on social media because I don't use that. Then we had a fascinating discussion about how photos without consent are outlawed. And, how video cameras are outlawed in public places. You cannot put up a camera outside your house to watch for Amazon packages. I was really struck by the \"news\" I get about Europe. I hear incessant discussions about GDPR, which is a very abstract thing about collecting data. I'm for it, I think, but it is abstract. If I ever heard a reporter saying \"You know, in Europe they are having a very different conversation about people taking pictures of your kids without your consent\" well, damn, I would be very excited and interested in that article. The fact that I don't read those articles makes me think my \"news\" is very controlled by social media companies, or should I say, anyone who has business in making sure data collection is unimpeded, which means Google, Facebook, probably Amazon.

Or am I right that the discussion of what happens in Europe is framed in a way that keeps me uninformed about what is really possible? European (Polish) here. Saying that all of Europe is privacy conscious is like saying that the entire US is extremely republican and never gets below 40 degrees Fahrenheit; there are a few states that fit this definition, but that's not the entire country. You have countries like Germany on one hand, where taking photos in public places is heavily restricted, you can get a ticket if the police find a dash cam in your car, quite a few organizations are passionate about avoiding Microsoft and hosting their own solutions, and a significant percentage of the population has Signal installed on their devices. On the other, you have countries like Poland, where everybody uses Facebook Messenger, nobody uses Signal, door and dash cams are perfectly legal, privacy isn't really that much of a concern, and photo laws are quite a bit less restrictive. We're both in the EU, we're neighbors actually, we both have to follow the GDPR, but the mentality and approach is very different. Over here, GDPR is mostly seen as \"another stupid law that Brussels came up with and that makes things more difficult than they ought to be\", not so much in Germany. A completely separate concern, unrelated to privacy, is how photo copyright is handled. In the US and some European countries (like Poland), taking photos of public buildings is legal, and you generally own the rights to those photos. In other countries, the owner / architect of a building, who owns the copyright on the design of that building, may disallow taking pictures of that design. In some places, the restrictions on photos stem from that different stance on copyright, not from any privacy concerns. reply janci 13 hours agoparentprevIf it's true, it's not GDPR. GDPR explicitly does not apply to personal use. There can be other laws that apply here.

Some countries allow dashcams some don't because the lack of consent. Germany is one of the countries doesn't allow this, do police would ask you to turn it off if they see one.

Following that talk, I was handed real consent forms to carry with me. At that time, privacy and commercial rights for resale were taken seriously. It is a social contract between strangers, and yes people can get very agitated. Fast forward to the age of the smart phone. The expansion happened so fast, for so many.. and with the marketing commercials and endless hype on using the phone to take \"fun vacation photos\" or whatever, and the explosion of Facebook uploads with \"friends at a party\" .. that social contract changed rapidly. New adoptors are often under 25 years old, and may not have heard of this formal signed consent form. Now, mass facial recognition at public events is \"no big thing\" ? Everyone has heard in California from someone that \"privacy is dead - get over it\" ? Then, covid-19 and masks.

    "commentBody": "Teaching general problem-solving skills is not a substitute for teaching math [pdf] (ams.org)111 points by JustinSkycak 3 hours agohidepastfavorite80 comments cyberax 1 minute agoThe other often-overlooked point is that _memorization_ _itself_ is a skill. You get better at remembering stuff as you keep practicing. And it doesn't necessarily have to be math. You can also train yourself by memorizing poetry, Chinese characters, foreign language words, and so on. And somehow all of these activities are getting sidelined in the modern education. After all, what use is memorization when you can always look up the answer on a phone? reply frogeyedpeas 2 hours agoprevThis comes down to the old saying \"everything is memorization at the end of the day\". Some people literally memorize answers. Other folks memorize algorithms. Yet other folks memorize general collections of axioms/proofs and key ideas. And perhaps at the very top of this hierarchy is memorizing just generic problem solving strategies/learning strategies. And while naively we might believe that \"understanding is everything\". It really isn't. Consider if you are in the middle of a calculus exam and need to evaluate $7 \\times 8$ by calculating $7+7+7+7...$ and then proceed to count on your fingers up to 56 because even $7+7$ wasn't memorized. You're almost certainly not going to make it past the first problem on your exam even though you really do understand exactly whats going on . Similar things are true for software engineering. If you have to stackoverflow every single line of code that you are attempting to write all the way down to each individual print statement and array access it doesn't fucking matter HOW well you understand whats going on/how clear your mental models are. You are simply not going to be a productive/useful person on a team. At some point in order to be effective in any field you need to eventually just KNOW the field, meaning have memorized shortcuts and paths so that you only spend time working on the \"real problem\". To really drive the point home. This is the difference between being \"intelligent\" versus \"experienced\". reply chmod775 1 hour agoparent> Consider if you are in the middle of a calculus exam and need to evaluate $7 \\times 8$ by calculating $7+7+7+7...$ and then proceed to count on your fingers up to 56 because even $7+7$ wasn't memorized. You're almost certainly not going to make it past the first problem on your exam even though you really do understand exactly whats going on. This is not a counterexample because exams aren't an end goal. The process of filling out exams isn't an activity that provides value to society. If an exam poorly grades a student who would do great solving actual real-world problems, the exam is wrong. No ifs. No buts. The exam is wrong because it's failing the ultimate goal: school is supposed to increase people's value to society and help figure out where their unique abilities may be of most use. > Similar things are true for software engineering.

If their mental models are truly so amazing, they'd make a great (systems) architect without having to personally code much. reply sim04ful 1 hour agorootparentI can't totally agree with your counter-counter example. Most non trivial problems are time bound, deadline exist, and no matter how well ingrained you are in first principles thinking you won't be useful if it takes months to come up with a solution. reply frogeyedpeas 1 hour agorootparentprev> Re: \"this is not a counter example because exams aren't an end goal...\" for any end goal with a set end time there are habits that need to be second nature and information that one needs to know in order to achieve that goal. If you lack those habits and don't know those facts it's going to be very hard to achieve that goal. I used the example of a calculus test and not being able to do addition. But this really could be any example. It could have even been a Wide Receiver failing to read the play thats happening quickly enough despite being physically fit enough to execute the right play in hindsight. >Re: they'd make a great (systems) architect... But you wouldn't hire them as a programmer. My sentence was biased in the sense that \"team\" meant \"team of software engineers\". You would hire them for a different job sure. Also good mental model here just means \"Always knowing and being able to clearly articulate what I need to accomplish next to write my code\". It doesn't even mean they are good at designing systems but lets go with that example anyways below: The Architect version of this is that they perhaps have perfectly clear mental models of exactly how to code (memorizing very obscure language shortcuts and syntactic sugar and writing very clear code when they know what to build) but they cannot for the love of god think critically about what a design should be BEFORE they implement it far enough to reach a major issue. And you would rightly say \"well I would never hire that guy as an architect but I might have hired them as a programmer thats led by more senior folks\". At the end of the day you are only hiring people for the parts of their mental models that are useful. And the ability to clearly recall facts about that their domain is basically the fundamental detail here. reply 1659447091 50 minutes agorootparentI agree with you that memorization is an optimization for getting daily task done (maybe not as optimal when novel solutions are needed; understanding/mental model might win out here). But we have tools to help take the load off memorization. The person that `understands` addition not as 7 + 7 but as incrementing a number a certain amount of times can use a calculator to solve the problem in a more efficient way. I would probably not make a developer who had great mental models but lacked coding chops my first hire. Nor the programmer that could make code do amazing things but can not grasp the domain model. I would, however, probably consider them(the mental model one) the 100th to clean up backlogged bug fixes, and the code whiz to implement the more technically difficult backend niche feature/optimization. As much as it pains me to say it, github copilot chat works surprisingly well IF you can give it a clear concise description of the model and expectations. Then someone with an excellent mental model can create the smaller lego pieces and put it together, minimal coding required. Not only for the popular languages, I play with it from time to time using clojure. reply TeMPOraL 3 minutes agoparentprevMemorization is caching. You need it because otherwise you'd be too slow at anything, but you can't possibly memorize everything, and the whole point of understanding is so you don't have to. And like with any caching, the more you store, the more it costs to maintain it, and the longer the lookups become. If you want to cram a lot of stuff into it, you may need to start doing actual, expensive work - e.g. spaced repetition - to keep it all. AS for memorizing generic problem solving strategies - I don't think it's about not memorizing, but rather that understanding comes through examples, and if you learn high-level stuff without actually applying it in practice, and experiencing the process, then you haven't actually learned the high-level stuff, you just think so, and will parrot the description without comprehending it. reply throwuxiytayq 2 hours agoparentprev> And perhaps at the very top of this hierarchy is memorizing just generic problem solving strategies/learning strategies. I'm not sure this counts as memorization. I don't even think you can really \"memorize\" high level learning and problem solving strategies, even when explained by an expert. You kind of have to re-discover them internally. And then, there are people who \"memorized\" the explanation and are completely unable to put it into practice because to them it's just a word sequence, instead of an internalized change to the way you perceive and work with problems. reply frogeyedpeas 1 hour agorootparentYou absolutely can. I remember struggling with some problems on AOPS and then reading in a book \"always consider smaller $n$ when dealing with a problem that is difficult because of large $n$\" and ever since then that habit has stuck. Whenever I have a problem thats hard and involves numbers and i'm stuck I just remember to ask \"what if the numbers were smaller? what do we do then?\" If that isn't memorizing something and making a new habit as a kid then I don't know what memorizing means. Said another way, the ability to remember to \"____\" when dealing with a problem of type \"___\" is what I mean by \"memorize\". reply throwuxiytayq 1 hour agorootparent> Whenever I have a problem thats hard and involves numbers and i'm stuck I just remember to ask \"what if the numbers were smaller? what do we do then?\" I think you underestimate the amount of internalized understanding of the \"unblock yourself on a difficult problem by solving a simpler version of it\" strategy that you possessed or unlocked at learn-time which allowed you to notice its effectiveness. Isn't the sentence more of an easily-retrievable mnemonic for a concept that's much more complicated (than just the information transferred by language) and requires a particular background to recognize how useful it is? reply nickpsecurity 27 minutes agorootparentprevThey’re called heuristics in problem-solving literature. Both heuristics and meta-heuristics have been used in planning software. Heuristics from one system are sometimes reused in another system. So, you can memorized generic, problem-solving strategies. I don’t know how much human brains do in that area vs non-memorization approaches. Ive read about how practicing rational, problem solving in specific domains to bake those heuristics into one’s intuition for faster responses. Most of us have done that, too. Any type of intuitive, problem solving probably involves memorization for that reason. reply Retric 24 minutes agoparentprevThere’s a point where understanding implies remembering somethings. If you see the symbol 8 there’s no way to understand it without memorizing something. However, your example assumes someone doesn’t understand multiplication. It’s very possible to get through calculus without having memorized the multiplication tables. People really do go through calculus using a calculator or going 8 * 7 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 7 = 2 * 2 * 14 = 2 * 28 = 56. reply jltsiren 54 minutes agoparentprevI'd say memorization and building expertise are orthogonal. Expertise is lossy intuitive reasoning. It's pattern recognition based on practice and experience. Then there is logical reasoning based on memorized facts, which is a fallback mechanism people use when they don't have the necessary skills. It usually fails, because it's inefficient, it doesn't scale, and it doesn't generalize. Sometimes memorization is necessary, but it's often not the actual point. When kids are asked to memorize the multiplication table, they are not really supposed to memorize it. They are supposed to build a mental model for multiplying numbers without resorting to first principles or memorized answers. Then if your model can calculate 7 * 8, you can also use it to calculate 7e10 * 8e11, even if you haven't memorized that specific fact. reply brigadier132 41 minutes agorootparent> It's pattern recognition based on practice and experience This is arguably another form of memorization. Magnus Carlson is the best Chess player in the world because he memorizes everything without effort. reply bitshiftfaced 1 hour agoparentprevNah, there's such a thing as creative thinking, idea generation, and connecting existing ideas in new ways. I wouldn't mind a coder that has to look at stack overflow a lot but is able to figure out a new method to do something better. reply frogeyedpeas 1 hour agorootparentYou absolutely would never hire a coder that needs to google \"how to access an array by index\" every-time they need to access an index of an array. You can say a politically correct answer like \"i don't care how they do it, as long as they get it done\" but such a coder will DEFINITELY take months to finish what might take someone else hours. Such a coder might still be able to suggest new methods to do something better and if there job description was \"organizational optimizer\" perhaps thats fine but as soon as you also expect software output out of this person you will quickly realize that you take for granted how valuable someone that has fully memorized a bunch of fundamentals up to and including some problem strategies truly is. reply youerbt 1 hour agorootparentThat makes no sense to me. If this coder has to access array by index twenty times a day, then he is going to remember it, eventually, no? If is it rare that he has to do it, then why memorize it? You really think there is more value in remembering how to do something in some arbitrary, shitty, programming language than understanding the concept of doing it? With understanding the idea you can do it in any language, at any time, it is just a few seconds away. reply mrmetanoia 1 hour agorootparentIt makes no sense because it indeed makes no sense. People who successfully solve realworld problems understand concepts and ideas and how to apply them, they understand how to iterate and extrapolate. I've met too many people who can do a specific thing but actually have no idea what's going on for the GP's logic to hold any water at all. reply paulpauper 1 hour agorootparentprevagree. how else do famous unsolved math problems eventually get solved? reply brigadier132 39 minutes agorootparentSearch. reply wizzwizz4 7 minutes agoparentprev> If you have to stackoverflow every single line of code that you are attempting to write all the way down to each individual print statement and array access Then you may be a perfectly adequate programmer. This, what, doubles the length of time it takes to type out the program? Triples? Typing out the program is not what takes the time! I've just spent a couple of days writing a plugin in a language I don't know. (The system documentation spends two paragraphs explaining how hard it is to solve the problem I solved.)

I guess that's why we don't seem to hire chess players as generals or... really, anything else. Being good at chess — whilst it clearly necessitates a certain level of intelligence — is basically just being good at chess. The cultural image of the great chess player being a deep thinker doesn't seem to line up with the evidence. I find it particularly interesting that, with very rare exception, none of the world's best chess players seem to go on to contribute anything intellectual other than their chess games. reply JustinSkycak 29 minutes agoparentTo be clear, this is not just chess. To quote the paper: \"[these] results have been replicated in a variety of educationally relevant fields, including mathematics (Sweller & Cooper, 1985).\" Now, I would agree that I wouldn't want to hire a mathematician as a general (on the basis of their being a mathematician), for the same reason that you wouldn't want to hire a chess player as a general (on the basis of their being a chess player). I just want to emphasize that this applies to math too. reply bee_rider 59 minutes agoparentprevIt is actually pretty remarkable, you’d think given the automatic reputation advantage that a chess grandmaster gets as a serious deep thinker, at least one would have managed to work that into a political career. reply techostritch 53 minutes agoparentprevKasparov seems to be a respected public intellectual or at least it’s debatable which is more than you can say for most others (though maybe that’s the exception that proves the rule). reply yazzku 1 hour agoparentprevAnd I suppose this is supported by current evidence too, where grandmasters have been beaten by computers, which hold more long-term memory, have memorized more moves, and can enumerate the state tree more deeply.

When I introduce a new topic I always start with worked examples, and I find that students are able to learn much more effectively when they have a reference. Poor pedagogy is also one of my biggest gripes with my undergraduate math program too, where the professors and textbooks often included too few worked problems and proofs, and the ones they did include were not very useful. What I found especially frustrating was when a worked example solved a special case with a unique approach, and the general case required a much more involved method that wasn't explained particularly well. Differential equations seems to be a particularly bad offender here, since I've had the same issue with the examples in many texts. reply JustinSkycak 1 hour agoparent> What I found especially frustrating was when a worked example solved a special case with a unique approach, and the general case required a much more involved method that wasn't explained particularly well. Amusingly, many people think the solution to this is \"abandon worked examples and focus exclusively on trying to teach general problem-solving skills,\" which doesn't really work in practice (or even in theory). That seems to be the most common approach in higher math, especially once you get into serious math-major courses like Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra. What actually works in practice is simply creating more worked examples, organizing them well, and giving students practice with problems like each worked example before moving them onto the next worked example covering a slightly more challenging case. You can get really, really far with this approach, but most educational resources shy away from it or give up really early because it's so much damn work! ;) reply cschmidt 2 hours agoprevThe \"worked example effect\" they talk about it interesting. The idea that you learn best from worked examples lines up with my experience. However, it seems like higher math abandons this completely. So many math textbooks are just in \"theorem, proof\" form, with almost no examples or even motivation. reply JustinSkycak 1 hour agoparentThis is one reason why so many people struggle with higher math. Textbooks & classes are typically not aligned (and often, are in direct opposition) to decades of research into the cognitive science of learning. Not saying that higher math would be \"easy\" if taught properly. Just that many more people would be able to learn it, than are currently able to learn it. Higher math is heavily g-loaded, which creates a cognitive barrier for many students. The goal of guided/scaffolded instruction is to help boost students over that barrier. Of course, the amount of work it takes to create a textbook explodes with the level of guidance/scaffolding, so in practice there's a limit to the amount of boosting that is feasible, especially if the textbook is written entirely by a single author... but most textbooks don't even come close to the theoretical limit for a single author, much less the theoretical limit for a team of content writers. reply jrm4 26 minutes agoprevThe older I get the more I believe (realize) the issue with math really is 100% skin-in-the-game. When they're young, I suppose you can force memorization on them, but very quickly: If an individual has no immediate percieved use for the math, they're not going to want or need to learn it. Simple as that. This really hit me as someone who did the overachievey college math.

They have to work out a solution either by trial & error (most common) or from first principles (very rare). Either way takes longer than letting an expert look at it and pull a solution seemingly out of thin air, when the reality is it's the decade or decades of experience looking at similar problems that they draw from. reply motohagiography 42 minutes agoprevthere is a constant tension in any field between fox/hedgehog, breadth-first/depth-first competence where in their own contexts they are absolutely correct about the supriority of their approaches, but quite wrong outside of it. we could frame these in a general category of Endian conflicts, where depth-firsts think the breadth-firsts are handwavey bullshitters, and breadth-firsts have a finite amount of patience for depth-first's concrete thinking and denial of abstractions.

Learn math for real, it's admirable and useful, and maybe someone will hire you to turn their handwavings into something someone wants. reply mlyle 36 minutes agoparentYes, but since an effort to educate students in math is universal, it's worth thinking about the different outcomes we want: A. To create top flight mathematicians who can push the frontiers of the field forward. Arguably not a whole lot of what we do in K-12 and the first couple of years of college isn't really aimed at this for the most part, since there is such a strong applied math push and the proofs stuff we teach in K-12 is broken. B. To create people competent enough in math to be engineers and scientists. Most math systems are pretty squarely aimed at this. C. To create people competent enough to live a life which tangentially touches mathematics (even if they are in a field like most of finance or accounting or whatever, the amount of mathematics they will do is limited). Here, I think we go pretty far off: getting a person just barely through Algebra 2 or trig doesn't serve them well; you'd be better off teaching them first and foremost not to be scared of mathematical reasoning, about general problem solving (\"look, you can just hold up the shape and rotate it!\" \"we can figure out the length of the board with a compass!\"), and strengthening their general arithmetic and lower math skills. I think we need to diversify out from path \"B\" to do both \"A\" and \"C\" better. reply orthopodvt 2 hours agoprevSo there is such a thing as \"knowledge\".

Search for that. reply Silamoth 2 hours agoprevI feel this article's argument is weak, largely for one key reason: They don't clearly define anything. Their references might clarify some things, but not all. They argue against \"general problem-solving strategies\" with a reference to Polya, but they don't provide a clear definition of what these strategies entail. How broad is the set of strategies they're arguing against? What are some examples of such strategies? I'd like something beyond two sentences on Polya. Furthermore, what audience and level of mathematics education are we discussing? The goals (and hence appropriate metrics of success) are certainly different for high schoolers targeting non-STEM careers vs. engineering undergrads vs. math grad students. The authors reference \"aspiring mathematicians\" and \"domain specific mathematical problem-solving skills\", indicating they're arguing about education for math majors, or at least students in STEM fields. In that case, the argument is somewhat meaningless - who's arguing math majors shouldn't learn math-specific skills? But, as I understand it, the argument for general problem-solving skills is that students outside of math don't actually need many specific math skills. Instead, math is a vessel for teaching logic, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. Then again, this might not be the type of problem-solving the authors are referencing - as I said above, it's not very clear. On a similar note, they cite evidence that studying worked examples is more effective than \"general problem-solving strategies\", citing an \"improvement in subsequent problem-solving performance\" without explaining how this performance is measured. If students are tested on specific problem types, of course they'll perform better when taught strategies for those specific problem types. But it's not clear that this is meaningful. For STEM majors, sure, solving specific problems is a skill worth cultivating. But for most students, solving specific problems isn't as important as learning logic, reasoning, and general problem-solving skills. In my anecdotal experience tutoring math, students tend to just memorize strategies for specific problem types instead of learning transferable logic and reasoning skills because that's what's tested. I'd be curious to see which method of learning facilitates better performance on a more general problem-solving test of some sort. Now, I'm not an education researcher or an educator of any sort. But I am passionate about good STEM education, especially in math. I genuinely feel that math education fails most students, at least here in America. If I'm being generous, this article is a well-intentioned but poorly-executed argument for effective math education strategies. If I'm not being so generous, this article advocates for the status quo in math education that forces students to slog through years of math classes for little discernible benefit. Either way, it's a disappointing article with a poorly-explained thesis. reply zeroimpl 2 minutes agoparent> Furthermore, what audience and level of mathematics education are we discussing? I wonder this too, I think they might mean university-level as well. For younger audiences, I feel one of the biggest problems for most people to understand math is they don't understand why any of it is relevant. If educators can make it seem more like teaching general problem solving abilities, that will likely improve the overall acceptance and lead to better overall math skills as a result. As a specific example, our high-school math curriculum taught a lot of calculus, but framed it incorrectly as being a useful tool that people would use. Eg as if a business man would write down an equation for their revenue based on inputs, and then take the derivative to compute the maximum. I'm assuming they told students this to try and get them motivated, but it clearly was a lie since everybody knows you could just plot a graph and look at it to find the maximum. If they instead were honest that the point of learning calculus was to help with understanding more advanced concepts in math/engineering/science, while also being a valuable learning tool for general problem solving, I think that would have been a better result. reply kragen 1 hour agopreva different way to look at this is that, when we find a way to generalize a problem-solving skill, we call it math if you can throw a spear and hit the mammoth, that's a problem-solving skill. but when we learned a technique that can calculate the trajectory of the spear, the effect of the timing of jupiter's rising and setting on mars's, and the penetration depth of a baseball into the water, that's math reply Icy0 2 hours agoprev> There is no body of research based on randomized, controlled experiments indicating that such teaching leads to better problem solving.

By “come across”, I mean I’ve read so much that it makes my eyes bleed. There is some good research that yields interesting and compelling results. Rare, but out there. Usually by an individual researcher and maybe with a team. Almost never by a school of education of significant size or by (almost?) any specific field in education. Results in education are challenging to replicate by a different researcher in a slightly different context, and studies are often trivially easy to replicate and come out with a competing/contrary conclusion by controlling a variable that the original researcher mentioned but did not control for (e.g., motivated subjects versus unmotivated subjects). Additionally, much research in education is not well-designed, or is well-designed but on a relatively meaningless topic. There is a lot of touchy-feely research out there (like the idea that folks can learn math with just problem solving skills), and folks p-hack the hell out of data to support their a priori conclusions. It’s a smart thing to do to maximize funding and/or visibility in academic journals, but it is absolutely irresponsible in the quest for “truth” and knowledge, which one would hope our education researchers would want (n.b.,they largely don’t). reply Icy0 2 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to have linked a collection of general research on teaching and learning, which I am aware of exists.

That's an interesting point. Ideally students would have both. My impression is that the latter is far less trainable, and the best you can do is go through enough worked examples, spread out so that every problem in the space of expected learning is within a reasonably small distance to some worked example. I.e., you can increase the number of balls (worked examples with problem-solving experiences) in a student's epsilon-cover (knowledge base), but you can't really increase epsilon itself (the student's generalization ability). But if you know of any research contradicting that, I'd love to hear about it. > Lack of adequate theoretical underpinnings. If you have time, would you mind elaborating a bit more on this?

I don't know what good theoretical underpinnings for human learning looks like (I'm not a time traveler), but to make an analogy imagine chemistry before the discovery of the periodic table, specifically how off-the-mark both sides of arguments in chemistry must have been back then. > My impression is that general problem-solving training falls into the category of lack of adequate theoretical underpinnings, but I doubt that's what you mean to refer to with this point. By the way, I see problem solving as a goal, not as a theory. If your study measures mathematical knowledge without problem solving, your tests will look like standardized tests given to high school students in the USA.

Overrated isn’t exactly the word I want, but there’s definitely something weird going on. 98% (I’m being generous) of people can no longer work almost math past early algebra and maybe a handful of finance-related plug-in-the-numbers formulas by age 35 because, assuming they ever learned any, they have never used it, so it’s gone by then. And that state of things seems to be entirely Ok. Like, if they needed it, they’d have used it and the many of them who could once at least kinda work with calculus, or what have you, wouldn’t have lost that skill. Meanwhile, I’ve not found the “it teaches problem solving skills, that’s why it’s important even if you never use 80% of it outside of school” thing to really hold. Maybe for the kinds of courses math majors take in college, I dunno, but not for the rest. If it does teach any, they don’t seem to generalize well for almost all people who learn them, and the rest, I think that’s more about who they are than that they took some math courses. Ultimately, it’s not clear to me that if we taught quite a bit less math to most kids and even college students, anything bad would happen. I think there are probably ways to approach math in primary and secondary school, and maybe also math courses for undergrads who have a small load of math courses anyway, that would temper its evident uselessness quite a bit—namely, a laser-focus on applications past the very earliest grades—but most math majors seem to want math education to go exactly the opposite way. Maybe they’re right and I’m wrong, I dunno. reply WalterBright 1 hour agorootparentI used calculus a lot in my mechanical engineering job. As a programmer, not. But as a programmer, I use a different kind of math (such as 2s complement arithmetic, boolean logic, floating point math, vectors, graph math, etc.) all the time. Knowing math has blocked many attempts by salesmen, contractors, bankers, etc., from ripping me off. If I didn't know math, I never would have even realized that my tailfeathers had been plucked. As for \"anything bad would happen\", bad things probably happened to you that you were not aware of. An anecdote: years ago, it used to be popular to run 30 minute seminars on TV called (my version) \"Get Rich In Real Estate Using Scams\". I recall one that bragged about making a quick $10,000. I figured it was a con, and so watched the show carefully, noting each transaction. And yes, it did net a $10,000 score for the person. But how it worked was through a confusing combination of transactions meant to obfuscate what was actually happening. The key in it was getting your mark to accept a bond that would be worth $XXXX in the future while you got the $XXXX today. In essence, it was exploiting the mark's failure to understand the concept of current value vs future value. The beauty (if you could call it that) was there was nothing illegal about this. With my math knowledge, it stunk from the outset, even though it took me a while to find the dead rat. Just like with my knowledge of physics, when it was posted on HN that electric cars were 90% efficient, that set me off immediately, and sure enough, there was a rat corpse in it.

    "originBody": "BEN HOYT Home Resume/CV Projects Tech Writing Non-Tech Email How to implement a hash table (in C) March 2021 Summary: An explanation of how to implement a simple hash table data structure using the C programming language. I briefly demonstrate linear and binary search, and then design and implement a hash table. My goal is to show that hash table internals are not scary, but – within certain constraints – are easy enough to build from scratch. Go to: Linear searchBinary searchHash tablesImplementationDiscussion Recently I wrote an article that compared a simple program that counts word frequencies across various languages, and one of the things that came up was how C doesn’t have a hash table data structure in its standard library. There are many things you can do when you realize this: use linear search, use binary search, grab someone else’s hash table implementation, or write your own hash table. Or switch to a richer language. We’re going to take a quick look at linear and binary search, and then learn how to write our own hash table. This is often necessary in C, but it can also be useful if you need a custom hash table when using another language. Linear search The simplest option is to use linear search to scan through an array. This is actually not a bad strategy if you’ve only got a few items – in my simple comparison using strings, it’s faster than a hash table lookup up to about 7 items (but unless your program is very performance-sensitive, it’s probably fine up to 20 or 30 items). Linear search also allows you to append new items to the end of the array. With this type of search you’re comparing an average of num_keys/2 items. Let’s say you’re searching for the key bob in the following array (each item is a string key with an associated integer value): Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Key foo bar bazz buzz bob jane x Value 10 42 36 7 11 100 200 You simply start at the beginning (foo at index 0) and compare each key. If the key matches what you’re looking for, you’re done. If not, you move to the next slot. Searching for bob takes five steps (indexes 0 through 4). Here is the algorithm in C (assuming each array item is a string key and integer value): typedef struct { char* key; int value; } item; item* linear_search(item* items, size_t size, const char* key) { for (size_t i=0; ivalue); return 0; } Binary search Another simple approach is to put the items in an array which is sorted by key, and use binary search to reduce the number of comparisons. This is kind of how we might look something up in a (paper) dictionary. C even has a bsearch function in its standard library. Binary search is reasonably fast even for hundreds of items (though not as fast as a hash table), because you’re only comparing an average of log(num_keys) items. However, because the array needs to stay sorted, you can’t insert items without copying the rest down, so insertions still require an average of num_keys/2 operations. Assume we’re looking up bob again (in this pre-sorted array): Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Key bar bazz bob buzz foo jane x Value 42 36 11 7 10 100 200 With binary search, we start in the middle (buzz), and if the key there is greater than what we’re looking for, we repeat the process with the lower half. If it’s greater, we repeat the process with the higher half. In this case it results in three steps, at indexes 3, 1, 2, and then we have it. This is 3 steps instead of 5, and the improvement over linear search gets (exponentially) better the more items you have. Here’s how you’d do it in C (with and without bsearch). The definition of the item struct is the same as above. int cmp(const void* a, const void* b) { item* item_a = (item*)a; item* item_b = (item*)b; return strcmp(item_a->key, item_b->key); } item* binary_search(item* items, size_t size, const char* key) { if (size + size value); found = binary_search(items, num_items, \"bob\"); if (found == NULL) { return 1; } printf(\"binary_search: value of 'bob' is %d\", found->value); return 0; } Note: in binary_search, it would be slightly better to avoid the up-front “half size overflow check” and allow the entire range of size_t. This would mean changing the mid calculation to low + (high-low)/2. However, I’m going to leave the code stand for educational purposes – with the initial overflow check, I don’t think there’s a bug, but it is non-ideal that I’m only allowing half the range of size_t. Not that I’ll be searching a 16 exabyte array on my 64-bit system anytime soon! For further reading, see the article Nearly All Binary Searches and Mergesorts are Broken. Thanks Seth Arnold and Olaf Seibert for the feedback. Hash tables Hash tables can seem quite scary: there are a lot of different types, and a ton of different optimizations you can do. However, if you use a simple hash function together with what’s called “linear probing” you can create a decent hash table quite easily. If you don’t know how a hash table works, here’s a quick refresher. A hash table is a container data structure that allows you to quickly look up a key (often a string) to find its corresponding value (any data type). Under the hood, they’re arrays that are indexed by a hash function of the key. A hash function turns a key into a random-looking number, and it must always return the same number given the same key. For example, with the hash function we’re going to use (64-bit FNV-1a), the hashes of the keys above are as follows: Key Hash Hash modulo 16 bar 16101355973854746 10 bazz 11123581685902069096 8 bob 21748447695211092 4 buzz 18414333339470238796 12 foo 15902901984413996407 7 jane 10985288698319103569 1 x 12638214688346347271 7 (same as foo) The reason I’ve shown the hash modulo 16 is because we’re going to start with an array of 16 elements, so we need to limit the hash to the number of elements in the array – the modulo operation divides by 16 and gives the remainder, limiting the array index to the range 0 through 15. When we insert a value into the hash table, we calculate its hash, modulo by 16, and use that as the array index. So with an array of size 16, we’d insert bar at index 10, bazz at 8, bob at 4, and so on. Let’s insert all the items into our hash table array (except for x – we’ll get to that below): Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Key . jane . . bob . . foo bazz . bar . buzz . . . Value . 100 . . 11 . . 10 36 . 42 . 7 . . . To look up a value, we simply fetch array[hash(key) % 16]. If the array size is a power of two, we can use array[hash(key) & 15]. Note how the order of the elements is no longer meaningful. But what if two keys hash to the same value (after the modulo 16)? Depending on the hash function and the size of the array, this is fairly common. For example, when we try to add x to the array above, its hash modulo 16 is 7. But we already have foo at index 7, so we get a collision. There are various ways of handling collisions. Traditionally you’d create a hash array of a certain size, and if there was a collision, you’d use a linked list to store the values that hashed to the same index. However, linked lists normally require an extra memory allocation when you add an item, and traversing them means following pointers scattered around in memory, which is relatively slow on modern CPUs. A simpler and faster way of dealing with collisions is linear probing: if we’re trying to insert an item but there’s one already there, simply move to the next slot. If the next slot is full too, move along again, until you find an empty one, wrapping around to the beginning if you hit the end of the array. (There are other ways of probing than just moving to the next slot, but that’s beyond the scope of this article.) This technique is a lot faster than linked lists, because your CPU’s cache has probably fetched the next items already. Here’s what the hash table array looks like after adding “collision” x (with value 200). We try index 7 first, but that’s holding foo, so we move to index 8, but that’s holding bazz, so we move again to index 9, and that’s empty, so we insert it there: Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Key . jane . . bob . . foo bazz x bar . buzz . . . Value . 100 . . 11 . . 10 36 200 42 . 7 . . . When the hash table gets too full, we need to allocate a larger array and move the items over. This is absolutely required when the number of items in the hash table has reached the size of the array, but usually you want to do it when the table is half or three-quarters full. If you don’t resize it early enough, collisions will become more and more common, and lookups and inserts will get slower and slower. If you wait till it’s almost full, you’re essentially back to linear search. With a good hash function, this kind of hash table requires an average of one operation per lookup, plus the time to hash the key (but often the keys are relatively short string). And that’s it! There’s a huge amount more you can do here, and this just scratches the surface. I’m not going to go into a scientific analysis of big O notation, optimal array sizes, different kinds of probing, and so on. Read Donald Knuth’s TAOCP if you want that level of detail! Hash table implementation You can find the code for this implementation in the benhoyt/ht repo on GitHub, in ht.h and ht.c. For what it’s worth, all the code is released under a permissive MIT license. I got some good feedback from Code Review Stack Exchange that helped clean up a few sharp edges, not the least of which was a memory leak due to how I was calling strdup during the ht_expand step (fixed here). I confirmed the leak using Valgrind, which I should have run earlier. Seth Arnold also gave me some helpful feedback on a draft of this article. Thanks, folks! API design First let’s consider what API we want: we need a way to create and destroy a hash table, get the value for a given key, set a value for a given key, get the number of items, and iterate over the items. I’m not aiming for a maximum-efficiency API, but one that is fairly simple to implement. After a couple of iterations, I settled on the following functions and structs (see ht.h): // Hash table structure: create with ht_create, free with ht_destroy. typedef struct ht ht; // Create hash table and return pointer to it, or NULL if out of memory. ht* ht_create(void); // Free memory allocated for hash table, including allocated keys. void ht_destroy(ht* table); // Get item with given key (NUL-terminated) from hash table. Return // value (which was set with ht_set), or NULL if key not found. void* ht_get(ht* table, const char* key); // Set item with given key (NUL-terminated) to value (which must not // be NULL). If not already present in table, key is copied to newly // allocated memory (keys are freed automatically when ht_destroy is // called). Return address of copied key, or NULL if out of memory. const char* ht_set(ht* table, const char* key, void* value); // Return number of items in hash table. size_t ht_length(ht* table); // Hash table iterator: create with ht_iterator, iterate with ht_next. typedef struct { const char* key; // current key void* value; // current value // Don't use these fields directly. ht* _table; // reference to hash table being iterated size_t _index; // current index into ht._entries } hti; // Return new hash table iterator (for use with ht_next). hti ht_iterator(ht* table); // Move iterator to next item in hash table, update iterator's key // and value to current item, and return true. If there are no more // items, return false. Don't call ht_set during iteration. bool ht_next(hti* it); A few notes about this API design: For simplicity, we use C-style NUL-terminated strings. I know there are more efficient approaches to string handling, but this fits with C’s standard library. The ht_set function allocates and copies the key (if inserting for the first time). Usually you don’t want the caller to have to worry about this, or ensuring the key memory stays around. Note that ht_set returns a pointer to the duplicated key. This is mainly used as an “out of memory” error signal – it returns NULL on failure. However, ht_set does not copy the value. It’s up to the caller to ensure that the value pointer is valid for the lifetime of the hash table. Values can’t be NULL. This makes the signature of ht_get slightly simpler, as you don’t have to distinguish between a NULL value and one that hasn’t been set at all. The ht_length function isn’t strictly necessary, as you can find the length by iterating the table. However, that’s a bit of a pain (and slow), so it’s useful to have ht_length. There are various ways I could have done iteration. Using an explicit iterator type with a while loop seems simple and natural in C (see the example below). The value returned from ht_iterator is a value, not a pointer, both for efficiency and so the caller doesn’t have to free anything. There’s no ht_remove to remove an item from the hash table. Removal is the one thing that’s trickier with linear probing (due to the “holes” that are left), but I don’t often need to remove items when using hash tables, so I’ve left that out as an exercise for the reader. Demo program Below is a simple program (demo.c) that demonstrates using all the functions of the API. It counts the frequencies of unique, space-separated words from standard input, and prints the results (in an arbitrary order, because the iteration order of our hash table is undefined). It ends by printing the total number of unique words. // Example: // $ echo 'foo bar the bar bar bar the'./demo // foo 1 // bar 4 // the 2 // 3 void exit_nomem(void) { fprintf(stderr, \"out of memory\"); exit(1); } int main(void) { ht* counts = ht_create(); if (counts == NULL) { exit_nomem(); } // Read next word from stdin (at most 100 chars long). char word[101]; while (scanf(\"%100s\", word) != EOF) { // Look up word. void* value = ht_get(counts, word); if (value != NULL) { // Already exists, increment int that value points to. int* pcount = (int*)value; (*pcount)++; continue; } // Word not found, allocate space for new int and set to 1. int* pcount = malloc(sizeof(int)); if (pcount == NULL) { exit_nomem(); } *pcount = 1; if (ht_set(counts, word, pcount) == NULL) { exit_nomem(); } } // Print out words and frequencies, freeing values as we go. hti it = ht_iterator(counts); while (ht_next(&it)) { printf(\"%s %d\", it.key, *(int*)it.value); free(it.value); } // Show the number of unique words. printf(\"%d\", (int)ht_length(counts)); ht_destroy(counts); return 0; } Now let’s turn to the hash table implementation (ht.c). Create and destroy Allocating a new hash table is fairly straight-forward. We start with an initial array capacity of 16 (stored in capacity), meaning it can hold up to 8 items before expanding. There are two allocations, one for the hash table struct itself, and one for the entries array. Note that we use calloc for the entries array, to ensure all the keys are NULL to start with, meaning all slots are empty. The ht_destroy function frees this memory, but also frees memory from the duplicated keys that were allocated along the way (more on that below). // Hash table entry (slot may be filled or empty). typedef struct { const char* key; // key is NULL if this slot is empty void* value; } ht_entry; // Hash table structure: create with ht_create, free with ht_destroy. struct ht { ht_entry* entries; // hash slots size_t capacity; // size of _entries array size_t length; // number of items in hash table }; #define INITIAL_CAPACITY 16 // must not be zero ht* ht_create(void) { // Allocate space for hash table struct. ht* table = malloc(sizeof(ht)); if (table == NULL) { return NULL; } table->length = 0; table->capacity = INITIAL_CAPACITY; // Allocate (zero'd) space for entry buckets. table->entries = calloc(table->capacity, sizeof(ht_entry)); if (table->entries == NULL) { free(table); // error, free table before we return! return NULL; } return table; } void ht_destroy(ht* table) { // First free allocated keys. for (size_t i = 0; i capacity; i++) { free((void*)table->entries[i].key); } // Then free entries array and table itself. free(table->entries); free(table); } Hash function Next we define our hash function, which is a straight-forward C implementation of the FNV-1a hash algorithm. Note that FNV is not a randomized or cryptographic hash function, so it’s possible for an attacker to create keys with a lot of collisions and cause lookups to slow way down – Python switched away from FNV for this reason. For our use case, however, FNV is simple and fast. As far as the algorithm goes, FNV-1a simply starts the hash with an “offset” constant, and for each byte in the string, XORs the hash with the byte, and then multiplies it by a big prime number. The offset and prime are carefully chosen by people with PhDs. We’re using the 64-bit variant, because, well, most computers are 64-bit these days and it seemed like a good idea. You can tell I don’t have one of those PhDs. :-) Seriously, though, it seemed better than using the 32-bit version in case we have a very large hash table. #define FNV_OFFSET 14695981039346656037UL #define FNV_PRIME 1099511628211UL // Return 64-bit FNV-1a hash for key (NUL-terminated). See description: // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler–Noll–Vo_hash_function static uint64_t hash_key(const char* key) { uint64_t hash = FNV_OFFSET; for (const char* p = key; *p; p++) { hash ^= (uint64_t)(unsigned char)(*p); hash *= FNV_PRIME; } return hash; } I won’t be doing a detailed analysis here, but I have included a little statistics program that prints the average probe length of the hash table created from the unique words in the input. The FNV-1a hash algorithm we’re using seems to work well on the list of half a million English words (average probe length 1.40), and also works well with a list of half a million very similar keys like word1, word2, and so on (average probe length 1.38). Interestingly, when I tried the FNV-1 algorithm (like FNV-1a but with the multiply done before the XOR), the English words still gave an average probe length of 1.43, but the similar keys performed very badly – an average probe length of 5.02. So FNV-1a was a clear winner in my quick tests. Get Next let’s look at the ht_get function. First it calculates the hash, modulo the capacity (the size of the entries array), which is done by ANDing with capacity - 1. Using AND is only possible because, as we’ll see below, we’re ensuring our array size is always a power of two, for simplicity. Then we loop till we find an empty slot, in which case we didn’t find the key. For each non-empty slot, we use strcmp to check whether the key at this slot is the one we’re looking for (it’ll be the first one unless there had been a collision). If not, we move along one slot. void* ht_get(ht* table, const char* key) { // AND hash with capacity-1 to ensure it's within entries array. uint64_t hash = hash_key(key); size_t index = (size_t)(hash & (uint64_t)(table->capacity - 1)); // Loop till we find an empty entry. while (table->entries[index].key != NULL) { if (strcmp(key, table->entries[index].key) == 0) { // Found key, return value. return table->entries[index].value; } // Key wasn't in this slot, move to next (linear probing). index++; if (index >= table->capacity) { // At end of entries array, wrap around. index = 0; } } return NULL; } Set The ht_set function is slightly more complicated, because it has to expand the table if there are too many elements. In our implementation, we double the capacity whenever it gets to be half full. This is a little wasteful of memory, but it keeps things very simple. First, the ht_set function. It simply expands the table if necessary, and then inserts the item: const char* ht_set(ht* table, const char* key, void* value) { assert(value != NULL); if (value == NULL) { return NULL; } // If length will exceed half of current capacity, expand it. if (table->length >= table->capacity / 2) { if (!ht_expand(table)) { return NULL; } } // Set entry and update length. return ht_set_entry(table->entries, table->capacity, key, value, &table->length); } The guts of the operation is in the ht_set_entry helper function (note how the loop is very similar to the one in ht_get). If the plength argument is non-NULL, it’s being called from ht_set, so we allocate and copy the key and update the length: // Internal function to set an entry (without expanding table). static const char* ht_set_entry(ht_entry* entries, size_t capacity, const char* key, void* value, size_t* plength) { // AND hash with capacity-1 to ensure it's within entries array. uint64_t hash = hash_key(key); size_t index = (size_t)(hash & (uint64_t)(capacity - 1)); // Loop till we find an empty entry. while (entries[index].key != NULL) { if (strcmp(key, entries[index].key) == 0) { // Found key (it already exists), update value. entries[index].value = value; return entries[index].key; } // Key wasn't in this slot, move to next (linear probing). index++; if (index >= capacity) { // At end of entries array, wrap around. index = 0; } } // Didn't find key, allocate+copy if needed, then insert it. if (plength != NULL) { key = strdup(key); if (key == NULL) { return NULL; } (*plength)++; } entries[index].key = (char*)key; entries[index].value = value; return key; } What about the ht_expand helper function? It allocates a new entries array of double the current capacity, and uses ht_set_entry with plength NULL to copy the entries over. Even though the hash value is the same, the indexes will be different because the capacity has changed (and the index is hash modulo capacity). // Expand hash table to twice its current size. Return true on success, // false if out of memory. static bool ht_expand(ht* table) { // Allocate new entries array. size_t new_capacity = table->capacity * 2; if (new_capacity capacity) { return false; // overflow (capacity would be too big) } ht_entry* new_entries = calloc(new_capacity, sizeof(ht_entry)); if (new_entries == NULL) { return false; } // Iterate entries, move all non-empty ones to new table's entries. for (size_t i = 0; i capacity; i++) { ht_entry entry = table->entries[i]; if (entry.key != NULL) { ht_set_entry(new_entries, new_capacity, entry.key, entry.value, NULL); } } // Free old entries array and update this table's details. free(table->entries); table->entries = new_entries; table->capacity = new_capacity; return true; } Length and iteration The ht_length function is trivial – we update the number of items in _length as we go, so just return that: size_t ht_length(ht* table) { return table->length; } Iteration is the final piece. To create an iterator, a user will call ht_iterator, and to move to the next item, call ht_next in a loop while it returns true. Here’s how they’re defined: hti ht_iterator(ht* table) { hti it; it._table = table; it._index = 0; return it; } bool ht_next(hti* it) { // Loop till we've hit end of entries array. ht* table = it->_table; while (it->_index capacity) { size_t i = it->_index; it->_index++; if (table->entries[i].key != NULL) { // Found next non-empty item, update iterator key and value. ht_entry entry = table->entries[i]; it->key = entry.key; it->value = entry.value; return true; } } return false; } Discussion That’s it – the implementation in ht.c is only about 200 lines of code, including blank lines and comments. Beware: this is a teaching tool and not a library, so I encourage you to play with it and let me know about any bugs I haven’t found! I would advise against using it without a bunch of further testing, checking edge cases, etc. Remember, this is unsafe C we’re dealing with. Even while writing this I realized I’d used malloc instead of calloc to allocate the entries array, which meant the keys may not have been initialized to NULL. As I mentioned, I wanted to keep the implementation simple, and wasn’t too worried about performance. However, a quick, non-scientific performance comparison with Go’s map implementation shows that it compares pretty well – with half a million English words, this C version is about 50% slower for lookups and 40% faster for insertion. Speaking of Go, it’s even easier to write custom hash tables in a language like Go, because you don’t have to worry about handling memory allocation errors or freeing allocated memory. I recently wrote a counter package in Go which implements a similar kind of hash table. There’s obviously a lot more you could do with the C version. You could focus on safety and reliability by doing various kinds of testing. You could focus on performance, and reduce memory allocations, use a “bump allocator” for the duplicated keys, store short keys inside each item struct, and so on. You could improve the memory usage, and tune _ht_expand to not double in size every time. Or you could add features such as item removal. After I’d finished writing this, I remembered that Bob Nystrom’s excellent Crafting Interpreters book has a chapter on hash tables. He makes some similar design choices, though his chapter is significantly more in-depth than this article. If I’d remembered his chapter before I started, I probably wouldn’t have written this one! In any case, I hope you’ve found this useful or interesting. If you spot any bugs or have any feedback, please let me know. You can also go to the discussions on Hacker News, programming Reddit, and Lobsters. I’d love it if you sponsored me on GitHub – it will motivate me to work on my open source projects and write more good content. Thanks!",

It prevents you from having to hash a key twice just to do \"check if key is not present, then set value, otherwise leave original value in hash.\" The pattern also meshes better with the way iterators naturally work. Also, in terms of this table, if you add the computed key hash value to the stored hash entry, you can check that the value of the hashes match before you do the full strcmp. If you have a weak hash you might also get a benefit from checking that the first characters match before calling the full strcmp. It would also make rehashing easier since you already have the full key available to you and don't have to use your internal set function to move entries into the new table. In the posted implementation the big-O semantics of a rehash are worst case.

The exact same mechanism is available with hsearch. That's how resizing a hash table typically works, yes. Except it's normally done automatically and transparently by the hash table code. hsearch doesn't do that. And since it doesn't give you a way to iterate over values in the table, you'd have to keep a separate list of everything you add to it in order to manually delete the existing table and make a bigger one and re-add everything to it...

    "originBody": "Anxious Generation — How Safetyism and Social Media are damaging the kids July 6, 2024 I just finished reading this book the other day. Written by Jonathan Haidt, \"Anxious Generation\" deals with a concept he calls the \"Great Rewiring.\" Essentially, he proposes that two forces at play nowadays have led (and continue to lead) an entire generation to significantly higher rates of mental illnesses. One of these forces is unfettered access to social media. He draws a distinct line between the generic overuse of computers or the internet and the use of social media. The former began back in the 90s (or maybe even the 80s), but no dramatic increases in mental illness occurred back then. In those days, you'd be spending too much time in front of your screen, and the worst that could happen was you'd worsen your eyesight, end up somewhat socially inept, or even get a job in the industry once you grew up. He highlights that this was mostly observed among boys rather than girls, and the effects weren't as negative. Nowadays, this is no longer the case. It's actually girls who bear the brunt of the effect, and the impact is far from harmless. He convincingly connects the dots between the social validation loop masterfully (ab)used by all modern social media, the early age that social media starts being used (early teens), and the statistics that show the incidence of mental illnesses just as platforms like Instagram started their growth in the 2010s. The mind gets stuck in a loop where it continuously seeks validation and requires us to put up an almost perfect appearance for others. There's no way this is healthy for a young mind to go through. He even shows research indicating that school-aged kids might actually be taking a toll in cognitive performance due to this. A study done on kids taking exams shows there's an actual difference between taking the test without your phone in the room, with your phone in your pocket, and with your phone on the table right in front of you. You can guess which produces the best results and which produces the worst, as their minds are frankly always on standby, wondering what's going on in their social network. In addition to social media use, he also talks about the other big issue that leads to his Great Rewiring: helicopter parenting. The net effect of this is that kids have far more extended boundaries set on them (except on their phones!). For example, nowadays, parents expect their children to be free to go and do groceries alone or play outside without adult supervision only at around the age of 10 to 12 (if not even higher). Gen X, in his research, remembers this as having happened for them around ages 6, 7, or 8. On one hand, I feel like this claim rings true; on the other, I'm also wondering if there might be a case of some rosy retrospection or wishful thinking. Far from stopping there, he mentions other significant societal efforts that are thwarting children's growth, such as having playgrounds where kids don't exhibit any risk of harming themselves. Instead of preparing the kids and making them capable of (literally in this case) tackling obstacles, we're removing obstacles and coddling them. Kids also become overprotected in other ways, such as not hearing other views or not being able to handle opposing views. No wonder academia is nowadays the exact opposite of free speech and the scientific method. The trend of not keeping tabs on what kids are doing online (as opposed to offline, where the boundaries are much stricter) leads to what he deems a phone-based childhood. The kids are growing up playing with their phones rather than playing outside with other kids, learning the ropes of, well—life. He suggests solving these regressions by reverting some societal safetyisms. He comes up with what he calls a \"Ladder from Childhood to Adulthood\" and presents checkpoints of what type of behavior one ought to expect their child to exhibit. For example, at six, the child should have a certain level of household responsibility. At eight, they might not require adult supervision to play outside, and maybe they get a dumbphone to stay in touch. Within this framework, the use of social media should come only at age 16, unlike the current state where it's supposedly age 13+ but in reality, this is not enforced at all. Apart from these two major angles of the Great Rewiring, he also touches on the spiritual aspects (albeit he's an atheist), but that's not that important. He's somewhat activist about all of this, so he has a website dedicated to it all over here (not just a book commercial). All in all, it's a fairly interesting book, and I'll probably take a look at some of his other writings.",

With suburbia and car centric infrastructure expanding, where are they even supposed to play? reply TheBlight 3 hours agoparentI grew up in car-centric suburbia. I played outside everyday. Rode around on my bike with my friends. We'd play wall-ball, stick ball, street hockey. Hang out at the neighborhood pool. Make bike jumps out of stuff. Play in the park. The problem is not having the imagination to make something out of not much. And today suburbia has many more parks and resources. Eg. We never had a skatepark. We'd skate in parking lots or on shoddily homebuilt ramps. But now there are 3 in biking distance from me. reply nerdponx 2 hours agorootparentRight, stereotypical suburbia is actually pretty good for walking and biking around, hanging out at the park, etc. What's not so good is \"rural\" suburbia, where every road is either a stroad or a country through-road with no shoulder and 35+ MPH traffic. Equally bad is \"urban-ish\" suburbia where you have high density housing neighborhoods with few parks or other amenities, sliced up by stroads and through-roads. reply JKCalhoun 3 hours agoparentprev> Except, parents nowadays can get arrested for even less. I wonder how many parents read about that one example and then behave in a way that ignores the likely millions of cases every day of kids playing in their front yard alone where that didn't happen. reply GeekyBear 2 hours agorootparentThis happens much more often than is reasonable. > Debra Harrell, 46, let her 9-year-old daughter play outside alone at the park. The South Carolina child had a cellphone she could use to call her mother in case of emergency. On the girl’s third day alone at the park, someone asked her where her mother was. The girl said her mom was at work. (Harrell works at McDonald’s and didn’t want her daughter to have to sit inside the restaurant for hours on a beautiful summer day.) The result? Harrell was arrested for “unlawful conduct towards a child” and put in jail; her daughter is now in the custody of the department of social services. https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/07/debra-harrell-arres... The park in question was half a block from their home. reply jprete 3 hours agorootparentprevPart of the problem is the faster and wider communication of these kinds of incidents. I think people can intuitively understand, at lowest, 5%* odds. Anything below that is either 5% or impossible unless you're mathing it out. Hearing about these kinds of tail-case incidents at least once or twice a year is probably enough to bump them up to the 5% category. *I'm not committed to any specific number here. The relevant threshold is \"high enough to consider when making decisions\". reply youainti 3 hours agorootparentAn interesting resource is IDC 203, which describes how the US intelligence community discusses probability. The table in paragraph 2a says something similar to what you are saying: almost no chance / remote := 1%-5% very unlikely / highly improbable := 5%-20% etc... reply eastbound 2 hours agorootparentprevIt shouldn’t have happened at all. reply jprete 25 minutes agorootparentSure! I agree with you. But acting on that idea requires cultural and political change, which requires large-scale agreement strong enough to motivate people. And that in turn requires convincing them to stop paying so much attention to the other terrible tail events they see on the news, the ones that teach them that letting their kids out of their immediate supervision is a horribly dangerous thing to do. reply epicureanideal 3 hours agorootparentprevNo parent wants to take an avoidable, even 1 in a million chance of losing custody of their kids because of doing a reasonable thing that someone could take out of context or make trouble for them about. reply layer8 3 hours agorootparentNo parent wants to avoid the much higher risk of damaging their kids psychologically? reply A4ET8a8uTh0 3 hours agorootparentprevIt may really depend on the location. My neighborhood is nice ( with an occasional crazy person driving through either too fast or too loud ) and it does warm my crusty heart to see kids playing in the frontyards. I can absolutely understand that there are locations where that would not be sensible. reply janalsncm 3 hours agoparentprevLaws may be a factor but more likely infrastructure (i.e. lack of accessible third places) is much more important. reply anon291 3 hours agoparentprevStates need to adopt safe harbor clauses for parents. A particular part of a town / city being unsafe for kids should not be seen as the parents' problem, but an indictment of bad city planning, services, and management. EDIT: Also this story is insane. Who sees a neighbor kid playing in their yard and calls the police? I'm going to generalize here and speak about my fellow conservatives (because Florida is a solid red state at this point), but I've noticed many have little interest in actually living in a conservative way. In the 'olden days' people would just invite the kid in because -- you know -- you knew your neighbors and thought they were good people (or at least tolerable people). Nowadays, it seems everybody just ignores their neighbors and minds their own business. Not that it's only conservatives who do this (far from it; it seems systemic). Imagine calling the police on your neighbor's kid! EDIT 2: From the article: \"The authorities claim he had no access to water or shelter\". Again... can you imagine being a kid in your own neighborhood and not being fairly certain that, if you needed it, one of your neighbors would give you WATER? I know all the kids on my block and regularly invite them over to play with our kids if we're all outside, and have no compunction giving them water? For goodness' sake, the person phoning the police should have been arrested for not undertaking the most basic neighborly duties to a child. reply jwells89 3 hours agorootparentI’ve spoken about it in other threads, but I believe that a significant factor in the the weakening of neighborhood community is the need for people to move frequently (relative to the past) to have access to opportunity (whether it be education, employment, or something else). Each move means a total reset of social connections for the individual moving and a hole left behind in the community being moved out of. Eventually nobody in a neighborhood other than a handful of longtimers (likely retirees) knows each other and everybody is a stranger. I think it would do an immense amount of good if employers in particular made greater efforts to allow employees to stay where they are, whether that be through small satellite offices or remote work. reply HPsquared 3 hours agorootparentRemote work has the potential to solve so many societal ills. reply cogman10 2 hours agorootparentprevDo we actually know the circumstances here? I have family that work in CPS (in Utah) and it takes A LOT before kids will be removed and placed in foster care. Even then, the end goal of the foster service is to reunite the kids with their families. Right now, we just have an anonymous claim with a pinky promise from the author that this is real. I'm thinking of the recent Ruby Franke incident. Were Ruby to describe the situation she might say her kids were outside for their health. However, dig in just a little and you find that she was severely abusing them for drinking water to try and force out the devil. reply gosub100 3 hours agorootparentprev> I'm going to generalize here and speak about my fellow conservatives That's not generalizing because you don't know which category the person is from. What you did was fabricate a scapegoat using your imagination. There are plenty of valid reasons to let the police handle a legal dispute involving a child. reply random9749832 3 hours agoprev>Kids also become overprotected in other ways, such as not hearing other views or not being able to handle opposing views. No wonder academia is nowadays the exact opposite of free speech and the scientific method. I wonder how much the scientific method went into coming to that conclusion. Also if anything we are way too exposed to other people's views. Before you could speak to someone random and there was a much higher chance that their opinions were unique because they weren't the next person who binges on r/all. We had many more forums and less recommendation algorithms driving what we consume. Now you overhear people talking about something you just saw the other day online in public all the time.

You might have similar differences between states within the US. reply johnchristopher 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I admit my comment was as shallow ^^. reply twelfthnight 3 hours agoparentprevAgreed that the argument \"overprotection leads to lack of free speech in academia\" is tenuous. That said, I do wonder if we all _are_ being protected from opposing views these days. Like, we come across the opposing views but usually in a filtered / characature form on Social Media/Fox News/MSNBC. It's actually kinda hard to find stuff without spin in my experience. EDIT My hypothesis is that's it's just cheaper to create speculative / opinion based journalism rather than real investigation. Since the former gets enough clicks, there's not a strong financial reason to create good journalism. reply HPsquared 3 hours agorootparentIt's always been hard to find things without spin. The only difference now is the range of different spin styles available. Every niche worldview has an online community. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agorootparentAnd then we've come half-cycle into the exact opposite fact from the one on the post that created this thread. All it too was 3 comments. I wonder what is really happening, because both statements sound true to me. reply inglor_cz 3 hours agoparentprevAmong liberal faculty 35 and under, only 23% indicated that shouting down a speaker is never acceptable, 43% said the same for blocking entry, and 64% for using violence to stop a campus speech. https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-wh... Look at Figure 3, which covers all faculty (liberal and conservative). The shift towards illiberalism and less tolerance towards speech is absolutely visible in generational cohorts, and the under-35 cohort is the most supportive of illiberal measures. Students are even more supportive of illiberal measures than young faculty. reply drewrv 2 hours agorootparentThis data does not indicate a “shift”, since it’s a point in time and we’d need historical data to claim there’s a shift. If the argument is about a “generational shift” then you’d need data going back decades at least. reply KittenInABox 3 hours agorootparentprevAre we assuming that older academics are more tolerant to being shouted down because older academia tolerated shouting more? It may just be that younger academics have always been less ok with dramatics on campus. We need to compare this to the same survey done generations ago. reply nsvd 1 hour agorootparentI think you may have read the parent's statistics backwards. Their point (correct or incorrect) was that younger academics are more accepting of the suppression of speech. reply anon291 3 hours agoprevThe point about the parks rings so true to me. We have a playground near us that was built in the 50s-ish and the slide is probably 12-15ft high, with just a ladder. The swings are about the same height and you can swing pretty high. Honestly, even as an adult it's a bit thrilling to go down the slide. You can imagine what it must be for kids. Meanwhile, the brand new park near my parents: the slides top out at like 6 feet. The swings are made so they don't swing high. There's absolutely zero risk of falling. No monkey bars, etc. Very sad reply supportengineer 3 hours agoparentI remember an article posted here years ago, there is an optimal amount of danger for playgrounds. reply Workaccount2 2 hours agoparentprevI wonder how much of it is \"think of the children!\" and how much is \"think of the litigation!\" reply IshKebab 3 hours agoparentprevThe really stupid thing is that they make toddler swings (with basket seats) lower than normal swings. Why?? Do these people not understand physics? How is it that professional swing manufacturers have never actually pushed a toddler on a swing?? reply Tao3300 3 hours agoparentprevHeh, the park they just built near me has a pretty tall slide, but there's a series of platforms in an enclosed structure you use to ascend it, so you can't just fall off a ladder. Kids are thankfully still kids though, and every now and then some kid climbs the outer structure and gets stuck. The smaller slides are big tubes, and to discourage kids climbing on top of the tube, they installed these big shield wall things... which make them even more fun to climb. reply theGnuMe 1 hour agoparentprevThere’s good reasons, spinal and head trauma. reply reify 3 hours agoprevI totally agree. I have seen the changes working with children for over 20 years. The mass media have a huge impact on parent's over protection of their children. The media claims, which are untrue, that we live in a society with a rapist, a child abductor and paedophile in every street will no doubtedly have a chilling effect on parenting. Schools also play a massive role in this by perpetuating this myth. Every school in Surrey UK where I live have huge 8-10 feet high fences all around the school to prevent unwanted innocent passersby looking at the children playing and more scarily, to prevent those rapists, child abductors and paedophiles living in every street from entering the school grounds. Children are living in prisons, constantly monitored by CCTV. The panopticon designs of the buildings and environment. What does this say to the children living in this protected environment? It says; this is a very frightening place to be, there are dangerous predators who might abduct you. No wonder then that children are presenting with acute anxiety disorders. This is most probably why parents allow their children to have carte blache when it comes to internet access. When I was a child in the 60's I roamed the streets from morning until night. I went home when I got hungry. Most children I knew had the same experience. Are there more paedophiles living in the world today compared to 100 years ago? I doubt it. One very strange phenomenon is that 95% of all child abuse happens in the family home by close family members and not by some stranger lurking in the shadows. reply tavavex 1 hour agoparent> One very strange phenomenon is that 95% of all child abuse happens in the family home by close family members and not by some stranger lurking in the shadows. It's not strange at all. In fact, it applies to almost every kind of abuse. Adult or child, you're far more likely to be abused/kidnapped/hurt/killed by someone you know. Most such crimes arise precisely because of that personal connection. That's not a pretty narrative, however. \"Serial\" criminals are extremely overemphasized, and people seem to be far more afraid of even a hypothetical possibility of being hurt by one, and not the more likely scenario. reply ozarker 3 hours agoparentprevLook at the sex offender registry in your area reply tavavex 1 hour agorootparentI can't, and that's a good thing. The US having criminal records that can be accessed by anyone is very strange, and something that no other first-world country (that I know of) does to this extent. What purpose does it serve? To absolutely guarantee that people who already served their punishment can never re-integrate into society? To act as Google Search for socially acceptable murder targets for anyone who's inclined? Were Americans actually at a greater danger before the internet because they lacked this information? reply __MatrixMan__ 3 hours agoprev> One of these forces is unfettered access to social media. I think we should reframe this to make it a bit more clear who the enemy is: We're allowing ad companies unfettered access to our kids. It's not communicating with their friends that's a problem, it's using a medium that is incentivized to encourage poor dopamine hygiene. These platforms are designed to harm their users because unhealthy users are more profitable than healthy users. reply silverquiet 3 hours agoparentToo many peoples' salaries here depend on them not understanding that. The most prestigious jobs here are often considered to be FAANG, two of which are the biggest ad companies on the planet. It's just depressing really. reply hackinthebochs 2 hours agoparentprevAds aren't the problem. Ad companies go out of their way to ensure their ads don't exceed the cultural average in terms of content and messaging. The problem with social media is the content kids are being fed. Communicating with their friends isn't the problem, its that they are consuming content not just from their friends, and their friends are also being influenced by content outside of their social bubble. It's the wide connectivity and the foreign ideologies that come with it. reply cassepipe 2 hours agoprev\"No wonder academia is nowadays the exact opposite of free speech and the scientific method.\" I was interested by what I was reading until I came across this sentence which really put me off.

He's presenting himself as an expert on a topic far from his research expertise. His background per Wikipedia: \"Haidt's main scientific contributions come from the psychological field of moral foundations theory, which attempts to explain the evolutionary origins of human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, gut feelings rather than logic and reason.\" This has nothing to do with developmental and clinical psychology/psychiatry. He's way out of his depth here. 2. He's part of the \"intellectual dark web\", a group of people who seek out fame with a particular audience niche, and prioritize that over truth. 3. I feel he's trying to please the audience and get out bestsellers, making the same mistakes he accuses others of making, e.g. lack of scientific rigor/open mindedness. Example: maybe Smartphones aren't that bad. Sure, they have a big impact, but it could be positive and negative. To make the book a bestseller, it pays to focus on the negatives. reply adamors 3 hours agoparentBut he is presenting his arguments based on research data, not just pulling stuff out of nowhere. I have the book and started reading it, so far it doesn’t seem farfetched or made up at all, he does cite his sources. reply croemer 13 minutes agorootparentIs he though? I haven't read the book, but the blog provides very bad arguments based on fallacies. Maybe it misrepresents the book. I don't know. But it's clear that this is not Prof Haidt's topic of expertise as a scientist. In scientific questions I would want a review on the question of impact of social media on mental health to be done by an expert on teen mental health.

What do you base this conclusion on? Him having written a bestseller? While you are right that Wikipedia can be biased, I'm surprised you bring this up in this context.

Also, his focus is on human social relationships and how they affect society. The article is well within his realm of experise.

The subtitle is \"How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" The people who diagnose, treat and study mental illness are psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.

Another is the dissolution of community and intimate time spent with other people (especially outside one's demographic) leading to what is basically insanity: thoughts and behaviors with no external \"sanity check\" or stop-gap (like an older more mature person mentoring a younger one to correct maladaptive thoughts and behaviors or even to just protect them from the onslaught of bad-faith actors). Those older are also to blame for not taking a greater part in preventing this; but seeing as it's so widespread, there are most likely more systemic, societal-wide issues at play. reply anon291 3 hours agoparentdecline of third spaces due to suburbanization, urban decay, and decline of religious participation.

Shirley Meng’s Laboratory for Energy Storage and Conversion has created the world’s first anode-free sodium solid-state battery. With this research, the LESC – a collaboration between the UChicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and the University of California San Diego’s Aiiso Yufeng Li Family Department of Chemical and Nano Engineering – has brought the reality of inexpensive, fast-charging, high-capacity batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage closer than ever. “Although there have been previous sodium, solid-state, and anode-free batteries, no one has been able to successfully combine these three ideas until now,” said UC San Diego PhD candidate Grayson Deysher, first author of a new paper outlining the team’s work. The paper, published today in Nature Energy, demonstrates a new sodium battery architecture with stable cycling for several hundred cycles. By removing the anode and using inexpensive, abundant sodium instead of lithium, this new form of battery will be more affordable and environmentally friendly to produce. Through its innovative solid-state design, the battery also will be safe and powerful. This work is both an advance in the science and a necessary step to fill the battery scaling gap needed to transition the world economy off of fossil fuels. “To keep the United States running for one hour, we must produce one terawatt hour of energy,” Meng said. “To accomplish our mission of decarbonizing our economy, we need several hundred terawatt hours of batteries. We need more batteries, and we need them fast.” Sustainability and sodium The lithium commonly used for batteries isn’t that common. It makes up about 20 parts per million of the Earth’s crust, compared to sodium, which makes up 20,000 parts per million. This scarcity, combined with the surge in demand for the lithium-ion batteries for laptops, phones and EVs, have sent prices skyrocketing, putting the needed batteries further out of reach. Lithium deposits are also concentrated. The “Lithium Triangle” of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia holds more than 75% of the world’s lithium supply, with other deposits in Australia, North Carolina and Nevada. This benefits some nations over others in the decarbonization needed to fight climate change. “Global action requires working together to access critically important materials,” Meng said. Lithium extraction is also environmentally damaging, whether from the industrial acids used to break down mining ore or the more common brine extraction that pumps massive amounts of water to the surface to dry. Sodium, common in ocean water and soda ash mining, is an inherently more environmentally friendly battery material. The LESC research has made it a powerful one as well. Innovative architecture To create a sodium battery with the energy density of a lithium battery, the team needed to invent a new sodium battery architecture. Traditional batteries have an anode to store the ions while a battery is charging. While the battery is in use, the ions flow from the anode through an electrolyte to a current collector (cathode), powering devices and cars along the way. Anode-free batteries remove the anode and store the ions on an electrochemical deposition of alkali metal directly on the current collector. This approach enables higher cell voltage, lower cell cost, and increased energy density, but brings its own challenges. “In any anode-free battery there needs to be good contact between the electrolyte and the current collector,” Deysher said. “This is typically very easy when using a liquid electrolyte, as the liquid can flow everywhere and wet every surface. A solid electrolyte cannot do this.” However, those liquid electrolytes create a buildup called solid electrolyte interphase while steadily consuming the active materials, reducing the battery’s usefulness over time. A solid that flows The team took a novel, innovative approach to this problem. Rather than using an electrolyte that surrounds the current collector, they created a current collector that surrounds the electrolyte. They created their current collector out of aluminum powder, a solid that can flow like a liquid. During battery assembly the powder was densified under high pressure to form a solid current collector while maintaining a liquid-like contact with the electrolyte, enabling the low-cost and high-efficiency cycling that can push this game-changing technology forward. “Sodium solid-state batteries are usually seen as a far-off-in-the-future technology, but we hope that this paper can invigorate more push into the sodium area by demonstrating that it can indeed work well, even better than the lithium version in some cases,” Deysher said. The ultimate goal? Meng envisions an energy future with a variety of clean, inexpensive battery options that store renewable energy, scaled to fit society’s needs. Meng and Deysher have filed a patent application for their work through UC San Diego’s Office of Innovation and Commercialization.

The Gibbs free energy of formation for chromium oxides and chromite is much more negative than for lithium-bearing minerals so Cr compounds are thermodynamically favored to precipitate out of melts and solutions, forming minerals with high concentrations that then get pushed up by other processes. Li+, with its lone valence electron, just doesn't form strong bonds or highly stable mineral phases in comparison. On top of that the diffusion coefficients for Cr species in magmas and rocks are generally orders of magnitude lower than for Li. Cr gets locked into crystal structures early and stays put, while Li keeps migrating and diffusing in the form of water soluble minerals. There's also a whole biogeochemical cycle for Cr involving microbes that can concentrate it in sediments. reply pfdietz 47 minutes agorootparentChromium is also being looked at for resistive thermal storage, due to the stability properties you mentioned.

    "originBody": "- [Narrator] Rice balls. - [Vlogger] Look at that. Michelin-type of ramen. - [Narrator] Collaborations with famous restaurants like Santouka, milk tea, this is 7/11 in Japan. But in the US, the company is more known for Slurpees and hot dogs. - It&#39;s just not as appealing. My perception is people go in there when they need to. - [Narrator] The world&#39;s largest convenience store chain has over 13,000 locations in North America alone and made over $72 billion in sales last year. But now, it&#39;s working to bring more Japanese inspiration to its American stores. Convenience stores have historically made their money selling tobacco and gas. But now, as cigarette sales continue to decline and many expect gas sales to slow, many are racing to find other sources of revenue and doubling down on food. But shifting a business this massive is a major undertaking. This is the economics of 7/11. (light music) 7/11 started as an American company, but it went bankrupt, twice. Once in 1932 during the Great Depression, and again in 1990 as it struggled with debts. - 7/11 is now owned by a Japanese company. Seven & I Holdings. - [Narrator] A majority stake was bought by Ito Yokado, a Japanese supermarket chain that had been operating 7/11 stores in Japan for more than a decade. From the beginning, the Japanese owners said American 7/11, both its central operations and its franchises, had a lot of catching up to do. - The Japanese model was a lot more data driven. They would pour over what sold well at what time of day, break it down by gender and age, and use that to inform their next order decisions. The American system just wasn&#39;t as sophisticated as that. - [Narrator] There were some major differences between US and Japanese 7/11s. The US stores were typically larger and attached to gas stations. The Japanese stores didn&#39;t sell gas, but had a much wider array of fresh food. Japanese stores only stocked items that would sell quickly. They had a proprietary distribution system that made multiple shipments to stores every day. Orders were customized by store based on sales data, demographic trends, and local weather forecasts. American 7/11 stores were getting two deliveries, per week, and some items were never being purchased. When American operators began counting items in their stores, some found that 40% of their products were selling less than one unit per month. Now, American 7/11 has its own distribution system where franchises place orders every day based on company recommendations of whats selling nationally and regionally and their own store data. - They&#39;re making decisions every single day on what they&#39;re going to order based on what they understand the customer wants to purchase, what new items are going to be made available. - One of the most interesting lessons that we&#39;ve learned from 7/11 Japan is their approach to operations and to retailing, which they call tanpin kanri. And tanpin kanri is basically this idea that we localize our assortment to the needs of customers. We actually help our stores localize their assortment so that they have the right balance of a consistent assortment of products that consumers and customers would expect to see nationally, as well as items in the assortment that are perfectly appropriate for a given store&#39;s location. - [Narrator] This is especially important when it comes to food. seven eleven japan is known for its wide array of meal options. - You&#39;re not gonna believe the choice of food in a convenience store. - [Narrator] American 7/11 also has a big food and beverage business. In total, it sold over $17 billion of food last year, about 24% of its overall sales. That included 315 million cups of coffee, 153 million Slurpees, and 99 million slices of pizza. But next year, it hopes to make one third of its sales from store brand goods, including food up from less than one quarter in 2022. That&#39;s particularly important given shifts in the convenience store industry. - So if you think about what convenience stores sell, there&#39;s fuel, there&#39;s tobacco products, and there&#39;s food and snacks. Gas is already a low margin business and it&#39;s at risk long-term. If electric vehicle adoption increases over time. Tobacco very profitable, but people are smoking less. Food, though, is a category where demand just isn&#39;t going away. So for convenience stores, it makes sense that they would wanna double down on that. - [Narrator] 7/11, it currently has 17, so-called Commissaries around the country that make food for all of its US locations. Now it&#39;s working on upgrading them. It&#39;s partnering with Warabeya, a supplier for seven eleven japan, to spearhead the effort. Warabeya&#39;s new factories in Hawaii, Texas, and Virginia can make a wider and more localized range of food than 7/11 has been able to stock in the past. - Things like being able to cook rice en masse, new protein capabilities, all which helps 7/11 introduce new types of products in the food area to our customers. We recently launched a product that&#39;s a spicy miso ramen soup, not something you would typically think about being sold at a 7/11. - [Narrator] It&#39;s adding a lot of items to its menu. The main question is how many customers will buy them? And this is where data comes into the question. - When customers come into our stores, they&#39;re in an immediate consumption mindset. - [Narrator] Capitalizing on this is a key priority for the company, and it plans to use its massive data operation to do it. American seven elevens monitor daily sales and for loyalty members, they collect demographic information on who&#39;s buying what. The company&#39;s loyalty program has 95 million members. Building on that the company&#39;s investing in targeted advertising on screens and TVs throughout stores. That&#39;s to spur impulse buys. - It helps not only 7/11, but also our advertisers, our vendors, to target our customers at the point of purchase. So for example, in the morning, we may target our customers with a message around a hot cup of coffee and a donut. Whereas later in the day, we may target our customers with an advertisement that&#39;s around a snack and a beverage from our cold vault. - [Narrator] And for potential customers who aren&#39;t at the store, there&#39;s delivery, the fastest growing part of the company&#39;s business. It&#39;s highly profitable for the company since delivery orders tend to be for about double the amount of in-store purchases. - How the brand&#39;s grown for nearly a hundred years starts with what&#39;s the customer want, where do we think they&#39;re going, and how do we meet them where they&#39;re going. - [Narrator] A big question is whether American customers will match the enthusiasm 7/11 sees in some of its other markets. - In Asia. I think there is so much excitement around convenience stores and the types of food and snacks they offer. So if they can bring even a little bit of that excitement to the us, - [YouTuber] We&#39;re gonna get some musubis. - That would be a great success. (light music)",

I've been to an American 7-11 once or twice in my life. (I didn't want to go back.) In Japan, I went at least once daily - sometimes twice per day. They almost function the role of a NYC bodega, but with more and fresher food options. In addition, they often have a stack of microwaves run by the staff, allowing for inexpensive, fresh, and warm meals. reply xianshou 20 hours agoparent7-11, Family Mart, and Lawson are the holy trinity of konbini (convenience stores) reply wesapien 20 hours agorootparentI stayed in Japan for two months and some days I don't feel like sitting down for food. I go to a a grocery store (or supermarket) and grab food there to take home. If there's none along the way, I go for konbini. reply wodenokoto 13 hours agoparentprevThe franchisee of 7-11 in Japan was so successful they eventually bought the mother company from the American owners and now 7-11 is a Japanese company. reply Loughla 20 hours agoparentprev7-11 here in the States tends to be a great place to get stabbed and/or purchase illegal drugs, in my experience. reply throwup238 20 hours agorootparentHere their parking lots are used to stage large illegal street racing competitions. reply le-mark 20 hours agorootparentprev7-11 used to have really great fresh brewed coffee. It been about 10 years since I moved and no longer go there. But it used to be the best gas station coffee around imo. reply Graziano_M 20 hours agoparentprevWhen I was there last I had an egg salad sandwich almost every day. reply shermantanktop 20 hours agorootparentTamago sando! The hot dog bun version is a little odd to me. reply catchnear4321 7 hours agorootparentthe hot dog bun is a perfect carb vessel for “salad”-like fillings. unlike traditional bread slices, the hot dog bun has fewer open sides, and acts more like a cup to hold the contents. though it may look a bit odd, it truly is peak salad sandwich performance. reply chalcolithic 14 hours agoparentprev>they often have a stack of microwaves you mean sometimes they don't? and in some countries they never have them? reply michaelbuckbee 18 hours agoparentprevIs the US equivalent of 7-11 something more like WaWa? reply analog31 16 hours agorootparentIt could be something regional. For instance Wisconsin has Quik Trip gas stations, which tend to have fairly large convenience stores, some with fresh groceries. reply matthewdgreen 7 hours agorootparentprevWawa is like 7-11 revamped to have a Michelin star. reply MrFoof 18 hours agoprevWhat was more surprising to me is the realization by corporate that 40% of the in-store SKUs in their US stores (in a given location) only sold through 1 or fewer units per month. That means if a franchise store got shipped a box of 12 units of a SKU, it might take a year or more to sell that box through. What kills me is they're possibly just realizing this in 2024. What on earth has the corporate analytics team been doing all this time to not make that sort of opportunity cost screamingly obvious? Even if the margin is good, you're moving no volume. I realize that it's probably cleaning products and other shelf stable items, but that just blew my mind. reply EE84M3i 13 hours agoparentPotentially it's items that move very very low volume but provide significant value by being available? For example, 7/11 in Japan sells underwear and shirts, with a bit of a selection even. No one is buying these except in an emergency, but having it there is a lifesaver. I also wouldn't be surprised if the average 7/11 location moved less than 1 unit a month of some of the whiskies they have available. However surely this is a small fraction of all the products they sell. reply MrFoof 6 hours agorootparent>Potentially it's items that move very very low volume but provide significant value by being available? That doesn't matter, and exactly why corporate brought it up. Again, opportunity cost. I asked my nearest 7-Eleven manager (I never go to convenience stores, so I just went in to the closest one) about how many customers he gets a month, and he said about 8,000. How many SKUs? About 2500. So for 40% of his SKUs, of the 8000 customers that walk in, 1 of 8000 is willing to buy a specific one of those 1000 items (at that elevated price) from that store. That's 1000 SKUs that could be at least partially replaced with something with far better sell-through. Shelf space isn't free. Backroom space isn't free. That's dedicated square footage, he's paying a lease on every single month, forever, for stuff that doesn't move. The guy isn't running a convenience store out of the goodness of his heart. There's a supermarket 3 blocks away selling the same items for far less money, so it's not like he's selling something you can't get just a 3-minute further walk (or 1-minute drive) away. I asked him about slow selling items. \"Oh, you saw the video too?!\" He was fully onboard with corporate support to not just get much better sell-through (and ergo, revenue), but having a reason for more people to come into the store, especially on a regular basis, and not simply getting things because, \"they happen to already be here.\" This location in particular WASN'T with a service station out front (inner city location). So for the manager, a way to get more regular customers, that are coming in to buy things they want -- possibly if they can't get it as easily (or at all) nearby -- is a HUGE potential win for him. That might help him get hundreds more customers every month, which might buy other things as well. reply ksec 1 hour agoparentprev>What on earth has the corporate analytics team been doing all this time to not make that sort of opportunity cost screamingly obvious? This is assuming there is an analytics team / department. I think people in tech may be surprised how Tech hasn't really caught on in many of the industry, especially those that are not Fortune 2000. reply throwawaymaths 17 hours agoparentprev> What on earth has the corporate analytics team been doing 7-11 is franchised with a ton of autonomy given to franchisees (relative to other franchises) so as long as the fees keep coming in, corporate doesn't care. Also, corporate is owned by a Japanese company so it's likely to be kind of \"old-fashioned\" in a way, and the US entities are a whole ocean away. reply wodenokoto 12 hours agorootparentThe Japanese franchise was successful _because_ they measured their sales. They were pioneers in the field. Story goes that in the 80s and 90s the register had a row for customer type, so each sale was attached to “school boy” or “middle aged male”, etc. reply ajb 20 hours agoprevInteresting. 7-11 is one of the example's in Rumelt's book on strategies[1]. In the chapter on 'pivot points' (by his definition, areas where effort yields significant reward) he outlines that 7-11 focuses on different things in Japan vs China. In Japan, they believe that the customer is easily bored and requires their stores to stock many choices, and carefully track which are rising and falling in popularity in each area, to avoid them seeking out novelty at competing stores. In China, they focus on attracting customers by having Japanese-style \"spotless interiors and white-gloved service\", a much more pleasant experience that traditionally found in stores in China. I was wondering what this said about the US customer. But it sounds like the US operation was just not as well run and needs to catch up. [1] Good strategy, Bad Strategy, 2012 reply mathgeek 20 hours agoparentNot sure of the structure in Japan and China, but US 7-11s are franchised and thus the individual owners have a huge effect on the base level of service and upkeep. There are many stereotypes that it wouldn’t be appropriate to get into here, but the quality of individual stores can vary a lot. They are also known as a place to buy huge sodas, tobacco, and energy drinks, but many other convenience stores also provide those. reply yamakadi 19 hours agorootparentThey are franchised here as well, although the holding company owns multiple stores. The overall quality, including the operating hours to the chagrin of the franchisees, is ruthlessly maintained through their contracts and lawsuits though. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/06/24/business/seven-... The US contracts might be more relaxed or the holding company might not have enough control due to the sheer size of the US market. In Japan, most stores get deliveries more than twice a day, have inspectors show up unannounced, need to make daily reports in some cases, etc. Not much room for leeway. reply alephnerd 20 hours agoparentprev> In China, they focus on attracting customers by having Japanese-style \"spotless interiors and white-gloved service\", a much more pleasant experience that traditionally found in stores in China In Asia, 7-11, Circle K, GS25, etc are all \"upscale\"ish outside of JP/SK/TW. They can't compete at the price point that a local bodega or street vendor in Dongguan, Diliman, or Da Lat so they segment themselves as slightly more upscale. Sort of like how Target differentiates itself from Walgreens and CVS. The whole point is that because they're Japanese/Korean/Taiwanese they are much more \"luxury\" than a local brand. reply m463 21 hours agoprevA friend from Japan said 7-11 was an upscale store there. It features the top products in every category, and is maintained in an organized and clean japanese way. reply TulliusCicero 21 hours agoparent7-11 and convenience stores in general in Japan (the other big ones are Lawson and Family Mart) are vastly superior to American offerings. Almost every American who goes to Japan seems to comment on this. reply Klonoar 21 hours agorootparentIt's not just Japan, it's largely Asia in general (e.g, Taiwanese 7-11's and Korean 7-11's are also so far above their US counterparts in terms of offerings/feel). (A fun trivia fact is that like 7-11, Lawson also originally started in the USA. They only recently-ish returned stateside with locations in Hawaii (IIRC).) reply mlinhares 20 hours agorootparentI'd be surprised if there is any place where 7-11 is worse than in the US given how bad they are in here. Having lived most of my US time in PA I always either drove longer or waited for a Wawa to shop because all 7-11s were pure garbage. reply m463 18 hours agorootparentI remember that lots of communities didn't want 7-11s in their area, because they showed up as red blotches in the crime maps. reply dawnerd 19 hours agorootparentprev7-11 in Canada is just as bad. reply alephnerd 20 hours agorootparentprevThe Asian equivalent of a trashy and cheap American 7/11 or Circle-K would be street vendors or a hyper-local general store/bodega with a bare minimum amount of goods. In much of Asia (JP, SK, and TW excluded), convenience stores like 7-11 are similar luxury wise to what Target is in the US. reply sho_hn 20 hours agorootparentprevI'd say in Korea 7-11 is the worst of the top 3 options though (GS25, CU and 7-11) reply Klonoar 20 hours agorootparentI mean, sure. I don't even think 7-11 is the top in Japan, but this is all opinion (ish). My only real point was that they are categorically above their US counterparts, and that it's not just a Japan-specific thing. reply jrockway 21 hours agorootparentprevWith that in mind, I've never noticed a difference between the various brands of Japanese convenience stores. Lawson / Family Mart / 7/11 all seem the same to me. The only thing that ever stood out about 7/11 was that I could use their ATMs to take money out of my American bank account circa 2002 when I lived there. (The post office also worked.) reply Klonoar 16 hours agorootparentHeh, I used to joke that 7-11 was my bank of choice for this reason. reply TulliusCicero 15 hours agorootparentI mean Seven Bank is a major bank in Japan. reply parhamn 20 hours agorootparentprevProbably because most Americans live in lower density cities. Fresh food distribution is a lot harder in low density areas, and that is probably why 7-11 focuses on microwavable wings and hotdogs in the US. A good NYC bodega is as stacked as a 7-11 in Tokyo. Really good fresh baked goods and they'll cook up anything you want for you too. reply chipgap98 20 hours agorootparentBut 7-11s in Japan seem better than American convenience stores in similar density areas (from my experience) reply TulliusCicero 15 hours agorootparentprevThis makes sense for rural and maybe exurban areas, but not for urban and most suburban areas. My guess is that the lack of foot traffic changes the clientele in the states. reply linearrust 4 hours agorootparentprev> A good NYC bodega is as stacked as a 7-11 in Tokyo. No. And it isn't as clean, orderly and organized either. reply throwaway743 16 hours agorootparentprevYup. The quality and price for food was shocking, especially compared to the US. reply forgetfreeman 20 hours agoparentprevI feel like the parent company is going to have an interesting time of it when convenience store wages collide with stocking and food prep processes more complicated than \"load hotdog roller then studiously ignore for the entirety of shift\", especially in the markets that are currently served by 7-11. reply dghlsakjg 16 hours agorootparentAre you saying that low paid workers don’t have the cognitive capacity to do more than cook hot dogs? reply forgetfreeman 13 hours agorootparentI'm saying over the course of the last 5 years performance in the service industry writ large has gone off a cliff. Example: fast food restaurants routinely sport sanitation scores that would have cost the franchisee their restaurant a decade ago. Your guess is as good as mine as to root causes. Specific to 7-11 the franchise has a storied multi-decade history of seedy establishments and desperately sketchy food offerings. Where the franchise expects to recruit a new cohort of motivated individuals is something of a mystery. reply agar 19 hours agoprevIndirectly related: before visiting Thailand I heard that 7-Elevens were everywhere (they were) and a core part of daily life for locals and tourists alike. I expected them to be more like the Japanese model, but was surprised that they all had a very limited number of salty snacks, energy drinks, and toiletries - similar to the US. Other than a nice selection of tourist-friendly pre-paid mobile plans, I couldn't really understand (or validate) the \"important\" role they played. Anyone have a perspective on this? reply bcherny 19 hours agoparentMaybe it’s the fact they’re air conditioned, and an easy respite from 100 degree/100% humidity summer heat? At least that’s what it was for me as a tourist. reply dpb001 18 hours agoparentprev7-Eleven’s will vary.

I get that it's a quarter of their revenue, but one of the things that makes japanese convenience stores so convenient is that you can do more than just buy stuff. like, they often have printers and scanners if you need to make a copy of something or print something off. or if you're a tourist and you're taking the train someplace and have too much luggage, you can get it shipped to the hotel at your destination via 7/11. that's the kind of thing I would love to see in a convenience store. reply chemmail 20 hours agoprev7-11 JP is so good the food is 90% there compared to restaurants and the desserts legit beat some Michelin star stuff.

Of course, I know there are dedicated devices for doing that, such as the Kryoflux or the SuperCard Pro. But it occurred to me that I already own the required hardware to capture the low-level data from a floppy disk: my Saleae Logic 8 logic analyzer. Side note: While I can only highly recommend the Saleae analyzers for their features and easy-to-use software, the things described here can also be done with other logic analyzers – including those available for less than 10 € from your favorite Chinese online store – and using, for example, the free Sigrok software. A primer on the floppy drive interface Contrary to more modern mass storage devices such as ATA hard drives or USB sticks, the interface to a floppy drive is much more low-level. E.g., you can ask a modern hard drive to read sector 1337 and it will return you the bytes stored in that sector. In contrast, as soon as it is selected for reading and the disk is rotating, a floppy drive will simply give you a pulse each time the magnetic flux changes, i.e. whenever the magnetic field changes orientation. It is important to know that the magnetic field orientation does not directly represent the individual bits that are stored on the disk. Instead, an encoding scheme is always used. The details of the encoding differ between systems – which is why you cannot read an Amiga disk in an Atari ST, for example. Regardless of the implementation, the encoding always needs to take care of several things: 1. Encode the data bits, obviously. 2. Clock recovery. This is essential because different drives may rotate at slightly different speeds and the floppy disk controller thus needs to determine the actual data rate. 3. Marking the start of a sector. This is often achieved by flux patterns that do not occur in regular data. The following examples will consider MFM (modified frequency modulation) encoding as used in IBM PCs and Atari STs. It is important to note, however, that the floppy disk imaging is performed at raw flux level and as such will work with every encoding. This image shows the signals involved in reading data from a floppy disk. The write select signal, write gate, is forced high, which means deasserted, since floppy disks use active low logic signals. Then the disk drive will return flux transitions as pulses as described above on the read data line. Only the falling edge is relevant. Furthermore, so that you know the duration of one revolution of the disk, the index signal provides one pulse for every revolution. During that time – nominally 200 ms for a 300-rpm, 3.5-inch drive – an entire track on the disk is read. The side 1 select signal tells the drive which side of the disk to read. If you zoom in on the read data signal, you will see that – for MFM encoding and DD (double density) disks – the flux transitions are 4 µs, 6 µs or 8 µs apart. How to tell the drive which track to read? There is no command instructing the drive to seek to, e.g., track 42 by itself. You have to provide step pulses – again active low – for each step the drive head is supposed to make inwards (towards higher track numbers) or outwards (towards lower track numbers), depending on the direction signal. The track 0 signal indicates when the head is at the outermost track. Connecting the logic analyzer and capturing a first track With that knowledge, one can now connect the logic analyzer to the drive. The pinout of the floppy drive connector is shown below. All odd numbered pins are connected to ground. Note: A drive taken from an IBM-compatible PC is configured as drive select B and, thus, needs the drive select B and motor enable B lines pulled low to be selected. Write gate of course needs to be pulled high. My drive is a modern one that only requires a +5 V power supply. Older drives might want the +12 V supply as well. The output signals, such as read data and index, are open-collector, meaning that a pull-up resistor to 5 V is needed. To minimize cross talk between the flying leads, I used logic analyzer channels 1 and 3 as well as proper grounding. With a DD floppy disk inserted and the motor now spinning, one can capture a trace with the logic analyzer – preferably triggered on the falling edge of the index signal. This looks as expected. A histogram of the times between flux changes confirms that indeed 4 µs, 6 µs, and 8 µs prevail. Controlling the floppy drive In order to move the drive head, I resorted to another bit of hardware that was available: a USB serial cable. Mine is from FTDI, but every cable should work that not only exposes transmit and receive signals but also the control lines. I made the following connections: RTS → direction DTR → side 1 select TX → step CTS ← track 0 GND = GND RTS and DTR are outputs that can be controlled from the serial cable. CTS is an input. Using TX (the transmit line) as step signal means that sending a 0xff byte will cause a single step pulse to the drive because of the start bit of the serial transmission. I verified this to work with a terminal program that allows me to arbitrarily set the control lines. Automating Capturing all 80 or more tracks of a floppy disk means that the process needs to be automated. Python comes in handy. Of course, a serial port can easily be controlled from a Python script (via the pyserial module). Fortunately, the Saleae software can be remote-controlled and there is a Python module for that, as well. A minor issue I found is that the remote-control API does not expose all settings. Hence, I initialize the Saleae software from a previously saved settings file. With my finished script, I can step through all the tracks on the floppy disk, capturing both sides, track by track, with the logic analyzer. Data is exported from the Saleae software and imported into Python for further processing. This mainly consists of trimming the data to one revolution of the disk by means of the index signal and of calculating the times between flux changes, i.e., the times between falling edges of the read data signal. Exporting the data Obviously, for preservation the captured data needs to be stored – preferably in an already established format. I decided to go with the Supercard Pro (.scp) file format, because it is well documented and understood by third-party applications such as emulators. An scp file stores times between flux transitions, exactly the type of data that I capture with my setup. The Python script was quickly extended to produce the correct format including headers. Preserving the first disk With hardware and software now in place, one can now test everything. For the first test, I chose an unimportant disk, just in case some malfunction would damage it. The script ran, the floppy drive clicking every time the head moved one track further inwards. And in the end, the scp file was generated! Its file size is roughly 14 MB. Considering that the disk only has a usable capacity of 720 kB, this shows how much more low-level information is preserved by imaging disks at magnetic flux level. I used the HxCFloppyEmulator software to decode and interpret the data. It correctly decoded the individual sectors captured in the scp file, telling me that all 1440 sectors were decoded without error – proving that my setup works without any issues! Also, one can make interesting discoveries. Consider this display of track 0, side 0 of my disk. The bit timings – drawn as thick gray lines – show the drive this disk was originally written with had some jitter, evidenced by the wavy lines. But the two sectors containing part of the FAT (file allocation table) were overwritten by a different drive with nearly perfect timing – marked by orange boxes. Thus, you can even use this data to “finger-print” a floppy drive. Final remarks If you want to this try yourself, you can find my Python script in https://github.com/czietz/floppy-and-logic-analyzer. You probably will have to adapt it to your hardware configuration. There are some things that could be improved: The process is quite slow, requiring ca. 10 seconds per track, ca. 800 seconds for a full disk. Most of the time is spent in the Saleae Python API for capturing and exporting data. Perhaps, profiling can highlight potential bottlenecks. To reliably preserve defective (or copy-protected) disks, it is sometimes required to save multiple revolutions per track. The scp file format allows for it; my Python script could be extended accordingly. Since in my setup the drive motor is always on, I have to switch off the power supply before changing disks. By using one of the general-purpose output pins of my serial cable, the motor enable signal could be controlled. However, these output pins cannot be set via pyserial. © 1997 – 2024 CHZ-Soft / Powered by ProcessWire CMS",

They're long gone. So if you're just getting started today, I recommend you keep copies of everything you do. It's fun to go back and look at, and maintaining those copies is a lot easier to do than it was in the 80s. reply ck2 3 hours agoprevFun-fact the last floppy disc was made in 2011 Also the BBC seems to be running an odd number of floppy stories lately? https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240510-floppy-disks-why... https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o reply silvestrov 8 hours agoprevThe graphs would be easier to read for somebody not already familiar with floppy drives if the signals (e.g. Step, Index0) were marked with direction, i.e. is it input to the FD or output from it. reply asdefghyk 12 hours agoprevWould not the best way to scan a deteriorating? floppy disks is with a magnetic flux measuring tool that flies very close to surface of floppy , but not touching the floppy.

I have a Greaseweazle and a Central Point Copy II PC Deluxe Option Board (and regular). Greaseweazle is largely the way to go. It's important to use the highest-fidelity method on the best FDD with the highest SNR because using a floppy disk causes wear to the media. Age also plays a factor. I also have TEAC (2.88M, 1.44M, 1.2M, 720K, 360K, and SCSI versions), Sony, and various other FDDs. reply daneel_w 7 hours agoparentprevAs a great alternative there are a handful of very cheap Saleae knock-offs using the same series of Cypress/Infineon logic chips, and they work well with e.g. Sigrok. reply kees99 4 hours agorootparentVery cheap knock-offs have same CY7C68013 usb interface chip, but lack an FPGA that original Saleae has, so can't capture quite as fast. Plenty fast enough for a floppy bit-stream, of course. reply ndiddy 1 hour agorootparentNote that the knock-offs are clones of the original ~10 year old Salae Logic design, which also used the CY7C68013 without an FPGA (and had smaller margins than their current design, it only cost ~$100). They added the FPGA as a way of differentiating their products from the clones after they started becoming widespread. reply nine_k 15 hours agoparentprevIf you already have a logic analyzer, are interested in the details, and maybe are facing a tricky disk with physical damage or creative copy protection, TFA may be helpful. If you just need to read disks without hassle and expense, a Greaseweasle or another adapter us likely a more suitable choice. reply dazhbog 10 hours agoparentprevI remember it used to be $200 for a Saleae logic 8.
