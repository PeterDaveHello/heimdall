She has a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Science Communication from the University of Adelaide. By Imma Perfetto The first clinical trial to administer gene therapy to both ears in one person has restored hearing function to 5 children born with a form of inherited deafness, astounding the research team.. Two of the children even gained an ability to appreciate music. The success of the new approach is detailed in a new study published in Nature Medicine. The work builds on the first phase of the trial, published earlier this year, in which children were treated in a single ear. “The results from these studies are astounding,” says study co-senior author Zheng-Yi Chen, an associate scientist in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in the US. “We continue to see the hearing ability of treated children dramatically progress and the new study shows added benefits of the gene therapy when administrated to both ears, including the ability for sound source localisation and improvements in speech recognition in noisy environments.” Lead author Yilai Shu, an attending doctor in otolaryngology and an investigator at Eye and Ear, Nose, Throat hospital of Fudan University, China, says: “restoring hearing in both ears of children who are born deaf can maximise the benefits of hearing recovery. Read More Body and Mind How cochlear implants work…and when they don’t “These new results show this approach holds great promise and warrants larger international trials.” The children involved in the study were born with DFNB9, which accounts for between 2 and 8% of hereditary deafness. It is caused by mutations in the OTOF gene which prevent the production of functioning otoferlin protein, which can significantly reduce sound transmission from the inner ear hair cells to hearing nerves. Through minimally invasive surgery, Shu injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered to carry and deliver functioning copies of the human OTOF transgene, into the children’s inner ears. All 5 children were observed over a 13 or 26-week period and showed hearing recovery in both ears, with “dramatic” improvements in speech perception and sound localisation. During follow-up, 36 adverse events were observed, the most common being increased white blood cell counts and increased cholesterol levels. However, there were no dose-limiting toxicity or serious adverse events. The trial is continuing, and participant are stillbeing monitored. The authors say their results show that the gene therapy is “feasible, safe, and efficacious”. Originally published by Cosmos as Gene therapy restores hearing to children with inherited deafness",

Does it need periodic injections? reply toufka 4 hours agorootparentIf the DNA is in the cell's nucleus, the DNA will be utilized to produce whatever gene is encoded in the DNA. But if the DNA is just floating around on its own it will not survive a cell division event and the material would need to be periodically reinjected to keep working. However, if the injected DNA is part of a full chromosome, it will be replicated when the cell divides - and will be permanent as long as the cell or its progeny survive. Some viruses will just inject the DNA into cells, but will not become part of the cell's genome (\"transient\" transduction). Other viruses (like lentiviruses and these adeno-associated viruses [AAVs]) inject their DNA not just into the cells, but also have machinery that splices their payload DNA directly into the cell's chromosomes (\"integrated\"). The location in the genome of the splicing event is relatively random. Random is not necessarily great as it could interrupt other genes already in the chromosome. CRISPR is a now-famous tool that helps \"integrate\" DNA into a specific spot in the genome by being guided to a specific location with a small piece of a specific sequence. Once the DNA is integrated, any cell, and any of the cell's progeny, will produce or \"express\" the gene on the delivered DNA. In this case, they delivered the 5991 characters of DNA associated with the OROF gene [1].

And a lot of our health issues are a matter of poor access to healthcare. reply landryraccoon 3 hours agorootparentThis assumes that the fundamental nature of human beings can't be changed, which is the presupposition that genetic engineering denies. The entire point of genetic engineering is to try to engineer people at the cellular level. A fanciful example would be modifying human metabolism to be more similar to those of birds that consume most of their calories in the form of simple sugars. Humans can't eat a diet of 100% sugar and remain healthy, but other animals can. It may be possible to change that fact, if we know how to edit our genes. reply marvin 12 hours agorootparentprevJust ensure that there’s good a insurance system to finance the rare health issues, and the market will take care of the hubcaps and spoilers.

But I think the former doesn't hold, and the latter is greatly influenced by sites like HN, where I'm disappointed to consistently (if not exclusively) see breathless proposals for ways to design shinier hubcaps whenever some promising new technology appears. Yes, they can and likely will both happen to some extent, but I think they aren't independent, so I feel justified in trying to nudge the public conversation back towards the issues that I think matter more. reply smegger001 13 hours agorootparentIn all likelihood if we were to get to the point of it being safe and cheap enough for genetic engineering cosmetic \"upgrades\" then that would through economies of scale drive enough money that medical research funding would be a solved problem.

Shiny hubcap manufacturers will very generously subsidise the R&D for other, more worthy users of a technology. They aren't competitive or independent, they're synergistic. The billions of dollars we \"wasted\" on making video games look more realistic gave us a revolution in high-performance computing that nobody could have created intentionally. reply refurb 9 hours agorootparentEach gene therapy is a unique \"medicine\". There is little economy of scale, at least for the hardest part. reply ninjanomnom 8 hours agorootparentThat's due to a lack of theory and useful abstractions in the tools used to modify genes. We're so early on in the development of that field that if this were computers, we'd still be assembling devices by arranging logic gates by hand. Custom cosmetic gene therapy is a great way to incentivize the better tools. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparentprev> breathless proposals for ways to design shinier hubcaps whenever some promising new technology appears I wouldn't underestimate the emotional toil of dealing with illness and death [1]. Tackling these problems head on requires (a) exposing researchers to that toil and (b) removing from the pool anyone who doesn't want to do that. Given how much of Silicon Valley culture is built on borderline-ludicrous optimism (once it's over the border it no longer qualifies as building), it makes sense that the indirect approach finds resonance here in a way the direct one does not. Where your argument finds ample purchase is in the asymmetry of idiot luxury spending in our society to basic and applied research of any kinds, wings or Wilm's tumour.

The personalities that will work on e.g. wings or longevity are not the types drawn to curing diseases, much less the boring ones. Broadening the field from solving mundane problems to solving daring ones is net positive. You gain personalities that would have otherwise stayed away.

It is intuitive, but not something that normally comes to mind~ reply ben_w 10 hours agorootparentI remember the Therian and Were community, back in the day. Some overlap with the furry community, but not a perfect subset. reply simianparrot 9 hours agorootparentprevIt is the very definition of insane.

Like it or not, the way society is currently arranged, making stuff for rich people is more profitable than making things for poor people, and greed can kick in, so people do things out of love of money rather than necessity. were the deck stacked more equal, maybe things would be different, but human psychology is devilishly complex. reply gurumeditations 9 hours agorootparentprevSex changes/gender transitions is an actual boring health problem.

Otherwise it wouldn’t be a problem. reply Almondsetat 4 hours agorootparentIf your perception doesn't match your body, would you prefer to change the perception or change the body? reply sillysaurusx 3 hours agorootparentIt seems pretty clear to me that changing one’s body is preferable to changing who you are. The former is something you’re born with, but the latter is something you can decide for yourself. reply Almondsetat 3 hours agorootparentSuppose, as you do, that your body is not who you are. Then your identity lies solely in your brain. But if that's the case why would disphoria even exist? If you feel like a man but you don't look like a man, why could that cause any identity problems? It must mean your body is actually part of your identity, so changing it changes who you are reply sillysaurusx 2 hours agorootparentThe problem with this argument is that it leads to the conclusion that all change is pointless. If your body is who you are, and you can’t control it, then it’s best just to accept whatever you’re given. That’s contrary to most of human history, where we specifically try not to take what we’re dealt. It’s useful to ask yourself: why should vaccines be \"allowed\" (or \"accepted\" or \"they’re good\") but body change shouldn’t be? They’re both as artificial as a Twinkie. reply wouldbecouldbe 8 hours agorootparentprevThat’s like trying to cure depression by getting rich. It hardly ever works reply Almondsetat 7 hours agorootparentWhat? reply wouldbecouldbe 5 hours agorootparentCutting off body parts to treat body dysphoria is something that should be done with great care and rarely leads to solving the underlying mental problems. Trans is a much discussed variant that is hard to have a normal talk about, but there are many more variants, for instance women hating their breast & wanting to remove them, I think most people here would agree that intensive psychological treatment are preferable to actually removing healthy body parts. But in the end an adult can do what they want. reply groovy2shoes 5 hours agorootparentprevErasing someone's dysphoria would also fundamentally change their identity and personality. If I were to suffer a head injury today that so altered my personality, the result would be very unpredictable. I could become a better person, or a worse one. I could lose my wife, my career, everything. But even if the outcome were positive, I wouldn't be me anymore. This me would cease to exist, replaced by a new one. On the other hand, a bodily alteration is much more predictable, and, importantly, I'd still be me. I wouldn't become some other person. This me has an instinct for self-preservation. Thus, if both options were available, I would absolutely choose transition over erasure. reply Almondsetat 4 hours agorootparentYou seem to come from the point of view that body and mind are quite separate, and that changing your body through surgery and hormones and other chemicals has less effects on the \"real you\" than a change in brain wiring would cause. reply narrator 15 hours agorootparentprevNo doubt you'll see an Android/Apple split and the Apple people won't be able to date the Android people because of incompatible augmented pheromones that smell funny if you're not on the same platform. reply nkrisc 17 hours agorootparentprevTaking it seriously for a moment, that still seems outlandish even in a sci-fi scenario. The amount of changes that would be necessary to the body for a human to achieve autonomous powered flight would be substantial. Given our overall density, we would need enormous wings and musculature. Consider that the heaviest flying birds alive today weigh maybe 40lbs and have a wingspan of 8ft or so. If we naively extrapolate that linearly then an adult weighing 160lbs would need a 32ft wingspan. There were flying pterosaurs that weighed much more than the heaviest flying birds today, but they were also the size of small planes and it’s a bit of a debate how well they even flew. They may have struggled to even take flight. So injecting yourself with some designer DNA isn’t just going to make you grow wings, it would have to completely transform you into a completely different creature, simply due to the physics of flight. Additionally, you need not only to be able to fly, but your body needs to function well enough to stay in this new state. You would also likely need an enormous caloric intake to support the massive new growth, or it would take a very, very long time. It wouldn’t be designing wings for a human, it would be designing a be creature based on a human but not human at all, really. Call me shortsighted but I don’t really see how that will ever be possible. reply slfnflctd 16 hours agorootparent\"...are you suggesting coconuts migrate?\" Seriously, lesser-schooled folks don't realize the extent to which evolution took tiny variations over an extremely long time to achieve physical flight. The way it arose differently in pterosaurs, birds and bats is fascinating. I think younger children are capable of understanding more about genetics than we often suppose. More of these concepts should be taught at younger ages. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparentprev> it would have to completely transform you into a completely different creature, simply due to the physics of flight In OP's defence, they never mentioned flight. Maybe they just want a peacock train. reply nkrisc 7 hours agorootparentOk, fair enough. I hadn’t considered that. In my mind, wings you can’t fly with are worse than no wings. reply galangalalgol 6 hours agorootparentTell that to am emu or ostrich, or don't, their claws aren't vestigial.

True, you might have to be a junior Olympian to do it, but it’s possible. On earth your pectorals would tear off of your sternum long before you achieved takeoff. reply BurningFrog 5 hours agorootparentI thought the same thing.

I’m saying that’s not impossible and an acceptable modification to whoever wants to do this to themselves. As long as you can maintain the brain as is, I don’t see there being a problem with radically modifying the rest of the body. Argentavis magnificens had a wingspan of around 24ft and weighed around 72 kgs or a 160lbs which is close to what an average human weighs. If you compare growth rates to other mammals like elephants, I doubt a change like that would take much more than 5-10 years. reply nkrisc 9 hours agorootparent> As long as you can maintain the brain as is, That’s the question, can a human sized body that can fly additionally support a human sized brain? I suspect you would have to spend nearly every waking minute eating to support both. Or at least a substantial portion of your day. No time for hacking, gotta eat. You’ll probably have to pay full up front for this, as no one will finance you since you’ll be too busy foraging for sugary fruit or carrying livestock off to your eyrie to work a job to pay it back. Finally, this raises another question I won’t even attempt to answer: is it even possible for you to still be “you” in another body? How responsible is your body, beyond just your brain, responsible for making you who you are? reply nonameiguess 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's about as close to impossible as you can get. If you tried to do it in the womb, too much deviation from a regular human fetus won't be carried to term. If you try to do it after growth plates have closed, you'd have to destroy every bone in the body first, which would kill you. That gives you some kind of post-birth, pre-puberty window over which some sufficient level of body remodeling can at least happen in principle, but you seem to be underestimating the level of remodeling to do this. You'd need to drastically reduce bone density, which would leave you extremely susceptible to injury. You'd have to undo human adaptations in the spine and pelvis for upright posture, which would be extremely painful. You'd need to effectively swap out the glutes with pecs and undo the adaptations for brachiating arms. Things like your eyes and ears and basic breathing apparatus are not well-adapted for flight. Things like where blood and lymph and other bodily fluids tend to pool in the human body versus where they do in the bodies of flying animals. Just as laying down for too much time will cause it to pool in places your body can't easily clear right now, being horizontal for flight would have the same effect. It's not just a matter of growing wings. And yeah, the energy demands of making all these changes, as others have pointed out. The only kinds of animals that go through this level of non-fetal metamorphosis are insects with weights measured in the tens of grams, energy needs that kind be sustained by something like a cocoon. How would you meet the energy demands of an adult human going through metamorphosis? You couldn't do it by eating, not only because your gut can't actually digest the amount of food you'd need (you don't have an elephant gut) but also simply because being conscious through the process, unlike insects in a cocoon, would be so absurdly painful that I doubt you'd be able to function and do anything at all, let alone spend all of your time finding and eating food. You'd need to be put into a medical coma and injected with intravenous nutrients to have any shot at all. Why on earth would we ever try this? In reality, giving yourself genes to grow wings would just kill you. Look at this picture from Wikipedia showing Argentavis side by side with a human: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentavis#/media/File:62628-A... What sorts of processes do you imagine are necessary to stretch the human body to the size of the Argentavis body without adding any weight? It'd be like getting flattened by a steam roller, then drawn and quartered.

For example: Retrobiosynthesis simulates biochemistry backwards, to find the steps necessary for a biological system to build something, usually a small molecule. Galaxy-SynBioCAD / Retropath would be one example: https://jfaulon.com/galaxy-synbiocad-portal/ Constraint based metabolic modeling models cellular metabolism, and lets you simulate adding and removing chemical reactions to a cell, and predict the outcomes. COBRApy would be one example software tool: https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/ Design editors for DNA plasmids, like the Teselagen design editor let you construct DNA sequences representing new biological capabilities to be added to an engineered cell, which can then be synthesized or constructed. Teselagen design module: https://teselagen.com/design-module/ Generative AI systems can 'hallucinate' functional proteins and DNA sequences that meet a design specification for function and/or shape. For example, GenerateBio's Chroma model can literally take a 3D file designed in a standard CAD program, and then automatically come up with an amino acid sequence that will fold into a protein with that exact 3D shape- and it actually works. https://github.com/generatebio/chroma An emerging field is coupling all of these types of tools with predictive models to enable 'inverse design' where you create a spec of what you want, such as a material with some desired properties, and it will automatically suggest biological routes to it. reply mylons 17 hours agorootparentprevit’s happening! i just finished something that assists in “CRISPR Design” and helps gene editors. reply taf2 16 hours agorootparentprevThat would be cool - maybe a simple 20/20 vision would be a great next step after hearing reply hinkley 10 hours agorootparentprevDan Simmons, Hyperion Cantos. “Biosculpting” reply TyrianPurple 9 hours agorootparentprevExcuse me, are you The Qu? reply inglor_cz 11 hours agorootparentprevOur bodies are very much not suitable for flight.

My wife and I had our embryos screened by Orchid Health since we have a related genetic condition: a pathogenic mutation in GJB-2. Amazingly, Decibel Therapeutics has has one of these in R&D and the OTOF success gives us hope. We have a few embryos that are affected and the more that can grow up healthy the more chances we'll have at children. The technology itself is unbelievably futuristic: involving using a virus to deliver a repaired gene into existing cells. This form of non-syndromic hearing loss may well be repaired two generations from now. An interesting thing is if you follow along with the literature, some Chinese labs report success with these gene therapies in kids on the cusp of teen age. That's remarkable. It will give a lot of people today the chance to have healthy kids in the future even if they were unfortunate enough to carry the genes today. Personally, the fact that I can practically hold a whole genome sequence of our embryos on my computer means the future is here.

Other than economic logic, we have natural experiments to back this up: i.e. the steam engine patent granted to Watt and Boulton in 1772 and its chilling effect on engine duty improvement (and the explosion of progress after patent expiry), and the modern pharmaceutical industry developing most strongly precisely where chemical patents were not granted, in 19th C. continental Europe, and slowing down wherever patent protections were eventually introduced, at the request of rent seeking lobbyists. https://fee.org/articles/do-patents-encourage-or-hinder-inno... http://www.dklevine.com/papers/anew09.pdf reply chris_t 3 hours agorootparentI agree with all of this.

A technology that distributes a gene editor throughout the body is called a delivery vector, and it is typically a modified virus. After the patient is two years old, many large molecules do not pass through the blood brain barrier. Typically most of the treatment ends up in the liver. Viruses and the gene editor can be toxic. Combining the two previous points the correct dose for most of the body can be highly toxic to the liver. The delivery vector may support genes up to a specific size (in kilobases) which may be smaller than the gene you are trying to fit. Sometimes you don't want to target organs that the delivery vector hits. Sometimes you want to target organs that the delivery vector misses. And more.

The world is easier for non-deaf people. I can’t imagine even many deaf people would argue against that statement. The correct way to argue against this isn’t to say that “objectively” the world is the same for deaf and non-deaf people; it’s that there’s a culture and language bound up in deafness that don’t deserve to die thanks to medical advances. That is true, and makes treatments like these and what they mean to the deaf community much more complicated and difficult. reply alexey-salmin 11 hours agorootparentIf dolphins could communicate with us they would surely tell how much easier it is when you have ultrasonic hearing.

However, whether all kids should receive gene therapy to develop the echo-location once the science allows for that is a more nuanced question. reply geraldwhen 9 hours agorootparentIf most buildings lacked light because the vast majority just echolocated, then the those unable would be disabled.

That's what most people normally do, yes. Then many people out there define an \"ability to enjoy hetero sex\" as a \"normal human experience\" and therefore see gayness as a disability that needs a cure. I'm not arguing about the conclusion here, but about the method and the basis for deriving this conclusion. The initial comment in this thread declared deafness to be an \"actual defect\" while gayness \"is just people being inherently gay\". Such division is completely arbitrary and doesn't follow from any law of nature. Only from current societal views which change a lot with time. reply sweezyjeezy 8 hours agorootparent> doesn't follow from any law of nature Natural selection gave us hearing. reply alexey-salmin 8 hours agorootparentRight, and it also gave us a strong desire for the opposite sex. So if you draw the line based on this principle then gayness and deafness will fall on the same side of this line, whichever side it is. Hence I write that the initial comment making the distinction between gayness being obviously OK and deafness being obviously not OK, look arbitrary to me.

E.g. it's beneficial to be stronger I guess, and gorillas are always strong whether they use their muscles or not. However for humans nature chose a different path where only the muscles you actively use are strong. This approach seem to work great so far, even though it results in many individual muscles of the body being weak. For each and every of these muscles you can argue that making it stronger would be \"beneficial\" but as a whole it doesn't seem to work out. reply PierceJoy 8 hours agorootparentprev> Most of vertebrates (including human's ancestors) lost the 6th sense of electric fields in process of the evolution. Human ancestors are not human. Also, the ancestor you are referring to was a fish, and could only sense electric fields under water. Why would the ability to sense electric fields under water be an evolutionary advantage for humans who don't live in water? If it's not an evolutionary advantage, then there is no reason it would propagate. When I said 5 senses are better than 4, I was clearly referring to senses that are useful in our environment. Answer this question: is a deaf person, all else equal, more likely or less likely to survive and procreate relative to a hearing person? > Moles went further to loose sight as well. Moles have eyes and can see. Their vision is just not as detailed as humans. Highly detailed sight isn't an advantage for creatures that live in the dark. However, hearing is a huge advantage for people who live in an environment where sound waves exist. You're clearly wrong here. Stop reaching so hard and just move on. reply alexey-salmin 8 hours agorootparentNo, I'm not wrong, I just don't like relying on \"obvious\" statements like \"5 senses are better than 4\". We can't know for sure what was \"better\" until the human race experiment is finished (and then we won't know either obviously). Consider this: hereditary autoimmune diseases are usually seen as a disadvantage. However they were a huge advantage during the bubonic plague in Europe, increasing the chances of survival by estimated 40% [1] If we manage to eradicate these disadvantageous genes we may not survive the next pandemic. I don't have the knowledge to predict whether deafness genes or some other property entangled with them will be advantageous 10000 years from now and neither do you. That's all.

You know the answer: it can be both ways depending on circumstances. * In the prehistoric world I think he was less likely to survive. The difference doesn't seem to be dramatic though since these genes were not eradicated from the population. * In the modern world the difference is close to zero with an unknown sign. Given that in developed countries probability to procreate seem to be limited by a desire to procreate, I can't rule out that e.g. deaf people for some reason have 0.1% more desire to have kids, or any other side-effect. So answer to your question is unknown, requires a study to figure this out. * In the future hearing can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on how the circumstances evolve. We see that species gain and loose senses depending on the environment. EDIT: I would also like to clarify this part: > Hereditary autoimmune diseases are not a sense, and are irrelevant to this discussion about whether hearing is an objective advantage or not. It's a human trait which was \"obviously good\" in the past and is \"obviously bad\" now. Hence I don't trust statements that other human traits like deafness are obviously good or bad. It's interesting to discuss but it's not granted. reply stahtops 11 hours agorootparentprevLet me help explain, some left handed people can hear and are not deaf. Objectively that is how deafness is not the same as being left-handed. reply alexey-salmin 11 hours agorootparentWell thank you, but the question is why one needs \"fixing\" and the other doesn't. Parent comment made an argument that being gay is like being left-handed so it doesn't need \"fixing\". That's fine with me, but I don't see how the same logic doesn't apply to deafness. Many deaf people enjoy their life as it is and don't welcome your attempts to \"fix\" them. reply stahtops 11 hours agorootparentI didn’t attempt to “fix” anyone. Everyone has to do that themselves.

The question, once again, was different: should the hereditary deafness be eradicated in childhood by gene therapy once advances of medicine allow that? reply glenstein 8 hours agorootparentI think you changed the question and escalated the severity of the proposal so it became easier to knock down as a straw man. Originally this was about the desirability and capability of enabling deaf people to hear writ large. But now you are framing it as full scale eradication carried out in a way that bypasses consent. reply alexey-salmin 7 hours agorootparentI'm not, please read the whole discussion. The root of this thread referenced the cochlear implant which produces best results when implanted at a very young age (staring from 9 months) obviously without consent of the patient. Other author replied that: > The weird thing that we should not strive to fix human defects when they are truly defects is astounding. All my comments are essentially stating the disagreement (or rather lack of agreement) with this point of view. It declares being deaf as a \"true defect\" that we should \"strive to fix\". In the context of the gene therapy now available, I understand this means that a deaf-born children should be \"fixed\" to remove this \"defect\". This vision is not crazy, but it doesn't strike me as universally true either. reply devilbunny 17 hours agoparentprevThere is a fascinating documentary about this, but I cannot recall its name.

I think a deaf person should be entitled to decline a low-risk treatment that would cure or mitigate their own deafness -- but to make that decision for a child is altogether different. Deliberately restricting a human being's sense experience throughout their lives should be considered child abuse, in the same basket as female genital mutilation. It's also about the most selfish thing I can imagine -- especially given that there's no reason I can see why a hearing child of deaf parents can't grow up \"bilingual\", learning both spoken and sign languages. reply brenns10 13 hours agorootparentThis presupposes an awful lot. If it were truly a risk free magic wand you could wave, then I could see your point. But none of the current options are risk free, and I doubt this one will be. They all have risks, side effects, and probably the chance of failure. And then the question is how low of a risk is acceptable to restore a child's hearing. These are people who would live an otherwise healthy and normal life, and they'd grow up in an accepting deaf family which is likely already plugged into a community. I can't imagine how it would feel to have a serious side effect (or worse) impact your child when you know they could have gone without that procedure and lived a happy, fulfilling life. But I also understand the desire to give your child every possible opportunity. All of that is to say, I think it is reductive to compare this to child abuse or FGM.

At the same time, for many who are eligible for cochlear implants, getting that early before speech development begins in earnest is very important, ideally when they're just a toddler or younger. Early enough and you'll barely notice any difference in their speech, understanding, etc. However, their parents often decline it and say they want to let their child be the one to choose when they're old enough to- which is far, far outside the best window for developing that area of the brain, as well as speech. They might be behind in those ways for the rest of their lives if they're not given therapy to help catch up.

    "originBody": "piku, inspired by dokku, allows you do git push deployments to your own servers, no matter how small they are. Demo Documentation: InstallUsingProcfileENVExamplesRoadmapContributingLinuxConf TalkFast Web App TutorialDiscussion Forum Install TL;DR: curl https://piku.github.io/getsh There are also other installation methods available, including cloud-init and manual installation. Project Activity piku is considered STABLE. It is actively maintained, but \"actively\" here means the feature set is pretty much done, so it is only updated when new language runtimes are added or reproducible bugs crop up. It currently requires Python 3.7 or above, since even though 3.8+ is now the baseline Python 3 version in Ubuntu LTS 20.04 and Debian 11 has already moved on to 3.9, there are no substantial differences between those versions. Motivation We wanted an Heroku/CloudFoundry-like way to deploy stuff on a few ARM boards, but since dokku didn't work on ARM at the time and even docker can be overkill sometimes, a simpler solution was needed. piku is currently able to deploy, manage and independently scale multiple applications per host on both ARM and Intel architectures, and works on any cloud provider (as well as bare metal) that can run Python, nginx and uwsgi. Workflow piku supports a Heroku-like workflow: Create a git SSH remote pointing to your piku server with the app name as repo name: git remote add piku piku@yourserver:appname. Push your code: git push piku master (or if you want to push a different branch than the current one use git push piku release-branch-name). piku determines the runtime and installs the dependencies for your app (building whatever's required). For Python, it segregates each app's dependencies into a virtualenv. For Go, it defines a separate GOPATH for each app. For Node, it installs whatever is in package.json into node_modules. For Java, it builds your app depending on either pom.xml or build.gradle file. For Clojure, it can use either leiningen or the Clojure CLI and a deps.edn file. For Ruby, it does bundle install of your gems in an isolated folder. It then looks at a Procfile and starts the relevant workers using uwsgi as a generic process manager. You can optionally also specify a release worker which is run once when the app is deployed. You can then remotely change application settings (config:set) or scale up/down worker processes (ps:scale). You can also bake application and nginx settings into an ENV file. You can also deploy a gh-pages style static site using a static worker type, with the root path as the argument, and run a release task to do some processing on the server after git push. Virtual Hosts and SSL piku has full virtual host support - i.e., you can host multiple apps on the same VPS and use DNS aliases to access them via different hostnames. piku will also set up either a private certificate or obtain one via Let's Encrypt to enable SSL. If you are on a LAN and are accessing piku from macOS/iOS/Linux clients, you can try using piku/avahi-aliases to announce different hosts for the same IP address via Avahi/mDNS/Bonjour. Caching and Static Paths Besides static sites, piku also supports directly mapping specific URL prefixes to filesystem paths (to serve static assets) or caching back-end responses (to remove load from applications). These features are configured by setting appropriate values in the ENV file. Supported Platforms piku is intended to work in any POSIX-like environment where you have Python, nginx, uwsgi and SSH: it has been deployed on Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin and the Windows Subsystem for Linux. As a baseline, it began its development on an original 256MB Rasbperry Pi Model B, and still runs reliably on it. But its main use is as a micro-PaaS to run applications on cloud servers with both Intel and ARM CPUs, with Debian and Ubuntu Linux as target platforms. Supported Runtimes piku currently supports apps written in Python, Node, Clojure, Java and a few other languages (like Go) in the works. But as a general rule, if it can be invoked from a shell, it can be run inside piku. Core values Run on low end devices. Accessible to hobbyists and K-12 schools. ~1500 lines readable code. Functional code style. Few (single?) dependencies 12 factor app. Simplify user experience. Cover 80% of common use cases. Sensible defaults for all features. Leverage distro packages in Raspbian/Debian/Ubuntu (Alpine and RHEL support is WIP) Leverage standard tooling (git, ssh, uwsgi, nginx). Preserve backwards compatibility where possible",

    "commentBody": "Piku: Allows git push deployments to your own servers (github.com/piku)440 points by tosh 11 hours agohidepastfavorite115 comments pixelmonkey 7 hours agoI love piku. I wrote a webapp tutorial for piku which got turned into a repo as part of the official GitHub piku org. You can find that here: https://github.com/piku/webapp-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#b... It explains how piku works under the hood, as well as showing a minimalistic Python web app example from a user standpoint. reply yodon 3 hours agoparentThe new piku docs are pretty but, as a potential new user very interested in trying piku, the new docs are completely useless to me. I gave up on piku because the docs essentially assume I already know everything I need to know to run and use piku. Your doc fixes that, but I never found your doc even after spending quite a bit of time trying to figure out how and whether I could use piku. I never would have known it existed without your comment here. At a minimum, your doc should be prominently linked to from both the piku repo and the piku docs (or more prominently linked, if it's already linked somewhere), if not pulled completely into the docs home page. That said, if you're interested in a suggestion, take a look at an end-to-end coolio tutorial that shows how to go from new bare metal server to publicly accessible custom domain name with SSL cert, and add the extra steps to your doc (even though yes, they have nothing directly to do with piku, because they have everything to do with what a potential new user actually wants to do and the potential new user doesn't know how to do those steps yet even though you do). Your doc is already hundreds of times more useful than the main piku docs page. Extending your doc to cover an example of how to get to exposing a publicly accessible custom domain with SSL cert would make your doc hundreds of times more useful than it is now. Yes, I know, there are a ton of ways to get from where your doc ends to a publicly available custom domain with SSL cert. Pick one. It doesn't matter what you pick. The person who cares which approach you use already knows how to do the approach they prefer. You're adding these steps for the person who doesn't know how to do any of the anpproaches and just wants to get to their site hosted on a $5 droplet or whatever. Again, your page is a huge help, this suggestion is just about making your page a huger help. For reference, here's a sample coolio end-to-end example showing how they go from bare metal to publicly accessible custom domain with SSL: https://billyle.dev/posts/self-hosting-your-website-with-coo... The goal of all this isn't about making it possible to do things, it's about massively increasing the number of people who adopt piku by making it easier for more people to do so. reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentAcknowledged. The tutorial is linked someplace deeper in the docs, but I am adding a direct link to it in the docs home page. Should be up in a little while. reply rc_kas 7 hours agoparentprev\"What is a Heroku-style deploy?\" thanks for that. I have no idea what heroku is or does. reply jslakro 1 hour agorootparentBasically it was the first PaaS to improve the developer experience when working with server infrastructure. It had git integration and allowed to scale easily your apps from a CLI reply pixelmonkey 6 hours agorootparentprevSure thing! Bit of cloud computing history. Covered a bit here: https://leerob.io/blog/heroku reply sesm 4 hours agoparentprevThanks for the explanation, official repo doesn't make it clear enough for me. So, did I understand correctly, that Pico installs both an agent on the remote machine and a commit hook on the local machine? Why didn't they minimize the overhead by just making the remote machine a Git remote and do all the work there when you push a specific branch to that remote? reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentYou’re confusing things, there is only the remote, the local machine doesn’t need anything. We do have a simple CLI you can run locally, but all it does is ssh remoteto scale up/down workers, change settings, etc. reply sesm 3 hours agorootparentThanks for clarifying! reply pixelmonkey 4 hours agorootparentprevpiku installs an agent on the remote machine (piku.py) which itself also provides the support for making that machine a git remote. There is no commit hook on the local machine. On the local machine, you simply have a shim named \"piku\" which is essentially running \"ssh remote /path/to/piku.py $@\" to control the remote machine. reply sesm 3 hours agorootparentThanks for clarifying! reply rcarmo 1 hour agoparentprevThis is now linked from the docs home page. reply p-o 6 hours agoprevFirst time I read about piku. I have no idea why, but the feeling of `git push` to initiate a deployment like piku does always felt magical to me. There's nothing simpler than that. This is timely for me as well as I just open sourced (yesterday!) a project that is in the same space, but for Kubernetes (https://github.com/pier-oliviert/sequencer). All of this to say, congrats! It looks great. reply myaccountonhn 5 hours agoparentIt works like magic, but it's also extremely simple to DIY if you wanna learn. If you set up a server, you can create a git repo by just doing `git init --bare`, add the setting `git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead`. After that you can use git hooks (more specifically push-to-checkout hook), to receive uploads, compile and launch. The hook will just be a simple shell script, the most basic version could be a variant of `compile && install && systemctl restart service`. From there you'll be able to copy the repo locally and pushing your changes will now trigger the hook you've setup. git clone root@yourserver.com:/path/to/git/folder reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentYou just described Piku, except that it’s a Python script that also sets up nginx and a process supervisor for your code :) reply myaccountonhn 4 hours agorootparentYeah I love the simplicity of Piku, being able to actually understand what is happening behind the scenes is a great quality. :) reply tasuki 2 hours agorootparentprevI've been doing almost exactly this. Have set up Ansible to automate it. Why would I want to use Piku? Would it give me some benefits I currently don't have? reply CaptainOfCoit 5 hours agoparentprevMaybe I'm missing something obvious, but how does sequencer use git to do deploys, if it's similar to Heroku/dokku/piku? Seems like you're dealing with kubernetes templates and kubectl rather than `git push` to deploy, which would put the project is a completely difference space. reply stavros 10 hours agoprevThis looks good, and Dokku has been very solid for me, but removing the Docker dependency means that now I'm beholden to my OS's choices. For apps that might run for years without maintenance, that's not ideal, as you'll quickly find you need a specific version of the OS for them. reply tym0 9 hours agoparentA different niche than Piku but I will give Dokku another vote. I've upgraded my dokku install over 3-4 Ubuntu LTS so far and it's been problem free for my use case of hosting little side projects on a VPS. reply Sammi 6 hours agoparentprevSometimes docker is overkill and I'm so glad something exists that doesn't require it. reply yard2010 3 hours agoparentprevQuestion - how can dependency hell be solved when using such a tool? It seems so elegant and I love the \"it just works\" attitude, and I do understand that docker can't be used everywhere due to its technical (and mental) overhead, but I love it because it allows to isolate everything, freeze everything in time so running a container 5 years for now \"just works\". In my humble workflow, I'm using lazydocker to manage the containers, gitlab workflow (action?) for deployment on push and a small VPS to build and push the containers to gitlab registry and to run it, on the same VPS. It's a little bit overkill - I could use a combination of a Dockerfile and a compose.yml with docker compose build. Also, I didn't figure out scaling yet. Good thing I don't need it! Otherwise I would swap docker for k8s and lazydocker for k9s. (I'm open to suggestions. I just got into devops, and I love it!) reply myaccountonhn 2 hours agorootparentPersonally I use the same approach to piku, but instead rebuild my Nixos config on push. My projects use nix flakes, so I get both something that I know will run on my server and on my local machine with the full development environment. No containers needed technically, but I use systemd nspawn to run the software in its own sandboxed namespace. My entire server is then managed declaratively, so if I want to add a new project, it’s like 3-5 lines of Nginx config and push, that’s all. Something goes wrong? Just revert the commit. reply ku1ik 51 minutes agorootparentThis sounds super interesting! Do you have an example of such a config somewhere, that you can share? reply myaccountonhn 25 minutes agorootparentI did a write-up of setting up nixos with git deploys here: https://mccd.space/posts/git-to-deploy/. As far as the nixos config is concerned, there is nothing crazy in it. It is just a regular nix config with nginx (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nginx). You can see there that adding nginx is just four lines of code, ~eight with ssl. Use it to proxy to your applications, that are setup as systemd services (https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Systemd/User_Services). Edit: btw I'm a big fan of asciinema! ty for making it. :) reply rcarmo 9 hours agoparentprevYou can use docker with it - I have a couple of things with \"docker run\" statements in the procfile, but of course it’s not designed for that. Most of the deployments I got wind of are on extremely stable distros - typically LTS versions where you will not need to upgrade your runtime every six months (and my website has been running in it for at least two Ubuntu LTS releases…) But you can trivially use pyenv/nvenv/etc. by just setting environment variables. My home automation system now needs two different Node versions, and I have one set per app. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentOh yes, I definitely use LTS distros, but my longest-running apps are from 2008, so even LTS won't cover that. reply layer8 8 hours agorootparentThat depends on your tech stack. I have Perl CGI and Java apps that have been running unchanged for two decades. And the only thing I ever had to change on Debian over that time was adding HTTPS (Let's Encrypt) and SPF/DMARC for email. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentYeah, but my point is that you have to upgrade your OS. If you never change anything, obviously you don't need to worry. reply layer8 6 hours agorootparentMy point is that OS upgrades don’t have to break tech stacks, and don’t tend to with runtimes that care a lot about backwards compatibility like Perl and Java. I did regularly upgrade Debian across those two decades. IMO that quality should be the default, and I would choose my OS and tech stacks accordingly. reply stavros 6 hours agorootparentDon't they link against static libraries? How do they do that? reply layer8 5 hours agorootparentThe runtimes are part of the Linux distribution and get upgraded along with it (and receive continuous security updates along with it), while maintaining backwards compatibility for the application code (Perl scripts or Java bytecode). Tools like needrestart will notify when a process needs to be restarted to take advantage of the update. reply stavros 5 hours agorootparentAh, all your dependencies are in the language you're using? Some of mine use dependencies that are written in compiled languages. reply layer8 5 hours agorootparentNot necessarily, but they are part of the Linux distribution. reply stavros 5 hours agorootparentWell, I don't know about you, but my dependencies have often been built against a static library from a different version of the OS, so they wouldn't work on mine. reply keredson 4 hours agorootparentprevOS updates are important sometimes. Security and all... reply lathiat 8 hours agorootparentprevAt -some- point you actually need to update things. If you're using a 2008 docker container you have all manner of bugs and security issues. reply szundi 8 hours agorootparentBut at least the attack vectors are limited reply vault 6 hours agorootparentyes, limited to those that work 100%! reply kybernetikos 9 hours agoparentprevI use nix via jetify devbox. Maybe something like that could help here. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentNix would actually be fantastic for this, but I've never been able to get it to work (including with Devbox and a few other such solutions). I might try again, thank you. reply rcarmo 10 hours agoprevVery happy to see this here - check out our freshly revamped docs at https://piku.github.io/ reply pixelmonkey 7 hours agoparentThe new docs look great! reply stavros 10 hours agoparentprevIs this the successor to Dokku? I didn't know you had a second project. reply rcarmo 9 hours agorootparentNope, just took inspiration from it because I couldn’t run Docker on some of my targets. reply ewalk153 8 hours agoparentprevGreat to see the updated docs. reply cfiggers 6 hours agoprevThe initial commit was eight years ago?? I wish I had known about this project ~18 months ago. I was specifically looking for a way to have a Heroku-like dev experience deploying to my Raspberry Pi, and this looks like it's trying to be exactly that. reply vault 5 hours agoparentExactly. There's a visibility problem. I've just setup a new VPS with CapRover and never found any mention of piku in the hour I've spent checking for comparisons between \"Heroku-style self-hosted PaaS\" dokku, CapRover, coolify, and dokploy. reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentWe’ve been using it for a long time, yes, but doing Marketing for a 1500 LOC Python script felt a little overblown :) Still, Chris did a public presentation on it near the beginning (video’s in the docs) and other folk did similar things, so… reply rcarmo 4 hours agoprevMaintainer and co-author here. If you like simple, minimalist deployment tools, check out https://github.com/rcarmo/ground-init for a very much down to earth take on cloud-init… reply tiffanyh 5 hours agoprevWith PHP, 1-line (no new tools): sftp user@host remoteFile localFile Joking aside, I’m a bit surprised such a tool would be developed in Python given its dependency’s and runtime (which is not easy on the user). reply rcarmo 4 hours agoparentTo be honest, Python made it stupendously simpler than anything else because it has a great standard library. The only dependency (click) is rock solid and made it a lot simpler to handle commands independently, but we could probably do without it and just use the built-in argparse—-but at the expense of a few more lines of code I didn’t want to maintain. Also, Python is everywhere, on every OS and Linux system, so it was a natural choice. I also wanted it to be easily hackable and extensible, and few languages would make it simpler to understand or extend. reply mlhpdx 4 hours agorootparentThat’s pretty funny. You may want to look a little further field to discover that the machines with Python are far from “all the machines” out there. Particularly production servers, which, if they run responsibly, are hardened with every extraneous bit of software removed. reply jteppinette 3 hours agorootparentI developed security software in Python that ran on 100k+ production nodes covering dozens of operating systems. They all had Python. reply hamandcheese 2 hours agorootparentCounter-anecdote: none of my Linux PCs have python. reply BbzzbB 45 minutes agorootparentDebian comes prepackaged with Python. If there are distros that are good enough for a server almost out of the box, surely Debian stable is one. reply jteppinette 1 hour agorootparentprevCounter-counter-anecdote: my toaster has python. reply pixelmonkey 4 hours agoparentprevIt's actually worth taking your joke seriously to compare and contrast: - piku deploys via git rather than scp/sftp, but authenticates via ssh like those tools - piku supports a number of runtimes, including Python, Ruby, Node, Go, Clojure. The runtimes are implemented rather simply, you can add your own rather easily, see examples here in the code: https://github.com/piku/piku/blob/8777cc093a062c67d3bead9a5d... - For each runtime, a mechanism is utilized to install and isolate package dependencies (requirements.txt in Python, Gemfile in Ruby, packages.json in Node, etc.) - a Procfile and ENV file are used to declare your application entrypoints and envvars akin to Heroku / 12 Factor App ideas - a CLI (ssh shim on dev client machine) is provided for checking status and logs from the client (as well as stop/start/restart) - since all applications are managed via uwsgi on the remote, there is also support for worker/sidecar processes and cronjob-style scheduled tasks - HTTPS via Let's Encrypt (acme.sh) is handled automagically for web apps I describe more about how piku works in this tutorial: https://github.com/piku/webapp-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#b... You're right that PHP apps have a simple deployment story, and in a way piku brings something akin to this level of simplicity to other web programming runtimes. reply dakiol 8 hours agoprevDoes someone know how it handles (if any) zero downtime deployments? Like, if your Python service is running in one machine on port 8080 behind nginx, how does piku switch to a fresh instance running in the same port? reply rcarmo 7 hours agoparentCurrently it will only kill running processes after it finishes deploying the new git push. Socket and session handling will vary depending on your code and whether you use uwsgi or run your own HTTP daemon. One thing it already does (optionally) is to kill off unused instances and idle, lazily starting them when a new connection comes in. reply mrweasel 3 hours agoparentprevSlightly off-topic, but you can do zero downtime deployments using systemd and socket activation. reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentThat gives me a couple of ideas...But picking a shorter name than \"piku\" is going to be hard... Maybe I can whip up a proof of concept and call it \"syd\". reply nico 2 hours agoprevCan it be a good replacement for Capistrano (for deploying rails applications)? Love the focus on being lightweight Recently I wanted to create a super basic website, and discovered it’s actually pretty hard to create something simple And then, even if you manage to create something actually simple, you usually end up having to manage some not so simple deployment process together with hopefully some sort of version control Ended up settling for putting plain html/css/js files in a git repo, then configuring auto deploy to GitHub Pages on merge to master (via Actions) reply mati365 49 minutes agoparentUse Podman Quadlet, I use it as replacement reply juliushuijnk 2 hours agoparentprevAlso an option, if it's just for you and with not too many updates, you can upload the new files to ftp as a manual step. reply nico 50 minutes agorootparentDoes GitHub pages support ftp? Or are you talking about some other potential hosting options? Yes, ftp is pretty easy for static sites. However, given I want to have version control, it’s nice to have automated deploys happen after a git push reply isoprophlex 6 hours agoprevThat is brilliant. Something complex, but not complicated. A project distilled down to its UNIX essence: hackable, lean, and magic. That said I want to give this a go but don't immediately see how I can migrate my overengineered 8-10 container spaghetti of a docker-compose file to a state where I can use piku instead of manual 'git pull && docker compose up' on the remote reply rcarmo 4 hours agoparentThat kind of situation was what drove me to go simpler :) reply isoprophlex 3 hours agorootparentYes it's me, not you ;) Currently hyping myself up to drastically simplify everything, which will be a joy onto itself reply zeroq 5 hours agoprev15 years ago it was common to deploy web applications as live SVN repositories with a hidden path executing 'svn update' on manual http request. Not quite the 'push deploy', but that was the way apps were developed back in the days, and for some reason I still prefer that approach. Commit, test, and at one point manually nominate and deploy stable version. reply eastbound 5 hours agoparentYes, when we didn’t want a build machine, we’d just build in production. Isolating production with no unauthorized binary (like Alpine) was a long path away… reply mati365 9 hours agoprevIsn't it better to create local docker repository and then use Podman Quadlet with autopull images to run apps? reply rcarmo 7 hours agoparentYou can’t do that on tiny systems very easily. reply pacifika 9 hours agoparentprevBetter in what way? reply mati365 9 hours agorootparent1. Less dependencies (only Podman and registry is needed) 2. Rock solid rootless systemd service management 3. Easy integration with systemd-proxyd 4. Easy manage dependencies between containers (with healthchecks) 5. Rollbacks reply GordonS 9 hours agorootparentSounds interesting! Is there any support for multi-node systems? Let's say I want to have an ingress Caddy proxy on one node, which reverse proxies to several backed APIs on other nodes - can this be done simply with Podman Quadlet? Also, what is the localdev UX like? With Docker Swarm I can easily run very similar setups in dev, test and prod, and it works with multi-node setups, has support for secrets etc. But the lack of work going into Docker Swarm becomes more concerning as the years pass by. Also, had no idea systemd-proxy was a thing - is there anything systemd doesn't have its tentacles into? :) reply mati365 8 hours agorootparentIf your VPS is wired with another one using VPC or any other internal network it'll just work. Just point Caddy to specified internal IPs of your other servers. It's not designed to work on local envs. When I wanted to debug infra I used to run it on Vagrant though reply altairprime 2 hours agorootparentprevDoes this all fit in 256MB of server RAM? reply ericaska 9 hours agoprevpikku means tiny or little in Finnish. Is it where the name came from? reply cuu508 9 hours agoparentI don't know but my first association was \"pico-dokku\" reply ewalk153 8 hours agorootparentMy guess has been they both originate from heroku; docker heroku to dokku, pico heroku to piku reply rvnx 8 hours agoparentprevCute, as in the sibling language, Estonian it means “big” or “tall” reply rcarmo 7 hours agoparentprevNope. https://piku.github.io/FAQ.html reply wayoverthecloud 3 hours agoprevHas anybody used this for Ruby on Rails? reply rcarmo 2 hours agoparentYes.

Looking at you sir mixalot: https://youtu.be/wKfMZOR8eWI?t=31 reply theanonymousone 9 hours agoprevNice work. But why isn't Docker supported as a runtime? Or is it? reply rcarmo 7 hours agoparentThe FAQ explains it: https://piku.github.io/FAQ.html You can use docker run commands, but that’s not the main goal. reply red_admiral 4 hours agoprevEventually, we'll need something more secure than effectively `sudo curl INSTALLERsh` as a way to install stuff. I can see why package managers aren't always the answer, but still. piku itself is neat and I like it. reply rcarmo 1 hour agoparentActually, we had manual install steps as the only way to go for a while. You'd be surprised at how many people asked for a one-liner... I'm going to add a note to the docs about that, since I've seen a couple of comments here of people who were put off by it and didn't even read the rest. I actually only install piku via cloud-init, but there are plenty more options: https://piku.github.io/install/index.html reply sneak 9 hours agoprevI think a more common use case than doing deploys by pushing to a different remote is to send git repo webhooks on PR merges to main to an API that has a deploy key and can fetch the repo itself. This afaik is missing from most PaaS tools (CapRover excluded, but it has been illegally relicensed to non-open-source). Perhaps watchtower or something could replace the functionality? reply rcarmo 7 hours agoparentActually, this is how I deploy my static websites: piku in lazy mode handles GitHub hooks, pulls the source and renders them out to cloud storage, then kills all workers and idles again. reply sneak 5 hours agorootparentDoes it support deploy keys, or are your website source repos public? reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentThe piku micro-app that does the deployment is just a 10-line Bottle app that validates the GitHub hook and does a git pull with a private SSH key, so yes. reply foxhop 5 hours agorootparentprevare there docs for this setup? reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentIt’s just a 10-line script, I’ll see if I can sanitize it and add to the docs (one of the samples already does something similar, you can peek at the repos to get ideas) reply adeptima 8 hours agoparentprevDidnt know ... \"CapRover has built in anonymous usage analytics starting v1.11\" https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/TERMS_AND_C... https://github.com/caprover/caprover/issues/1852 Was looking at CapRover to see if it has REST API Looks shaddy reply vault 5 hours agorootparentYou scared me for a moment, as I've just setup a new VPS with CapRover and migrated all my projects from heroku. Doesn't look too shady for me, there's a oneliner to disable analytics, it seems enough for me. reply sneak 4 hours agorootparentYou still have to agree to the terms and conditions of use of the nonfree application which can of course change at any time without notice. It’s a time bomb. I’m thinking of forking it and adding all his dumb and easy table stakes features (2fa etc) that he is trying to gate as subscriptionware. reply rcarmo 4 hours agorootparentIf you want to contribute any of that to piku, we’ll welcome it.

But now you're trusting two fewer places: - piku.github.io (the deployed version) - github.com/piku/piku.github.io (the source code that supposedly generates the deployed version) I'm not saying to do exactly these steps, and they are not perfect anyway (you're still trusting a `git clone` before even doing any kind of verification), but at least you're not YOLOing[1] without first doing some minimum verification of integrity before something is executed, so you know at least the first installation step has not been tampered with[2][3]. The git repos don't have commit signatures, and the verification doesn't have to use specifically those kind of signatures (could be a minisign public key hosted somewhere), but you get the point. The updates are also a `git pull`, meaning, if the commits were signed, and the installation copy-pasta (or script) included a step that added the author's public key to the allowed signers file (TOFU-style), e.g. with a `curl` to the author's GitHub's keys URL, then `git pull --verify-signatures` could check new commits against the already-known key, and automatically warn about any changes so the user could decide if trust the new key or not. Stuff like that. [1]: Nowadays, saying \"install with `curlsh`, but you can also do install these other ways\", is equivalent to saying \"verify integrity with `md5sum`, but you can also check this other file if you want to see other hashes\"; technically correct, but if the installation instructions already contain questionable defaults, it makes me question what other questionable defaults are in the actual code. [2]: \"Has not been tampered with\" as in \"the last modification of `README.md` and the most recent commit are signed with the same key\". Not perfect, but it's not YOLO. [3]: Emphasis on \"first installation step\". Obviously anything that happens after that simple sanity check would need more scrutiny in case the author tries to run unsigned/unverified code in one of the next steps. reply 1oooqooq 3 hours agorootparentprevthe script is irrelevant. it's the culture it attracts/creates when you start with this. and while i didn't look at the script for the reason above, i did look at the site and found no high level or architecture designs links. good luck basing, even your dev, infrastructure on things like this. reply rcarmo 4 hours agoparentprevThat is just one of the deployment methods.

This new study, published in Circulation Research, marks a potentially pivotal step in the fight against this debilitating condition. Dr. Alastair Webb, as Associate Professor at the Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia at Oxford University said: 'This is the first trial to show that sildenafil gets into the blood vessels in the brain in people with this condition, improving blood flow and how responsive these blood vessels are. These two key factors are associated with chronic damage to the small blood vessels in the brain, which is the commonest cause of vascular dementia. This demonstrates the potential of this well-tolerated, widely-available drug to prevent dementia, which needs testing in larger trials'. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform the treatment and prevention of vascular dementia, which currently lacks specific therapies. Chronic damage to the small blood vessels in the brain is not only the leading cause of vascular dementia but also contributes to 30% of strokes and 80% of brain bleeds. High blood pressure, reduced blood flow to the brain, and impaired blood vessel function exacerbate these conditions, making the findings of this trial particularly crucial. The OxHARP trial was a meticulously designed double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 75 participants who had experienced a minor stroke and showed signs of mild to moderate small vessel disease. Each participant received sildenafil, a placebo, and cilostazol (a similar drug) over three-week periods in a randomised order. The study employed cardiovascular physiology tests, ultrasound, and functional MRI scans to evaluate the drugs' effects. Key findings include: Sildenafil increased blood flow in both large and small brain vessels as measured by ultrasound and MRI scans. Sildenafil enhanced the blood flow response to carbon dioxide, indicating improved cerebrovascular function. Both sildenafil and cilostazol lowered blood vessel resistance in the brain. Sildenafil caused fewer side effects compared to cilostazol, particularly with less incidence of diarrhoea. Looking ahead, the next steps involve larger-scale trials to confirm these findings and explore sildenafil's potential in preventing vascular dementia on a broader scale. This research was generously funded by the Wellcome Trust and supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, with special thanks to all the partners and participants involved. Professor Peter Rothwell, Founding Director of the Wolfson Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia said: 'Professor Webb's findings are very encouraging and highlight the potential for preventing vascular dementia using existing drugs that target the underlying reduction in flow in the small blood vessels in the brain.'

They are not the same thing. Slightly off topic, but this is why I don't really trust these \"no tolerance\" claims. That claim is usually very specific, while people's understanding of \"tolerance\" is often quite a bit wider. I take 3 medications which each make \"no tolerance\" claims based on scientific studies. But my subjective experience is that all of them do build tolerance in some way - the subjective effect does wear off with time and taking a break does reduce the tolerance. One possible cause is mistaking the intended effect (ED) with side-effects (boner all day). reply zolbrek 7 hours agorootparentprevThe first time I took sildenafil I had a bad headache and nausea, the next couple of times I didn't suffer from nausea and the headache wasn't as severe. I don't suffer from any side effects now other than my nose getting a bit stuffy every now and then, so in that sense I developed a tolerance to the medication's side effects. The boner effects still work just as reliably as day one, no tolerance development for me there. reply rickydroll 4 hours agorootparentyou are lucky, in addition to the migraines and stuffy nose, sildenafil altered my vision making everything looked blue tinted.

Was news to me to read in a sibling that it also requires mental stimulation. I thought it was purely a physical inducement by the drug, as many drugs for other purposes induce a physical response without requiring mental effort. reply lukan 5 hours agorootparentMe too.

As someone with recent onset of ED taking viagra regularly, it’s been fantastic but it just makes me function like I should. It takes about an hour to take effect (usually less for me) and lasts a little over 4 hours with some lingering effects for several hours later, with diminishing effects towards the 4 and above hours. If I’m sexually stimulated during that time physically and or mentally, everything works like it should (erection). If during that time even when I would normally see peak effects around the 50 min to 90 min mark I’m driving or doing taxes or whatever non-sexually stimulating activity one might do, no erection at all. reply throwup238 4 hours agorootparentYou don’t get turned on by Schedule K-1 Form 1065? Nothing gets me hornier than correctly accounting for capital equipment depreciation. reply Traubenfuchs 12 hours agorootparentprevLong term PDE 5 treatment lowers estrogen and increases testosterone. As a consequence of that, and its cardiovasvular effects, it makes it easier for the body to turn fat into energy by fat-browning, to grow muscles and to lose fat. reply caycep 28 minutes agoparentprevyes, well, pulmonary hypertension reply Phoenix5869 17 hours agoparentprevYep. Originally developed for high blood pressure and angina, but in clinical trials was found to be more effective in treating ED than heart issues. reply 1oooqooq 3 hours agoparentprevthis is the case with almost all drugs. for example almost every antidepressants was the result of a weight loss or something like that. drug research is worse than training an LLM. you feed it to random people and then compare effects with initial conditions and of something looks good you try with more control. reply standardUser 15 hours agoparentprevWe don't know how many medications actually function. We put them inside of increasingly complex animals and study the results to see what they do (and hope they don't die). Botox was intended to treat muscle spasms. Powerful anti-depressants are regularly prescribed for pain from nerve damage in people with no mental health issues. And MDMA isn't prescribed for anything because the powers that be prematurely decided to ban it based on completely fabricated claims, which I assume is part of a massive hundred-year conspiracy to make sure people... keep dying from alcohol? Not totally sure about that last one, but it's hard to deny the facts. reply lebuffon 5 hours agoparentprevI know a former executive of the company that was developing this drug for cardiovascular problems.

It’s bloody loud :( reply hooverd 1 hour agorootparentIt can also be caused by SSRIs and NDRIs and benzos! Great side effect if you're already feeling depressed. Although benzos can also help, depending. I think 80% of cases are a brain thing and not an ear thing, but because ENTs and audiologists have exactly one hammer (hearing aids), we get fuck all for research. reply sva_ 18 hours agoprev> The OxHARP trial was a meticulously designed double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 75 participants who had experienced a minor stroke and showed signs of mild to moderate small vessel disease.

There are many reasons for ED, some of them in the brain, some of them in hormones. Viagra only helps with cardiovascular ones. reply grugagag 4 hours agorootparentI had a highly intelligent and good looking roommate with ED and it was devastating that at such a young age he couldnt’t maintian an erection even with viagra, cialis. I urged him to see a doctor and it turns out the ‘baloon’ down there that gets filled with blood also has a valve to keep the blood in. He had a misfunctioning valve and blood was leaking out and erection was soft. Sad story, as it seems to have had psychological effects on this person. Not sure it was much they could do at the time other than a manual pump fix. He did have a girlfriend though and they found other ways around it, though I heard she was cheating on him in search for a normal experience. reply spencerchubb 17 hours agoparentprevMaybe, but maybe not. If I told you I'm either giving you actual viagra or a placebo, you might get more aroused even if given placebo.

Also, extremelly stuffy nose, to the point where basically I need to breath by the mouth. And the red eyes, eyes as red as if had just smoke the biggest and strongest joint ever. Yes, I tried to use it recreationally a few times. It is not worth the pain for me. And then the dosage in the study: 50mg 3X times a day? I am not sure I could even survive the first day. Did I mention the headaches too? EDIT: Before someone asks... At least the on-label effect works really well in a recreational setting for me. But it is kind of funny to have persistent carbon-steel erections when you're feeling miserable with stomach pain and can't breath well. Doing oral sex with a stuffy nose is... interesting. reply talldatethrow 16 hours agoparentWere you taking authentic or internet genetics from China/India?

I think the Indian/Chinese ones are laced with garbage and what I feel depends on what else was in there. reply exodust 12 hours agorootparentThe one time I used it over a few weeks was a generic brand. The on-label effect worked, but I had one disturbing side effect: terrible nightmares. Unscientific conclusion, but the nights I took it when with my new gf at the time, nightmares followed. Binned the remaining pills, nightmares vanished. Possibly the generic additives factor, or maybe the drug itself. Who knows, never tried it again after that. reply Scoundreller 16 hours agoparentprevSildenafil is fairly short acting, so that’s probably the reason for 3x/day (but a better choice if you don’t need a whole day of effects because of its side effects like sinus congestion). Tadalafil (Cialis) would probably be a better choice, and is used at daily (but reduced) dosing for prostrate issues. reply vidarh 12 hours agoparentprevHaving tried it recreationally and also getting the stuffy nose, NSAIDs counter that effectively for me. Of course if you also get acute heartburn you want to be careful with combining it with something that can be tough on the stomach...

Certainly more work will be done in the future to try to replicate the results and figure out the one negative outcome. But until then, we cannot say that the evidence is in any way \"equal\" on both sides. reply zerocrates 16 hours agorootparentThe first one is just a combination of some computer modeling guessing at possibly useful existing drugs and a look at the existing patient data showing that people who were on these seemed to have Alzheimer's less. It's very clear that it's just an initial step that doesn't actually show there's a benefit. The second is more of that same basic kind of research, but weighing in the opposite direction: it showed no association with Alzheimer's for people with a specific other condition who got these drugs vs. ones with the same condition that didn't (also they did some cell culture testing outside the body that didn't show any effect/improvement). This new one is an actual double-blind study giving people the drug. Equally important, it's not claiming an effect on Alzheimer's, but vascular dementia, a different form of dementia that's directly related to blood flow and therefore to Viagra's known effects. Of course it's still just really a marker for future research on if this is broadly useful. reply engine_y 16 hours agorootparentprevMight be a 2:1 but we also have to take into account the level of evidence each study provides. reply HPsquared 8 hours agorootparentprevStudies aren't conducted at random, it's not really valid to sample them as though they were.

In fact, I would go as far to say that if you've been prescribed Viagra the only things you know about it are: it will help you get boners, you should talk to a doctor if you have a heart condition, and you should never use it more than once a day. The warning seemed extra ominous because it was basically the only warning, so I adhered to it fairly strictly at first. About a year later I talked to some gay male friends and they all said that was ridiculous, that they freely take it multiple times per day, and I that should too. So now I do (as needed) and it's worked very well. Plus, the subscription I get through Hims sends me a giant bottle of 20mg pills (at an unreasonably high cost) so I am able to easily dose myself instead of being given a one-size-fits-all dosage, like we get with most medications. My low dose is 3 pills and my high dose is 5 pills. Now there are many options beyond Viagra including a ton of intriguing combination drugs that use multiple erection drugs and/or other drugs with tangential effects. But I like that I know how Viagra works for me personally based on experience. I think we all underestimate how much drugs very from person to person. Plus, now that I think about the lack of warnings that come with Viagra, it actually seems like an unusually benign drug. reply UberFly 14 hours agoparentA typical dose of Viagra is 25,50 or 100 mg, so your 3-5 doses of 20 mg isn't even atypical.

I coincidentally even happen to take long hot baths frequently (3-4 times a week for an hour) as a form of stress relief, relaxation, and it further helps with muscle recovery. Absolutely none of that helps me to a notable degree with what the specific pill in question does which I also use regularly. In addition, viagra adds an additional say 4 hours per day per pill to my normal weekly routine of increased blood flow that may help reduce risk of dementia when I’m older.

There’s just better stuff to do than spend multiple years taking care of the baby. Any argument other than “for the greater good” won’t sound reasonable to educated population. Talking to my friends, especially women who already have a child, they keep mentioning the opportunity loss when you go through pregnancy and birth (career, vacations, personal growth and etc.). You can call it selfish, but it’s the reality and nobody wants to fall behind. Everything you mentioned is great, and I support it, but I doubt it’ll convince young people to sacrifice at the very minimum 6 years of their life (pregnancy + first year). reply hattmall 15 hours agorootparentAre people really saying they missed out on \"personal growth\" when they had kids? Taking care of kids is not that hard or much of a sacrifice really. It would be super easy if things were even more communal. There's just really not that much great stuff that you are missing out on after like 35/40+. In truth most of the stuff geared to people in that age range is designed for people with kids. I think a lot of people would prefer to have more than 2 kids. The major issue is that SO much stuff is designed for the family of four. Yeah there's 3rd row seating, but it's annoying. Furniture that comes in 2 packs, theme parks, restaurant tables, vacation accommodations, etc. Because of modern life and the things we are accustomed to the logistical management burden of more than two children is very significant. reply kredd 5 hours agorootparentNot 35+, think of mid/late 20s as it used to be about 20 years ago. Peak health, some disposable income, educated, but also good age to bear a child. If you start having children at 35-40, it’ll be harder for you to have 3+ children, but now for health reasons. Up here in Canada, according to statistics, only 20% of couples want to have 3+ children. If I recall it correctly, it’s not that they have it, but plan to, which might not even happen due to socioeconomic reasons. I don’t think majority of young people want to have 3 children though, as you mentioned. Even if I do an extremely unscientific look around in my circles, the number of couples who want that is 0. I obviously might be in a bubble, but it’s a fairly common sentiment especially for my age group. reply Engineering-MD 10 hours agorootparentprevFor me having kids has been massive personal growth. In some ways having kids is synergistic with many of life’s goals and personal growth. Career, less so, but I can a more capable human for being a parent. reply kredd 5 hours agorootparentYou’re most likely right, but people achieve the same result with having one or two children as well. It’s having minimum of 3 children that is needed to have a population growth, and that’s sometimes a bad life choice for a young woman nowadays. Again, back to opportunity loss. It’s way easier for me to babble, because if I was a father I wouldn’t have to go through pregnancy period.

An iceberg wouldn’t float exactly like on this page in reality. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.

But you nailed it before I could swing my own hammer, to use a figure of speech. reply HarHarVeryFunny 2 hours agoparentprevMy mental model is of each side (think left/right in 2-D) of the iceberg competing with the other side to float to the surface by rotating the iceberg around it's center of gravity. The only stable positions are where these left/right rotational forces are balanced. If an iceberg is currently floating in a vertical orientation where more of it's mass to one side of it's center of gravity (bottom half) is underwater compared to the mass on the other side (top half), then it's going to tend to rotate until both sides are equally above water, so (depending on mass distribution) horizontal orientations are likely to win over vertical ones. Of course an iceberg could balance vertically, but that's like balancing a pencil on your finger - not the most stable, and any disturbance (such as the initial calving event) is likely to rotate it into a more stable horizontal orientation. reply furyofantares 8 minutes agoparentprevHexagons work reply WhitneyLand 2 hours agoparentprevTry something that has no flat surfaces.

Then, use your first attempt to correct for the correct height. ⇒ I think a good game would need some other constraint, maybe score more for max height above the surface, or for how long a polar bear can keep their feet dry while it melts (a very wide but not tall stripe will melt faster than something resembling a ball) reply sinuhe69 3 hours agoprevI got a design which wobbles infinitely! :D The clip was live recorded, not looped. https://streamable.com/0a9zmb reply Dunati 1 hour agoparentIt seems to have trouble with long skinny shapes, I had one that would keep moving and occasionally flip over reply joshdata 7 hours agoprevAuthor here.

The macro statistics are hiding the experience of being cheated. Matt Stoller Jun 08, 2024 284 Share this post Economic Termites Are Everywhere www.thebignewsletter.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 19 Share Today I want to start with a comment by a colleague, Texas antitrust lawyer Basel Musharbash, observing a restaurant trying to do a renovation in Dallas. “Something funky is happening in the building materials supply chain,” he wrote . “A 3,000 sq. ft. commercial space in a strip mall shouldn’t cost $720,000 to renovate into an Italian food joint.” He’s right. It shouldn’t. And yet it does. This attitude of ‘something is very wrong with our society’ is everywhere now. Corporate procurement officers just assume costs are going up, it’s in budget projections for the Defense Department, and we expect cost overruns on everything. ‘Inflation’ is now a catch-all for a basic view that stuff is just going to suck more and more. So what’s going on? Today’s piece is about a concept I am going to call ‘economic termites,’ which are instances of monopolization big enough to make investors a huge amount of money, but not noticeable enough for most of us. An individual termite isn’t big enough to matter, but the existence of a termite is extremely bad news, because it means there are others. Add enough of them up, and you get our modern economic experience. The concept of an economic termite is the cousin to Cory Doctorow’s ‘enshittification’ or Yves Smith’s ‘crapification,’ terms that describe how a platform gradually degrades the quality of its service as it gains market power and gets pushed to extract cash by financiers. Economic termites describes where these same forces get into the mostly unseen business foundations of our society and profiteer. These termites are in the infrastructure or guts of business, like recruiting services, construction equipment or software, the industrial gasses that go into chemicals and electronics, and so forth. It’s the stuff you don’t see that makes our world turn, there’s fortunes to be made, and bottlenecks to foster. They also explain a dynamic we all face, a profound wariness in our society, a sense that stuff just costs more and is more difficult, for no discernible reason. Added up, these end up sapping our faith in the American system, because they make what seem like simple problems become not just unsolvable, but not even capable of being diagnosed. In this issue, I’ll cover some of the companies you don’t realize are gnawing at the foundation of our society - Verisign, Autodesk, Linde, Assa Abloy, Gracenote, and LinkedIn. And yes, there are legal tools to address them. But first we have to realize that these bottlenecks are everywhere. We’ll start with a corporation I pay to host this newsletter. Verisign: The Most Profitable Company in the Stock Market A few months ago, Verisign - which is the government-designated monopolist that runs the registration of .com addresses - announced a price hike, from $9.59 per year for .com addresses to $10.26. If you’ve ever bought or renewed a website, Verisign has gotten some of your money. I have to pay this fee to register TheBigNewsletter.com domain name, every year. So does everyone else who has a domain name. An increase of less than a dollar a year is not a big deal. But over the decades, these price hikes have been routine. A few years ago, the price to renew a .com domain was $6 a year. Then $7. Then $8. Verisign has hiked prices every year, up to the maximum set by the government (until Trump removed the price cap altogether in 2018.) Today, Verisign is the single most profitable company in the stock market, a great example of an economic termite. In 2013, its operating margins were 54.7%, by 2023 they grew to a crazy 67.1%. Verisign doesn’t invest this money; in 2023, it spent $882 million of it on stock buybacks. Its expenses are basically running a simple database, its strategy is to hike prices just below what will be noticed, and its method is to have politically connected people like Clinton Justice Department official Jamie Gorelick - who is one of Merrick Garland’s good friends - on its board. Where did Verisign’s monopoly come from? Well, it was due to the last four administrations choosing to ‘privatize’ domain registration to a ‘multi-stakeholder group,’ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which has a deal with Verisign to allow it to maintain the monopoly. ICAAN could at any point put the contract out on domain management for bid, and you’d see corporations come in at $2/year, certainly much less than $10.26. But they haven’t ever done that. Their contract strikes me as unlawful, a straightforward agreement in ‘restraint of trade.’ Yet, Verisign has a weird agreement with U.S. government’s National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), which is widely perceived to provide the firm with legal cover for its clearly monopolistic behavior. In less than three months, the NTIA, which is run by former Google lobbyist Alan Davidson, has a choice of whether to renew its agreement with Verisign. I don’t know what Davidson will decide. He might not perceive it as worth his time to fight with this economic termite. But he should, because termites are a bad sign. Also, I want my money back! AutoDesk: Taking “Hostages” in Architecture Talk to anyone in architecture or engineering design for big construction projects, and it’s not hard to find complaints about software provider Autodesk, which sits in the computer aided design (CAD) space. “I have personally been bullied by Autodesk while CTO at a design firm using predatory practices that dictated pricing unlike any software contract I've negotiated in my 30 year career,” one BIG reader wrote me. “I continue to hear stories from all leaders in the industry with aspirations to create a sustainable, human centered built environment, but limited by pricing and poor quality of a single tool (Autodesk).” Autodesk is the classic economic termite. As one Wall Street analyst put it in praising the stock, “Like other software suites providing extensive support for customer workflows, ADSK's offerings can demand premium prices due to their prevailing market dominance. When juxtaposed with the overall expenses of a construction project, which might reach millions of dollars, the cost of these products remains relatively minor.” There are rivals in the market, but as another source noted, “The switching costs associated with CAD software are gargantuan, a reality incumbents leverage more or less mercilessly.” The result, he added, is that “there’s not all that much organic innovation in the past 25 years, but lots of steady growth.” Just going to Glassdoor, there are a large number of employee complaints consistent with a firm that has market power, mostly about poor leadership and constant reorganizations due to acquisitions, but extending to unethical sales practices and a few claims of fraud. In 2020, UK based architecture firms penned an open letter to Autodesk complaining about high prices and poor innovation, “censuring the Silicon Valley-based design software and services giant for the mounting ownership costs—an increase as much as 70 percent over a five-year span through the end of 2019—of its central BIM product, Revit.” The software, they argued, has “remained mostly stagnant and that firms dependent on the aging software (it’s now 20 years old) have been faced with, among other things, ever-changing licensing models, aggressive sales tactics in enterprise licensing, and a lack of understanding of the business dynamics within the industry that the company serves.” The likely reason for this market power is that Autodesk makes it hard to switch, both through technical means and aggressive sales tactics. As one customer said in the Autodesk forums from a few years ago, “The only feature request I’ll make is antitrust action against Autodesk.” Generative AI might change the dynamic in the industry, but if there isn’t antitrust action, it will be deployed poorly. Linde: Industrial Gasses In 2018, the second and third largest industrial gas companies, Linde and Praxair, combined to become the biggest firm in a very concentrated industry. Industrial gasses are chemicals, like oxygen, nitrogen and argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and specialty gases, that go into a ‘countless’ number of products, from MRI machines to frozen fish to semiconductors to steel to carbon capture and renewable energy. The Biden Inflation Reduction Act has supercharged the industry. The merger was a controversial deal within the government, with the Trump Federal Trade Commission blessing the deal, though requiring the new firm to sell off some assets to a private equity joint venture. (FTC Commission Chopra dissented and opposed the merger.) Immediately after the combination with Praxair, Linde announced substantial price hikes, and it has continued to increase prices ever since. In the last quarter of 2023, for instance, according to Linde’s investment documents, its sales in the U.S. grew by 6%, “driven by 5% higher pricing and 1% volumes.” And the root of its pricing power isn’t hidden; in 2022, its 10% boost in profit was, according to the corporation’s annual report, “primarily due to higher pricing… driven by merger related assets.” Operating margins went from about 10% in 2019 to 16% in 2022 to 27.6% in 2023. In 2023, the company paid out 50% more to investors than it invested into the business. Today, the industry is a lot like Verisign, on a larger scale. Industrial gases are essential to customers, but also an afterthought, because they are usually a small percentage of the customer’s cost. No one really cares if there are price hikes, as long as the gases are delivered. It’s also hard to switch, distribution is a bottleneck, and long-term supply contracts are common. The result, for Linde, is high operating margins, low investment, and lots of dividends and buybacks. There are a few other big companies in the market, like Air Liquide, but the merger cut price competition substantially. Last year, Linde fortified its position in distribution, buying one of the biggest packaged gas distributors in America, nexAir. And its executives have announced they are looking for ‘tuck-in’ acquisitions, meaning they want to keep buying mid-market firms as a consolidation play. Unless you are buried in a supply chain somewhere, most people will never hear about the industrial gas price increase. But as with Verisign, a few pennies are coming out of your pocket every day because of this economic termite. Swedish Predators: Assa Abloy Swedish conglomerate Assa Abloy makes locks and smart locks that go into a large percentage of residential and commercial buildings. As with gases, locks are a small percentage of the cost of a building or house, so this industry is about power in distribution. Like many corporations with market power, Assa Abloy is a roll-up, having bought over 300 firms in the last 27 years. In 2023, it engineered a significant merger, to buy out Spectrum Brands’ industry-leading Kwikset line of business, and sell its own third place Yale and August business line to a new weaker firm called Fortune Brands. The Antitrust Division challenged the merger of the Kwikset brand, but Judge Ana Reyes forced a settlement to allow the merger to go through. Smart locks had been a competitive industry; from 2019, smart lock output nearly doubled, and prices dropped by 9%. That era seems to have ended with the merger. Assa Abloy raised prices in December, January, and February, and its main competitor, Fortune Brands, did as well. There are also complaints in the industry about increasingly coercive behavior. Here’s a story of a new innovative producer whose business was simply… turned off by the incumbents. As most of my connections, friends, and family know. I have been building a business called DailyAdventureBox since 2019. The business is a self-automated rental locker for outdoor sporting equipment, beach equipment, and camping equipment. We are or should I say, we were, on the verge of extreme success with multi-state operations with major hotels like Hilton Hotels & Resorts, IHG Hotels & Resorts, and Fairfield by Marriott. Sadly, my business is being forced into bankruptcy because of two multi-billion-dollar corporations not honoring their agreements..... ASSA ABLOY Group and Fortune Brands Innovations have destroyed my business and are not taking ownership of their wrongdoing. Long story short they agreed to partner with my company, they had us design our IOS/Android app to their code, and I developed my lockers around one of their smart lock products. After spending over $500,000 into the partnership, they decided to pull support. Causing my app to crash and all of my locations to be uninstalled. Now we are not operational and are at risk of forced failure for NO REASON. They believe that because I am a startup company, I cannot fight back. A bit of coercion leads to no innovation, and then a few pennies drawn from the pocket of every homebuyer, landlord, and renter out there… Entertainment Data: Gracenote In 2016, Nielson’s acquired a corporation called Gracenote for $560 million, which provides metadata for movie, music and TV listings for use in user interfaces on cable, satellite, streaming services, automobiles, hotels, and hardware. As of 2021, Gracenote was widely deployed throughout the industry, not just in most TV interfaces but in 250 million in-car entertainment systems. The rumors are Gracenote has 60% of the market. Gracenote seems to have provisions that prevent the use of multiple databases or combining its data with outside vendors to improve the service. “Gracenote will only license if we drop all the other databases, they will not allow to be combined with others,” wrote one person complaining on a forum. “The results from four databases are much better than one.” Here’s a contract from 2019, and the word ‘outside’ seems to be the mechanism by which Gracenote exerts power. Many of the customers for the data also make content that needs to be ‘datafied,’ there are a lot of conflicts of interest embedded in the market. And because data is woven into an organization’s fabric, switching costs are quite high. The restrictions on the use of data make moving gradually to another provider of data almost impossible, and prevent the use of different forms of data to make discovery of content better and cheaper. I can’t find pricing information, but since Nielson’s is now owned by private equity/hedge fund Elliot Management, I suspect they aren’t shy about taking advantage of market power. Another dime out of every viewer’s pocket. LinkedIn: Beyond Super Positive Corporate Blog Posts Over the years, professional recruiters have been telling me about increasingly worse terms offered by LinkedIn. What’s the problem? Is LinkedIn really a monopoly? Well maybe not from a consumer’s perspective. But from the perspective of recruiting firms? That case is more compelling. “LinkedIn is the only dominant social professional network, with ~1 billion public resumés,” I was told. “They have no true competitors in ‘sourcing software’ for recruiters searching to attract passive job candidates for most all veins of corporate work.” There’s also direct evidence of market power. Earlier this year, LinkedIn imposed a 174% price increase on its customers, who are professional recruiters that scour the database for potential hiring. And I looked into it, and yes, this one looks like a market power story. In fact, Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a big political donor, wrote a book called “Blitzscaling” in which he discussed the importance of getting big before anyone else. He used that recipe to build LinkedIn, the largest professional social media network, before selling it to Microsoft in 2017 for $26 billion. (Microsoft also owns GitHub, which is the other key place to source mid-career technical talent.) There are a number of mechanisms LinkedIn uses to maintain its monopoly. The key is, as Google and Amazon do in their areas of network dominance, to deny scale to potential rivals. While most people think a LinkedIn profile is a public facing resume, in fact, Microsoft fiercely controls who can access that data in bulk, litigating to deny the use of LinkedIn profiles to potential rivals, except for certain companies, “such as Google,” which are whitelisted. Why would Google be allowed to search LinkedIn profiles? I’m guessing there’s a market allocation agreement. After all, it would seem pretty trivial for Google to launch a rival product, but it hasn’t. Thousands of small agencies rely on LinkedIn, and have been gradually driven out of business as Microsoft, its owner, generates more revenue. These make it slightly more expensive to hire, an indirect tiny cost borne by everyone in the economy. I could on, and I eventually will. (For instance, Waste Management is an obvious termite.) But you get the point. Small hidden tollbooths everywhere eventually foster economic tyranny. Now of course it’s not all hidden. There are big monopolies in our economy. Live Nation/Ticketmaster, for instance, is likely responsible for big price increases in live entertainment, and UnitedHealth Group is driving up prices in health insurance. Oil price-fixing, rent price-fixing, and meat price-fixing are each individually a big deal. But the aggregate cost increases we’re seeing in random areas often can’t be traced to one big villain. But they can be traced to many small ones. Where did these economic termites come from? We decided four and a half decades ago that monopolies were good. After 1998, the Antitrust Division stopped bringing monopolization cases, and in 2005, the Supreme Court unanimously endorsed monopolization as foundational to the health of American economy. After twenty years of not bringing cases, business executives realized the best way to run a business was to create a tollbooth in some mostly unnoticed part of society. So now, each supply chain is made up of a bunch of different bottlenecks, too small to notice. That said, there are commonalities among these industries that make these problems easier to solve. Most of these firms use the tactic of building a network or standardizing a business on their platform, and then denying necessary scale to their rivals through technical, contractual, or business tactics. They often use exclusive contracts. They also often rely on expansive patent, copyright, or trademark claims, sometimes government sanctions for their market power. They are ‘capital light,’ usually in opposition to the new industrial policy goals of ‘bending metal.’ As the big antitrust claims work through the courts, and as government policy design moves away from supporting consolidation, trends in business will change. Executives will get worried about being sued. Rivals will start calling lawyers, class action attorneys will see more opportunity, journalists will write more stories, and judges will learn. It’s becoming easier to see analogies and bring private cases. And over time, we’ll start to once again see these kinds of monopolization techniques as we do other moral wrongs based on unfairly exploiting power. Thanks for reading!

    "commentBody": "Economic Termites Are Everywhere: stats hide the experience of being cheated (thebignewsletter.com)274 points by passwordoops 7 hours agohidepastfavorite237 comments spicyusername 5 hours agoI very much agree with the premise that economists unduly focus on a few metrics of dubious quality - labor force participation, personal consumption expenditures, market capitalization, wage growth, etc - and overfit them to construct a coherent narrative about the \"strength\" of the economy and what the experience of living in that economy must be like. There's a story right now being peddled by all the talking heads that the economy is \"great\", but consumers keep reporting feeling terrible, so consumers must not understand something. I think this goes the other way around. Our method for understanding the economy is flawed and is not properly capturing what all consumers know intuitively, things kind of suck, even when you have a job and even when you're still buying things. We need to start thinking about what information needs to be captured and how it needs to be reported to start making better sense of what's broken and how to fix it. reply Spooky23 4 hours agoparentThere are two Americas, the one that HN folks inhabit and the underclass. The former is doing great. The latter has grown and shifted. I grew up in a rural community that was in the process of unraveling from a prosperous farming and light industrial area to a rural slum. There are zero operational farms in that area today. The one I worked for as a teen was in continuous operation since the Dutch colonial period. That’s an example of why the nihilism of MAGA is so appealing. The world is collapsing around many people. These issues are caused by demographics and macro trends. The laws have changed to facilitate generational wealth transfer, and that process will change the way the economy works and further fuel unrest.

Some say that it hasn't been this bad in a decade.

And as a bonus, we get to sit comfortably in air-conditioned rooms and spend a good chunk of our day thinking about things we actually take some enjoyment from. None of this is true for the “underclass” mentioned above who have little to look forward to each day; the labor they provide is in various amounts boring/tedious/demeaning/physical, and doesn’t pay enough to give them the middle class lifestyle they feel entitled to (e.g. home ownership, healthcare, etc).

We already shovel in far more tax dollars maintaining infrastructure for a handful of remaining occupants even when the economic activity no longer justifies the spend. What further burden, exactly, do you think the rest of the world owes ex-rural communities that have deindustrialized like this? I’ve been to places like this around here, where mining towns have dried up and there’s only a few early-20th-century dams marking anything at all. You have to drive into unmarked, un-google-mappable state land through the fire roads (the kind of thing that gets people killed-by-GPS out west) to even get there etc, and there used to be a whole town there once for the mines. Serious/honest question, what does the broader public really owe that miner? America needs to have some hard talks about what to do in these (extremely frequent) situations, because infrastructure can’t be an indefinite commitment once the communities that sustain it wither and shrivel away. And it sucks for the handful of holdouts who don’t want to leave, but the community itself is really already dead. If there are 30 people who don't want to leave their homes, do we keep paving roads and delivering US mail and maintaining hundreds of miles of power lines for the 30 people who won't leave? That's maybe viable when it's a rare situation, but it's not, anymore - America is folding back inwards after over-expanding during the railroad and industrial eras. There are a lot of \"railroad towns\" where the trains no longer stop, so to speak. And once \"the mine dries up\", and those arteries stop pumping, people move on. What do we do about the ones who won't? Society is probably \"in the hole\" (net economic activity) to the tune of millions of dollars of infrastructure per resident, perhaps tens of millions in some cases, over their lifetime. A lot of these places literally have population density of sub-1-person-per-sq-mile, there are whole regions with sub-10. It's gauche to say it, but at the end of the day everyone knows there is a number when it's worth it and a number when it's not - just like statistical value of life. And at some point, if the taxpayer is kicking in tens of millions of dollars of artificial subsidy, it's becoming a lifestyle choice that we choose to subsidize. By all means offer them a great deal to buy their property and bulldoze it... but at the end of the day we can't keep paving roads onto mountains just because 10 people don't want to move. That is an economic termite right there - and they would use far less charitable terms to describe the situation, if the tables were reversed. I feel for people who have to leave their lives behind etc, but infrastructure isn't a suicide pact either. It's not a permanent, lifelong commitment even when the fundamentals on the ground totally change - and not everyone is a legacy homeowner to begin with. http://travelthemitten.com/landmarks/redridge-steel-dam-an-e... https://99wfmk.com/redridge-michigan/ > Nothing beside remains.

Obviously it's hardly a new idea; I'm sure that human nature being what it is, they had to deal with it in Mesopotamia. But it makes budgeting very difficult; I suppose it's like living in a corrupt country; you just have to add an overhead for bribes as part of day-to-day living.

Another possible rubric for this, a bit more sensationalized, would be \"destructive precision\". A simple example would be the hollowing-out of conventional terms everyone believes they hold the same settled definition of, such as \"a flight.\" Instead of transacting according to what consensus suggests \"a flight\" meant a decade or two ago, when most would have expected this term to have thoroughly matured to the point of semantic stability, instead delivering against the most contextually minimized, stripped down interpretation of the term possible that still qualifies as valid, and attaching fees to all of the other attendant associations of value that used to be included in the scope of general consensus of the term. reply SI_Rob 3 hours agorootparentSo, a pricing exploit based on arbitrage between the rigorous description (and enforcement) of payment for a service in one direction, and the comparatively un-policed description of the service delivered, in the other? Perhaps the lawyering class wants everyone to either suffer under their miserable penchant for overweening semantic nitpicking, or suffer it along with them. reply ChainOfFools 1 hour agorootparentA description versus price equation, where there's a lot of variables on one side and only one on the other, does seem to be the model. I guess I would add that it may only be a Salient as it is with respect to certain things like flights, because there are a couple of outstanding counter examples like cell phones and and automobiles which seem to exhibit the exact opposite trend. A deeper analysis might reveal that there is a cycle at at work here, wherein the initial novelty of a prodict or service which is destined to become a commodity, means there is not yet a strong set of expectations about what the service or product is \"supposed\" to provide. distinction in the market has to come from adding context to that essentially commodity utility. But later on some consumers begin to recognize that some of the additional context may not be strictly necessary or offer a value to them and would prefer compartmentalization of the core product as distinct from its value-added variants. When flights were a comparative novelty, or at least a novelty in different market segments at different times, distinction between products was through different levels and configurations of service or features rather than price. This may still be the phase of the product cycle that cell phones (setting aside the fairly stable tiers of product within that category) are in. It's harder to make as direct across the comparison with cars as they are older than both air travel and mobile phones, and because of all the regulation that enforces standardization of non-optional features related to safety. reply lotsofpulp 3 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, I recall paying roughly $100 per hour of one way flight time in the 2000s, and I still pay near $100, maybe $150 to $200 in peak season (including seat assignment and carry on luggage). reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentI don't love taking flights in general--and my goal moving forward is to reduce the number of flights relative to the amount of travel overall.

Taking a quick glance at the articles you linked shows the same behavior as those reporting on the economy - defining disingenuous targets so they can claim their headline is true. To tie this back to anecdotes, I think it comes down to trust. When my neighbor says they’re afraid to lose their job due to housing, food, childcare being a lot more expensive I dont see any motivated reasoning behind that statement. On the other end, economists (and all the articles you linked) have many incentives to distort the truth. On average anecdotes are going to come from a more truthful place - both because you trust the source and know their biases. [1] https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/2018...

But my point is that argues for too much trust in anecdotes and people’s perceptions. We all know memory is incredibly faulty, for instance. Yet people have a very high perception of their own memory’s accuracy. It’s kind of in the same vein. It’s not that people can’t remember things accurately, it’s that we need to start from a place of skepticism when depending on it. Same thing goes for people’s perceptions of crime, the economy, etc. Their anecdotes and lived experience, insofar as they can even accurately explain their lived experience, needs to be put into context re: its value for determining “reality.” That being said I would never undermine the value of how people feel. If people don’t feel safe, that is a bad thing too. And we can cite all the stats in the world we want but ultimately feeling unsafe is not a good thing and that perception needs to be addressed. reply fallingknife 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is actually a perfect example of Bezos being right on the money. You are measuring it wrong.

Only Vox seems to get it closer to correct (though still hung up on the violence thing): > One theory that came up again and again is that city residents and visitors are, to some extent, conflating actual violent crime with broader indications of urban disorder.

Or perhaps more strictly, the metrics that those groups put out that the media choose to report on. CPI isnt always the best metric and something like healthcare costs are better tracked in the PCE metric. So you get this situation where CPI says \"not bad, boys\" and the consumers have a wildly different point of view. For labor participation, full employment is not great if everyone is working crappy jobs. I dont know if there are better metrics buried in the government's output, but it perhaps would be more in keeping with lived experience to track participation with dependence on supplemental sources of income. if you need a second job, or charity/government help, just to survive, then you dont have a \"living job\".

Companies essentially pass off a new product as the old product now, lying to consumers. Capitalism relies on informed customers to target purchases towards the 'best' products; this breaks that ability. VC firms seem to buy well-established companies, reduce the quality and ride them into the ground, destroying a lot of value that has built up over a long time. Rinse-and-repeat and the overall value of products goes down. This is a point for government to require a detailed account of products. It shouldn't be a mystery whether shrinkflation has occurred it should say it right on the product, and be confirmed in a government verified database. In the UK it feels more like corrupted consumer protections.

Did you know that you can apply, get hired, and actually start work at an Amazon warehouse without speaking verbally to a single human being ever? Like you literally go online and fill out forms, go to a building and use a kiosk to check in, and so on, and are on the job without a single conversation. Can you try to actually really think about what being in this economy feels like to most people? Now call them and ask them how the economy is doing. Do you think they trust you, an educated social scientist employed at faceless corporation that is calling them to publish some news report on what they think? Do you think they're interested in impressing you with their stock market fluency? To the extent they are willing to talk to you at all it's in the hopes that you'll fucking listen to them when they tell you to fucking do something about this for once.

I guess Assa Abloy is another example, but really - mini-monopolist power? It's one of countless lock manufacturers. You can buy Schlage, Kwikset, ABUS... In fact, no serious study of the construction industry pins cost increases on stuff like that. There are far more powerful factors at play. The laborers you hire want to be paid more than before (and the government is rising minimum wages). Compliance is getting costlier due to ever-evolving building codes, environmental and energy regulations, and zoning. Customer expectations are increasing (higher finish, more sqft). To the extent the materials are getting expensive, it's usually not your lumber mill being greedy.

It seems to many people don't realize it's not about making and selling the product. It's about the economic/money game. It's not about selling a car, it's about being a bank giving financing. It's not about selling a retail product, it's about credit cards. It's not about refining mined products, it's about controlling the willingness to invest in the sector. reply CPLX 2 hours agorootparentprevUnless there is market power and exploitation by monopolists.

Protracted lawsuits with the (now) second-most-valuable company in the world. 2. Any significant customers being loudly reminded by Nvidia that the EULA for CUDA tools prohibits their use on non-Nvidia hardware. The problem is not the technical challenge of reimplementing the CUDA API or tools. The problem is the users want CUDA, not something that looks and behaves like CUDA but requires them to load a different set of libraries. reply kiney 4 hours agoparentprevThere's a very simple reason why it does very little to substantiate its core claim: The claim is simply wrong and therefore can't be substantiated reply ghaff 4 hours agoparentprev>In fact, no serious study of the construction industry pins cost increases on stuff like that. There are far more powerful factors at play. The laborers you hire want to be paid more than before (and the government is rising minimum wages). Compliance is getting costlier due to ever-evolving building codes, environmental and energy regulations, and zoning. Customer expectations are increasing (higher finish, more sqft). To the extent the materials are getting expensive, it's usually not your lumber mill being greedy. In general, you're probably seeing some increased disparity between the cost of things that require some significant levels of labor--especially if skills are involved to any great degree--and those that can be dealt with mostly by \"just\" throwing capital at the problem. Over time I expect you'll see more automation, more self-service, and--yes--more just doing without of things that cost more to deliver than you can or want to pay for. reply notahacker 4 hours agoparentprevyeah it's basically a longwinded way of saying \"market power is a thing\", and a clumsy one that kludges absolute monopoly rentiers like Verisign, companies reneging on partnerships and conventional market leaders tend to put their prices up when their product is much more useful than the alternatives all into the same bracket.

But isn't life still easier with LinkedIn than in the before times, when recruiters would dig deep to get folks' phone numbers and then have to call each of those people individually? (I think the modern equivalent would be email addresses.) It's true that LinkedIn makes recruiting much easier to scale to a mass market. And it's also true that it has a monopoly on that scaling for professional employees. But is it fair to call them an economic termite when it's still possible to do sourcing in an admittedly clunky and old fashioned way? Just because they have a monopoly on scaled recruiting doesn't mean that they hold all the cards the way Linde (also in the profile) would in the gas market.

Let's say I own every single gas station in your city, a thousand of them or so, and I charge 100% gross margins on gasoline. I do hundreds of millions of dollars in business. You want to open a gas station with lower margins and undercut me. You pick a good location and open it. Great, my location across the street can just sell below your cost unit you run out of money. Bye, see you later. Was that in your business plan? Where'd you get all that capital? What kind of return were they expecting, and how will you deliver it selling below cost for an indefinitely long period of time? Also where are you sourcing your gas? Maybe I have already locked up all the current deliveries given my buying power with the refinery. Also what happens when you find out that nobody will service your pumps because I've locked them all up too, and am paying more than you can afford. And you can't afford anything because you're selling every gallon at a loss. Meanwhile the last couple years of 100% margins have given me a giant pile of cash I can use to do all of these things.

Her crime? A passage from her book where she laments that academia involved way too much people pleasing and political games for her. Reactions varied1 from angry: “Who does she think she is”/”We are all Geniuses, not only her, we all deserve funding, why does she think she is special”/”Nooo, she is a jerk” to self-satisfied, cynical: “Well of course this is how it is, why are intelligent people so naive?” Ruxandra’s Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Subscribe The quote in question: But I was learning that succeeding at a research institution like Penn required skills that had little to do with science. You needed the ability to sell yourself and your work. You needed to attract funding. You needed the kind of interpersonal savvy that got you invited to speak at conferences and made people eager to mentor and support you. You needed to know how to do things that I have never had any interest in (flattering people, schmoozing, being agreeable when you disagree, even when you are 100% certain you are correct). You needed to know how to climb the political ladder, to value a hierarchy that had always seemed, at best, wholly uninteresting (and, at worst, antithetical to good science.) I wasn’t interested in those kills. I did not want to play political games. Nor did I think I should have to. A couple of months ago I wrote a piece called “The flight of the Weird Nerd from academia”, in which I argued there is a trend wherein Weird Nerds are being driven out of academia by the so-called Failed Corporatist phenotype. Katalin Karikó is a perfect example of a Weird Nerd. I recently argued that many Weird Nerds (I called them autistics, but people really hated that2), have found a refuge on the Internet, where their strengths are amplified and their weaknesses are less important. There, I make the case for why these people are uniquely suited for creative intellectual endeavours and why they might slip through the cracks in a lot of normal jobs. Judging from a (short) lifetime of personal observations as well as the vitriol launched at Kariko for daring to not be “normal”, I suspect some explicit pro-Weird Nerd norms have to exist in an institution that seeks to properly utilize these people, for the benefit of us all. To formalize this: “Any system that is not explicitly pro-Weird Nerd will turn anti-Weird Nerd pretty quickly.” That is because most people, while liking non-conformism in the abstract and post-facto, are not very willing to actually put up with the personality trade-offs of Weird Nerds in practice. There is an increasing number of people right now who are thinking about how to build better intellectual institutions (e.g. those who study metascience.) Yet surprisingly little attention is given to human capital outside of “Let’s increase immigration” (a good idea, don’t get me wrong.) But if the rule turns out to be true, I think it’s worth thinking about what kind of people one wants to attract in these institutions and how to keep them there. And I believe the conversation here starts with accepting a simple truth, which is that Weird Nerds will have certain traits that might be less than ideal, that these traits come “in a package” with other, very good traits, and if one makes filtering or promotion based on the absence of those traits a priority, they will miss out on the positives. It means really internalizing the existence of trade-offs in human personality, in an era where accepting trade-offs is deeply unfashionable, and structuring institutions and their cultures while keeping them in mind. Genius is rare In one of her interviews, Katalin Karikó recalls her mother calling her from Hungary around the time when the Nobel Prizes were awarded and asking her if that year she was going to win it. The question, in its loving naivete, must have stung worse than an insult: not only was Karikó not close to this remarkable feat, she was actually unsuccessful by much less ambitious metrics. Put simply, she had left her family in Hungary to work in the US, but for little actual measurable reward, be it status or money. Karikó did not get grants. Karikó did not get tenure. What Karikó did was work until late at night on a topic people did not pay that much attention to at the time: mRNA for vaccines. And she did that for decades. Paul Graham talks about an underrated quality one needs for extreme success, namely the willingness to be low status. And Karikó had plenty of that: she lived her convictions, in this case the conviction in the importance of mRNA through rejections, humiliations (her office was vacated without her having received prior notice) and hardship. I would go even further and say: she had intellectual courage. People often mistake a non-descript combination of conscientiousness coupled with high intelligence with Genius. By that definition, there is some decent amount of Genius in Science. Some people, like those getting mad at Karikó for that passage, go even further: Genius is so abundant in Science, that we can barely find our way through it: we are drowning in it! Of course, this is just a “feel-goodism” people like to tell themselves. Genius is very rare, in Science and outside of it, and it’s linked to intellectual courage, the quality Karikó had an abundance of. And it’s not only that Genius as a whole is rare in the population: it also usually shines in specific places. Karikó was a Genius at Biology and maybe at nothing else. For someone to be a Genius, many pieces have to fall into place: the right personality has to be there, the right happenings have to happen and so on. We should catalyze the right circumstances for Genius to manifest itself more, instead of diminishing them. In Kariko’s case, it seems like the unnecessarily political nature of Science and the fact that her specific workplace was not very Weird Nerd- friendly were obstacles. It’s good they did not stop her. But there are probably many 70%, or 80% or 95% Katalin Karikos who were not merely hampered, but stopped. And that’s probably a huge loss. The bad parts are a feature, not a bug To have so much intellectual courage one has to be a bit mad. It’s hard to believe this needs to be said, but the no trade-off world many people like to pretend is real does not, in fact, exist. It’s reasonable to expect Weird Nerds or anyone else for that matter to be ethical and not become toxic colleagues. And listening to the interviews with Karikó one hardly gets the impression that she was toxic: there is a Jesus-like quality to the way she talks even about the people who had wronged her — for example about a Professor who threatened to have her deported. It’s hard to imagine that coming from a “jerk”, as many have called her. But it’s also hard to believe someone like her could ever become the most pleasant interlocutor at a dinner party, or the most socially adept and organized manager. And that is fine. We need her in the lab, not at fancy dinners. Now, one could argue that Karikó and Weird Nerds should just learn to be strategic and suck it up, like most people do. I sensed quite a bit of schadenfreude from people suggesting we should be making people like her suffer through the same arduous processes as everyone else. Of course, if I was Katalin Karikó ’s friend, I would advise her to try and play the political game if that’s what’s needed. Maybe it would have been better for her in the moment. But it might be the case that if she did listen to such advice, she would have been so drained of energy that less time would have been spent pursuing her interests. Or she would have just switched research fields to work on something more popular. Everything comes at a cost: spend more time worrying about politics, there will be less time for science. What’s more, the kind of people who really care about science or truth to the extent that Karikó did, are not the same people that get motivated by playing politics or being incredibly pleasant. There is a strong anti-correlation between these interests (that of course does not mean there is no one who is good at both.) Selecting future intellectuals based on traits like Agreeableness or Extraversion might not be only unnecessary, but actually harmful. We might be actively depleting the talent pool of the kind of people we do want to see in academic institutions. Societal trends A full scientific career these days is a bit of a cacophony. It starts with doing a lot of what is essentially grunt work in a lab or on a computer. Slowly, one moves up the ladder and gains more independence. Postdoc is probably the stage that maps best to what people usually imagine when they think of a scientist: that’s when one is fully in charge of their projects, but also spends their day-to-day doing actual scientific work. Ironically, it’s also the most precarious: postdocs are often in their 30s, jumping between relatively short term contracts. The way out of this is to become a PI, or Principal Investigator. In 2011, the average age at which a biomedical scientist gets their first R01 grant to establish their independent career as a PI is 42, having increased from 36 in the 80s. It has probably increased since then. As a PI, interpersonal skills become more and more important: one has to forge collaborations, write and get grants, take care of the fragile mental health of confused PhD students so they can produce work and so on. The skills required to be a successful PhD student and postdoc are in many ways very different from those required to be a good PI, almost as if they were different careers. Age at first R01 grant It’s at this young PI stage that Karikó ’s career hit a wall: after she became an Adjunct Professor, she stopped advancing further. Some of it was because of the topic she had chosen and in this regard, diversifying funding and supporting more high risk projects are very good proposals coming from the metascience community that would have helped. But some of it was probably her personality, as she says herself. I suspect selection against Weird Nerds has actually amplified since Karikó ’s time in academia: everything from ever larger collaborations in Biology, to longer times to becoming independent or increase in admin points in that direction. Indeed, as I have argued before, there is some quantitative evidence there are less Weird Nerds in STEM academia than there used to be. So far I have discussed the Hard Sciences, but there is a case to be made that the problem is much more acute in less quantifiable fields like Humanities or Social Sciences. STEM has a higher barrier to entry: there is only so much political game playing that one can do in order to advance themselves if one cannot perform experiments in a lab. It is also somewhat more clear if a scientific piece of work is completely bad. There is feedback from industry, with most start-ups in biotech these days coming out of academic labs: this provides a strong incentive for innovation. Such quality check mechanisms are on much more shaky ground in fields like Humanities, where feedback from society can happen on the order of decades. Arguably, being a Weird Nerd that is intrinsically driven by the truth as opposed to what’s fashionable is even more crucial in the absence of hard metrics that can tell one their work is wrong. But backlash from society does eventually happen, and I think we are in the middle of this right now, with trust in academia plummeting in a bipartisan fashion, as recent Gallup polls show. At least some of the current crisis is, in my opinion, down to academia essentially selecting against Weird Nerds types. A problem with non-STEM topics might sound less problematic than a replication crisis in cancer biology. I think that’s not true: after all, we depend on a collective imaginarium for a healthy society, a collective imaginarium whose pillars might be slowly crumbling. 1 The most popular tweet in question, from @johnstreichner, has been deleted since then. In it, he was basically arguing that we have so much Genius in academia and we need a way to select from this abundance of Genius. 2 I still stand by my association of Weird Nerds with autism, but for some reason people really do not like to call Weird Nerds autistic.

The exact stereotype differed by domain... the performer who is a diva, the self destructive author, the manic artist... each with a hint of nobility but also quite off-putting. The author wanting to combine Weird Nerd with autistic is very incorrect IMHO... I've known a lot of weird nerds, am one myself, and there's lots of different flavors, most of them not autistic. So much of talent is just really caring about something specific. Caring about it above other things. Specifically above external motivation and incentives. Do that and the weirdness grows naturally, neurodivergence isn't even necessary (though it might help) reply pclmulqdq 1 hour agoparentMental illness is somewhat linked to creative productivity, sadly. Bipolar disorder is somewhat overrepresented in highly-accomplished musicians, artists, and writers (with the trend going as far back as the 1800s). It would not surprise me if ASD is overrepresented in scientists and engineers. However, people also imitate their tribe, and seeing \"weird nerds\" with mental illness may get other nerds to emulate that behavior without actually being mentally ill. reply fragmede 1 hour agorootparentOr plain just getting away with shitty behavior.

Would neurodivergence have to be native (so, not grown \"naturally\") and at which point does weirdness fit on the spectrum ? Recently I think people are more receptive to lower degrees of neurodivergence. I see it the same way people understand that you have a gradation between having difficulties climbing stairs and not being able to walk. We could probably have it more in the open that many are not full blown clinically diagnosed ASD patients, and I wouldn't see it as an issue to have \"false positives\" of diversity lumped into neurodivergence if it was destigmatized. reply kristjansson 2 hours agorootparentAt some point the question is “why?”. We can keep atomizing human variability into smaller, more graduated buckets of neurodivergence, but what’s the point, esp. for those that don’t really suffer negative impacts, and for which there isn’t really any remedy besides acceptance? reply detourdog 46 minutes agorootparentMy guess is to try to improve human relationships. Trying to understand why someone has consistent surprising/inappropriate reactions might help. The flip side is someone who consistently seems to be surprised by how people are reacting to them and wants better connections. reply folsom 2 minutes agorootparentI do know that people do not like me. Don't get me wrong, my coworkers all get along with me and I think most enjoy working with me but in general people outside of work don't want to be around me. Hell I couldn't even keep my wife interested enough to stick with me. So how could we study what makes me turn off other people and have it make a difference in my life? It is unlikely that I would be able to change myself and there is almost zero chance that whatever it is about me that disgusts others will change their natural reaction. In addition, I am not sure that this isn't how things are supposed to be. This may be part of social evolution that just makes the world tick. I would prefer we stop classifying people and just let them be who/what they are without pointing fingers at them. fragmede 1 hour agorootparentprevso that people can identify themselves as being part of a group, and then find others who are also part of that group, just to have a community for support. if I want to find a group of left handed pansexuals who are into Pokemon Go, the Internet facilitates finding your exact flock. reply zarathustreal 21 minutes agorootparentSeems to me like enabling further segregating people would be a negative thing.

I'm seeing a mix of effects, positive and negative, from increased diagnosis rates. On the plus side, some people are using their diagnoses to find helpful support material, techniques, and advice. On the negative side, some people get a diagnosis and then try to use it as an excuse for every personality trait they can fit under the umbrella of that diagnosis. It's really difficult as a mentor to have to explain to someone that their diagnosis of anxiety or ADHD or autism doesn't give them a free pass in society for all of the things they struggle with. I've had to explain to numerous people that having an ADHD diagnosis doesn't, for example, exempt them from the same performance review standards as their peers at work. This can be difficult to acceptance for someone who was given extra time on tests and possibly more leniency on assignments throughout high school and college due to their diagnosis. The educational institutions meant well, but the students took the wrong message from their accommodations and assumed it was always the world's responsibility to bend to their personal quirks rather than the other way around. Teaching people that their diagnosis is, to be blunt, not other people's problem is a difficult hurdle to clear for some. Many others get it right away, of course, but the internet rhetoric about neurodivergence leads a lot of people in the wrong direction. reply aspenmayer 59 minutes agorootparent> I've had to explain to numerous people that having an ADHD diagnosis doesn't, for example, exempt them from the same performance review standards as their peers at work. I can’t speak for you, but that isn’t at all accurate as far as I know. I myself would not say these kinds of things to a coworker, and definitely not to a subordinate one or one that reports to me, as I don’t work in HR or legal department, and I’m not intimately familiar with actual existing accommodations for ADHD and other conditions under the FMLA and other disability discrimination laws and regulations in the US or other countries.

Why are you saying it's inaccurate if you don't understand the laws and regulations? The FMLA that you cited and linked is for emergency medical leave, not for ADHD accommodations. You're also making a mistake that I see a lot: Getting an ADHD diagnosis is not the same as having a disability. It is possible to qualify as having a disability due to an ADHD diagnosis, but it's a substantially more difficult standard to achieve and prove. The average ADHD patient will not and cannot qualify as being disabled due to ADHD. This is exactly what I was talking about: There has been an explosion of over-confident opinions about how ADHD and other mental health conditions intersect the workplace that have no basis in reality. The amount of incorrect ADHD information circulating on places like Reddit and TikTok is leading people in the wrong direction in large numbers. eikenberry 51 minutes agorootparentprevHow is this stance different from one that says the same thing about your race or being deaf or requiring regular injections? Seems to me this is saying that some forms of bigotry are OK and the victims of it just need to deal with it. That neural disorders aren't as real or important because you can't see them and that makes it easier for some people who have them, but at a functional level, try to make more of it than they should. Because of this everyone with any level of these conditions should just suck it up where it doesn't jive well with our common hierarchical workplace organization. reply iamdbtoo 50 minutes agorootparentprev> The educational institutions meant well, but the students took the wrong message from their accommodations and assumed it was always the world's responsibility to bend to their personal quirks rather than the other way around. This is kind of a toxic perspective and could be why you have so many problems with your neurodiverse coworkers. If you believe they should never require accommodations and are always expected to conform to the rest of society, then you don't understand what that experience is like and how further debilitating it can actually be. reply ambicapter 2 hours agorootparentprevHow does sifting people into smaller and smaller buckets work to make people feel more part of a group?

Being diagnosed directly led to immense stigma over and over. You are literally giving people the language they need to stereotype you and put you into a bucket by getting diagnosed and telling people your diagnosis. Stigma is literally an iatrogenic consequence of diagnosis itself, never mind diagnosis stopping stigma! I hear \"Autistic\" thrown around as an insult maybe 10x more than I heard the same 20 years ago. People feeling safe because they're not alone does not end stigma whatsoever either. reply Aurornis 1 hour agorootparent> by getting diagnosed and telling people your diagnosis One of the things I try to emphasize with newly diagnosed young people is that they should not make their diagnosis an outward part of their personality. There's a trend of putting your diagnoses in everything from your LinkedIn profile to your resume lately. I've been helping with resume review in a group and I've been stunned by how many times I've had to tell people that they need to remove their ADHD diagnosis from their resume. reply andoando 1 hour agorootparentprevI dont even like it on a personal level. People use these terms to describe themselves in very narrow buckets and stereotypes, and there is no logic to that at all. I saw a post on /r/ADHD for example thst went something like \"Does anyone else svoid eye contact during sex\" and everyones like \"omg thats me too!\". I mean...need I say more? I get how it might be fulfilling to have a label to explain away all your behaviors but it makes no sense to do so and I find it extremely self-limiting reply dbtc 1 hour agorootparentprevThe phrase has sounded weird to me for some time but here it strikes me as especially so: \"the spectrum\" Just one spectrum, 2 dimensions? Is that all we get? It's a linguistic short-cut, I get that, but I wonder how useful it is, how much nuance it conceals. reply ianbicking 36 minutes agorootparentYeah, \"the spectrum\" feels like squeezing lots of things into one diagnosis. Kind of the opposite of neurodiversity. It also feels a bit tech-centric... probably tech is someplace autistic attributes are particularly helpful, but other subjects are probably most compatible with other kinds of neurodivergence. reply ModernMech 1 hour agorootparentprevPicture a color wheel instead of a continuum.

I've been told by a therapist specializing in ASD that there are a lot of diagnosed and undiagnosed ASD workers in tech. It's very possible the only reason they are \"full blown clinically diagnosed\" is because they haven't been tested. reply Gigachad 6 minutes agorootparentAt this point we could diagnose basically everyone on the planet with some flavour of neurodivergence. I’m sure there’s one that makes people good at sales, one that makes people ruthless CEOs, one that makes people programmers, etc. But I just don’t see the point of diagnosing people with things unless it causes some kind of actual disability and dysfunction. reply parineum 1 hour agorootparentprevYou didn't use this word specifically but this whole conversation has the underlying prior of the \"everything is a spectrum\" mindset. In that context, everyone is neurodivergence because, afterall it's a spectrum we're all on and nobody is going to be deadest average. At some point we have to define at what point these spectrums become clinical. The kind of language you see in the DSM for stuff like this is \"does it affect daily living/relationships/health in a negative way\". Being neurodivergent isn't a disorder, not showering because you're obsessed with programming probably is. reply kylebenzle 1 hour agorootparentAutism is a result of neurons failing to \"trim\" or being over-connected. Being \"on the spectrum\" refers to the degree of above average physical over-connection of neurons. The opposite, when neurons fail to connect or lose too many connections is called schizophrenia. People that are between the two, the vast majority of people, are not said to be either autistic or schizophrenic (you can't be both at the same time but can go from autistic to schizophrenic with a degenerative disease). Everyone is not \"on the spectrum\" for autism, again by definition no one that is schizophrenic is \"on the spectrum\" for autism at all so your comment is nonsensical. reply walt_grata 2 hours agoparentprevI duno on some of that. Until I was about 39 I was a \"weird nerd\" and then my wife (Dr of special education) finally convinced me to talk to a Dr and get get tested for autism. Turns out I'm ASD 1, would have been Asperger's in the past. Autism has a very wide range of ways it shows itself. reply sneed_chucker 2 hours agorootparentWell, to me your comment also speaks to the increasing degree to which we medicalize personality traits. I'm sure your diagnosis is legitimate, but also I'm inferring from your comment that you are married and gainfully employed; so it sounds like you're able to build and maintain relationships, as well hold conversations with strangers or non-close acquaintances when necessary. In years past would any professional have bothered to test someone like you for a disorder? reply sctb 1 hour agorootparentBeing married and gainfully employed and able to build and maintain relationships as well as hold conversations with strangers when necessary can come at an exceptionally high cost for neurodivergent people in the form of masking (like a kind of mental tech debt). Instead of overt social difficulty, this might present itself as anxiety, depression, and suicidality—those conditions are worthy of medicalization IMO. reply sneed_chucker 1 hour agorootparentI agree with what you're saying, but also - everyone has problems. Is anyone truly normal or neurotypical? Why do some people's problems get the validation of the medical system and others don't? (These are non-rhetorical questions, I'm really not sure about the answers to them myself) reply sctb 23 minutes agorootparent> [...] everyone has problems They certainly do. And I don't think we can make meaningful comparisons between individuals in terms of their problems, how they struggle or suffer, etc. For me personally, I don't assume to have it any worse than anyone else, and I always assume that others have deep challenges that I won't ever know about. > Is anyone truly normal or neurotypical? Again, these concepts become strained when applied to individuals. It's like the family who has 1.5 children: they don't exist. These are ever-changing labels that we make use of within an extremely nebulous social process. I try to apply them only in well-defined contexts and then throw up my hands in the general case. > Why do some people's problems get the validation of the medical system and others don't? I have no idea; in my mind this question is trying to peer closely into the nebula. reply faeriechangling 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't really accept the validity of people who are generally more functional and conventionally successful than average being called \"disordered\" in the first place. It seems like a weird arbitrary insistence of the medical system to simply pathologize anybody who fits into a certain box. reply detourdog 36 minutes agorootparentThe disorder is how they affect their social surroundings.

Many psychological disorders we have little hard science to understand them with.

But it's diagnosed based on behavioral observations, it's not like people get diagnosed with ASD based on brain scans like you would for MS or parkinsons. reply UniverseHacker 1 hour agoparentprevCaring about something deeply above external motivations, especially external validation is by itself neurodivergent. At the very least, you have to be highly introverted, which is rare. reply fdw 1 hour agorootparentI'm understanding your statement to mean that caring about something because of itself, without external motivation (like validation or money), is neurodivergent. So neurotypical would be to only care about something if you profit from you caring about it? Is that reading correct? If so, I have to disagree vehemently. That is not my experience at all and feels extremely homo economicus and - to be honest - depressing. I want to care about things I like and that bring me joy, even if no-one pays me for that or validates my choice. reply UniverseHacker 1 hour agorootparentIt sounds to me like you probably are introverted, but might not be familiar with exactly what that means, or how neurodivergent is really is from much more common extroverted people. Most extroverts aren't ruthless machivellian self interested people like you are worrying I am claiming, but they are focused primarily on fitting in and being accepted by others- and do choose their activities and behaviors mostly based on that. Their interests are genuine, but the biggest factor in them is usually who it connects them with, and how it makes them appear to others. What do your hobbies, car, clothing, etc. say about you and how will that affect how others see and treat you? Introverts are, as the name implies, more inwardly focused- and although they enjoy social connection and acceptance also, it can be exhausting and therefore less motivating, and generally takes a back seat to more inwardly generated concerns. It is often wrongly confused with being socially awkward or shy, which isn't the same at all. reply andoando 1 hour agorootparentI hate this extrovert vs introvert thing too. People don't fit simiply into these buckets. reply UniverseHacker 48 minutes agorootparentIt's not a bucket you fit people into, it is one aspect of a persons personality, out of an almost infinite number, and is also a continuum. The idea originally comes from Carl Jung, and his point in coming up with it was for people that personally identify themselves as fitting into a particular bucket, to realize this, and be able to consciously explore the part of yourself that doesn't fit into it, that you might have ignored or rejected in the past. For example, if you see yourself as an introverted person, and dislike extroverted qualities in others, it can be useful, for personal growth, to explore and accept your own extroverted qualities as well. I would argue that is nearly the opposite of \"simply fitting people into buckets\" - it is a tool that gives a perspective to do the opposite of that. To understand the complexity and diversity of yourself, and of others. reply andoando 34 minutes agorootparentHow does saying \"Im an introvert\" not put yourself into a bucket? Youre quite literally using someone elses made up categorization to define who you are, and people tend to speak of this as an innate and overcompassing trait, and moreover using these made up categorizations as a cause of other behaviors. I dont like making small talk with cashiers at this point in my life\" essentially becomes \"I am an introvert, so I dont like making small talk with strangers and its is never likely to be my thing\". I am perfectly fine describing myself with the actual details of my experiences. Its much richer and nuanced that way rather than simply saying Im not some way because Im an introvert. What Ive seen is the complete opposite of ehst you are saying. People label themselves as something and believe anything thst doesnt fit the label is not them, out of reach, a monumental step for them to do. Talking to a cashier all of a sudden isnt just muttering some words, its a foundational shift from being introverted to extroverted. I think all of modern psychology/psychaitry suffers in this way: Making up categorizations with the belief that making things easier to conceptualize and making it easier to associate things is scientific and valuable insight. I think its the opposite. Youre losing precious detail and artificially killing complexity and getting simplified, untrue beliefs. I dont need these labels to explore \"my more extroverted qualities\". Having never labeled myself this way, I had no issues being the complete \"opposite\" reply UniverseHacker 6 minutes agorootparentThe point is people are already unconsciously putting themselves in buckets- being conscious of it is the first step towards actually moving past it. By being conscious of exactly how you are doing this, you can also begin to explore and accept the parts of yourself that don't fit into those buckets (what Carl Jung calls the shadow). These ideas are widely misunderstood and misused in both popular culture and the social sciences, but that isn't the fault of the concepts themselves. For example, the categories in the popular Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) are from Carl Jung's archetypes, but people use them exactly like you said- to essentially justify their own behaviors, when the point is to explore the parts of yourself that are the opposite of that. This idea often horrifies people that are fans of MBTI and use it like you are implying. I'm sure you would agree that people already have different personalities, and see themselves a certain way, and often dislike traits in themselves and others that are somewhat opposite traits to those. For example a person might see themselves as an analytical logical person, and look down on people who seem to be guided mostly by emotions. It can be hugely valuable for a person like this to start to understand and accept the emotional part of themselves and others, but that likely won't change the fact that they are still a person that prioritizes \"thinking\" over \"feeling.\" People often mistakenly call this Carl Jung stuff \"pseudoscience\" because they are misunderstanding it as trying to be science. It is not- it is a tool or technology for personal growth, and is not attempting to be a literal explanation for how the human brain works or anything like that. It would be more accurate to relate it to religious or spiritual practices like meditation. jacobolus 3 hours agoparentprev\"Performer who is a diva\" is not directly about focusing on one thing at the expense of another. Performers are trained to be divas by having no real friends willing to confront them, and by being infantilized by the people around them who lie about their faults, are excessively accommodating of bullshit, and don't ever make them take responsibility for mistakes or reflect on their impact on other people. The result is often the same for people in positions of authority, such as CEOs. Cf. Elon Musk. reply IggleSniggle 2 hours agorootparentI somewhat agree, but I think there's more to it than that. To be a great performer, you have to care about delivering your own \"message\" as authentically or at least \"in totality\" more than anything else. Critique may be useful in understanding how your vision is being received, but actually delivering the vision requires believing in your own vision more than the visions of others. The same could be said of CEOs. It's not just that there are adoring fans / sycophants, it's that to be a great success in these areas you need to be able to disregard the criticisms of others when the criticism doesn't really connect with what you are trying to achieve. reply jacobolus 17 minutes agorootparentThe \"diva\" stereotype, starting with opera prima donnas, has plenty of real-world examples. These are people who were constantly pampered by support staff who treated them as royalty, and then ended up being huge jerks to anyone who even looked at them the wrong way. It's not just about compartmentalizing criticism or whatever. reply mattgreenrocks 1 hour agoprevIt feels like more and more areas of life are regressing to the mean in terms of how status is distributed. The mean being some sort of centralized cabal-like structure (perhaps autonomously/accidentally centralized, like an algo) doling out status. By design, it is highly uneven, quasi-random (there are things that make you eligible but there are no guarantees), and their authority to do so unquestioned. Take social media: it is more about who they've said you are rather than _what_ you say. The key message of the medium is less the content of the message itself (though it figures in!) and more the combination of your online persona's followers + likes along with the message itself. I'd argue social media is a real shift in the Internet itself where we began to take online reputation very, very seriously, to the point that we decided we'd believe that likes were more than just Internet Points. And people _love_ this sort of structure because it means that something other than actual competence can be the deciding factor. They have a shot at being in the cabal and among the deciders. And it's a lot easier to evaluate people: simply see what other people say about them. Not saying that non-technical factors don't matter. They matter a lot and are often very easy wins to pick up.

First it's absolutely true that orgs that purport to support weird nerds will revert back to rewarding politicians. I've seen it happen, and typically has to do with who is doling out money. However, in my experience the vast majority of brilliant nerds way overextend themselves, and are much too confident outside their domain. They're also much more likely to be jerks and will tumble from conflict to conflict until they get their way by attrition or status. Conflicts are strangely more personal because so much ego is tied up into it. They're more likely to assume they're right in every (non-tech/science related) situation. My advice to weird nerds (assuming emotional intelligence isn't an innate skill) is: Find a way to turn your brainpower onto this challenge as equally important as your core interest. Treat interacting with your institution like a long term engineering project or investigation. Think long term and be strategic, create and track longer term plans, try to learn what people respond to, what works and what doesn't. Always try to be kind and maintain some humility, but assuming you aren't sure what that really means, then ask for lots of feedback. Or you can just find someone you trust and delegate all of this to them, like a technical founder hiring a CEO. (Edit: relatedly, if you work for or with weird nerds in a support role, my advice is to take full advantage! They might have a useful point, so set your own ego aside, don't take it personally (they are weird), and try to listen charitably. Their work is what you're here to support, after all.) reply bradleyjg 1 hour agoparentHowever, in my experience the vast majority of brilliant nerds way overextend themselves, and are much too confident outside their domain.

Intelligence allows someone to gain that insight faster than those in the middle of the bell curve of IQ, but it doesn't magically confer it. It still takes time, reading, research, and seeing it in practice. Or put another way - what I call the \"Iceberg Analogy\" - every discipline in life is like an iceberg.

In the real world, the \"Weird Nerd\" rarely checks all of these boxes, let alone most of them. I bet a lot of people will read this and identify as the Weird Nerd despite checking none of the boxes. That's the nature of articles that leave out the nuance and instead give us the most idealized view of a noble scientist who was a victim of the system. It leaves an opening for everyone to feel like they were a victim of the system. That's why this problem is far more complicated than articles like this would lead you to believe. Many of the \"Weird Nerd\" people out there aren't perfect scientists or engineers unfairly shunned by the system. Many of them have real flaws of varying degrees that would require a lot of guidance and mentoring even within a perfect system. And it's not easy!

Say, 90%. And then there is a 10% left which takes as much work. So management hires people from a consultancy to pick up the 10%. Except that these guys don't write much code. They are adept at finding their way into technical management at light speed and want to push what should be their work back to W, while doing the bare minimum otherwise. Now W has more work than before, because he has been pushed into politics. At the very least, he will need to communicate to his colleagues that they need to pick up the slack for real. With some luck, W will find a nice way to do that, but that's the kind of problem he is ill-equipped to handle.

There's a couple of forces at play - a) it's a medical issue that people are really passionate about b) there's an ironic (or not, at times) subculture of calling oneself 'autistic' when it's just exhibiting an interest and c) there's still no 100% accurate test, not everyone will want to out themselves, etc. So the shroud of mystery + confusion persists for the vast majority outside of those that advocate and speak out. I think it's a good thing to come up with some other term to refer to these extrinsically motivated nerds that don't really care for typical social constructs but bring immense value to a bunch of types of work.

A major risk in academia is picking a dead-end niche. We hear about the people who picked an unlikely winner. This one picked mRNA vaccines. The inventor of MRI scanning had similar problems. He was almost fired. Those two succeeded, eventually. But the people who work on E-beam lithography or vaccines against addiction didn't do so well. Both of those would have been huge if they worked well. You can't tell in advance. If you could, the problem didn't need research. A more useful way to look at this is that doing it and selling it are different skills. This is why companies have separate R&D, production, and marketing departments. If you face a hard problem in one of those areas, you can't devote enough time to the others. This is to some extent a time management and division of labor problem. Academia is not team-oriented in that sense. At least below the principal investigator level. Once reaching that level, university PR departments are happy to hype any modest advance into a major breakthrough. Below that level, it's a cold world. Academia seems to have built itself a dysfunctional world - a huge bureaucracy, not much of a career path for real researchers, and a shrinking pool of full professorships.

Regarding \"socially adept [...] manager\", I've worked with two software engineering project managers who were autistic. They were both very different (one amiable, and had much better than average understanding of human behavior and emotions; the other came off as making an effort to tolerate people). Both were not only well-respected, but liked, and were effective at difficult work&people-herding jobs. Even with the manager who came off as not really liking anyone by default, and even on a very difficult project, almost everyone on large teams respected the project manager (excepting one person, who couldn't stand something about the project manager, or the nature of the project).

Meritoriousness was not on the menu and it took me entirely too long to \"get\" that I was locked out of promotion and that it was just a way to keep me dancing like a little dog standing up for a treat. The \"bundle of tradeoffs,\" which is a more humane and human way of thinking, is at odds with the \"cog in the machine\" approach which began with interchangeable machined parts and progressed on to the human element. Being replaceable then becomes a prized characteristic. Indeed, one of the administrative staff suggested that anyone who seemed like they were too valuable to replace ought to be let go on those grounds alone.

This exposes me to a wide variety of people, but unsurprisingly, a lot of them are probably what the author would consider Weird Nerds. Most of them are perfectly pleasant people, and I look forward to spending time in their company, both in the context of playing D&D, and just as a way to socialize. Heck, at my last session, a player proposed doing a regular board game night, and I am very excited to do this with those people. But. Occasionally, you meet someone who is just fucking unpleasant to be around. Maybe they're on the spectrum (as the author really wants to lump all Weird Nerds on the far end of), maybe they're just poorly socialized, maybe they're just assholes. And unless they're just awful people [more on this later], you learn to put up with their idiosyncracies - because in the end, they're pretty good at playing D&D, and it's fun to slay a dragon or solve the mystery of the mermaid pond, or finally get revenge on your vampire stepfather from hell or whatever. But those people? They're not coming to board game night, and they're not fucking coming to any of my BBQs. They're ok in the context of playing D&D for three hours, but I'm not willing to spend more time with them. I think that's another reason why some Weird Nerds who are unpleasant to be around have found a safe haven on the internet, as the author puts it: because while they're still unpleasant, you can read their unpleasant words and then walk away for awhile. They're not standing in front of you, demanding your time face to face. If someone is the world's expert on a thing you're collaborating on online, it doesn't matter if you groan every time you have to talk to them, because your time with them is largely limited, and you can walk away at literally any point during the interaction and regain the will to live and spend more time with them. I'm not sure what my point is. Maybe that it's kind of ok to not want to be around people who are unpleasant to be around, and that despite that, it's also ok for them to still meaningfully participate in the things that matter to them. [About the awful people in D&D: it's a game, and it's made to be fun. Not every table is made for every player, and vice versa. If you're in a game, and someone is truly ruining the game for the other players by being a generally unpleasant person, I am begging you to just fucking stop playing with them. Life is short, don't surround yourself with assholes. I promise you can find more players. And if you're the one being asked to leave a D&D table because other people find your unpleasant, reflect on your actions. Maybe you're just at a table that's a bad fit for you. Or maybe you're an asshole.] (If I currently play D&D with you, rest assured that I am not talking about you; all the examples are from past games.) reply nurple 1 hour agoparentI had a \"friend\" like you once.

He explained to me once that he likes to keep his different social lives separate, and I was apparently the only one in his \"tech\" social circle. That made me feel like shit, and reinforced my self-view as failing to be a normal human.

Sure as hell feels that way. See, I actually feel like this is happening across the Internet, too, in a different way. Firstly, I'd consider myself some sort of \"Weird Nerd\" but certainly not a genius or even especially intelligent; I would be willing to indulge in the idea that my contingent and I have some unusual qualities that, while not remarkable, are still somewhat unique and indeed basically a package deal with our \"other\" traits. Secondly, while \"weird nerds\" are prominent on the Internet of today, they're definitely struggling to keep control over their own spaces. Anyone remember forums, and have routine thoughts about how different it is from social media? I think that forums were controlled by weird nerds, and social media is clearly not, it's controlled by people who play the political games better and more often. Weird nerds are forced to try to adhere to the rules of this system, they get increasingly tired of it, burn out and start behaving erratically. I think a lot of people are deeply in denial that this is happening, and some of them may have never even known a world where it wasn't happening, so they find other reasons why. Being driven by truth and put off by bullshit is something that I think is very core to a lot of people who are currently struggling to find anywhere to fit in. No matter how much time passes, it will never feel \"right\". It feels like people can only ever be their true and honest selves in small quantities, in closed groups, being careful with who to trust.

Eshraghian View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at \\url{this https URL}.

This is quite useful, as this should make training this type of LLMs much more efficient. So this is a ternary weight LLM using quantization aware training (QAT). The activations are quantized to 8 bits. The matmal is still there, but it is multiplying the 8 bit activations by one bit values. Quantization aware training with low bit weights seems to lead to reduced overfitting by an intrensic tendency to regularize. However, also the model capacity should be reduced compared to a model with the same number of weights and a higher number of bits per weights. It's quite possible that this only becomes apparent after the models have been trained with a significant number of tokens, as LLMs seem to be quite sparse. Edit: In addition to the QAT they also changed the model architecture to use a linear transformer to reduce reliance on multiplications in the attention mechanism. Thanks to logicchains for pointing this out. reply logicchains 3 hours agoparentIt's also a fundamentally different class of model than the original BitNet; it's a linear transformer, without quadratic attention. reply lajamerr 51 minutes agorootparentSo a mishmash of ideas from other papers(Not to downplay the results). This is exciting times of hackery and basically using puzzle pieces and piecing together stuff.

I will correct my original post. reply buildbot 14 hours agoprevWow - This seems at first read to be really impressive work. They got scaling laws up to a reasonable size, 2.7B, and also run a few downstream tasks. Would be interesting to see how a comparable model trained by someone else does, to check their scores against those. They get real (61%!?) memory savings during training, and inference too. On top of all that, they then go build an FPGA core which is programmed with a custom assembler. And their code is posted and works seamlessly with huggingface transformers?! Absolutely going to test this out. reply kgc 8 hours agoparentPlease let us know how the tests go! reply naasking 55 minutes agoprevI feel like all of these transformer reductions to binary or ternary bits are basically constructing an implicit decision tree, where any stage of the process is basically answering a question with yes/no/I don't know answers, where \"I don't know\" basically invokes a continuation for further processing with more context. reply jph00 14 hours agoprevThere was another matmul-free language model paper released a year ago FYI: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17190 reply versteegen 4 hours agoparent> cheap piecewise affine approximation that is achieved by adding the bit representation of the floating point numbers together as integers ... with little to no performance impact > we show that we can eliminate all multiplications in the entire training process, including operations in the forward pass, backward pass and optimizer update, demonstrating the first successful training of modern neural network architectures in a fully multiplication-free fashion.

Specifically, most of the parameters are ternary (i.e. -1, 0, or 1). The approximate gradient discussed in the paper will (I think) give some real gradient on each parameter, and that can be further processed by the learning rate schedule, but the result is still a real number g_i for each parameter a_i. Normally one would update a_i to a_i + g_i, but with these ternary parameters, a_i + g_i isn’t ternary! So what’s the extra trick to make the model stay quantized? Does one evaluate the gradients on a whole bunch of training inputs, add them up, apply some randomness, and then re-quantize the model? Or is it something else? reply logicchains 9 hours agoparentThe original bitnet paper has more information on training: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453 . >To train our 1-bit model, we employ the straight-through estimator (STE)[BLC13] to approximate the gradient during backpropagation. This method bypasses the nondifferentiable functions, such as the Sign (Eq. 2) and Clip (Eq. 5) functions, during the backward pass. STE allows gradients to flow through the network without being affected by these non-differentiable functions, making it possible to train our quantized model. >While the weights and the activations are quantized to low precision, the gradients and the optimizer states are stored in high precision to ensure training stability and accuracy. Following the previous work [LSL+21], we maintain a latent weight in a high-precision format for the learnable parameters to accumulate the parameter updates. The latent weights are binarized on the fly during the forward pass and never used for the inference process. reply amluto 5 hours agorootparentAha, thanks. This seems a bit unfortunate — the training process will end up using a whole lot more memory than inference. I wonder whether one could get away with storing the high precision weights in slow host memory and using the quantized weights for the backward pass, thus keeping them out of GPU memory. reply PaulHoule 7 hours agoprevThis is why the NPU built into your processor could quickly become a liability instead of a benefit. reply sva_ 6 hours agoparentIt's ok, the AMD one still doesn't even work on Linux without a custom kernel reply sva_ 6 hours agoprevThe FPGA in question, Intel FPGA PAC D5005 seems to cost around $8k reply mmoskal 49 minutes agoparentThe FPGA would be only to prove the transistor efficiency.

In fairness, I understand that there are different views on this; I stop one tiny half-step shy of the GNU/FSF position, in that I would argue that people should have complete control of their machines, but that that includes the right to run software that doesn't respect their right to control the machine. reply Sk8Wo 14 hours agoprevublock origin is blocked in china, in same way. otherwise the whole amo would be blocked. see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30740366 reply anon66669938144 11 hours agoparentthat's not even relevant since couldn't you just run adblocking dns script as cronjob with list of ad domains like here? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/h... how china blocks that? ublock sucks anyway if you're using 127.0.0.1:53 with unbound/dnscrypt or something reply hnarn 9 hours agorootparentublock blocks html element in a browser, dns blacklists stop resolution. they’re clearly not the same. reply smsm42 3 hours agoprevDoes Mozilla have any assets or workers located in Russia?

And the reality is Mozilla can always block any extension they want. They can just change the Firefox source code. It doesn't matter what functionality does or doesn't exist now or what the policy they do or don't have – everything can always be changed. That's true for almost anything. So what they \"could do\" is a complete distraction in the first place because the \"could do\" anything. What they ARE doing matters. reply yjftsjthsd-h 13 hours agorootparentNo, pointing out that your claims are conceptually false is a fine look. It's not about things Mozilla could theoretically do to block you, it's that they require you to proactively get their permission to run an extension (in a prod version of the browser on an ongoing basis, which I think is reasonable table stakes). Here's their official docs for self-distribution, i.e. not using the AMO at all: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitti... Notice that step 1 starts with giving Mozilla your extension to approve of, step 4 goes so far as to say that if your extension doesn't pass their checks then > The message informs you of what failed. You cannot continue. Address these issues and return to step 1. then step 7 is make sure Mozilla reviewers can read your source code, step 9 is wait for them to get back to you, and step 13 is download the XPI that Mozilla has approved to be allowed to run in their browser. So yes, you absolutely need Mozilla's approval to publish an extension, even if you self-publish the XPI after they've blessed it. If they do not perform the action of signing it, they don't need to change any source code, it won't install. It may be true that in this case they have given that approval, but that doesn't invalidate the general point, and this is a fundamental restriction, not \"language-lawyering\". reply jwitthuhn 13 hours agorootparentprevI have to disagree that I'm perpetuating any falsehood here. Mozilla literally needs to approve an addon for it to behave normally. That you are satisfied with the process they have for approving doesn't change that. To me it seems absurd for a company that claims to be so pro-privacy to not allow any genuinely private extensions to exist. Anyone who wants to make a 'real' addon has to share their code with mozilla. reply arp242 13 hours agorootparentI actually mostly had the top poster in mind, not you, sorry for the confusion. What you're saying is technically true, but also not relevant, as explained. They can have the best system in place today, and just change Firefox tomorrow. So it doesn't really matter how the system works now. This is true for anything from Mozilla to XFree86 to Redis to left-pad. De-facto reality is that right now anyone can create an account and just create a signing key and distribute their extensions $anywhere. Approval is little more than rubber stamp. Mozilla not going around granting \"approval\" or anything like that. And they certainly didn't revoke the very weak \"approval\" here; people can distribute and install it. It's just not listed on the Russian add-on store. So that makes it doubly irrelevant. reply szundi 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, seems to be exact way out reply 38 14 hours agorootparentprev [–] > You don't need Mozilla's approval; anyone can publish an add-on anywhere and anyone can install it in Firefox.

Published 20 March 2017 Share IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Shipowners and traders meet in shipping agency Lloyd's of London's coffeehouse in 1863 By Tim Harford BBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy Almost a decade ago, I tried to place a bet with a leading UK betting shop that I would die within a year. They should have taken the bet - I am still alive. But they will not gamble on life and death. A life insurance company, by contrast, does little else. Legally and culturally, there is a clear distinction between gambling and insurance. Economically the difference is less visible. Both gambler and insurer agree that money will change hands depending on what transpires in some unknowable future.

Gambling tools such as dice date back millennia - perhaps five thousand years in Egypt. Insurance may be equally old. The Code of Hammurabi - a law code from Babylon, in what is now Iraq - is nearly 4,000 years old. It includes numerous clauses devoted to the topic of \"bottomry\", a kind of maritime insurance bundled together with a business loan. A merchant would borrow money to fund a ship's voyage, but if the ship sank, the loan did not have to be repaid. IMAGE SOURCE, ALAMY Image caption, Many of the provisions of the Code of Hammurabi - as seen on this stone stele - deal with matters of contract and trade Around the same time, Chinese merchants were spreading their risks by swapping goods between ships. If any single ship went down, it would contain a mix of goods from many different merchants. But all that physical shuffling around is a fuss. Much more efficient to structure insurance as a financial contract instead, something the Romans did a few millennia later. Later still, Italian city states like Genoa and Venice developed ever more sophisticated ways to insure the ships of the Mediterranean. Thirst for news Then, in 1687, a coffee house opened on Tower Street, near the London docks. Run by Edward Lloyd, it was comfortable and spacious, and business boomed. Patrons enjoyed the fireside tea and coffee, and - of course - the gossip. There was much to gossip about: London's great plague, the great fire, the Dutch navy sailing up the Thames, and a revolution which had overthrown the king. But above all, the inhabitants of this coffee house loved to gossip about ships: what was sailing from where, with what cargo - and whether it would arrive safely or not. And where there was gossip, there was an opportunity for a wager. IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Lloyd's patrons were happy to speculate on the likely death of Admiral John Byng, who was shot in 1757 The patrons bet, for example, on whether Admiral John Byng would be shot for his incompetence in a naval battle with the French. He was. The gentlemen of Lloyd's would have had no qualms about taking my bet on my own life. Edward Lloyd realised his customers were as thirsty for information to fuel their bets as they were for coffee, and began to assemble a network of informants and a newsletter full of information about foreign ports, tides, and the comings and goings of ships. His newsletter became known as Lloyd's List. IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Lloyd's List was published daily until 2013, when it became online-only Lloyd's coffee house hosted ship auctions, and gatherings of sea captains who would share stories. If someone wished to insure a ship, that could be done too: a contract would be drawn up, and the insurer would sign his name underneath - hence the term \"underwriter\". It became hard to say quite where coffee-house gambling ended and formal insurance began. Eight decades after Lloyd had established his coffee house, a group of underwriters who hung out there formed the Society of Lloyd's. Today, Lloyd's of London is one of the most famous names in insurance. IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Lloyd's is not an insurer: it is a marketplace in which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool risk But not all modern insurers have their roots in gambling. Another form of insurance developed not in the ports, but the mountains. Alpine farmers organised mutual aid societies in the early 16th century, agreeing to look after each other if a cow - or child - fell ill. While the underwriters of Lloyd's viewed risk as something to be analysed and traded, the mutual assurance societies of the Alps saw it as something to be shared. And when the farmers descended from the alps to Zurich and Munich, they established some of the world's great insurance companies. Deep pools of risk Risk-sharing mutual aid societies are now among the largest and best-funded organisations on the planet - we call them \"governments\". Governments initially got into the insurance business as a way of making money, typically to fight a war in the turmoil of Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. Instead of selling ordinary bonds, which paid in regular instalments until they expired, governments sold annuities, which paid in regular instalments until the recipient expired. Easy to supply, and much in demand. Annuities are a form of insurance: they protect an individual against the risk of living so long that all their money runs out. More from Tim Harford The warrior monks who invented banking The compiler: Computing's hidden hero How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream Providing insurance is no longer a mere money-spinner for governments. It is regarded as a core priority to help citizens manage some of life's biggest risks - unemployment, illness, disability and ageing. Faced with these deep pools of risk, private insurers often merely paddle. At least, citizens in richer economies expect insurance from their governments. In poorer countries, governments are not much help against life-altering risks, such as crop failure or illness. And private insurers tend not to take much interest, either. The stakes are too low, and the costs too high. Blurred lines That is a shame, because there is growing evidence that insurance doesn't just provide peace of mind, but is a vital element of a healthy economy. A recent study in Ghana showed that farmers were being held back from specialising and expanding by the risk of drought - a risk against which they couldn't insure themselves. IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Some small scale farmers in Ghana previously struggled to insure themselves When researchers created an insurance company and started selling crop insurance, the farmers bought the the insurance and expanded their businesses. Today, the biggest insurance market of all blurs the line between insuring and gambling: the market in financial derivatives. Derivatives are financial contracts that let two parties bet on something else - perhaps exchange rate fluctuations, or whether a debt will be repaid. They can be a form of insurance. An exporter hedges against a rise in the exchange rate. A wheat farming company covers itself by betting that the price of wheat will fall. The ability to buy derivatives lets companies specialise in a particular market. Otherwise, they would have to diversify - like the Chinese merchants four millennia ago, who didn't want all their goods in one ship. The more an economy specialises, the more it tends to produce. But unlike regular insurance, for derivatives you don't need to find someone with a risk they need to protect themselves against. You just need to find someone willing to take a gamble on any uncertain event anywhere in the world. It is a simple matter to double the stakes - or multiply them by a hundred. As the profits multiply, all that is needed is the appetite to take risks. Before the international banking crisis broke in 2007, the total face value of outstanding derivatives contracts was many times larger than the world economy itself. The real economy became the sideshow, the side bets became the main event. That story did not end well.

    "commentBody": "What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? (2017) (bbc.com)150 points by yamrzou 22 hours agohidepastfavorite262 comments bluecalm 10 hours agoI feel the article as well as most of the comments miss the most important difference between the two. Insurance, assuming the fee isn't too high, increases your utility of money while gambling decrease it. If there is an event that happens 1 time in 100 that costs you $100k and you pay $1.05k to insure against that would have a negative expected value in money terms but positive expected value in utility of money terms. It's hard to model utility of money curve, economists often use logarithm for convenience (it's easy to do math on logarithms) but whatever the specifics we know the function is concave. No one rational is going to flip a coin for their net worth or any significant part of it for example. With this in mind insurance is a service worth paying for as long as the fee is lower than utility you gain from it. In a theoretical case that the fee is 0, that is expected value of money when taking the insurance is 0 you should always take it. In the opening example of 1 in 100 event that would be $1k USD fee. Gambling is the opposite: you voluntarily stake money on event that wouldn't otherwise affect your financial situation. This decreases combined utility of you and your counter-party. Utility is higher if you both have $1000 than if one of you have $0 and the other $2000 for example. Gambling, like excessive drinking or other activities that hurt the population as a whole is viewed as immoral by many moral systems. I think it's hard to argue against that - the more gambling there is the worse off the population is going to be. Not so with insurance. reply mrazomor 4 hours agoparent> With this in mind insurance is a service worth paying for as long as the fee is lower than utility you gain from it. Why even consider the insurance as investment (money increasing tool)? A stock market would get you higher gains at more controlled risk. The 3rd best financial advice I got is about insurances: \"Pay the insurance only if the negative outcome would cause you a significant financial loss\" (and is of relatively high probability) So, insuring a house from fire etc. makes sense. But, my $2k bike is not worth covering (from my PoV). Or, if we go to extreme, my (unnecessary) motorbike/boat/jet ski as if they are destroyed, I can continue living without them (a bit of exaggerated example, but I hope you get my point). Same for insuring a house from unlikely events. reply kgwgk 3 hours agorootparent> Why even consider the insurance as investment (money increasing tool)? Most people wouldn't consider it in that way - unless the risk they're insuring is terribly mispriced or they plan to do some insurance fraud. reply ivancho 3 hours agoparentprevYou haven't demonstrated most of these assertions. For example, if everyone gambled against everyone else every second, then that system has a pretty good chance of staying close to equilibrium for a long time, whereas your model indicates that the total utility would be depleted almost immediately. Whereas if everyone was fully insured for absolutely every risk in their life and immediately received a replacement of the exact same value on any loss, then the overall system would just steadily trend to all the money ending at the insurer, which doesn't seem like increased total utility reply bluecalm 2 hours agorootparent>>You haven't demonstrated most of these assertions. For example, if everyone gambled against everyone else every second, then that system has a pretty good chance of staying close to equilibrium for a long time >>whereas your model indicates that the total utility would be depleted almost i Can you describe specific assumptions about how that \"everyone gambling against everyone else\" would look like? I just don't see how my model could predict total utility being depleted very quickly while the model having good chance to stay close to equilibrium. My model is very simple: apply utility function on wealth. When you model people flipping coins against each other you will see a lot of busted ones and a lot of rich ones pretty quickly and that will mean significant utility decrease. reply ivancho 1 hour agorootparentOk, take 100 people, with $100 each, and have one round of $1 coin flips between each 2. A significant number of bets overall, 4950. Each person has wagered 1% of their net worth 99 times, something that we all agree sounds quite scary. And yet there will be no busted people, most will likely be between $80 and $120. Repeat this 10 times, a ridiculous amount of gambling - still most likely no bankruptcies, and the total utility, if we assume log, has barely dropped by 1%. I simply do not believe that we are making such a subtle societal optimization by frowning upon gambling while encouraging all kinds of other risk taking, like investments and properties. And the other scenario where insurance just acts as a drain on the overall system seems to indicate that it is not inherently positive for utility either reply LorenPechtel 7 minutes agorootparentIt's unlikely anyone's busted but utility is unquestionably lowered. A negative for society. Insurance increases equality, gambling lowers it. reply gdilla 2 hours agorootparentprevwell you can hedge your bets, a form of insurance. people do this with stock too. reply kgwgk 7 hours agoparentprev> This decreases combined utility of you and your counter-party.

Maybe some gamblers can recognise moments they've been irritated where some rule requires insurance, \"let me embrace the risk on my own dammit\" reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentThe edge they have is providing more utility for you dollar, as OP said. That kind of edge is just having a good or service someone would pay for. reply noitpmeder 6 hours agorootparentprevAlso casinos typically take rakes in poker reply treme 5 hours agorootparentEffect of rake makes it such that only about 5% of players show profit in the long run. reply jack_pp 6 hours agorootparentprevindex funds also take a fee reply pfannkuchen 5 hours agoparentprevIsn’t this typically explained via marginal utility, not just utility? You can’t really compare the utility of the same amount of money in the hands of different people, but for a single person each additional unit of money is worth less than the last along some non-linear curve. The $1k you spend on insurance is further along this curve than the first $1k of the insured loss (and the second, and the third, etc) and if you do the naive expected value calculation it ignores this curve. reply JumpCrisscross 5 hours agoparentprev> insurance is a service worth paying for as long as the fee is lower than utility you gain from it Critically, the variable that makes gambling rational is the hedonistic pleasure one derives from it.

Insurance is invariably a \"for profit\" enterprise so the utility or return across all participants has to be lower than the value invested/paid. Clearly you are protecting an unlikely situation so the utility value of peace of mind would need to be quantified. Gambling has utility too...entertainment. How someone measures that is up to them I guess. Excessive gambling, just like excessive insurance, is wasteful as well. IMHO, I don't think your argument stacks up. reply bluecalm 8 hours agorootparent>>Insurance is invariably a \"for profit\" enterprise so the utility or return across all participants has to be lower than the value invested/paid. This is wrong and the reason you are confused about the argument. If insurance is priced fairly all parties benefit utility wise. It's true that the buyer has negative expected value money wise and the seller positive one but as the utility function is concave both parties benefit. The important thing is to be able to see value in insurance. Once you are able to see it you will understand why it's worth a premium. One natural question is why the insurer can afford to sell the insurance and not lose expected utility. The answer is that the insurer has a bigger bankroll and the utility curve is flatter for them than it is for the buyer. That's why they can offer a lower premium than an individual in similar position to the buyer would be. reply derf_ 5 hours agorootparent> It's true that the buyer has negative expected value money wise and the seller positive one... This is obviously the insurer's goal, but in practice competition and relaxing underwriting standards to win business means that many insurance companies do not turn an underwriting profit (the buyer winds up with a positive expected value). But premiums are paid up front and payouts to policy holders do not occur until later, and the insurer can invest the \"float\" in the meantime, so they still make money. Obviously the customer could have taken the premiums and invested them themselves, but that also takes time and effort, and may come with risk itself. It is not obvious that insurance is a bad deal even ignoring arguments about the concave nature of the utility of money. reply JackFr 7 hours agorootparentprevInsurance is not always a for profit enterprise.

Could you please define \"expected value in money terms\" vs \"expected value in utility of money terms\" reply graemep 8 hours agorootparentUtility is quite a complex and badly defined concept - its also central to economics. The idea is that the value to you of an extra amount of money goes down as you have more. i.e. getting £10k could be life changing for a poor person, unnoticeable to a rich one. https://moneyterms.co.uk/utility/ The expected value is the amount multiplied by the chance of getting it. SO if you have a 50% chance of getting £1,000 the expected value is £500. That GP comment is saying is that in the case of insurance the small risk of being wiped out financially vs the certain cost of premiums the expected value is negative (for insurers to be profitable) BUT because the effect on utility of losing a huge amount of money is so bad, the expected value of the utility is positive. reply pydry 6 hours agorootparentIve never seen a definition of utility which wasn't self referencing.

Utility and value might be defined by self referencing each other but that's true for many other concepts or words in a language for that matter. It doesn't make it problematic or unscientific.

Gambling is seen as immoral because it's about extending your exchange value capabilities, although most people who gamble are poor as dirt and a winning bet is often about paying your utility bills and having a day out over being able to do neither (while losing bets contribute to being unable to do either).

It sounds bad. But the relationship between utility and money isn't linear. If for you, $10 is worth 10u and $91 is worth only 89u, this deal has expected value of +0.1u. Why and how isn't it linear? It's a hard problem that can't be answered easily. However we know it's true for most big institutions in stock and bond markets.

Your expected value in utility terms is: u($9k) * 0.5 + u($11k) * 0.5 where u is a function that tells you how much worth you get from money. See wikipedia link for some explanation (although I think the articles are over-complicated and don't convey the point in clear way): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Law_of_Dimini... The key point is that utility is concave (a coin flip for any amount has negative utility) which is obvious when you think about it (better to be a millionaire than flip a coin to be busted or have 2 million net worth) but maybe not something most people think when making everyday decisions. reply CPLX 6 hours agorootparentprevA simpler way of explaining it is that both activities have a negative expected value but insurance usually reduces variance while gambling increases it. In the context of money variance is usually synonymous with instability and unpredictability. Those things are bad and it’s worth paying a fairly priced premium to avoid them. In simple math terms gambling is essentially the opposite dynamic. Of course things that are unpredictable can be entertaining, which is why gambling is correctly viewed as a form of entertainment. reply bluecalm 6 hours agorootparentBut why is reducing variance desirable? It's exactly because there is utility of money function which is concave. Variance being undesirable comes from the shape of utility of money function. reply CPLX 6 hours agorootparentYes that’s one factor. But there’s also a “going bust” factor which is kind of a fundamental dynamic as well. Think of it in terms of life. Once you are dead you’re dead, it’s the end. If the variance in your life outcomes “crosses the zero line” then the game ends, even if it’s just for an hour. You could bend your argument to cover that by arguing that the utility of that last little fraction tends to infinity. Like what would you exchange for the drink of water that would save your life if you were minutes from death? But it’s a bit strained, especially as a way to explain it to someone for whom utility is not already intuitive. I think it’s pretty easy to understand that excessive variance leads to death or very negative outcomes. All you need to demonstrate it is a houseplant and a supply of water, air, and sunshine. If you increase the variance of any of those three things sufficiently you quickly don’t have a houseplant any more, regardless of the average total supply. reply beaeglebeachedd 6 hours agorootparentprevAnd at some point that function bends hard once you hit bankruptcy, for instance many places in US you go to jail if you run out of money, especially if you have children with someone to whom you're not currently married. reply beaeglebeachedd 6 hours agorootparentprevVariance can be good though. Imagine you want some expensive service like a waterline for your house that's difficult to steal but you live under rules of gangsters or oppressive government so holding anything more than a little money at a time is risky.

You quickly pay for the waterline and now you don't have to walk 300 ft to the well everyday. reply jprete 6 hours agorootparentThat's a very contrived scenario and your hypothetical response is very unrealistic. For one thing, the gangsters either wait outside the gambling joint or simply take it outright and farm the rake. For another, real communities with such dynamics don't accumulate cash, they might accumulate tangible goods or a little infrastructure but they are not going to have large sums of cash-equivalents lying around. For all kinds of reasons you need either a high-trust society or an army to accumulate liquid wealth. reply CPLX 2 hours agorootparentMaybe but when you see seemingly irrational behavior by \"the underclass\" it's always worth spending a little more time trying to understand what kinds of issues they may be facing that you're not intuitively aware of. If you've been in the position where every dollar you make gets somehow taken from you without warning for years you'd act differently.

Have a look at this blog for intuitive examples where insurance is beneficial for both the insurer and insured. https://two-wrongs.com/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.htm... The thing that makes or breaks the Kelly criterion is the correct evaluation of risk. If the risk is incorrect then it is garbage-in garbage-out. Due to this uncertainty, people tend to use fractional Kelly criterion. For a car example, my current car price is a significant proportion of my total wealth and the risk of totalling it is perceived by me to be high, so I pay insurance. I say perceived because in 15 years of driving I never totalled a car. But now that I understand the Kelly criterion I will account for how expensive it is proportionately to my wealth and figure the cutoff price where I need to get total coverage insurance and how much it costs. It also explains by cell phone insurance and similar are normally not a good deal, the insured asset is worth a small proportion of my wealth. reply bluecalm 10 hours agoparentIt's not about Kelly Criterion specifically but about utility of money in general.

At the very end it brings up financial derivatives but again does not explain them well or the danger they caused. Is \"insurance\" a type of \"gambling\"? Maybe. But it's quite different from gambling in a US casino (and I presume UK casino). In the US, \"gambling\" refers to wagers placed at known odds, sometimes against other players; legal gambling has limitations on how much money the House can take: e.g. if a casino \"wins\" $100, they must also pay $80 to someone. Again in the US, \"insurance\" (excepting health \"insurance\", which is mostly not insurance) is someone paying a regular premium and the insurer promising to pay if certain events happening to the person, with the government requiring that the insurer keep financial reserves to pay out claims. If you stop paying your premiums, you lose your insurance. If the insured events never happen, the insurer keeps your money. In a sense, insurance is a type of gambling, but closer to buying an umbrella in the morning in case it rains in the afternoon. Financial derivatives were portrayed as insurance but were not regulated as such, and the banks did not keep reserves to pay them out; because folks were also taking \"insurance\" against events that happened to third-parties (i.e. not themselves) it looks a lot like gambling (though they weren't regulated as that, either).

Insurance on the other hand is a small price you pay that, through statistics, allows you move your odds from the ends of the bell curve towards the center.

We don't know what the future holds and we have the choice to insure or gamble on just about any aspect of our lives. Insurance companies are just like casinos in that the math always favours them if you look at a sufficiently large sample size. Even so, some things are still worth insuring. e.g. Your house. Most people do not have enough assets saved up to replace their house should it burn down. Even though your house will likely not burn down, protecting yourself against the loss of something you can't easily afford to replace is worth spending money on. Does it make sense to insure things you can replace though? Consider the \"Instant product replacement\" plans that stores constantly try to sell you. If your monitor dies you can easily absorb the cost of buying a new one. If, instead of buying IPR's on everything, you set aside a similar amount of money, you'll likely soon come out far ahead. Even if you don't, you'll still be able to afford it. Buying IPR's means, on average, you lose money. Not buying IPR's means, on average, you'll save money. The choice is easy. Insure the big, vital things you can't afford to replace. Treat insuring small things as gambling without the fun. reply bluecalm 10 hours agorootparent>>Having insurance is gambling, but not having insurance is also gambling. This is because life itself is a gamble. We don't know what the future holds and we have the choice to insure or gamble on just about any aspect of our lives.

You are already the party in a gamble and insurance is a way out. reply hattmall 15 hours agorootparentprevOnly thing I insure is umbrellas.

I discovered that the University did not have insurance for this, or for a lot of things, because the University was a large organization with a lot of assets and could easily absorb the cost of theft. I'll assume they got the risk analysis right, since they wrote the textbooks on that sort of thing. The math changes though if you are dealing with a non-profit insurance system. For example, becoming a member of a well designed co-op, or a genuine non-profit insurance company (one that returns excess to members rather than pay bonuses to executives). But still there are problems, since not every member brings the same amount of risk, so you get a good deal if you know you are higher risk than the insurance company believes and vice versa. reply doe_eyes 15 hours agorootparentI think this profit-vs-non-profit thinking is reductionist. A non-profit insurer still has expenses. They have to pay their staff, rent offices, pay vendors, and so on. In fact, nothing stops them from spending more than a for-profit corporation would. Anyway, the math doesn't change: the insured still pay more than they are getting back. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentprevNot uncommon for universities to self-insure.

I don’t think these business ever hope for a total loss. It would make no sense. I also don’t think a nonprofit or government can do an adequate job of offering insurance. Let’s ignore health insurance but rather define insurance in the base form as an entity paying out if an event happens. In a for profit model you have multiple agents each evaluating risk and the costs to cover that risk. Ideally enough agents exist that they compete to keep costs low. Certainly sometimes this is not always true. reply hattmall 14 hours agorootparentprev>Also how could insurance ever be a \"for profit\" business? What? They plan to take in more in premiums than they pay out in claims by managing risks and underwriting. In that sense it's like a bookmaker who plans to set a line on a game that results in bets not having an imbalance that outweighs their vigorish. In cases where they do they lay off bets on other bookmakers. It's why they tend to be concentrated on certain areas and the same is true for insurance. Both of those are legitimate for profit businesses that use statistical modeling and risk management to turn profits and provide value to customers. reply baruz 12 hours agorootparent> take in more in premiums Also, prudently investing the insurance float (excess premiums beyond that needed for claims) reply klyrs 8 hours agorootparent> prudently investing the insurance float More gambling! What I find interesting about this question is that insurance companies are the real gamblers. Attempting to frame their clientele as gamblers approaches absurdities such as a limited opportunity to spend, and most importantly, a strict cap on \"reward\" lower than the cost to \"play\" (entry fee for a new car is the policy rate plus a car of equal or greater value). Whereas insurance companies are gambling on both ends: with their customers' potential losses and with their float on the investment market. reply sholladay 14 hours agoparentprevSo far, I have made use of my car insurance policy two times. Each time I regretted it. First was for a rodent that somehow got into the space between the roof and the headliner, then died and made a mess. The second was for hitting a pothole at highway speed, which damaged a wheel and its control arm. In both cases, the insurance company paid the minimum they had to. For the rodent, sure they paid for the ceiling to be disassembled, fixed up, and reassembled. But did they pay for the interior detail that was necessary because of the rodent guts that had dripped from the ceiling? No, of course not. For the pothole, they paid for the wheel and control arm replacement and even one new tire. But did they help me pay for a tire on the other side so the wear could be reasonably symmetrical? No, of course not. How about the alignment I obviously got, which isn’t strictly necessary but really should be done after such an incident and installing a new drive wheel? No, of course not. Oh and they categorically consider hitting a pothole to be the driver’s fault, no matter the circumstances, so they raised the insurance premium on me. They made all of their money back within 18 months and now I’m still paying the higher rate. Insurance is such a scam. The company makes a profit despite their team of employees because they always price the premium above your level of risk. If the math made any sense for the customer, the company would break even or go bankrupt. I wouldn’t have insurance but it’s required in my state. The one good thing I can say about it is it helps ensure victims of car accidents get their medical bills paid for regardless of the financial status of the driver. reply tjohns 14 hours agorootparentInsurance is primarily for major events. The things at the extreme upper end of the bell curve. For example, you've hit another car (possibly an expensive one) and caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage. Or you've inured a passenger and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of hospital bills. The kinds of events that would financially ruin you, or at least seriously set you back on your life goals. Or, in the case of state-mandated insurance, where there's a high likelihood you wouldn't be able to make the other party whole. You can use it on smaller things if you insist (and your rates will go up), but that's not really what it's for. Personally, both the events you described fall under my definition of one-off maintenance (\"things that are an unpredictable yet unavoidable cost of owning a vehicle\") and that I'd expect to pay for out of pocket. reply efitz 11 hours agorootparentAnd that is one of the reasons why medical insurance is so crazy in the United States nowadays - it’s no longer used to hedge catastrophic unpredictable events (which used to be called “major medical”), but instead is used to pay for normal, minor consumption or for chronic conditions. In other words it’s no longer like a bet, it’s like a discount plan. But the problem is that the complexity of introducing a third party payer who doesn’t want to pay, and a consumer who has no incentive to self regulate consumption, means that the costs spiral up and up. reply scott_w 10 hours agorootparent> But the problem is that the complexity of introducing a third party payer who doesn’t want to pay, and a consumer who has no incentive to self regulate consumption, means that the costs spiral up and up. The first part is correct but a consumer that “doesn't self regulate consumption” is not a thing in medicine. People don’t take drugs for fun. People don’t injure themselves more in public healthcare systems. In fact, a huge problem in medicine is getting men to go to the doctor before issues become critical (and more expensive). reply mcculley 5 hours agorootparentPeople eating more than they should, getting diabetes, and then consuming more medical services is a form of poor regulation of consumption. The overapplication of OxyContin is another form of unregulated consumption. Now we have the semaglutides and will see the same effect. reply scott_w 3 hours agorootparentThe USA has a 38% obesity rate vs the UK at 29% (for men). Given both exist quite far apart on the public/private healthcare debate, I don’t see how this supports your argument at all. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670332/ I’m not going to debate the others because I don’t know much about them and, since your argument fell apart at light prodding, I don’t think you do, either. reply mcculley 3 hours agorootparentI was not making an argument about the public/private healthcare debate. I am objecting to the assertions 'a consumer that “doesn't self regulate consumption” is not a thing in medicine' and 'People don’t take drugs for fun.' I was similarly convinced that moral hazard in healthcare was not a problem because consumers don't get more healthcare than they need. I know now that this is not the case. reply scott_w 2 hours agorootparentI’m not making a public/private argument either. The full sentence was: > But the problem is that the complexity of introducing a third party payer who doesn’t want to pay, and a consumer who has no incentive to self regulate consumption, means that the costs spiral up and up. Obviously, people do eat to excess, engage in activities that have risk (and die as a result). Whether you pay or someone else pays does not factor in these decisions, which is why I pointed to obesity rates in UK/USA to demonstrate this. If such moral hazard existed, you’d see lower obesity in the USA than in the UK. You don’t, ergo, it mustn’t. EDIT: By “take drugs for fun” I’m specifically referring to medical drugs in my original message so removed it from this one (where I conflated with recreational drugs). reply mcculley 2 hours agorootparentOxyContin is a medical drug. I have unfortunately had to assist my mother with visits to the \"pain clinic\" and seen firsthand many patients with a problem with self regulation of consumption. Maybe I am interpreting your assertions too literally. reply scott_w 1 hour agorootparentOk but I’m guessing you’re in the USA where you’d have to pay significant sums for that in some form, as long as you can convince a doctor to sign off. I’m not aware of a similar problem in England, where prescriptions are currently £9.90 per prescription. This is my point: the financial cost, as with obesity, is not regulating the behaviour. reply mcculley 1 hour agorootparentAh, now I understand why you are confused. No, most people with health problems in the U.S. are paying, at most, only a copay for a visit. They are getting medical treatment at no cost to them directly. It is paid for by an insurer or the state or Federal government. This moral hazard is fundamental to our problem and why many have problems regulating their consumption. reply scott_w 1 hour agorootparentExcept this simply DOESN’T HAPPEN in the most famous free healthcare system on Earth, so clearly it can’t be a moral hazard. I also know for a fact these people aren’t getting this for “free.” I just checked and copay is subject to the deductible. Also, I seriously doubt insurance companies aren’t ramping up premiums on these people once they get a chance. Are these people seriously going “well it’s only $26 a pop so I may as well.” Do you think the (apparently) low price is what’s causing this? reply mcculley 1 hour agorootparentI believe that you have strong opinions of the system with which I have too much experience. Many of these people are, in the case of pain clinics, getting their pills paid for by workers’ compensation carriers. That the UK has avoided some moral hazards does mean that they cannot exist elsewhere. Maybe the UK doesn’t incentivize doctors to hand out more pills. reply abenga 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd that is why the insurance model should not be used for healthcare. For example, why should an insurance company charge you anything less than the cost of treating a chronic illness after diagnosis? Why should the minimum price of giving birth not be the exact premium you pay? None of those are surprises (after the initial diagnosis or conception, of course, and it can obviously be argued that birthing complications can be insured against too), so there is no reason to use probabilistic models to pay for them. reply bruce343434 8 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is price fixing deals between hospitals and insurers, where the insurer pays only a tiny fraction of the retail price.

People buy what is cheapest on a price comparison site. They do not consider reputation for trying not to pay, or customer service very much (because there are either no metrics or unclear ones). The same applies to things like internet connectivity. People look only at price and download speed.

Does your state require comprehensive/collision insurance? I've only lived places where you would be permitted to get liability-only insurance which would specifically not cover either of the situations you think you got screwed on. (Neither of which is why most people get insurance anyway. You get car-insurance beyond the legal minimum because while you will likely pay more in the long run, you won't have to deal with a surprise tens-of-thousands replacement bill out of nowhere if you accidentally total your car. Or because you have a loan and your lender doesn't trust you to go without it - of course, if you truly don't need insurance for something, you likely don't need a loan for it either. This is generally non-controversial and the \"obviously it's a bad deal because the insurance company exists and pays salaries\" hot take is... duh? well known? not an insight?) reply infecto 10 hours agorootparentprevOf course insurance companies need to make a profit. That does not mean they are scams. Hitting a pothole will almost always be either your fault or the local governments fault.

If you pay and things go badly, things go a lot less badly. Counter: your belief about insurance is inverted from reality because your notion of what constitutes winning vs losing at insurance is backwards. You lose at insurance by not having any circumstances that lead to payout. You win at insurance by having it actually do something for you. Dying is losing at life, but it's winning at life insurance. Buying insurance is very literally betting that something expensive/bad will happen sooner rather than later or never, where the expected payout exceeds the expected cost to you. Selling insurance is betting the opposite, while, exactly like a casino, making sure that the sum of inflow stays greater than the sum of outflow. > Gambling is all about risking it all. It's an activity that sits at the extremes of the bell curve. You win it all, you lose it all. Insurance on the other hand is a small price you pay that This ignores the fact that many (most?) personal insurances are paid over and over and over and over again, because when you stop paying they stop paying too, and they all always cost more than they expect to pay. Every month you pay for health insurance and you don't get sick, that amount you spent is lost. Every time you insure an electrical appliance that doesn't break, the money you spent is lost. This is exactly like any other gambling loss. You gloss over that part by saying \"but you have your health and that's good\", which is absolutely true, but perversely not what you paid for. reply pdonis 20 hours agorootparent> You lose at insurance by not having any circumstances that lead to payout. You win at insurance by having it actually do something for you. You are misunderstanding what insurance is for. The benefit that insurance conveys for the person insured is not that it is supposed to make money. It is risk avoidance. Without insurance, you might pay zero, or you might pay a very large sum that you can't afford. With insurance, you pay a predictable sum periodically, no matter what happens, and the insurance company is the one taking the risk of either paying zero or a very large sum, which hopefully the company can afford. In other words, just as the GP said, insurance is the opposite of gambling. In gambling, you accept the huge variance in payoff. In insurance, you transfer that risk to someone else. > Every time you pay and nothing bad happens leading to payout, that amount you spent that month is lost No, it isn't. You are getting something of value to you in return: risk avoidance. If that is of no value to you, then don't buy insurance. You might not regret it. But then again, you might. reply BugsJustFindMe 20 hours agorootparent> The benefit that insurance conveys for the person insured is not that it is supposed to make money. Presuming you mean ending with more money than you started, gambling isn't either. Pay in vs pay out has no relation whatsoever to that except in passing. > It is risk avoidance. These are the same thing dressed in different names. There's only no making money on health insurance in the sense that you don't get to keep the money, but the only reason you're not \"making\" that money is because you have just incurred medical debt that the given money is obligated to cover per the terms. It's exactly the same as giving the money directly into your pocket on the condition that you use it immediately to clear your medical debt. You \"made\" all that money. You just also owe the full amount to someone else too. Consider term life insurance instead, where there is no extreme debt obligated to cover and your next of kin does just actually get a fat check. reply pdonis 20 hours agorootparent> Presuming you mean ending with more money than you started, gambling isn't either. That's true, but it doesn't mean insurance and gambling are the same thing. > These are the same thing dressed in different names. No, they're not. In gambling, I accept the risk involved in a wide variance in payoffs, for the entertainment value involved (since I can imagine that I might be a big winner); on net I am paying money for entertainment. In insurance, I transfer the risk involved in a wide variance in payoffs, for the peace of mind of not having to worry about being bankrupted if a rare but catastrophic event occurs; on net I am paying money for peace of mind (since I don't have to imagine that I might be a big loser). > Consider term life insurance instead But your next of kin only gets a payout if you die during the term. If you don't, nobody gets any payout and all the premiums you paid are lost. Which, since insurance companies make money selling term life insurance, is the expected average result. So on net, you do not make money buying term life insurance--but, as above, you might still do it if the peace of mind involved is worth it to you. > your next of kin does just actually get a fat check. But they are losing you--and even if we go to extreme cynicism about that, they are losing whatever income and other goods and services you provided, for which the check will hopefully be enough to compensate them. So it's not a pure gain with no offsetting loss, even leaving out the premiums paid. reply BugsJustFindMe 20 hours agorootparent> But your next of kin only gets a payout if you die during the term. If you don't, nobody gets any payout and all the premiums you paid are lost. Yes, aka gambling. > But they are losing you That is true AND it is not what you paid for. Just like health insurance isn't paying for health but rather for coverage of bills related to loss of health. Being healthy is a win for health but not a win for buying health insurance. Being alive is a win for living but not a win for buying life insurance. reply pdonis 18 hours agorootparent> That is true AND it is not what you paid for. You're qubbling. You paid for replacement of the income and goods and services you can no longer provide, in the event of your death. Sure, that doesn't replace you in the eyes of your beneficiaries (assuming we're not taking the extremely cynical viewpoint about that), but of course nothing can replace you in that sense. However, if your beneficiaries are financially secure enough that they do not need the insurance payout, i.e., if they're not depending on you for income or goods and services, then you should not be buying life insurance: you should be spending the premiums on something with a positive expected rate of financial return. The only reason to buy insurance in the first place is if your beneficaries are depending on you and will need something to replace you financially if you are no longer there. reply adw 17 hours agorootparentNo, the other poster is actually right. In betting on outcomes, there are two roles - bet (“long”) and lay (“short”). An insurance company is exactly a bookmaker; they are buying a bunch of risk and being paid a vig (or in the case of long-duration bets and life insurance, getting the carry) on each of those risks. This is indistinguishable from insurance, particularly when the beneficiary of insurance isn’t the subject (key-person insurance, for example, which you can view life insurance as a form of). You’re saying that because these are morally different - which I don’t actually believe, given that options trading is another equivalent form of hedging/speculation, but I will grant - these are different things. But “fire which I use to cook dinner” and “fire which I use to torch a car during a riot” are both fire; the goal is different, but the object used is not. Let’s say I hedge a bunch of political risk by betting on politics. How is that different from buying a custom insurance policy from Lloyd’s or engaging in a bunch of interest rate swaps? Drawing a distinction between betting and insurance on those lines is the same thing as saying “being long in a stock is morally good, being short in a stock is morally bad”, and I don’t think that position holds up. reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentIn general, you are not able to buy insurance for more than the value of something. If you could, that would be a form of gambling. But up until that line it's anti-gambling. Buying a position out of nowhere is gambling. Buying a position to directly counteract the position you already have is not gambling. If you short 50 shares of a stock when you already owned 80 shares, you are doing the opposite of gambling. You are reducing your position. reply adw 13 hours agorootparentI would describe every single one of these as active risk management - and the difference between one sort of active risk management and another is vibes, not reality. There’s an implied moral judgment here that gambling is inherently bad. I don’t think gambling is inherently immoral; I think mismanaging risk (in either direction) is one of the ways people mess themselves up and therefore encouraging people to take bad risks is immoral. This is not quite the same thing, though it’s close - but the difference between these two positions is what led to prohibition. Don’t get me wrong, bookies are awful in many ways, but so are bars and crypto exchanges and E*Trade. The right approach in all cases is harm reduction. reply Dylan16807 12 hours agorootparentThe difference is not vibes! Reducing your position is the opposite of increasing your position, and those things are very objective. If someone has an equal number of short and long shares in a single company, they are not gambling. Surely we can agree on that, right? We don't have to use the word gambling, we can say they're not investing either. Their money does not change at all based on the stock market or any other external factors. Now what if they have more short or more long shares. We can say that gambling or investing is happening, right? What do we call the process of moving from a net-nonzero position toward net zero? Isn't it the opposite of gambling? Or the opposite of investing? reply scott_w 9 hours agorootparentprev> the goal is different, but the object used is not. That’s not how the English language works. Insurance is a noun (I have insurance) but gambling is not (you can not possess a gamble). In your analogy, you would “cook” your food or “commit arson.” The purpose of your action is intrinsically tied to the words we use to describe it. Gambling is engaging in a game of chance to get a favourable outcome. Insuring is paying money now to mitigate the risk of losing more money later. The fact that both are financial activities doesn’t mean they’re the same thing. reply hattmall 14 hours agorootparentprevIn your scenario, you are using gambling as insurance, and that's different. If you bet $20 on the Greenfeet it's not because something bad happens to you if they win. reply adw 13 hours agorootparentYou’re using a tool and choosing to give the tool different names based on how you feel about it. If I’m the landlord of a pub in Glasgow, and Scotland get to the finals of Euro 2024 (we won’t, but work with me here), betting on Scotland losing the final is a reasonable hedge against the profits you’ll lose when everyone goes home depressed after the final rather than buying another round. Is that a contrived example? A little bit, but it’s structurally reasonable. (If you’re a sponsor of the Scotland team, gambling on the result could be hedging media risk). Can you leverage yourself up? Yes, but you can do that in the stock exchange or futures market too. They’re all the same thing. reply scott_w 9 hours agorootparentNo, betting on the Scotland game to try and hedge expected profit loss doesn’t turn it into insurance. The payout isn’t tied to the thing you want to hedge, so it’s just hedging your bets (gambling payout vs beer sales). Insurance might be a kind of “hedging” but in a limited way that makes it not gambling. reply lucianbr 13 hours agorootparentprevIsn't the fact that you cand use gambling as insurance and insurance as gambling support the idea that they are the same? If it all depends on the context, then it's not the activity that is different, but the context. To me it sounds like you're saying whenever you like it, you will call it insurance, and whenever you don't like it, you will call it gambling. \"It\" is not apriori anything, until you have decided what you want to call it. That makes it all the same thing, pretty much. reply csande17 11 hours agorootparentYou can use some gambling products as insurance, but insurance products are designed so you cannot use them as gambling. At least in terms of products sold broadly to the general public, which is the main situation where people worry about gambling being immoral. As other commenters mention, the main way this works is by making it impossible to \"win\" at insurance. You aren't hoping for the rare payout event to happen, like you would be when gambling. Having your house burn down, or getting into a car accident, or needing treatment for cancer, or dying are all really bad even if insurance reimburses the monetary costs involved. This is probably why the concept of \"insurable interest\" exists; without it, it would be possible to use insurance products as gambling. reply brightlancer 19 hours agorootparentprev> There's only no making money on health insurance Health \"insurance\" is mostly not insurance: it's a healthcare plan for periodic maintenance and minor incidents combined with an insurance plan for large and catastrophic incidences. When I buy car insurance, they don't give me 4 free (or even discounted) oil changes a year. Car insurance exists for large and catastrophic incidences. Same with home insurance. Actual health _insurance_ plans are much cheaper than healthcare plans, but they also only cover large and catastrophic incidences. reply FireBeyond 14 hours agorootparent> Health \"insurance\" is mostly not insurance: it's a healthcare plan for periodic maintenance and minor incidents combined with an insurance plan for large and catastrophic incidences. Precisely. You/your employer pay a premium. Then you have a deductible. Then your \"insurance\" company has the unmitigated gall to also include \"co-pays\" (which are on top of your deductible, as well as after meeting it), AND \"co-insurance\" (even if you've already met your deductible)... AND then they'll refer to it as \"your contribution to your healthcare costs\". I suppose that is somewhat accurate but still... Imagine your car gets totaled. Your insurer says \"Hey, we're going to pay out $25K for your vehicle. So you have a $1,000 deductible, so that's $24,000, and then your copay for a total loss is $2,000, that brings us down to $22,000, and for total losses, your coinsurance as your contribution for your vehicle coverage is 20% which is $5,000 so here's a check for $17,000.\" I know it exists in certain very limited contexts, but if it weren't for all the regulatory capture, I could easily see companies that say \"We'll negotiate bulk discounts with these providers. Everything else is on you. Pay for what you use.\" reply aleph_minus_one 18 hours agorootparentprev> You are misunderstanding what insurance is for. The benefit that insurance conveys for the person insured is not that it is supposed to make money. It is risk avoidance. I buy a lottery ticket as an insureance against the risk that I won't become rich if the right lottery number become picked. :-) reply NovemberWhiskey 18 hours agorootparentprevThe difference between insurance and gambling is about what happens to your risk - whether it's a hedge or not. When you buy insurance, you pay a premium to make you whole should a random event occur in the future. You exchange a payment for certainty about future cash flows with respect to the insured risk. When you place a bet, you do the opposite. You exchange a payment for uncertainty about future cash flows with respect to the subject of the bet. If you insure against a risk to which you're not exposed (like: you take out a life insurance policy on a person you don't know with you as the beneficiary), then yes - that's risk taking rather than hedging. Commodities futures have similar aspects: if you're an aluminum producer then you can trade futures in order to reduce your exposure to variations in the market price. On the other hand, if you're a hedge fund trading those futures then you're probably doing the opposite - looking for exposure to risk. If you're going to take the position that a known cashflow now that returns an uncertain cashflow in the future is \"gambling\" then essentially all forms of economic activity are \"gambling\". It's reductio ad absurdum. reply snotrockets 14 hours agorootparentMind you, in the US, you are not allowed to take a life insurance on a person you don’t know (but you are allowed to buy a life insurance that person had taken on themselves) reply FireBeyond 14 hours agorootparentCue flashbacks to Walmart buying life insurance for its employees (with Walmart as the beneficiary)... ... and the oh-so-charming way they referred to it at head office: \"Dead Peasants Insurance\". reply sethammons 11 hours agorootparentIt is a derogatory industry term, also called janitor insurance.

As said, it simply reduces variance in your life/business. You have to choose if that's how you want to live your life. reply BugsJustFindMe 20 hours agorootparent> it simply reduces variance Mostly I agree. That doesn't make it not gambling though. reply pdonis 20 hours agorootparent> That doesn't make it not gambling though. Yes, it does. As I said in response to you elsewhere, insurance means not accepting huge variance in payoff, whereas gambling means you do accept it. They're opposites of each other. The fact that the counterparties in both cases--insurance companies and casinos--end up making money from all of their customers on net does not mean the two things are the same. reply Almondsetat 20 hours agorootparentprevIf gambling and insurance were the same you would be able to both frame insurance as a form of gambling and gambling as a form of insurance. reply vbezhenar 17 hours agorootparentIMO the main difference is that insurance provides two good outcomes while gambling only one. So you're buying car insurance. There are two outcomes: either your car will survive another year or you'll crash. First outcome: you're happy because you've got a survived car. Second outcome: you're happy because you've got insurance payout. Now you're buying lottery ticket. First outcome: you won the lottery and you've got the prize. Second outcome: you didn't win the lottery and you lost your money spent on lottery ticket. reply BugsJustFindMe 20 hours agorootparentprevI believe I said that insurance is gambling, not that all gambling is insurance. If not I apologize. So I should be covered by what I already said elsewhere, that buying insurance is betting (aka gambling) that a bad thing will happen sooner rather than later or never. Now is all gambling insurance? Hmm. Maybe betting that something will happen is equivalent to insuring against its happening not financially benefiting you. Boom. reply lucianbr 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are multiple comments in this thread doing exactly that. reply lostmsu 20 hours agorootparentprev> You can choose to live your life without insurance No, in many cases you can't. Health, car, homeowners, and renter's insurances are mandatory until you are wealthy. reply seanmcdirmid 19 hours agorootparentHealth insurance isn’t mandatory in the USA. It’s a bad idea not to have it though. You might get away without insurance when you are young, however, assuming nothing bad happens. Without being able to price discriminate on pre-existing conditions, however, it’s not really free market insurance anymore. Liability Car insurance is mandatory only if you use public roads, which most people do. Collision insurance is only needed if you have a bank loan. Homeowner’s insurance is needed for a mortgage, renter insurance is required by a landlord. You can avoid most of these insurances if you are really rich, but most rich people carry even more insurance because they have more to lose, so they will have umbrella policies, for example. Ironically, it’s the really poor who can get out of having insurance: many states aren’t going to throw you in jail if you drive without a license or insurance, so now other people need uninsured driver insurance. Heck, it’s way too common where I live that many people have no insurance, even if our state requires really low levels of coverage. Health insurance is only needed if you have assets the hospital can sue for, but you will be going to the ER for everything so that sucks. reply lostmsu 15 hours agorootparentWell sure, if you are willing to violate a few laws you don't have to get insurance. reply sailfast 20 hours agorootparentprevInsurance (outside of health insurance, which is not insurance in the typical sense) hedges your \"bet\" so it's not gambling to me. Your bet is that you'll drive a car without an accident. Insurance hedges that bet to reduce downside risk if there is an accident. You're paying a small amount to avoid a large loss, on purpose, knowing that it may not happen. You're not trying to get more out of it than you put in (at least on purpose) because that's fraud. Doesn't sound like a bet to me... reply BugsJustFindMe 19 hours agorootparent> Your bet is that you'll drive a car without an accident. That's the ideal outcome, but it is not the bet being made by the person buying insurance. In fact the opposite. If you believed that you wouldn't have an accident you would not buy insurance. You buy insurance because you believe that you will likely have an accident at some point and that the accident will happen either soon enough or seriously enough that the cost of covering the accident will be greater than the total cost of insurance up to that point. reply thephyber 11 hours agoparentprevThis is mostly wrong. Gambling doesn’t require that you “risk it all”. In this way, your entire post looks like it’s arguing against a straw man. There is a way to gamble in which it is very similar to insurance — extremely defensive and conservative. But that means the gambler isn’t “enjoying” gambling, they are instead just being an accountant, but not earning a salary for it. They are both games of chance, but you fail to point out why gambling is most frequently outlawed: it is a compulsive behavior that becomes addictive in some people. When 11% of a society can’t maintain a gainful living (maybe they can’t hold a job or they become a habitual liar or a thief to feed their habit), governments tend to step in to dissuade the problematic behavior. But most people who gamble frequently tend to do it with their lizard brain and most people who purchase insurance do it with their cognitive brain (even if the underlying reasons aren’t based on facts). Then again, the premise of the question is arguably wrong. The state lottery is one of the biggest forms of gambling and that isn’t illegal (even though the origins were to supplant similar mob-run games). reply pdonis 20 hours agoparentprev> Gambling is all about risking it all. I would say that gambling is about paying for entertainment, much like lotteries. Your overall expectation is that you will lose money, but the entertainment value of being able to imagine yourself winning a huge pot compensates for that. Of course the above assumes that you can afford to lose the amount of money you are gambling. The few times in my life I have gambled, that was always my approach: I set aside an amount I was willing to lose all of, and if I got to the point where it was gone, I stopped. But of course many people who gamble do not take that approach. reply nhggfu 20 hours agoparentprev\"Gambling is all about risking it all\" a blanket statement which is not true. gambling is about risk / reward management. there are bad gamblers and good gamblers. a good poker player for example employs bankroll management to avoid going broke due to variance (expected downswings) [1] and their game-play decisions are driven by math.

It (generally) cannot be turned into money. There is extrinsic value to reducing risk. reply lucianbr 13 hours agorootparentBut you are only able to hedge the money part of the risk. Life insurance does not bring anyone back, and health insurance only repairs your health as much as can be done with money. You can't insure against incurable diseases, as in the risk remains. You will just get some money to hopefully feel better, or for your children. Same with insuring some painting let's say. You can get enough money to buy a different painting, but the risk of losing that particular painting is still there. If it is a unique painting and it gets lost, how are they going to repair the non-monetary value of it? They can't. Hedging the risk of being shot by wearing armour sounds like actual hedging. Buying insurance against being shot sounds like just betting. The non-money part is exactly the difference, and it is missing in insurance. reply abenga 9 hours agorootparentYes, you are hedging against financial loss. Most of the other stuff you describe, e.g. sentimental value of one painting vs another, are irrelevant to insurance. You pay a (relatively) small amount to eliminate the risk or mitigate the effect of getting a massive (specifically financial) loss. reply JeffL 11 hours agoparentprevInsurance for the consumer is lowering your expected value to reduce variance.

Insurance helps mitigate a low-probability risk. Gambling provides a low-probability chance of a big reward. Socially the presence of a small number of really destitute people is a problem, so we moralize the process to prevent it as “bad.” The presence of a small number of really rich people is, like, neutral or negative, so we don’t moralize the a thing they produces them as good. It is a bit weird that we don’t moralize the rich as good in this case, given that we often do do that. Not sure what’s up there. Maybe gambling is uncomfortable because produces rich that aren’t seen as deserving somehow. reply elijaht 21 hours agorootparent> I think they are on different sides of 50% probability.

Insurance is hedging against the value of something you have an interest in (which takes the form of a bet against that thing). Gambling is betting on a thing. So a short option on a stock (betting against it) would be: a) insurance if taken out by the company, or a shareholder, or someone with stake in the business b) gambling if done by a random third party There's a moral component to the definition. reply kortilla 16 hours agorootparentThere’s nothing moral. It’s gambling either way. The only confusion comes from people who bend over backwards to convince themselves they aren’t gambling because of weird “it’s a sin” morals that leak into their mind. Betting against a company by shorting has no different moral component than betting on a company by investing. Either way you aren’t doing work and are taking risk to get a higher return. Insurance products have different risk curves but they are still gambling. Someone can buy a ton of garbage houses, buy bunch of insurance, and just hope they burn down for the payout. reply Almondsetat 21 hours agorootparentprev>Where exactly on which exact bell curve does gambling stop and insurance start?

It was by far the largest logistical event in Sweden's history.[3] Headlamp sold in Sweden not long before Dagen H. Opaque decal blocks the lens portion that would provide low beam upkick to the right, and bears warning \"Not to be removed before 3 September 1967\". A pair of coloured gloves used in 1967 by Swedish authorities in order to remind drivers they should drive on the right as the traffic was changed Sign at the border crossing in four languages reminding of the right hand drive in Norway Background[edit] There were various arguments for the change: All neighbouring countries drive on the right, including Norway and Finland, with which Sweden shares land borders, with five million vehicles crossing annually.[4] Approximately 90 percent of Swedes drove left-hand drive vehicles,[4] and this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane highways.[5] City buses were among the very few vehicles that conformed to the normal opposite-steering wheel rule, being right-hand drive (RHD).[6] However, the change was unpopular; in a 1955 referendum, 83 percent voted to keep driving on the left. Nevertheless, the Swedish Parliament approved Prime Minister Tage Erlander's proposal on 10 May 1963 of right-hand traffic beginning in 1967, as the number of cars on the road tripled from 500,000 to 1.5 million and was expected to reach 2.8 million by 1975.[7] The Swedish Commission for the Introduction of Right-Hand Driving (Statens högertrafikkommission, HTK) was established to oversee the change.[8] It also began implementing a four-year education programme on the advice of psychologists.[5] The public information campaign leading up to Dagen H included extensive advertising, road markings, and even distribution of reminder items like gloves and stickers to ensure everyone was aware of the change. The campaign included displaying the Dagen H logo on various commemorative items, including milk cartons and underwear.[5][9] Swedish television held a contest for songs about the change, and the winning entry was \"Håll dig till höger, Svensson\" ('Keep to the right, Svensson') written by Expressen journalist Peter Himmelstrand[2] and performed by The Telstars.[10] As Dagen H neared, every intersection was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic. Workers roamed the streets early in the morning on Dagen H to remove the plastic. A parallel set of lines was painted on the roads with white paint, then covered with black tape. Before Dagen H, Swedish roads had used yellow lines.[citation needed] Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, including some 20,000 in Stockholm alone.[11] Vehicles had to have their original left-hand-traffic headlamps replaced with right-traffic units. One of the reasons the Riksdag pushed ahead with Dagen H despite public unpopularity was that most vehicles in Sweden at the time used inexpensive, standard-size round headlamps, but the trend towards more expensive model-specific headlamps had begun in continental Europe and was expected to spread through most other parts of the world. Further delay in changing over from left- to right-hand traffic would have greatly increased the cost burden to vehicle owners.[citation needed] The switch[edit] On Dagen H, Sunday, 3 September 1967, all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 01:00 to 06:00. Any vehicles on the roads during that time had to come to a complete stop at 04:50, then carefully change to the right-hand side of the road and stop again (to give others time to switch sides of the road and avoid a head-on collision) before being allowed to proceed at 05:00. In Stockholm and Malmö, however, the ban was longer – from 10:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday – to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections.[12] Certain other towns also saw an extended ban, from 15:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday.[citation needed] One-way streets presented unique problems. Bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street. Intersections had to be reshaped to allow traffic to merge.[citation needed] Results[edit] The relatively smooth changeover saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents.[13] On the day of the change, only 157 minor accidents were reported, of which only 32 involved personal injuries, with only a low number being serious.[14] On the Monday following Dagen H, there were 125 reported traffic accidents, compared to a range of 130 to 198 for previous Mondays, none of them fatal. Experts suggested that changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking, as people already drove left-hand drive vehicles, thereby having a better view of the road ahead; additionally, the change caused a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the actual level, and thus was followed by very cautious behaviour that caused a major decrease in road fatalities. Indeed, fatal car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result, and the number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%.[citation needed] These initial improvements did not last, however. The number of motor insurance claims returned to \"normal\" over the next six weeks and, by 1969, the accident rates were back to the levels seen before the change.[15][16][17] Trams in central Stockholm, in Helsingborg and most lines in Malmö (which ultimately abolished its tram system in 1973) were withdrawn and replaced by buses, and over one thousand new buses were purchased with doors on the right-hand side. Some 8,000 older buses were retrofitted to provide doors on both sides, while Gothenburg and Malmö exported their left-traffic buses to Pakistan and Kenya.[18] Although all road traffic in Sweden changed to the right-hand side, railways and metro systems did not switch to the new rule and continued to drive on the left, with the exception of tram systems. Additionally, many of them were abandoned as a result of Dagen H; only the trams in Norrköping and Gothenburg and three suburban lines in the Stockholm area (Nockebybanan and Lidingöbanan) survived. Gothenburg faced high costs for reconfiguring trams, while Stockholm's budget only covered purchasing new buses, since the remaining lines had bidirectional trams with doors on both sides. In any event, most trams in Stockholm were replaced by the metro, a decision made long before the Dagen H decision.[citation needed] Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the right in May 1968, on a day known as H-dagurinn.[13] See also[edit] 730 (transport) Switch to right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia Transport in Sweden Switch to right-hand traffic in Iceland References[edit] ^ Ttnyhetsbyrn (26 January 2022). \"Sidbyte genom kameralinsen\" [Driving side switch through the camera lens].

And we're forever greatful that they did. Presumably people thought it would be inconvenient and voted no, while politicians realized the cost of doing it later would be much larger than just ripping the band aid off. At the time, the number of massive motorway crossings and similar was probably nearly zero. Today the cost would be unimaginable. We would have caved in the 70s at the latest, and at a cost many times larger. reply air7 2 hours agoparentMy optimistic take on this is that the politicians of the time had the actual peoples' best interests at heart and realized that even though the change was unpopular, it was the right thing to do and that people would eventually realize that. I'm sure very few of those 83% held their opinion a few years after the change. Also 83% is really a lot... While seemingly obviously correct now, the vast majority didn't see it that way then. I can only assume that If I was there I would be against it too.

The problem isn't mass media, the problem is that they did use this card many times over the past decades to promote neoliberal policies, and in retrospect it's clear that nobody is thanking them. The main lesson is that you can indeed force things on people, and when you do so for good reasons you'll be thanked later, but you must do it wisely and be sure that people will thank you, otherwise you're just destroying public's confidence in politicians (which doesn't matter to the neoliberals anyway, since they don't think State is a valuable institustion in the first place…) reply boxed 3 hours agoparentprevIt's funny.

An hour or two after traffic switched, TV broadcast from Svinesund, the biggest of the road crossings to Norway, and a major route for road haulage, and a reporter said something like \"here we have the driver of a Norwegian 18-wheeler, . Well, , what do think of the big reform?\" Norwegian, looking a little dense and speaking slowly: \"Uh, what reform?\" There was big signage everywhere. The reporter tried dropping a hint, the Norwegian truck driver refused to have noticed any change in the driving rules. Camera showed the very big 18-wheeler. The reporter dropped increasingly clearer hints and looked discomfited, the Norwegian still said \"no, what reform, is anything new?\" and eventually they cut the interview and switched back to the studio. reply hnarn 7 hours agoparentThis almost sounds like a sketch since Sweden has “Norway jokes” where the punchline is consistently how dumb Norwegians are — a structure that I’m sure is mirrored in Norway and similarly in other countries (england/scotland, france/belgium maybe?) reply lb1lf 6 hours agorootparentOh yes. In Norway we have the exact same jokes about the Swedes. One quip which did the rounds in the papers prior to the Swedes starting to drive on the right was that they would perform the switch in several phases - first heavy traffic, then cars a month later... reply stareatgoats 5 hours agorootparent> In Norway we have the exact same jokes about the Swedes This is a fairly recent development. When I moved to Sweden in the 1970s, it was so bad I learned Swedish at accelerated rate in order to avoid the kneejerk compulsion of many (if not most) Swedes to tell their favorite jokes about how dumb Norwegians seemed to be. No doubt a consequence of century-old rivalry and the fact that Sweden during the early part of the last century was the larger, richer, most industrialized and organized society in comparison. And they believed much of it to be actually true, in the way that derogatory humor always evokes some degree of \"no smoke without fire.\" To this day, I meet swedes who are surprised at hearing that bananas are not actually called \"gulebøj\" in Norway (bended yellow) - a reference to how Norwegian is not as anglicized as Swedish, as there has been a pushback against this trend in Norway historically. As Norway has become progressively richer these jokes in Sweden about Norwgians have more or less disappeared however. The notion that Norwegians nowadays have the same jokes about Swedes is something I hear repeated, but it saddens me nonetheless because it doesn't rhyme with the spirit I remember from my childhood. If true, then it means that a fair number of my present (Swedish) countrymen are being denigrated, perhaps because Norway can now pride themselves on being the richest (real) country in the world per capita, so rich that a lot of swedes migrate here to take the worst paid jobs in restaurants and in hospitals. They are popular as employees because they understand the language and are hard working. And probably because they can take denigrating jokes, maybe because well, they used to do it too.

The Wikipedia article mentions that briefly towards the end. reply renhanxue 2 hours agoparentThe trams were already on the way out in the 1950's, they were seen as a thing of the past that were inhibiting the development of the new car-centric urban areas. Several systems closed well before H-day, in the 50's and early 60's. The ones that closed on or around H-day were mainly in Stockholm and in Helsingborg. In Stockholm, plans had been made as early as the 1940's to gradually replace the tram network with the metro, and that did in fact happen. Today's green and red metro lines do in fact use old tram line alignments to a pretty significant extent (the younger blue line was all new and mostly blasted out of the bedrock deep underground). In 1957 the city council formally decided that the tram networks should be gone by the mid-1970's, at which time most of the infrastructure and rolling stock would have been considered end-of-life. All H-day did was accelerate this by a couple of years. Two suburban lines were kept though and they survive to this day, but at least up until the 1990's their future was kind of uncertain. Things finally changed in the mid-90's, and new light rail alignments started to get built again. reply BurningFrog 5 hours agoparentprevI don't get why. Can't you just run the trams in the opposite direction? reply mongol 4 hours agorootparentIt was not done throughout, but cities with trams with doors on only one side posed a problem.

Some stations have center platforms, others have side platforms. Maybe there is some network in the world with only one type, but in most cases they come in a mix. reply matsemann 9 hours agoprevOne surprising (after we got a ticket..) thing about parking laws in Sweden is that you're also only allowed to park on the right side of the road / with the car in the direction of the traffic. This has the benefit of that when you're leaving the street parking, you are sitting close to the lane and can look behind you for coming cars and only cross one lane. Compared to parking on the \"wrong\" side, where you're sitting on the opposite side of the lane in your car, having your view of the opposing lane blocked by the parked car in front of you. As a cyclist I wish we had the same rule where I live. Far too often a car parked on the street will not see me when they try to exit their spot, as it's only when half the front of the car is in the cycle lane they actually can see past the other car. reply gerikson 8 hours agoparentAs a Swede it amazes me that some countries allow parking \"in the wrong direction\". I've never even thought about it, and I don't know if it's a written rule (I'm sure it is, just it;s been a long time since I got my license). reply gfna 6 hours agorootparentIn finland this has been allowed since a few years ago. It is quite useful on narrow sidestreets in residential areas where it helps hunting for parking spaces. The biggest problem seems to be that now many misinterpret the law that one must leave 5 meters empty space before pedestrian crossings as being measured from the front of the car, ie not applying when parking on the ”wrong” side reply Ekaros 3 hours agorootparentAlso it seems less understood or followed rule is that it is also technically 5 meters from any crossing lane. And then sometimes whole intersection is very nebulous. As pedestrian crossing can be faraway from intersection and still be part of intersection... Sometimes things just get weird. reply edb_123 7 hours agorootparentprevYou don't have to go further than Norway to be allowed to park on both sides of the street (unless indicated otherwise by signs) as well as park in both directions. I believe many Norwegians have received parking tickets when visiting Sweden because if this difference.

As a midwesterner, it definitely surprised me to see so many \"contra-parked\" cars the first time I visited Seattle. It was one of those things that was just so deeply ingrained that it never occurred to me to park against traffic like that. reply matsemann 7 hours agorootparentprevNorway. It might be more common than I anticipate, just weird that we've been parking in Sweden for decades not knowing this and never having received a ticket.

But it does matter what those around you speak, now. Neither the person you originally responded to or me have mentioned ancestors. reply tsimionescu 5 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking a different language than your great great great grandfather (\"a few generations ago\") is not always very impactful, though even this means you can no longer read letters or poetry or novels that they may have written or just loved. You can no longer understand laws that they might have obeyed, understand speeches that influenced them, and so many other things that keep a culture going beyond generations. However, that pales in comparison to what the transition means, not speaking the same language as your grandparents. You get a huge gulf of distance from relatives who, for the majority of humanity, are some of their most beloved and close relationships. reply SahAssar 8 hours agorootparentprevUsually people have one primary language which is usually the one predominantly used in the home they grew up in (or maybe the one used for their primary education). If you have multiple, that's fine, but your disregarding the reality for 90%+ of people if you don't think most people have a language that is their \"primary\". > It does not matter to me which language I use to communicate. Why should it? For most people language is tied to their culture and history. I'm just saying that we should not mandate that people use a certain language as their \"primary\". It would be nice if we had a global way to passably communicate though. reply bjoli 7 hours agorootparentI think something changed culturally as well. When my parents grew up any moderately educated person was expected to speak different several different languages. Very few in my generation speak three languages, even in my rather international field. Yet my older colleagues speak french, German and Spanish like it is nothing. And my international colleagues often speak 4+ languages. I am fine with English being a de facto Lingua Franca, but I can't help feeling something has been lost. reply checkyoursudo 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I get what you are saying. I would never want to mandate any language. I think it is dumb when countries have official languages as opposed to e.g. operating languages. I just think that people are more worried about the homogenization of language than they need to be. In fact, with how quickly culture is homogenizing around the world, I think that it is even possible that language differences outlast cultural differences over the medium term.

That seems like a very reductive take. Of course trends and culture is more global since we now communicate globally, but there are definitely regional cultures and values and those are expressed many different ways. If I travel from my small european city to a city in the american midwest or a city in nigeria that are going to be massive differences regardless if the teens are doing the same tiktok dance or whatever metric of homogenization you pick.

They do so by turning \"he has a point\" into \"who is this funny little moustache guy and why does he sound so angry?\" reply marginalia_nu 2 hours agorootparentI'd argue lacking a shared global language is more likely to isolate a population and ensure they can only hear the local mustache man's narrative. reply bsza 1 hour agorootparentBut having one gives a platform for those narratives to spread and potentially become dominant. To be clear, I'm not saying freedom of press between countries should be eliminated (quite the contrary!), only that diversity of languages should be preserved. In my opinion, this does two things: 1. Allows more diverse ideas to come into being, as language directly affects on one's way of thinking. 2. Slows the spread of dangerous ideas, due to some of their appeal (or the charisma of their advocates) being lost in translation. reply echoangle 2 hours agorootparentprevYou think germany would have taken over europe by convincing them if the citizens of the other countries spoke german? reply cupofjoakim 9 hours agoparentprevI can agree on all of the points except \"Speaking English\".

    "originBody": "Downtown Doug Brown Thoughts from a combined Apple/Linux/Windows geek. Home About Mac ROM SIMMs Software Microcontroller lessons Contact Jun 08 Fixing a knockoff Altera USB Blaster that never worked Doug Brown Linux, Microcontrollers, Windows 2024-06-08 What follows is the story of how I fixed not one, but two, different flawed Altera USB Blaster clone devices that never worked correctly after I bought them. I recently built a few Time Sleuths for HDMI input lag testing. Time Sleuth is a neat little open-source project that allows you to measure the time it takes for your TV or monitor to display an image. The way it works is an Altera/Intel MAX 10 FPGA creates a video signal that is mostly a black screen with some blinking white boxes. It feeds the image off to a TI TFP410 DVI transmitter, and also looks for a pulse on a photodetector. It measures the difference in time between when the white box blinked on and the photodetector saw it, and displays it as a number on its generated video signal with some min/max/average stats. Pretty cool! If you’re not into soldering, you can also buy them fully assembled. Anyway, after soldering up a board, I had to flash a bitstream to the Altera FPGA. I immediately discovered that the official Altera/Intel USB Blaster JTAG cable costs $300. I wasn’t willing to fork up that much money for a programmer I would potentially never use again, and I noticed that there are a lot of cheap clones out there, so I did some research and decided on a clone to buy. I read many good things about the Terasic USB Blaster, but I thought that $69 was still a little on the high side for pricing, so I went for something even cheaper. In hindsight, I was completely wrong. $69 is very reasonable for a reputable product. The Terasic programmer would have been the best choice and would have avoided the mess I’m about to describe, so keep that in mind if you’re reading this and trying to decide on a programming cable to buy. I opted for the Waveshare USB Blaster V2. Waveshare’s site seemed pretty nice, and I saw at least one pretty good recommendation of it on Reddit. I did notice an Amazon review that said it works intermittently in Linux, but I bought it despite the warning. Worst case, I could use Windows instead. Well, it turns out that one-star review was spot on. I would even say that it was overly optimistic when describing the Linux compatibility. I couldn’t get the freaking thing to ever program an FPGA correctly at all in Linux, at least with Quartus Programmer or the related command line tools. It would fail during random parts of the programming process. Erases actually did work sometimes, but the longer the operation it was being asked to perform, the more likely it would fail. It was scary because I was starting to think I had made a mistake when building my first Time Sleuth, but then I fired up my Windows 10 VM and it programmed perfectly on the first try. I’ve confirmed that it always works fine in Windows. I will say that I was able to get it to work with OpenOCD and UrJTAG by playing back an SVF file, but it was really slow and it felt clunky. I wanted something compatible with Quartus Programmer! I asked Waveshare about getting it to work in Linux, and this is what they said two days later: I’m sorry that we did not test it with the Linux PC, it should have compatibility problem. It is recommended to use in Windows PC. At this point, I cracked it open to take a look. It’s actually pretty nice. It uses an FTDI FT245RL and an Altera EPM3064A CPLD, as well as a Nexperia 74LVC244A buffer. I have often seen people say that the FTDI + CPLD USB Blaster clones are typically higher quality than the really cheap clone devices out there. That’s because Altera’s actual USB Blaster (version 1, anyway) uses a similar setup internally. I’m not sure if it’s quite as nice as Altera’s design, but I like seeing the 74LVC244A buffer in there. As far as I can tell, it’s being used as a level shifter to ensure compatibility with different voltages, which is how Waveshare is able to say it supports 1.2V to 5V programming voltages. I’m not convinced that 5V programming voltage would actually be in spec with the 74LVC244A’s recommended supply voltage range of 1.2V to 3.6V, but I digress. Why would a device like this work correctly in Windows but not Linux? The Altera software looked pretty similar between Windows and Linux. I’d be shocked if they weren’t using the same codebase underneath. This seemed like the perfect thing for me to investigate, especially since I have a hardware USB sniffer. I looked at the raw USB traffic, although a hardware sniffer ended up being overkill for this. The traffic actually looked quite a bit different between Windows and Linux. I guess the Windows software assembles the JTAG commands slightly differently, and something about the way Windows does it works better with this device. To limit the scope of what I was looking at, I decided to focus solely on Linux. Since I could get Linux to both succeed and fail during a short procedure like erasing the chip, I used Wireshark to do a usbmon capture of good and bad erases. Then I studied the captures in depth. First, I needed to understand how the USB Blaster works. I also didn’t know much about JTAG, so I read up on it. The USB Blaster’s protocol is actually very simple. As a brief summary of the linked info, the host computer sends a bunch of bytes to the device. If the highest bit in a transmitted byte is 0, the rest of the bits contain raw state to put directly on the various JTAG pins, as well as controlling the status LED. If the highest bit is 1 instead, then the bottom 6 bits contain a length, and then there are that many bytes following that contain 8 bits that will be consecutively shifted out through TDI/TCK. So basically the byte mode is an optimized way to send data faster if you are aren’t needing to twiddle the other pins like TMS. Bit 6 is used in both modes to tell the USB Blaster to also read data from the TDO pin and send it back to the computer. The USB Blaster sends out heartbeat packets every millisecond or so even if there’s no data that has been read since last time. The packets appear to always be prefixed with two bytes: 0x31 and 0x60. I’ve noticed that the Waveshare device sometimes sends “0x31 0x00” as the prefix instead, but I don’t think it matters. Next, I read up on the linked JTAG documentation above. It explains how it’s a state machine and the TMS pin is used to decide how to jump around between the different states each time a TCK cycle occurs. It also provides some useful examples of how you can figure out what devices (if any) are present on the JTAG chain. I manually decoded the JTAG operations in the Wireshark USB captures. Here’s an example of a recorded packet sent to the Blaster: 0000 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7c 7d 7e 7f 0010 7c d0 ff 03 b3 3f fc ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 0020 ff ff 7c 7d 7c 7d 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 0030 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c And here’s the response that I got back from it: 0000 31 60 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 0010 03 03 03 77 43 60 0c fc 03 b3 3f fc ff ff ff ff 0020 ff ff ff 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 0030 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 You’ll notice that the response has one more byte than the transmission. Actually, it has one fewer byte, because the “31 60” prefix doesn’t count. The reason it has one fewer byte is because the transmitted “D0” byte has bit 7 set, so it’s indicating we’re going into byte mode for 16 bytes (the lower 6 bits are 0x10 = 16). That byte doesn’t actually perform any operation itself, so it doesn’t cause a response byte to be sent. But because bit 6 is set in it, all 16 bytes transmitted will have associated responses. They show up as the “77 43 60 … ff ff ff” in the response. Going into the actual nitty-gritty detail of this transmission is well beyond the scope of this post, but what’s happening here is the Altera software is reading the IDCODE of the attached chip(s). It’s very hard to see in the hex dump because the bits aren’t on perfect byte boundaries, but the Altera CPLD responds with a chip ID of 0x031810DD, which is exactly what the 10M02SCE144 is supposed to respond with. I kept following along in the USB/JTAG trace and eventually found a point where the data readback differed between the success and failure captures. The Altera software appeared to be attempting to enter the Shift-IR state, but the readback we got didn’t make sense after entering that state. At this point I had no choice but to blame something in the adapter. It was returning different results when given the exact same input both times. It was random. It kind of seemed like it was probably something related to timing, like maybe it was right on the boundary of being out of spec on setup/hold times or something. Here’s what the traffic looked like on an oscilloscope. In particular, this is what the optimized byte mode traffic looked like (TCK): I did notice something a little funky with this. The pulses are 6.25 MHz. This makes sense because the oscillator is 25 MHz, so it’s being divided by 4. My understanding is designs like this, including the original USB Blaster, typically have a 6 MHz JTAG clock though. I began wondering if it’s slightly overclocked. I think that would explain intermittent behavior. I even found an old discussion from 2006 where “kawk”, who designed a CPLD bitstream for this setup, ran their design slightly overclocked at 25 MHz and it worked okay, but other people reported problems and had to slow it down. This gave me an idea. The FTDI chip has its own internal oscillator, so I was totally free to mess around with the frequency that the CPLD was running at without interfering with any of the USB circuitry. I didn’t have any oscillators sitting around, but I did have an RPi Pico I could use. I wrote a simple program in MicroPython to set up GP0 as a 24 MHz clock signal with 50% duty cycle: 1 2 3 4 from machine import Pin, PWM pwm = PWM(Pin(0)) pwm.freq(24000000) pwm.duty_u16(32768) Then I removed the 25 MHz oscillator from the Waveshare Blaster and soldered a wire to the Pico’s GP0 instead (and another for ground). When I verified the frequency with my multimeter, I discovered that the RP2040 was outputting a 25 MHz signal even though I had asked for 24 MHz. I quickly realized this is because the Pico is clocked at 125 MHz by default and the PWM frequencies would have to be an integer divisor of that. I probably could have changed the Pico’s frequency with machine.freq(), but it was easier to just keep stepping up the divider instead. (125/6) = 20.83 MHz, which is well below 24 MHz. Running at 20.83 MHz, it still seemed erratic. So I bumped the clock speed down even more to (125/7) = 17.86 MHz. At this rate, it mostly worked! I did see it fail a few times though, so I figured I was getting closer to reliability. The next lowest possible frequency of (125/8) = 15.625 MHz seemed to be the sweet spot. It worked perfectly every time with that slower clock speed. Success! I’m still waiting for a few random oscillators to arrive from Digi-Key so I can close this one out for good. I ordered them before I thought to try using an RP2040 as a stand-in, so the speeds I ordered were 24 MHz, 20 MHz, and 12 MHz. I wish I would have ordered a 15 or 16 MHz one as well. I’m feeling pretty confident that soldering in the 12 MHz one will solve everything and the Waveshare USB Blaster will work perfectly in Linux after that. Sure, it’ll slow everything down quite a bit, but at least it’ll be reliable. I’m still kind of mystified that the problem never happens in Windows. I’m guessing the CPLD design has a subtle timing bug that the Windows version of Altera/Intel’s software doesn’t hit because it arranges the JTAG traffic in the USB packets completely differently. Normally this would be the end of this type of blog post, but you may have noticed at the top that I mentioned I fixed two different USB Blaster clones. Buckle up, because we’re just getting started. After the Waveshare one didn’t work, and before I figured out what was really going on, I bought an even cheaper one on Amazon for $9. I didn’t feel very optimistic about this based on the reviews. There were a lot of reviews that said it didn’t work at all. Several reviewers said it bluescreened their Windows computers. Despite those reviews, and given how much time I had invested into this problem, I thought it would be fun to see what was wrong with this cheapo clone. Am I crazy or something? It arrived yesterday afternoon. I plugged it into my Linux machine and tried it out. Of course, it didn’t work. No surprises there. It showed up with the correct device ID and the software correctly recognized it, but Quartus Programmer didn’t like it at all. usb 3-2: New USB device found, idVendor=09fb, idProduct=6001, bcdDevice= 4.00 usb 3-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3 usb 3-2: Product: USB-Blaster usb 3-2: Manufacturer: Altera usb 3-2: SerialNumber: FFFFFFFF As far as I could tell based on a quick Wireshark USB capture, the traffic looked normal except for one thing. It wasn’t responding with any data. There were no response packets at all, not even the periodic idle “31 60” packets that should have been showing up. Then I tried it in Windows and immediately replicated the BSOD problem that other reviewers had mentioned. It quickly gave me a blue screen with the bug check being PFN_LIST_CORRUPT. I didn’t even have enough time to open the Quartus Programmer software. Some quick Googling revealed that I wasn’t the only one experiencing this problem with cheap Altera USB Blaster clones. Other people had solutions that often involved trying custom Windows drivers, but I didn’t really want to mess with that. I didn’t really care about Windows support anyway. It didn’t work in Linux and that was all that mattered to me. So yeah, this clone seemed totally useless, just like most of the reviews had said. It’s interesting, because I’ve also seen a lot of people online say that the cheapo clones work great. I guess there must be different versions out there and some of them work better than others. I decided to open this one up and see what it looked like inside: There is only a single chip, which isn’t identifiable in the picture. It’s a WCH CH552G microcontroller. This is one of those extremely inexpensive microcontrollers that was making its rounds on the Internet a few years ago. It’s an 8-bit 8051 MCU that has a fair amount of neat little features. It has crystal-less USB support, for example. As of this writing, LCSC has a few in stock for $0.62 each. Not bad for the capabilities it has. However, I think this board design is very basic and is a great example of how you get what you pay for. As far as I can tell, it’s hardwired for 3.3V operation. There are series resistors on each pin, so I don’t know if that helps with avoiding damage if you hook up a lower-voltage device or what. I searched around to see if anyone else had encountered these chips in USB Blaster clones. I saw that many of the other cheap clones have STM32 or PIC microcontrollers. I guess the market has been flooded with different versions. Some of the people who say theirs work great must have gotten a different model, or at least different firmware on it. I found a few mentions of the CH552G being used in these. One interesting thing was a Hackaday post from a couple of months ago where someone else had developed one (closed source), as well as another project from 5 years ago with open-source firmware, based on top of Blinkinlabs’ CH55x SDCC SDK port. This seemed right up my alley! A new idea/challenge sprung to mind. Could I get the open-source firmware from 5 years ago compiled and working on this non-functional CH552G USB Blaster clone I just bought? Would it work properly in Linux and avoid the Windows blue screen of death? The Time Sleuth runs at 3.3V so it would be completely safe to try out. Of course I couldn’t resist taking on such a challenge. So last night, I started on it. What better way to spend a Friday night? The first task was to determine the pin mappings using continuity mode on my multimeter. The board is so simple and the MCU is so small that it didn’t take long before I had the entire pinout I needed: Pin 1 – P3.2 – TMS Pin 2 – P1.4 – NCS Pin 3 – P1.5 – TDI Pin 4 – P1.6 – TDO Pin 5 – P1.7 – TCK Pin 6 – ? Pin 7 – ? Pin 8 – ? Pin 9 – P1.1 – ACTIVITY LED (ACT) Pin 10 – P3.3 – ASDO Pin 11 – P3.4 – NCE Pin 12 – USB D+ Pin 13 – USB D- Pin 14 – GND Pin 15 – VCC Pin 16 – V33 Next, I got the CH55x SDK up and running. The documentation on the SDK’s GitHub project was excellent. It didn’t take long before I was ready to try out a program to blink the activity LED on and off. I simply modified the “blink” example to use P1.1 instead of P1.7 and built it. There are so many awesome tutorials out there about how to work with these chips, so it wasn’t really a problem to figure out how to program it. I installed ch55xtool. These chips are cool because they have a USB bootloader that puts it into a programming mode if you hold a pin high at startup. You don’t need a special programmer or anything. The datasheet says that you need to be running at 5V to flash them, but I’ve found so far that flashing works fine at 3.3V too. They do say you only get about 200 flash cycles per chip, so you can’t go crazy with reflash attempts. Oh well, they’re so inexpensive that it doesn’t matter that much. To force it into the bootloader, I just held a wire between the 3V3 and D+ pins which were conveniently located on a header, plugged it in, and then quickly removed the wire to avoid shorting it for too long and also to allow USB communication to commence. A resistor would probably be safer. Then it showed up as a different USB device in Linux, so I knew I had done something right: usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 69 using xhci_hcd usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=4348, idProduct=55e0, bcdDevice= 2.50 usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0 I briefly contemplated something in my head at this point: there was no going back as soon as I went any further. I’d erase the stock firmware on this device and my only hope would be to get this open-source firmware working. I didn’t care though. The device was useless with its original firmware so I had nothing to lose. Here’s the command I ran to flash the chip: ch55xtool -v -f blink.bin The flash was successful, but my blink test firmware didn’t freaking work! Nothing happened on the LED. I checked the other pins and there was no sign of life. I was pretty irritated. I really thought I had done my homework on this. I tried some other flashing utilities — even the vendor’s WCHISPTool in Windows. Nothing worked. I tried resetting all the config settings on the chip to default just in case one of the settings was screwed up, but nothing seemed to fix it. I started to worry that I had done all that reverse engineering work for nothing. When I came to my senses after an hour or so, I realized I should start tinkering further with the sample code to see why it was failing. I noticed a call to CfgFsys() at the start of main(). I tried commenting it out, and all of a sudden the LED started blinking! (At the wrong rate, but that’s okay). Further reading in the datasheet revealed the problem as soon as I realized that CfgFsys() was writing to the CLOCK_CFG register. The SDK was defaulting to a FREQ_SYS of 24 MHz in examples/Makefile.include, but when the chip is running at 3.3V, it can only do a maximum of 16 MHz. I simply had to override FREQ_SYS to 16000000 or lower in my Makefile. Once I did that, the blinking LED demo worked and I was all set! The next order of business was to get the open-source CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware compiling. The easiest thing to do was to drop it into the examples folder of the SDK as another example project. It was even including ../Makefile.include in its own Makefile, so I think that’s the CH55x-USB-Blaster developer’s intended way of integrating it. I added the FREQ_SYS override to its Makefile. I also modified the pin mappings. They were mostly correct, but I had to strip out a bootloader entry button and move a couple of pins around. I also noticed the code was sending a prefix of “01 60” instead of “03 60” on transmitted packets so I went ahead and changed that to match the original USB Blaster. After I did that, I tried plugging it in…and nothing. Well, almost nothing. My computer detected a device plugged in, but nothing happened after that. In Wireshark it looked like a request for the device descriptor was being sent out, but nothing was happening in response. usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 88 using xhci_hcd Looking at the USB IRQ handler in the code, I was suspicious about the way the start-of-frame (SOF) interrupt was being handled. It didn’t look like the SOF interrupt was being cleared properly. I just disabled the SOF interrupt altogether for testing. It didn’t seem super important; it was just incrementing a counter which was later used to decide to send out an idle “03 60” packet every so often. As soon as I disabled it, my reflashed USB Blaster clone sprang to life! usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 92 using xhci_hcd usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=09fb, idProduct=6001, bcdDevice= 4.00 usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3 usb 3-1: Product: USB-Blaster usb 3-1: Manufacturer: Altera usb 3-1: SerialNumber: C0BFA6D7 Amazingly enough, in this state, it worked completely fine in Linux. I had successfully fixed my $9 junk cheap USB Blaster to actually work correctly for flashing my Time Sleuth! I was totally stoked! Then I plugged it into Windows to see if I had fixed the Windows compatibility, and it bluescreened right away. It was the exact same PFN_LIST_CORRUPT error as before. What in the world? But it worked in Linux now! Why would Windows be upset? I think what’s going on here is if your device pretends to be an FTDI chip, but it doesn’t perfectly emulate it, weird stuff happens when the official FTDI driver doesn’t see something it’s expecting. I’ll leave it to you as the reader to decide whether that’s accidental or intentional on FTDI’s part. Whether it’s accidental or not, I think it’s pretty bad that the driver can crash the system if the device doesn’t respond correctly. Anyway, I remembered that I had disabled the SOF interrupt that was part of the logic for how often to send out the empty “03 60” packets. I looked through some other code examples of how similar USB controllers handled SOF interrupts and tweaked the firmware accordingly. With this change implemented, the SOF interrupt seems to work as intended now. I’m noticing periodic empty “03 60” packets when the programmer is in use now when I sniff the traffic in Linux, and Windows no longer crashes when it’s plugged in. I am successfully able to flash my Time Sleuths from Quartus Programmer in Linux and Windows with no problems. After I got it fully working, I realized the activity LED was backwards. It was on most of the time and off when it was busy. I just had to invert the LED in the code. It was a quick fix. The only other weird thing I’ve noticed is that the Time Sleuth backfeeds power into the cheap USB Blaster, so I just try to plug them both into power at about the same time to be safe. I don’t think there’s anything I can do in software to fix that. Here’s my GitHub fork of the CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware, along with a release binary you can flash to your device if you’ve somehow made the same mistake I did and bought a completely useless USB Blaster clone. Just keep in mind a few things: the circuit is very basic and only appears to be designed for 3.3V programming. This will only work if yours has the same pinout as mine. I take no responsibility if you brick your useless USB Blaster by trying this firmware out. I’ll take lots of credit if it fixes it though! Credit also goes to VladimirDuan on GitHub for the original implementation of the CH55x USB Blaster firmware, as well as Blinkinlabs for the excellent SDK port. Not to mention the developers of SDCC! It’s awesome seeing so many open-source projects help breathe a solution like this to life. Not too bad for a night’s work, huh? I converted a $9 piece of Amazon garbage into a functional USB Blaster clone in just a few hours. I’m pretty happy with myself! I don’t want to toot my own horn too much, but it seems kind of ridiculous that these junk devices are being sold totally nonfunctional, yet it only took me one evening to piece together some open-source firmware to fix it. Do they even test these things? I’m also satisfied with my research into the first device I looked at, the Waveshare USB Blaster. I’m pretty sure as soon as I have a slower oscillator to solder in, it will also begin working perfectly, albeit slower than it potentially could be. It would really be cool to figure out how to make a new bitstream to load into it that could operate at the full 25 MHz original clock rate. I would probably need a bit of help on such a project though. I hope this info is useful to someone out there!

Author writes they had problems with a FTDI chip.

Mine is a few years old, I wonder if there are better clones out nowadays. reply rasz 12 hours agoparentprevWhy infamous?

They apparently also have a CBM9001A which is a clone of the Cypress SL811HS (the datasheet is a search-and-replace, they even forgot to do that to the PDF properties), and almost all their other products are marketed as \"Replace\" for ICs from big brands like Maxim and Analog Devices. I wonder if these are layout-RE'd clones or reimplementations --- I suspect the latter. reply Rinzler89 9 hours agorootparentYou keep calling all those original devices overpriced, but what exactly makes them overpriced in your option? To me it's wild how (not singling you out specifically) well paid people have no issue paying on a daily basis 8$ for a shitty cup of Starbucks or 18$ for a mediocre sandwich in London or California, stuff that you then piss and poop away, but asking them to pay 10$-60$ one time for a widget like an Original Arduino or a Salee, developed by skilled people that lasts you for life, that's suddenly overpriced. It's as if people expect electronic devices to only cost the sum of their wholesale parts, preferably at the manufacturing costs in a country with no workers rights and no IP rights, and ignoring the skilled labor that goes into the IP of the originals. reply tecleandor 9 hours agorootparentIt'd be nice if it were 20-60$, but weren't USBee AX Pro more like $500 when they released them? reply Rinzler89 8 hours agorootparentMaybe they were I don' remember exactly, but you also have to put the price in the context of that era, when oscilloscopes were only available form the established manufacturers costing thousands of $, and before the era of community FOSS HW designs enabling devs to pool their knowledge for free. So even 500$ for a high quality hobbyist USB scope with good SW was considered affordable and definitely not overpriced. 500$ price was actually very disruptive to the established scope industry. And developing those 500 scopes and SW at western wages, doesn't come cheap, and since the SW was free, the only way to recoup the R&D and turn a profit was through the margins on HW sales reply fragmede 7 hours agorootparentprevSure but they cost a lot to develop and they need to recoup their costs. That doesn't mean they're overpriced. it means they're expensive, but they have to sell them at that price because they know it's only a matter of time before knockoffs come out and they have to lower prices, so they need to charge that much in order to not go out of business. It's a niche product to a small audience. The word overpriced is reserved for luxury items like designer anything, sunglasses, handbags, jeans, etc. they're able to be priced that way because of the brand, with no relation to how much it cost to make. (note: the price of an item and the cost or takes to make an item are decoupled. took a lot of years of business to learn that one) reply ashirviskas 28 minutes agorootparentI don't see a difference there. If someone sells something without doing much innovation for over 10 years (doesn't matter if it is electronics or clothing), for much more than it costs to make, why is one overpriced and the other one is not? reply daghamm 6 hours agorootparentprevOh come on. All these devices are based on the Cypress reference design. USBee was sold for 1600, the software was crap. Saleae was sold for a couple of hundreds. The software was nice but unstable and limited. The \"clones\" that also use the reference design cost 10-20 and use the open source sigrok/pulseview software. Should also add that I don't live in CA, and don't drink coffee :) reply Rinzler89 4 hours agorootparent>Oh come on. All these devices are based on the Cypress reference design. And MacOS is based on the original BSD and Android is based on Linux. Doesn't mean you can't take something already existing then improve and polish it till you can monetize it. People are willing to pay for increased UX and polish. >Should also add that I don't live in CA, and don't drink coffee :) You weren't the point of this, but people who scoff at a few bucks for hardware when they spend a lot more than that on daily frivolities. You know there's plenty of them out there, even here. reply daghamm 1 hour agorootparentWhen I wrote \"based\", I meant it was pretty much a 1-1 copy of a design by Cypress (although they have all evolved since than). I dont like the idea that one particular company should sell this for a shedload and anyone buying a cheaper device from elsewhere is doing something wrong. Saleae claimed that people buying \"clones\" use their desktop software without paying, which is a reasonable complaint. But with Sigrok around nobody is doing that anymore. reply jalk 1 hour agoprevIf you already had an RPI pico, couldn’t you use something like https://github.com/kholia/xvc-pico from the start? reply dougg3 1 hour agoparentHi, I’m the author of this post.

Namely, when: 1) The central party running the website accumulates value from its growing network but doesn’t want liability for their database being hacked and corrupted (eg having someone give themselves a lot of votes or internal credits), or prevent the fear that they won’t pay out (eg when PayPal froze accounts for the tiniest reasons, or Lebanese banks, or Canada, etc.). In the past this was partially solved with reuquiring middlemen to post surety bonds in every state and registering as a money transmitter. But many marketplaces (eg Etsy, Ebay, Kickstarter, Uber Eats) today operate in a gray area when they do payouts. 2) When a community (whether local or global) are engaging in some ongoing collective action and want to make sure everyone can verify the rules were followed, without relying on fallible middlemen. The Factory Pattern allows them to easily verify that the publicly audited software was indeed not tampered with. Examples include: contests, elections, roles and permissions, escrow transactions, memberships with recurring subscriptions, disbursements to approved entities etc. In the past we just had bank accounts be a block box for most investors etc. Here are actual useful applications of blockchain: https://intercoin.org/applications Bookmarking software isnt one of them. reply JackFr 3 hours agorootparentbookmaking != bookmarking reply kseistrup 9 hours agoprevThe Betula bookmark manager and the Mycorrhiza wiki engine are among my favourite apps.

    "originBody": "Jun 8, 2024 5 min read matchmaking Creating a matchmaker for your multiplayer game Don't test in production. Test in simulation! Photo by JESHOOTS.COM / Unsplash I'm Glenn Fiedler and welcome to Más Bandwidth, my new blog at the intersection of game network programming and scalable backend engineering. A good matchmaker is vitally important to your multiplayer game experience. But it's difficult to test your matchmaker properly ahead of launch. Testing often misses problems that arise with real-world distributions of players, and you really need to be 100% confident that your matchmaker will do a good job from day 1. In this article I present a matchmaking simulator built on player data captured from a real game. This data set reconstructs one virtual day's worth of player joins across the world with the correct distribution of (latitude, longitude) according to the time of day – accurately reproducing the timing and pattern of player joins you'll experience at launch. Goal Create a matchmaker that quickly finds low latency matches. Ideally, players find a good quality match almost instantly. Context The game plays identically from 0 - 50ms RTT by design, so there is no point preferring a 10ms server over 50ms. From 50 - 100ms the game still plays well, but 50ms or below is preferable. Above 100ms performance starts to degrade. The server fleet for the game is distributed across datacenters around the world. If there are multiple server hosting companies in the same city, each are considered to be logically distinct because they can have different network performance. There are 4 players per-match. Intent First match players to servers near them with <= 50ms latency After 10 seconds, if no match is found, expand to servers <= 100ms latency After another 10 seconds, give up and donate the player to any match that needs a player. There's no good match for this player and the priority is to just let them play. Alternatively, you could let them play against bots. This should be very rare. Algorithm in Detail Each datacenter has its own matchmaking queue. Players can be in multiple datacenter queues at the same time. Every second the set of datacenters are walked in random order. For each datacenter, the matchmaker shuffles the queue to avoid the same players being matched together repeatedly (more should probably be done to avoid this), then walks the queue and assembles players into groups of 4 players. After all datacenters are processed, any left over players feed into the next iteration. For each new player entering the matchmaking pool: Set the player state to NEW For players in state NEW: Find all datacenters less than ideal threshold (50ms). If one or more datacenters are found, go to the IDEAL state. If no datacenters are found under ideal threshold, find all datacenters less than expand threshold (100ms). If one or more datacenters are found, go to the EXPAND state. If no datacenters are found under the expand threshold, go to the WARMBODY state. Players in IDEAL state should quickly find a game and go to PLAYING state. Any players that don't find a game within 10 seconds, go to EXPAND state. Players in EXPAND state should quickly find a game and go to PLAYING state. Any players that don't find a game within 10 seconds, go to WARMBODY state. Players in WARMBODY state donate themselves to all matchmaking queues. They just need to play somewhere. Look across all datacenters for games that need extra players to start, regardless of latency, and volunteer the warm body. Any players that don't find a game within 10 seconds, go to FAILED state. Alternatively you could set these players to play with BOTS. Players in PLAYING or BOTS state go to BETWEEN MATCH state at the end of the match. Players in BETWEEN MATCH go to NEW state once the time between matches has elapsed (30 seconds). IMPORTANT: Break up players at the end of each match and send them back to matchmaking. Otherwise, little islands of players are formed and when you are in the down sloped portion of the CCU curve, new players won't find matches. Estimating Latency The key input into the algorithm is the estimated round trip latency between a player and each datacenter. This is what guides players to low latency datacenters, so it's important that it's accurate. If the input is not accurate, the matchmaker will send players to the wrong place. One option is to use the haversine formula to calculate the distance between the player and datacenter, then use the speed of light in fiber optic cables (2/3rds speed of light in a vacuum) plus some fudge factor to estimate the round trip time in milliseconds. The problem with this approach is that in many cases the best datacenter isn't actually the closest. A great example are players in Peru, for whom the closest datacenter by distance is often São Paulo, but since there are no fiber optic cables directly through the Amazon rainforest, it's not actually the lowest latency datacenter for them to play on. One way to get around this is to put ping servers in each datacenter you host game server in, and send low frequency pings to all ping servers on game startup. This way the round trip time can be determined to each datacenter in just one second. But even this approach has problems. The route packets take over the internet often depends on the hash of the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers, and the game server the player will ultimately connect to has a different IP address and port from the ping server in the datacenter. This can lead to the best datacenter for that player being excluded because it has false positive high RTT due to a bad route between the client and the ping server that doesn't occur when the client connects to the game server. Conversely, the ping server RTT might look good, but when the player connects to the game server, the route has a much higher RTT. See this article for more details on why this happens. Because of this, my preferred approach is to calculate latency maps as greyscale image files per-datacenter in a batch process run daily over the last 30 days. This lets you look up the RTT to a datacenter in constant time, and because it's an average, the RTT value isn't subject to internet fluctuations. This way the player is always sent to the datacenters with the best chance of having low latency. I always pair this with a network accelerator like Network Next to fix any bad routes between the game client and server. A combined latency map. Grey scale color [0,255] is latency in ms to the nearest datacenter Implementation You can see the full source code and dataset for the matchmaking simulator here. Results It takes an average of two seconds to find a match, with 30-40ms average RTT depending on the time of day. It seems that the matchmaker is working well. To confirm correct operation, let's visualize the set of active players in matches, so we can verify the distribution of players is correct. It looks good! Click on the image to watch a timelapse across several days Closing thoughts While developing the simulator I found that for the same set of players joining, the peak CCU is incredibly sensitive to the % chance that a player will play another match. What can you do to increase this % for your game? Published by:",

Sometimes we'd bump into each other on other servers too. After a couple of times of hanging out we've found out why (probably at least) we came across each other, we all default to sorting the server list based on ping (latency), and since we were all geographically close, we tended to end up on the same servers. reply gryn 6 hours agoparentprevCan't you make a group with people you like ?

Let the game client apply to servers in datacenters where they will get low latency if that's relevant for your game 2. Wait 1 second on the server, then shuffle the list of clients and group every set of 4 into a match. 3. If no match is found after 10 seconds, add the client to servers in suboptimal datacenters 4. If still no match after another 10 seconds, put them in all the queues and join them to the first game it finds so they can at least play at all, even if they'll have lag no matter where they go 5. Determine latency either using the same IP:port as the game server will have because the route might differ from another port (citation needed imo. The author links another blog post for further info which is mainly a statistics lecture about averages hiding outliers and doesn't back up this claim that the port number makes a significant difference for latency in any but the most exceptional of situations where you're sent eastward instead of westward around the globe or so) or by collecting statistics to find which server was best for a given location and ISP over the past 30 days (seems over-engineered with extra downsides, like that you will have gaps in the data and that it might have changed) Did I miss anything? The whole thing seems somewhere between \"do the most naïve implication\" (1–4) and doubtful (5). It's useful for devs to confirm the intuition they might have for the simplest implementation is correct but other comments saying this is a great blog surprise me when looking at these two posts The hardest part about matchmaking seems to me finding players well-matched in skill without making them wait long, especially during off-peak hours, or having off-putting loss streaks because they (50% chance for each game) got matched against a slightly stronger or equal team and lost. The article doesn't even mention these aspects exist, let alone offer advice on tackling them reply toast0 22 minutes agoparent> 5. Determine latency either using the same IP:port as the game server will have because the route might differ from another port (citation needed imo. No citation, but here's some things to think about. You can easily have two servers in the same facility, in the same rack, with very different ip addresses. Most of the time you'll get the same general route for all destinations within a /24 (v4) or /48 (v6), but not always. Two /24s at the same facility might get different routes, especially if there are capacity issues on the better route at any point. From same IP to same IP, anywhere there's a redundant link, which link to use is generally selected with a hash on the 5-tuple {protocol, destination ip, sender ip, destination port, sender port} (sometimes on a smaller tuple). If traffic is unbalanced or if one link is lossy, you can get drastically different experiences with a change in port number. If you've done traceroutes and seen multiple similar ips at a given hop number, it's probably the second effect; this is pretty common. Typical traceroute sends udp packets to the destination and modulates the sending port number. Sometimes, rarely, you can see drastically different routes within a traceroute. It's easier to do traffic engineering on a /24 level though. Traffic on redundant links is balanced by hashing flows rather than on a per packet basis so that packets within a flow tend to arrive in order; out of order arrival is very expensive for endpoints, so it's better to ocassionaly have unbalanced usage than to regularly have out of order arrival. reply remram 13 hours agoparentprevPlayers are coming in and out all the time, you can't \"wait 1 second and shuffle the list\". 1 second after what? reply gafferongames 5 hours agorootparentThe algorithm just has a tick rate at 1 second. Assume requests come in continuously, but only do work at some rate, eg. once every 1 second for a matchmaker that is meant to very quickly find games, and maybe once every 10-15 seconds for a higher quality matchmaker that is going to do a lot of work to match players together by skill etc (longer tick times means you'll have more players to consider in each iteration) reply gafferongames 18 hours agoparentprevIt's a shame that you missed the key point of the article in #5. Many games today have suboptimal inputs to their matchmaker, because like you, they refuse to believe that the internet can route a significant percentage of players incorrectly. Source: Ran a network accelerator with more than 50 million unique players for 5 years. Bad network performance is much more pervasive than you think. https://networknext.com reply cmdrk 58 minutes agorootparentLove the articles but I think you should disclose Network Next is not merely \"a\" network accelerator. It's the network accelerator that you're the CEO/founder of, which makes this read a bit like an advertisement. reply remram 13 hours agorootparentprevIf it can route incorrectly, that seems like a strong signal not to rely on your maps. It doesn't matter if you know what the correct latency is, if the users only experience the incorrect one. reply gafferongames 5 hours agorootparentThe solution is to pair the matchmaker using maps with a network acceleration product that fixes the bad routes, then the latency map and the actual latency experienced are very close. The reason you use the maps in the matchmaker is so you can look up the latency from client to datacenter in constant time and you don't have to waste any time on the client pinging ping servers to get the results. Plus, it costs money to run pings through the network accelerator, and they always (from experience) converge to the latency map anyway. reply remram 3 hours agorootparentHow much time is wasted? 50 milliseconds at most? And you're about to send 50 packets per second for an hour during the game.

In terms of overall experience, the best approach in general is a purely random one. This is how you avoid the experience of getting trapped in a 20 game losing streak, even if you are a really good player. If you allow the natural balance of good players winning more often and bad players losing more often, you will find things get a lot less messy in between. This also provides your bad players an opportunity to occasionally witness what they could become. When you only play someone 1% stronger than yourself, you probably don't have a great idea of what the upper bound actually feels like. This can become a serious trap for players who are seeking to grow their skills. reply pynappo 6 hours agorootparentThere's different levels of SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) though, most games nowadays have a choice between ranked (where the appeal is the well-matched games and the possibility of increasing your rank) and quick play (where the appeal is the low queue time and more casual play, and the matchmaker basically is making sure that the lobby is filled with players who are very roughly in the same skill range) While I also have fond memories of pre-SBMM Halo/CoD from the 2000s, they're more focused on pure shooter mechanics rather forcing players to work together to win an objective, so doing well but losing still feels fine. I find SBMM is needed in more objective focused esport games like overwatch, because the game is designed such that it's harder to do well individually (and thus have any fun) if your teammates aren't doing well. reply bob1029 4 hours agorootparent> it's harder to do well individually (and thus have any fun) if your teammates aren't doing well. Perhaps this is the actual cursed aspect. In a free-for-all context (i.e. a team size of one), you would never have this kind of a problem. As you increase the mandatory team size to six, you are creating an entirely new universe of effects to compensate for. In my experience, 99.99%+ of the frustration in Overwatch and League of Legends emerges from dealing with your own teammates, not your opponents. reply gafferongames 17 hours agoparentprev> If you have any advice on improving skill matchmaking I would be quite interested.

Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior work by up to 4.5$\\times$.

So far it has identified issues that are technically correct but aren't actually an issue within the larger context of the how the code is used. That said, I'm pretty sure I could find vulnerabilities by using Claude-opus as first pass filter to find problem areas. ChatGPT broke a cryptographic protocol I wrote[0]. I convinced myself ChatGPT was wrong about the attack until a human cryptographer pointed the same attack out [1]. \"The protocol you described appears to be a variant of the Schnorr signature scheme, with a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the signature. However, this specific variant does not provide security against forgery attacks by the prover. The reason for this is that the prover can choose a random value r and compute w = r^e mod N, without actually computing the signature sig = h(m)^d mod N. Then, the prover can simply choose zksig = w and publish (w, zksig, m) as the proof. Since zksig = w^d mod N = r^(ed) mod N, it satisfies the verification equation zksig^e mod N = h(m)*w mod N, even though it is not a valid signature for the message m.\" [0]: https://chatgpt.com/share/f5526fd5-7ebb-4b15-a2bf-703ac88de4...

However, to pick at two small things: 1. The vulnerability classes chosen (XSS, CSRF, SQLi, etc.) have well known, basic \"shapes\" that don't vary as much in the wild as other classes, e.g. memory corruption or logic bugs. The latter also have a common subset of shapes, but frequently require long sequences of dependent operations to reach an exploitable state. It would be interesting to see more research tackle these vulnerability classes! 2. The standard for \"proof of ignorance\" in the field is cutoff dates: it's taken for granted that, because GPT-4's training cutoff predates any of the CVEs, they must not be included in the training set. This might be appropriate in some cases, but it's harder to confidently assert for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities: a public CVE may be subject to extensive semi-public documentation and conversation before being made \"public\" in the form of a CVE, and it'd be interesting to know whether any of that has been included. Edit: To make the point in (2) more clear: it's somewhat common for a CVE to come from a public issue tracker, where a user reports a bug or piece of unexpected behavior that ends up being exploitable. That issue tracker doesn't get labeled with the CVE itself (from the LLM's cutoff perspective at least), but it contains much of the information needed to derive the exploit. In such a case, it's hard to establish that the LLM has successfully produced a novel exploit rather than just regurgitating what it was trained on. reply bongodongobob 3 hours agoparentI don't think that's how LLMs train is it? One instance of a bug in an issue tracker shouldn't be enough for the LLM to \"remember\". For example, if I were to post my password is ($;3+$($7262 there's basically a 0% likelyhood that it will ever infer \"bongodongobobs password on hackernews is ($;3+$($7262\". It's not a database of bits of knowledge. reply woodruffw 3 hours agorootparentTo my understanding: one of the biggest outstanding research areas around LLMs is that we don't actually understanding all that well how much they \"remember\" vs. infer. This is at the centerpiece of the ongoing lawsuits from newspapers against OpenAI: ChatGPT didn't just summarize articles, but appears to be capable of reproducing them verbatim[1]. (But even separately from this: the LLM doesn't need to store verbatim details from the pre-CVE-labeled vulnerability to poison the experiment here. Being trained on it at all poisons the experiment, since it's no longer an 0day.) [1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/business/media/newspapers... reply mjburgess 2 hours agorootparentInference from associative statistical models is a kind of remembering. Think of a model as a heated metal sheet placed over some surface (ie., the data); training is heating this sheet just enough that it takes an impression, but not so much that the impression is exact. Cooling and heating the metal to smooth-over impressions is called \"regularization\". This is very different from, e.g., explanatory modelling, whereby some (e.g., scientist) builds a device to imitate a mechanism in the world, rather than a dataset. Consider a building a model of the solar systems with cogs (etc.). A mechanistic model of the solar system isn't a remembering of any data taken about the solar system, rather its a machine which can generate such data. In the latter case, \"inference\" is running the model which has been crafted so its mechanisms track properties the world has. In the former case, \"inference\" is throwing a dart on the metal sheet, and hoping that whatever impression has been taken at that point will be good-enough. So the technical question here isnt open. All associative modelling is a kind of impression-taking of a particular historical dataset. The moral question is whether one ought be paid (etc.) for providing the data. Soon enough it will be easy to invert a large LLM and show you the sources of data it draws from in its replies. At the moment, this is being attempted, but it isnt presented that well and computationally difficult for larger models. Nevertheless, when it happens, I think people will be less impressed. Perhaps, optimistically, they might be more impressed at the people who wrote the original works being sampled. However, of course, I doubt it. The one thing which often accompanies the adoration of LLMs is a dehumanising impulse to deprive people of any capacities at all. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentprev> This is at the centerpiece of the ongoing lawsuits from newspapers against OpenAI: ChatGPT didn't just summarize articles, but appears to be capable of reproducing them verbatim[1].

(But again: this is not at the heart of the argument above. The argument above is that any degree of training on public but pre-identified 0days undermines the \"cutoff\" claim, in a way that would be interesting to qualify in further research.)

It's usually a fancy way of saying a prompt with function calls - but since the definition is vague it leads to different people holding different mental models from each other. As far as I can tell, this team took descriptions of vulnerabilities in the form of CVEs and fed those into a system consisting of various GPT-4 Turbo prompts-with -functions configured for things like executing Playwright commands or running code in a terminal. They arranged this such that there was a \"planner\" prompt which could then delegate to prompts specializing in XSS or SQLi. These were the \"agents\". I imagine they won't be sharing their code, which is a shame because it would be interesting to see the details of how they got this to work. reply cess11 4 hours agoparentWe'll soon have FOSS adapters on top of LLM:s or similar software capable of managing and to some degree extend botnets.

Then you don't know how much context you need. I imagine it can get expensive. Per Commit. reply nomilk 3 hours agorootparentOpenAI's latest (GPT-4o) model is US$5.00 / 1M tokens [1] For large repos it might get expensive, but many will have orgs footing the bill. To satiate curiosity, I made a fresh rails app and it has 9141023 characters, let's /5 to estimate 'tokens' (wild guess), so to scan an entire rails app, that's about $10. Not nothing, but not back-breakingly expensive. Scanning could be reserved for non-trivial PRs and important applications where vulnerabilities are especially likely (e.g. perhaps not static sites, demos, or apps not in prod or a live environment). Scanning only new or edited files, along with those they interact with (where sensible patterns could emerge over time) could decrease the total volume of files needing scans, thereby reducing costs. [1] https://openai.com/api/pricing/ reply simonw 2 hours agorootparentOr $2.50 / million tokens if you run it in batch mode (results in up to 24 hours, though in practice much faster than that): https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch/getting-starte... reply woodruffw 3 hours agorootparentprevMost OSS maintainers don't even pay for GitHub, so you're competing with free. I for one certainly won't pay for a service for the OSS projects I maintain for free. (Or another framing: I might pay for such a service, if the service could demonstrate that it would save me N hours of work fixing bugs instead of costing me N hours of work triaging false positives. Nobody has presented such a demonstration yet, which is also why turning non-LLM program analysis tooling into paid products is such a struggle!) reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentThere's a breed of OSS maintainers that really do care about whether their project is used and satisfying to the users, vs. building stuff just because. In a situation where having your project used vs. deemed insecure is a matter of forking out $10 for an exhaustive pass with GPT-4+-based tool, such maintainers may actually care to pay. Or Github will fund it for them, like they always do. reply woodruffw 2 hours agorootparentThe implication that I'm building stuff \"just because\" isn't appreciated. What I really care about in these instances is protecting my time: I have only so many hours in the day, including time that I rightfully reserve for not doing unpaid maintenance. If the X hours that I previously spent doing OSS maintenance is now partially occupied by triaging false positives, my projects are both worse off and I'm less inclined to work on them, because I equate that work with mindless churn rather than helping my users. You've pointed out that GitHub will fund it, which is potentially true! But observe that this hasn't gone all that well with CodeQL, which they also fund for public repositories: I've had to disable it on a lot of my projects, because the FP/FN ratio simply wasn't worth it. I did, and do, better for my users dedicating my time to actual issues filed. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparent> The implication that I'm building stuff \"just because\" isn't appreciated. It seems this came across not the way I intended; I apologize - I meant that very positively, as a set of possible motivations related to the code/project, problem domain, and/or author themselves, as opposed to product thinking.

It's not a magical being working on your behalf with agency, it's that there are inherent limitations to attention, and overcoming them usually involves having multiple models cooperate on the inputs and outputs. the number of agents is not necessarily related to the number of distinct jobs you need done, after all a single job could still perform best with multiple \"agents\" due to limitations in attention. reply mewpmewp2 3 hours agorootparent [–] Multiple models cooperating doesn't sound much better though.
