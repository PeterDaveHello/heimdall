Yay! Because I’ve already written a “tips I’ve learned about business that I wish I knew sooner” article, I thought another kind of anniversary post might be appropriate: a response to a very popular question I get. People I know often ask me: “Do you plan to hire someone?” To those used to traditional business models, that seems like the next logical step. If I’m doing well in my career, surely I want my company to grow? The short answer is that no, I don’t plan on hiring anyone—especially not other creative staff. I don’t want my business to grow beyond me. The slightly longer answer is that I can imagine hiring an administrative assistant if my workload gets to the point where I feel like I need help, but I’m managing just fine without one, so I don’t know if/when that’s going to happen. I prefer collaborating with other creatives (web developers, writers, photographers) on a project-by-project basis, where everyone operates and charges their own fees independently. I’m also fine with being brought in as a contractor into an established creative team for the duration of a project, but I don’t envision permanently being a part of any team again. If you’re wondering why I’ve made this decision—either because you care about my career, or because you’re in the same boat—I’ll explain my reasons in this article. The main and most important reason I’ve made this decision is: The way I naturally work best is incompatible with agency work norms. I’ve worked in agencies. I have friends and clients who run creative agencies and consulting firms. I know what it’s like, and I don’t want this for myself. Agency life requires a degree of accountability and responsibility for other people’s livelihoods that I just don’t want to deal with. Thankfully, I have a choice. I can still do work that I enjoy for the clients I love, and afford the lifestyle I want by working on my own. I’m aware it’s a tremendous privilege. There are many ways to progress in a creative career. The typical junior designer → senior designer → art director → agency principal isn’t the one I’m interested in. I’m evolving in different ways: inventing my own methodologies, teaching and mentoring others, perfecting my craft, and experimenting with various forms of self-expression. How I work I don’t work typical hours. I usually wake up without an alarm clock. I’m really not a morning person. It takes me an hour or two to fully wake up and be ready to work on solving creative problems. I often start my workday with a personal creative project, or I write. When I feel like I’ve warmed up my brain enough, I move toward client work and (if needed) administrative work. I work for a couple of hours and then make lunch. Depending on my workload, I may go back to my office and keep working for another couple of hours in the afternoon, or take the afternoon off. Edited after this post got more attention than I expected In the interest of transparency: my partner is employed full-time, and we’re mortgage-free. If our living expenses were much higher, or if we lived on a single income, I’d certainly need to work more. Everyone’s situation is different, so please take this into account if you’re comparing your life to mine, and the math doesn’t check out. Quiet thinking time on the patio in the morning is the secret behind my best creative ideas. I have very few meetings because I only work with one or two clients at a time. My phone rarely rings. There are days when I don’t get a single work-related email. I spend most of my work days alone in my office, brainstorming and producing design solutions. My former bosses told me I’m “slow” and “inefficient”. I like to call it “thoughtful” and “meticulous”. I don’t like to rush things. I want to make sure all the details are just right. I need to give myself space and time to think. I prefer working with one or two clients instead of multitasking on half a dozen projects. Because I have the freedom to work like this, I consistently create designs that I’m proud of. Back when I was churning out logos and websites in the agency machine, I was only proud of maybe 1 out of 5 designs. For years I’ve felt “weird” and “wrong” for working this way. I felt like the laziest person in the room. I internalized my bosses’ comments that I spend too much time on details that don’t matter. I questioned myself. I hid how I work from other people because I didn’t want them to think that I’m not working hard enough. That I’m too laid back, too indulgent, too focused on my own comfort. Trying to change myself has only hurt me. Countless attempts at becoming an early riser broke down every time. Trying to start with client work first thing in the morning resulted in blank staring, frustration, and no results. Multitasking made me unfocused and frazzled. The burnout and stress caused chronic health issues that I still have to deal with, and that might never go away. It took some therapy, as well as reading books and blogs that deconstruct productivity literature, for me to realize that I’m not the source of the problem. I just have a low tolerance for capitalist pressure and workaholism, because I was born with a brain that can’t thrive in that environment. There are many, many people out there who are experiencing the same issues and are made to feel like a problem, because the silent majority doesn’t want to rock the boat. Realizing that I don’t have to work 8 hours every day was pretty groundbreaking. I still get work done, and have lots of personal time. I do occasionally take on an ambitious project and work overtime for a few weeks, but then I try to balance it with more rest so I don’t burn out. I’m fine with this and accept myself as I am. But I’m also profoundly unemployable, and would not make a good boss. I’m glad I learned this before I’ve made the mistake of hiring anyone. My non-commercial creative self-expression is equally important to me as my career. When I’m only focused on work and don’t dedicate enough time to personal projects, I become unwell. Creative self-expression is not “just a hobby” for me, it’s a necessity. One of the main reasons I decided to be a freelancer is to tailor my own schedule that would accommodate personal projects. Sure, I was able to paint and write when I was employed, but I prefer writing in the morning, so now I do. I don’t think I could’ve written “The Human Centered Brand” (or even gotten the idea to write a book) if I had to fill 8-10 hours of my day with other stuff. I took 4 months off from client projects in order to write, edit, design, and self-publish it, and then rest and recover. I was able to take those 4 months off because I had no one else in my business depending on me. In the summer of 2020 I had several slow months during the economic downturn. While many companies struggled to find work and pay their teams’ salaries, instead of scrambling for clients, I wrote another book. I considered this free time a gift. Chapter outline for my second book that I wrote in 2020 I prefer being a designer than a director. Managing myself and my clients is enough of a challenge for me. Managing team members frustrates me. I’ve done it before, and I’d rather avoid it. I got into this career because I enjoyed design. I like doodling, sketching, coloring, transforming photos, arranging stuff… I do it even when no one is paying me. I’m thrilled that people want to pay me. Unfortunately, the more you progress on the corporate ladder as a designer, the less time you spend designing. Junior and senior designers are doing most of the production work. Art directors instruct, oversee, and evaluate what others have done, but don’t produce as much finished work as their reports. Agency principals/CEOs do the least hands-on work of all, and take care of managerial and strategic duties. The more people they hire, the more managerial and strategic duties they have. My managerial, strategic, and admin work amounts to a few hours a week. Marketing adds another 5–10 hours, depending on the season. I spend my remaining work time designing, writing, and teaching. It’s a perfect balance: I have just enough variety in my work that I don’t get bored and I’m constantly learning new things—yet I get to spend the majority of time doing the very thing that I love the most about my career. Why would I want to change this? I can’t say that I will never do it, because I’m sure Nela in 10 years’ time will be much wiser than I am, and she might have reasons to make a different decision than Nela of today would. I just find it really, really hard to imagine. I can accept projects or turn them down as I please. I have limited hours available for client work, so my calendar fills up very quickly. I often turn projects down for a variety of reasons. Because I don’t have the time for it. Because it doesn’t pay well. Because I have ethical concerns about the project. Because I don’t like the client’s personality. Because I don’t feel excited about the project. That’s another luxury that many agencies don’t have. Designer Terry Irwin described a situation when her team realized that their client hired them for a rebrand in order to cover up a shocking news story that was about to break. They faced a dilemma with very practical implications: “Should we resign? What should we do? But the reality was, we couldn’t afford to resign it. We had built a machine that needed so much revenue coming through it, it would not accommodate ethics, to put it really bluntly, and that was a real wake up call for me because we just unquestionably kept growing, kept accepting more projects.” Growth can spring up traps that we weren’t prepared for. Is growth really necessary? A couple of years ago I read the book “Brutally Honest” by Emily Ruth Cohen, and overall it was a really good book that I wish existed when I was starting out. However, as I wrote in my GoodReads review, the author is biased against freelancers. (Despite being a freelancer herself at the time of writing and promoting her book.) I found it ironic that she considers a solo consultant business model she’s been using “unsustainable” for design studios. Like many business experts, Cohen subscribes to the capitalist imperative of growth. I don’t equate growth and sustainability. Sustainability is just that—having the means of sustaining a stable business. Being able to meet your needs. Growth on the other hand requires expansion, fulfilling needs that grow bigger as your business grows. I hold a lot of anti-capitalist beliefs. I don’t believe in continuous growth in terms of company size, number of clients, revenue, and other numeric markers (beyond what is needed to keep up with inflation). I believe unchecked growth is harmful for individuals, our society, and our ecosystem. We’re making the planet Earth less habitable for many species (including humans) with too much growth. We’re exploiting people in developing nations for our first-world comfort. There’s rarely a day that I don’t feel complicit in the devastation that happens so I could have my electronic gadgets, affordable clothes, and exotic foods. This internal conflict informs what kind of business owner I want to be. I don’t buy into the “conscious capitalism” movement because it’s just window-dressing that doesn’t solve capitalism’s core issues. I’m a worker: I trade my intellectual, physical, and emotional labor for money. And I love it! I’m fulfilled by creating, and I can’t imagine a life without that. I own my means of production, and have total freedom over how I use them. When I work with other independent contractors, I don’t mark up their fees or take any commission. They earn 100% of what the client paid for their part of the work. I get paid only for my own work. If I change my mind and decide to build an agency, it’s going to be a cooperative. Every partner will own a proportional share of the business and their own equipment, and contribute to the business expenses. But since that requires a great deal more trust in people than simply hiring workers you can fire if it doesn’t work out, you can see why I’d be so reluctant. There are other ways to grow I believe in personal growth. I believe in evolving your business to keep up with the times. I believe in becoming more intentional when selecting clients and projects. I believe in continuously improving your services. Those who want to grow their number of clients and their revenue need to hire more people. I’m satisfied with the number of clients and revenue I have, so I don’t need to hire anyone. I earn leveraged income through my books, workshops, and digital products, and will continue to build this library. There’s really no need for me to grow the agency side of my business. We call it “lifestyle business” The kind of business that works around your life, instead of molding your life around work. It’s a tremendous privilege to be able to work this way, but it’s also risky. My first 3 years of freelancing were tough, and I didn’t know if it would all work out. I’m glad I persisted through the hard times. And yet, I feel incredibly lucky that I’m able to work and live this way. I’m lucky that the conditions in my life were orchestrated in such a way that I could learn the skills that enable me to do this work at a young age, and find a supportive community. I don’t take it for granted. My friend Višnja and I talk about this stuff often. After years of running an agency, she and her partner decided to simplify and have a lifestyle business instead. No employees, no fancy office, less overhead, less stress. She told me she’s much happier now. Scaling down may look like stepping back on the success ladder to someone on the outside, as if gross revenue and the number of employees are the most important markers of career success. It’s a short-sighted view, because the quality of human life depends on so many other factors. True “winners” are those that recognize this, weigh all the factors that matter to them, and have the courage to make the right decision for them in the moment. Even if that decision means scaling back. Even if it means closing a business and starting over. Even if it means caring for family members full-time. Our parents don’t get it. Our friends with jobs may not get it. That’s fine, we don’t need their blessing. We don’t need to explain ourselves to them. We don’t need to prove our success through conventional means. We don’t need to measure against a scale that others have invented. We don’t need to feel guilty for refusing to take on unnecessary responsibilities. They can judge all they want. Whether it’s envy or sincere worry, it doesn’t matter. Those of us who have the privilege and luxury to tailor our own career should take that opportunity. If you can help others do the same, do it. Teach people. Advise people. Introduce people. Form communities. Give back. But don’t dull your own shine for others’ sake, and don’t hide how well you have it. Show other people that a different way of life is possible. You may save someone from making a big, expensive mistake.

I’m a freelancer as well (programmer), work more or less in the same way as you and I’ve come to believe all the same things. I see a lot of people complaining online that they hate their work and life is awful bla bla bla, I wish they realized a better way is possible. I know it is because I’m living it and there are others like you. Thanks for the article, I’m going to save it to read it again when I need reminding of my own values (which you put much more eloquently than I could). Reply Nela Dunato September 4, 2023 at 10:05 Thank you very much for your kind words! I’m glad you’ve found this to be a satisfying and sustainable career model as well. I wish everyone was able to find their own. Nikhil Kumar September 3, 2023 at 22:40 This is awesome! Thank you for writing this. I am embarking on my own journey of self-employment after years in high-stress, high-growth startups. A lot of your reflections resonate with me and it helps to see your thoughts laid out clearly as I envision (and try to explain to friends/former colleagues) a similar working rhythm. Thanks again and keep it up! Reply Nela Dunato September 4, 2023 at 10:09 Thank you! I wish you all the best in your own journey. I hope those years of high-stress work at least got you a savings cushion, so you can jump into self-employment without worrying about income for a while. Beginnings can be rocky, but I’ve found it’s definitely worth it in the long run. Gian September 4, 2023 at 03:07 Great article. Shame so many people consider the term “life style business” as a negative. I think that the very naming is descriptive. It is a business that suits your life style choices. I do have a question: When you need to work with several other creatives to deliver a project and it is the project that you sourced. Do each of you directly invoice the client, or do you aggregate the billings into one? If it is the latter, then how do you handle the situation when the client is slow to pay or baulks at some aspect? In other words, effectively making you responsible for other people’s work. Reply Nela Dunato September 4, 2023 at 10:24 Thank you! When a project requires other skills, I just connect the client to recommended specialists, or suggest a few and they choose. All the legal and financial agreements are between the client and each contractor. It’s up to the contractor to handle their part of the project as they see fit, I’m only responsible for my own work. I don’t do subcontracting because: 1. It’s added admin burden for me. 2. It would impact my tax status. I’m currently benefiting from a special “micro-business” tax law. If my gross income increased (regardless of profit), I’d pay higher taxes, and the subcontractors would still pay their own taxes on top of that… My business is not set up to work like an agency. If I wanted to subcontract, I’d have to set up an LTD. Leave a Reply If you're new here, please read the commenting guidelines before posting.

We&#x27;ve used an \"associate\" model for all that time - a posh way of saying \"a network of trusted freelancers\".We&#x27;ve deliberately chosen not to take on staff. We could have grown at many points along the way but haven&#x27;t wanted to. Instead we&#x27;ve stayed small, focused and profitable.The benefits to growing would have been being able to take on bigger gigs, but we have always aimed for family first. The business has always been a means to a sustainable, balanced and loving family - and not an end.I have friends who have taken the growth route. Some are doing ok. Others are desperately stressed. One has split from his wife in part because of the financial burden of maintaining a 5-10 person team.We&#x27;ve never regretted taking the route we have. We have been here for our kids and we&#x27;ve been able to be flexible with our time in large part because we&#x27;re able to scale our own work up and down in response to changing times without having to worry about paying salaries. reply gochi 13 hours agoparentWhatever the choice, it has to be deliberate. So many are people pleasers in disguise. They grow not because they actively choose, but because they can&#x27;t say no. It causes that desperately stressed life when you&#x27;re not active about these choices and boundaries. They&#x27;re always in survival mode, chasing more more more, without ever being deliberate and reflective about their actions.It winds up being the end of a lot of businesses, whether or not they actually did grow. They took on a contract that was just too big for them, despite their intuition telling them not to. Or they hired too many people despite not wanting to but was talked into it by a friend.So good on you for knowing what you want and being deliberate about it! You and your wife have avoided a lifetime of stress by doing so! reply AussieWog93 10 hours agorootparentMan, you&#x27;ve basically laid out in a paragraph what took me 3 years to work out.Only started properly setting boundaries in the last year or so, no regrets. reply idopmstuff 14 hours agoparentprevThe biggest advantage to owning your business is that you can optimize it solely for what&#x27;s best for you. If growth is all you care about, go nuts, but if you&#x27;ve got it humming along making decent money with just the right amount of work, there&#x27;s zero pressure to change it.I think a lot of people forget that and think that they need to push to be more \"successful\" - kudos to you for doing in the right way for you. reply abraae 13 hours agorootparent> The biggest advantage to owning your business is that you can optimize it solely for what&#x27;s best for you.Another great advantage is being able to fire bad clients.It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve done more than once or twice but the freedom not to be brought down or stressed by someone else&#x27;s insane demands is worth gold.Related is the ability to pick and choose your clients in the sales process. e.g. plenty of small consultancies have formal or informal policies not to bid for government work because of the effort and frustration involved in responding to public sector RFPs. reply fsckboy 8 hours agorootparentprev> if you&#x27;ve got it humming along making decent money with just the right amount of work, there&#x27;s zero pressure to change itwhat works now in the economy now with your skillset now etc. is not guaranteed to continue.

Couldn’t be happier. reply Aurornis 14 hours agoprevRespectable move. My primary complaint with solo-turned-agency people is how grifty they get.As a solo, the job is to add value and make the customer happy so you build your reputation. There are definitely solo contractor grifters out there but they usually struggle with the reputation issue.Agencies develop a grifty dynamic where they realize that their job is to sell themselves and as many headcount and hours as they can squeeze into a contract. Now instead of hiring that solo dev, they’re forcing you to pay 20 hours&#x2F;week to the project manager and to have two devs minimum on it, one or more of whom are complete juniors who will spend incredible amounts of hours solving simple problems, but that’s okay because that’s what they want.Agencies rely on their status and size to impress clients, which short circuits the reputation issue and opens the door to these shenanigans. They also target bigger companies where wasting time and moving slowly might be the norm, or at least something they can gloss over by sending the sales people out to schmooze the execs over dinner again.I knew some excellent devs and infosec people who turned into agency operators who just tried to milk companies for contracts and run a revolving door of junior hires who they can squeeze hours from until they quit. It’s sad to see.To be fair, I know a few good agencies as well. They tend to be in such high demand from reputation that they’re always booked without even trying. It takes a long, long time to get there though. reply 93po 14 hours agoparentI’ve unfortunately done studio&#x2F;agency work my entire career and they’ve all been pretty small (around four devs) until my last employer, which was closer to 70 people and exactly what you described. It’s like you were describing them specifically. I left that job because it ran the capable people ragged and also generally felt dishonest to our clients despite financial transparency being one of the biggest public selling points reply zdragnar 10 hours agoparentprevThis was my experience as well- I started my career with an agency, and it grew from 80 to about 500 people in the course of 7 years. My last two there made it abundantly clear it was turning to the grifty side- every year, we were less profitable, and every year, they kept pushing for ways to get more hours (document more! Test more! Add more value!) despite the fact that the quality we delivered varied greatly from one team to the next.It was really hard to watch what had been a committed group turn into a grubby machine. reply grecy 14 hours agoparentprevThis resonates 100% with my experience.Telco I worked at spent 6 months choosing an agency, end up spending 3 million for what turned out to be a new Color scheme on the public website. Mind blowing, but completely normal for them reply qudat 10 hours agoparentprevTotally. I worked for a consultant agency for a year and this resonates with me.Every project was all about forcing the customer to pay for PM, designer, and two engineers. reply re-thc 7 hours agoparentprev> their job is to sell themselves and as many headcount and hours as they can squeeze into a contractWhich is the complete inverse of what a client needs. It is what it is, but somehow it feels wrong.The agency should be providing value and to make the customer happy.

If you’re paying someone 50th percentile compensation and demanding a 90th percentile work pace and output from them, you’re just going to have endless turnover as you burn people out.Conversely, if you’re paying 90th percentile compensation and you have an employee moving at half the speed of their peers, eventually you’ll get fed up and replace them with someone better matched to the position.But this all breaks down when you get into the weirder ends of the market. Self-pacing works great for you because you can put in the work to deliver $500K&#x2F;year of value and companies appreciate it. It doesn’t work for many people whose idea of a workday is to put in 1-2 hours of focus and then browse the internet all day, which is a larger portion of the developer population than I would have guessed before becoming a manager. Other people can’t help but wander through tasks, get distracted by rewrites or new frameworks, needlessly refactor working code, or otherwise do a lot of activity without producing a lot of work. Both of these fault modes benefit greatly from the pacing and structure of management.There’s no one size fits all approach. I think solo dev contracting is a great option for some people, but the type of person who can self-manage, sell themselves, network, and retain self-discipline isn’t all that common.I think this is a great example of how different people thrive in different environments. reply doctorpangloss 10 hours agorootparent> It doesn’t work for many people whose idea of a workday is to put in 1-2 hours of focus and then browse the internet all day, which is a larger portion of the developer population than I would have guessed before becoming a managerYeah, but not necessarily for any malicious reason. It may not matter to you. My impression is that these people are burnt out from high school and college. But they fit a superficially, stereotypically identical profile to like, the one person you know putting in 80 hour weeks, so they keep getting hired. This is not a fringe idea, it&#x27;s common enough to be made fun of in movies.My point is that there are a dozen commenters litigating all sorts of irrelevant issues, when the explanation for how people who want to work 1-2h weeks keep getting $200k&#x2F;yr+ jobs seems obvious to many non-industry laypeople. reply jokethrowaway 14 hours agorootparentprevHow do you know that people are lazy by nature and not because their job sucks?Of course they have zero incentive to get anything done, they get paid regardless of how well the project gets done.Maybe if they had the guts to leave a paycheck for browsing Reddit and started their own business they would have success too.When I work on my projects I have way more stamina than when I&#x27;m doing client work.

I feel the same way of more stamina doing my projects then what I do at work, but I feel like the blame, at least for me, can&#x27;t be attributed to school. Here is the reality, at least for me. I got into software engineering because I like to build really cool shit. The problem is, when people hire me, it usually isn&#x27;t for really cool shit. Its a business application, often with insane requirements because the client has no clue what they want or even why they really need it. When it does get figured out, its often just some boring business application with nothing really challenging to it or interesting. I&#x27;ll code it out, but there is nothing interesting about. But when I go home, I just do whatever I want. Want to build my own internet protocol built at a lower layer than TCP? Sure, sounds fun! But no one wants to pay me to do that, or the jobs that would pay me to do that are so far and few between.If anything, school set me up with higher expectations. Here I am in college, doing interesting math problems and programming projects and such. I get out to the real world and boss man is just like, \"client just needs an application&#x2F;feature to do X,\" and the solution is just fetching the data, putting it in a list, and doing a for loop over it. If anything, College had me expecting to do a lot cooler shit. reply greybox 13 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who takes pride in their work and who tries to always work the hours I&#x27;m paid for (and often regrettably more, but trying to cut back on that ...)

Of course the biggest changes are starting in more \"progressive\" states, such as New York and California, but the movement is spreading.

I mean sure, it helps if their output is good enough to guarantee more work, but that&#x27;s not why they exist. Their purpose as a business is to generate billable hours.Customers do not hire agencies with the expectation they will build great software. They turn to agencies because they don&#x27;t have the time or skills to do it themselves, and agencies are cheaper than hiring people and they are more dependable than freelancers. By that I don&#x27;t mean that freelancers are collectively unreliable, but with an agency you have a dozen or more developers and if one falls sick, they can just replace them with another developer. If your product depends on that one freelancer, you are screwed.So \"10x developers\" aren&#x27;t really suited for agencies, where every hour is billable and accounted for, and the output does not have to be great, it just needs to be more or less reliable and more or less on time and under budget (or at least cost overruns are accounted for). reply setr 12 hours agoparentprevAssuming it can be done by a solo dev, then pull on 10 guys out of body shops in India&#x2F;Pakistan, seek the cheapest possible credentials that they can be called developers, call yourself project lead&#x2F;architect.Bill as a fixed price project with milestones — you want the work assignments to be ambiguous.

Those are sometimes really close to permanent employment (except the job security and employee-specific perks) but will at least get you started in the game.Be mindful of laws around disguised employment with those types of engagements. You need to make sure you are in the clear legally by paying the appropriate amount of tax for your given situation (in the UK the regulation is called \"IR35\" and tries to specify what falls under a legitimate B2B arrangement and what counts as \"disguised employment\" and incurs taxation equivalent to conventional employment). reply towawy 14 hours agoparentprevReach out to other contractors who you’ve worked with directly (e.g. worked on the same project at a former employer) and valued&#x2F;praised your work. reply j7ake 17 hours agoprevI think the quantity to look for is the fraction of time you spend working on your own projects.You want it to be about 40 hours a week.Too little means you’re probably spending too much time on client or admin work.Too much could mean you’re in a hyper competitive field and you’re struggling to keep up, eg academics. reply ChrisMarshallNY 7 hours agoprevCan totally relate.Good, clear explanation. reply causality0 10 hours agoprevI don’t want my business to grow beyond me.Good.

Async as much as possible is crucial.If you&#x27;re worried about people not putting their 100% because they&#x27;re employed and not making more money the more value gets created, you can setup a structure with low base pay + amazing bonus on success and you can get the same incentive (and risk) you have in your solo work - but with friends and scaling up your business into something that can make more money.It&#x27;s easier to have large margin as an agency than as a solo grifter. reply brightlancer 1 hour agoparent> If you&#x27;re worried about people not putting their 100% because they&#x27;re employed and not making more money the more value gets created, you can setup a structure with low base pay + amazing bonus on success and you can get the same incentive (and risk) you have in your solo work -I think more jobs should be structured this wayBUTit also needs strong checks to catch and _fire_ folks who upsell&#x2F; oversell&#x2F; overcharge against the customers&#x27; interests.This is a risk with any quota (minimum) system but there are a relative handful of folks who will abuse a reward structure to the maximum potential, raking in tons of money for the company (and themselves) while slowly damaging the reputation of the company.So, we need good incentives and rewards coupled with harsh penalties for dishonesty and abuse.

I think this article is just cope. reply nickjj 17 hours agoparent> Can someone explain what the appeal of solo freelancing is in the age of bountiful remote work?Income multipliers, flexibility and being treated like an adult are a few reasons that come to mind.For example, with salaried work your income is mostly fixed (minus a pre-defined&#x27;ish bonus or options, etc.). With contract work you might land a $30,000 contract that takes 2 weeks to do because the focus is on providing value that allows your client to 5x that in a few months so it&#x27;s a no brainer. This is different than salaried work where you&#x27;re expected to be available for 40-45 hours a week.You may decide to spend a year traveling the world while maintaining existing work and working whenever you feel like it. As a salaried worker I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to work a few hours a week for 6-12 months in a row and still be employed unless you had an exceptional situation.With a number of salaried positions, especially with companies that receive funding or are growing a bit past early startup stages you often lose all freedom to make decisions that you&#x27;re qualified to make. Such as having to ask permission from multiple people to store $0.01 &#x2F; month worth of files in an S3 bucket where the discussion to get this approval literally costs 10,000x to 20,000x more in engineering time. reply xwdv 9 hours agorootparentI’m still not sold.How often are you getting $30k contracts that can be done in two weeks? Remote workers can still travel the world and work remotely if they can tolerate the timezone differences. I just got done with a rental in Costa Rica where I lived by the beach for 40 days this summer while working remote.I don’t particularly care if I have to ask permission to get stuff done in a company. This is actually one of the reasons I spend a lot of time doing nothing: I’m blocked by other people and am waiting for them to resolve something or get their specs straightened out. By the time there is work for me to do, I’ve spent a lot of time idling. The actual work is done quickly, efficiently and I’m back to waiting for more work. The bottleneck is always other people, it’s not engineering taking too long.I’m not going to push those people to hurry up either. They are under other pressures and it’s none of my business how long they take. As a remote worker, they are out of sight and out of mind until they have something useful for me.Sometimes when we finish a big project, there’s a period of 2 or 3 months afterwards where we basically do very little except maintenance of the new deployment. Conveniently this year, we planned for those months to coincide with the summer.Everything I’ve heard about freelancing has told me it’s not going to be this easy.

When I&#x27;ve done freelancing in the past, I&#x27;ve never had to look for any clients besides posting \"I&#x27;m available to help out people on a freelance-basis\" on various social media, and then I get more work available to me than I could realistically do.I think most established freelancers \"suffer\" from the same.

They didn’t start out like that, and I’m not sure how easy the road would be in the current economy, but the people who started out 10-15 years ago have it made for them. They did work a lot more than us who went into the corporate mill, but they are frankly going to “win” anyway considering some of them are basically set for retirement at age 40-45. reply doctorhandshake 16 hours agorootparentWhat industry is this where all of the ICs you know are making a million or more? reply devjab 4 hours agorootparentThey started consulting and eventually build products that they sell to the organizations they consulted for.

Another started as a RPA (robot process automation) trainer who worked together with the business side of the whole concept and was their go-to for technical training whenever they sold a \"package\" to organizations. Now owns a 50+ person company that is full of consultants that did what he once did.I guess the latter isn&#x27;t really an IC anymore, but I know he didn&#x27;t plan for things to happen this way.

The jump from lead to principal is a big one in terms of workload and stress, and I’ve been told the pay difference isn’t huge.Older I get, the less I care to ascend the ladder. Even at this point I’m doing it out of a sense of amassing status in case I need it, rather than being motivated by it.

There are basically a few people who are higher in the entire company, which is a medium-sized public company.The best thing about this company is the work life balance; I never put in a lot of hours. The worst thing is the skill level of most of our software engineers. The thing I hate about this new role is that I&#x27;m less connected to the day-to-day work and just getting shit done. I&#x27;m in even more meetings now and the expectation is that I&#x27;ll somehow help to level up the semi-competent people we hire, and make sure projects go smoothly even though everything is built on a foundation of shit.Fortunately I am paid extremely well.

If you like sticking your nose in everywhere, going to meetings and want to move away from programming this is the role.It&#x27;s a role with little power or accountability. Part of your role is justifying your value. The successful ones I have seen have been able to listen, take in everything and convey that message in language a vp understands.By default I say don&#x27;t take it you sound happy at your current level.

As is often pointed out on HN, electrical cars are substantially heavier than their fossil fueled alternatives, and generate other pollution along the way. Furthermore, we&#x27;re digging our lithium brines from the environment, without really understanding what all this lithium will do once it&#x27;s leached out into the environment or what impact the mines themselves will have.With the recent advances of turning CO2 into other substances, such as propane, should we be focusing more on closing the carbon cycle and simply be producing fossil fuels from the waste products of yesteryear?Naively, it feels like we understand C, O and H, better than we understand some of the rare metals we&#x27;re now introducing in the name of climate change. reply whats_a_quasar 16 hours agoparentElectric cars vastly reduce the environmental impact of cars. Everyone who&#x27;s run the numbers agrees on this [1][2][3]. Battery vehicles aren&#x27;t that much heavier than gasoline vehicles, and the volume of metals needed to make a battery is a tiny fraction of the volume of oil needed to fuel a car across its lifecycle. Power plants are much more efficient than small engines in cars, and as the grid decarbonizes the emissions of battery electric vehicles move towards zero. Electric cars really are far better for the planet than burning gas, there isn&#x27;t a catch.I get the worries, Lithium mining causes ecological damage, but every sort of resource extraction causes ecological damage. Every kilogram of pollution generated from lithium mining prevents many times more pollution generated from oil extraction and emissions. Lithium, cobalt, and the rest aren&#x27;t exotic materials, the battery industry is huge and has many decades of experience building batteries.Synthesizing hydrocarbons is an important technology. But that process is incredibly energy intensive, and it&#x27;s much more efficient to use electricity to just charge a battery. The scale of production of synthetic hydrocarbons isn&#x27;t anywhere close to where it would need to be to make a dent in climate change. I think that electrofuels will be very important in aviation - they&#x27;re the only apparent pathway to run jet engines without emissions. But it will be a long time, if ever, before that technology is mature enough to fuel passenger vehicles at a meaningful scale.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;data-and-statistics&#x2F;charts&#x2F;comparative-l...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;vehicles&#x2F;electric_emissions.html[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S136403212... reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just that. Solar is already cheaper than other generation methods, except that it&#x27;s intermittent. So it needs some kind of storage technology.The batteries in electric vehicles are a storage technology, so all you have to do is charge your car while the sun shines. If you need the batteries anyway it makes much more sense to put them there so you can also stop burning gasoline. reply palata 11 hours agorootparent> Solar is already cheaper than other generation methods...In a world that mostly relies on abundant fossil energy. We tend to ignore that and interpolate from \"solar improved 3x in the last year, so in X years it will have replaced oil\", but that is just wrong. Solar today depends on fossil fuel, and it is absolutely not a given that it can ever replace it (e.g. see next point).> ... except that it&#x27;s intermittent.Yep. So it&#x27;s not enough. We are at a point right now where it is very likely that what we cannot change anymore (the consequences of what we already emitted) will already cause global instability. I find it crazy that people have the faith to count on technology that does not exist yet.We need to use (much, much) less energy, that is the only solution. People don&#x27;t like the word \"degrowth\", so let&#x27;s call it differently: let&#x27;s say we need a \"smarter society\": less bullshit, less over-consumption, more efficient everything, more minimalistic everything. Probably cryptocurrencies, cheap rockets and SUVs are not part of this world, though. reply ianburrell 11 hours agorootparentThe production of solar panels requires lots of energy which currently uses fossil fuels. But the whole point of making solar panels is to decarbonize energy. We will need to use fossil fuels for a while longer to make the transition.You didn&#x27;t mention why this transition isn&#x27;t possible. There is also not enough green energy currently to stop using fossil fuels. It is either transition or death.You mention things that have a small effect. They would be good to get rid but they won&#x27;t get us there. To use much less energy, we would need to give up cars, trains, AC, and heat. You probably say we should bicycles, and we should, but guess what gets used to make bicycles. We might have to give up food since industrial agriculture is required to feed everyone. reply rich_sasha 2 hours agorootparentAll scenarios where we rely entirely on renewables assume we can scale storage (or very special locales where there is abundant hydro or reliable year-round favourable weather).But to make knowledge scalable storage simply does not exist beyond maybe 48hrs. It may well come, but it&#x27;s not here.For some reason some people assume it is not a problem. reply palata 11 hours agorootparentprev> You didn&#x27;t mention why this transition isn&#x27;t possible. There is also not enough green energy currently to stop using fossil fuels. It is either transition or death.Nope: I mean that green energy is just not capable of replacing fossil fuels, just by looking at orders of magnitude. Thinking that it is possible by extrapolating some graphs is just naive. It is not, that&#x27;s all.Of course we need to build alternatives (both nuclear plants and renewables), but they will only cover a fraction of fossil fuels. Don&#x27;t under-estimate fossil fuels, they are extremely efficient energy.> To use much less energy, we would need to give up cars, trains, AC, and heat. [...] We might have to give up foodThat&#x27;s the whole point of degrowth: prioritize what you can keep. Planes will mostly disappear, that&#x27;s pretty much a fact. Food has to stay under some form, quite obviously (but meat will mostly disappear).We are at a point where it is about survival: we need to organize our society and cities such that people don&#x27;t starve in the next few decades. Let&#x27;s be optimistic, I believe we can still keep a modern society. But probably we won&#x27;t change smartphone every year, and people living in cities won&#x27;t own a car. reply ianburrell 9 hours agorootparentFood accounts for 26% of emissions. 31% of that is meat. Nearly all of the usage is fossil fuels so decarbonizing electricity won&#x27;t help unless electrify agriculture. Turn off the fossil fuels, the combine harvesters stop running and half of people die (the peasant farmers of Asia are fine). People mention permaculture as alternative, but that requires lots of labor. Is the plan that everybody becomes a peasant?The problem with talking about smartphones and planes is that they aren&#x27;t enough. For example, a big portion of energy usage is heating and cooling homes. Are you saying people need to give up AC and die in the summer? Or give up heating and die in the winter? Obviously, we should insulate houses, but like solar panels, that takes fossil fuels. reply runarberg 9 hours agorootparentAgricultural machinery can be electrified. There are alternatives to fossil fuel fertilizers. Land use can be prioritized in such a way to significantly lower the need of chemical fertilizers while maintaining current yield. Lowering the production of meat and other animal products will yield much more consumed calories per grown calorie.The transformation of agriculture is inevitable or we will all die.Similarly homes can be insulated, roofs can be made of heat reflecting materials, trees can be grown to provide shade. We can build cooling centers in cities. replylovecg 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah I became convinced over the last couple of years that solar + batteries is pretty much the solution and all the technology is here, everything else (degrowth, nuclear) is a politically infeasible distraction. We need larger scale and faster adoption which is a whole set of challenges on its own (see CA lagging behind Texas for example in what is a complete self-own) reply palata 11 hours agorootparent> all the technology is here, everything else (degrowth, nuclear) is a politically infeasible distraction.You need to replace fossil fuels with . If you are convinced that solar + batteries can do it, then you need to rethink about orders of magnitudes.Even nuclear cannot reasonably replace fossil fuels in the timeline that we need (i.e. before global instability that may well slow down many things). Solar is far behind.Also never forget that we are living a mass extinction right now (it is happening, it is a measurable fact), and that is solely due to human activity in a world with abundant energy. If you find a solution to replace fossil fuels, you may save what remains to be saved on the climate front, but you will finish killing biodiversity. I don&#x27;t know about you, but that is catastrophic to me.Conclusion: we need to use much less energy, and therefore we need to be more minimalistic and stop growing just for the sake of growing. It&#x27;s called \"degrowth\", but some people don&#x27;t like that word because they think it means \"go back to Middle Age\". Instead it just means: engineers (like everybody else) need to work hard on clever solutions that rely less on energy. That&#x27;s not Middle Age, it&#x27;s just not the Silicon Valley world. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> Conclusion: we need to use much less energyYour thinking is that we can&#x27;t build solar panels and nuclear reactors fast enough, but we can build housing fast enough to move a significant fraction of the population to higher density areas where they don&#x27;t have to drive as much? Because that&#x27;s the low-hanging fruit on energy consumption, and it&#x27;s a massive scale long-term construction project with significant political opposition.And we should still do it, if only to get housing prices out of crazyland. But what makes you think we can do it any faster than we can build generation capacity? reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentprevSolar + electric cars is an excellent solution for transportation. It&#x27;s basically the whole problem gone as fast as you can build the new infrastructure.But solar still has the same storage problem in the power grid. You need something to keep the lights on at night. Lithium batteries are cost effective when it means you can avoid the cost of the whole ICE powertrain and replace buying gas with cheap daytime solar -- which also means that the production capacity for lithium batteries is going to go there.But then you start talking about electrifying heat, for which the peak demand is when it&#x27;s colder. At night. And for that it makes sense to build some more nuclear reactors. reply ianburrell 11 hours agorootparentFirst, it shouldn&#x27;t be solar+storage but solar+wind+storage. Solar and wind work well together because wind is strongest at night.Second, you need to specify what kind of storage you are talking. We will need a lot less short-term storage for overnight than we need for cloudy, calm days. Batteries make sense for short-term storage but are too expensive for long-term. Generated fuels, like hydrogen, may work well for long-term storage and we&#x27;ll them for other things.Third, we can overbuild solar and wind. It might be cheaper to make 3x or 5x than needed. Finally, we are going to need extra energy for carbon capture and generating fuels. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> First, it shouldn&#x27;t be solar+storage but solar+wind+storage. Solar and wind work well together because wind is strongest at night.The trouble is they&#x27;re both intermittent, even independent of time of day. For solar that&#x27;s much less trouble because the demand is higher during the day, and aligns extremely well with air conditioning load in the summer.But if you&#x27;re relying on wind at night and then there isn&#x27;t any, and you also have no solar because it&#x27;s night, what&#x27;s left?> Generated fuels, like hydrogen, may work well for long-term storage and we&#x27;ll them for other things.At which point you have to add the cost of production, storage and generation facilities for some other generating technology.> Third, we can overbuild solar and wind. It might be cheaper to make 3x or 5x than needed.But how does that fix it? Sometimes it&#x27;s calm for weeks, so your wind turbines are generating at 5% capacity for that long. Are you going to overbuild by 20x? Or build enough storage to power the entire grid for that long, even if you only use it for two weeks every three or four years?> Finally, we are going to need extra energy for carbon capture and generating fuels.This is a generic argument for building more of any kind of non-carbon generating capacity. reply ianburrell 9 hours agorootparentWind turns out to be pretty reliable. It gets built in places that blow regularly. It is also more reliable offshore where they are building new capacity. Also, we will definitely need short-term storage to fill in solar into the evening and night. But night time usage is small, and things like charging cars can be delayed.Overbuilding means that can use solar and wind more of the time. Partly because wind and solar are anti-correlated, partly because you build them in different spots, and partly because there is some energy being generated. 3x means that only need a couple weeks per year need backup. 5x means that couple days per year need storage.The generated fuel production would already exist because need them as fuel. Repurposing natural gas storage should work for hydrogen and there is lots of that available. The power plants would need to sit around but should be able to convert natural gas to hydrogen. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> Wind turns out to be pretty reliable.> 5x means that couple days per year need storage.But that&#x27;s the problem. If you need the long-term storage at all because you have a period with ~0 output from renewables, you then need to maintain enough generating capacity to run the whole grid from something else during that period, even if you only use it once a decade. Which is enormously expensive.> But night time usage is small, and things like charging cars can be delayed.The night time usage is about half the peak daytime usage during the summer, and a significantly higher proportion in the winter. And it will get even higher if we switch to electric heating from fossil fuels.You already want to be charging cars during the day anyway because solar is cheaper, but none of that is included in the existing numbers because the current number of electric cars isn&#x27;t a major proportion of power consumption. We could perfectly well charge electric cars entirely from solar, but you still need to handle the existing nighttime load with something. reply lovecg 14 hours agorootparentprevI’m encouraged by this graph https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;battery-price-decline - hopefully the trend can continue for a while longer! reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentThis is a classic exponential curve, which infamously level out after they hit some kind of bottleneck. It&#x27;s possible that it will keep going long enough to be competitive, but it&#x27;s not a safe enough bet to put all the eggs in one basket.If we build a lot of nuclear reactors and then it turns out that storage becomes cheaper, it will cost an amount of money in line with what we currently pay to generate electricity, much of which will be paid by the investors who bet on the wrong horse. If we don&#x27;t build a lot of nuclear reactors and then it turns out storage is not cheaper and so we keep burning fossil fuels, that is bad. reply ianburrell 11 hours agorootparentAre you going to overbuild nuclear to cover the peaks? Or are you going to build for baseload and then need storage to cover the gaps?How are you going to get people to build nuclear power plants when they could make more money on solar?Who is going to pay to decommission nuclear power plants when they go bankrupt? Solar drives baseload plants bankrupt, which is why coal plants are going out of business. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparent> Are you going to overbuild nuclear to cover the peaks? Or are you going to build for baseload and then need storage to cover the gaps?That obviously depends on the cost of storage relative to the cost of building more plants, but you don&#x27;t even need to ask the question until after you&#x27;ve already built enough plants to replace all of the existing fossil fuel baseload, so let&#x27;s start there.> How are you going to get people to build nuclear power plants when they could make more money on solar?Regulatory reform to address the maliciously, intentionally high cost of construction and operation, resulting in competitive prices.> Who is going to pay to decommission nuclear power plants when they go bankrupt?They don&#x27;t get decommissioned because they don&#x27;t result in that kind of bankruptcy. They cost a lot to build, but once they&#x27;re built, they&#x27;re going to exist for decades.If something else turns out to be much cheaper the people who invested in it may get a below market rate of return, but still it doesn&#x27;t get shut down, because the initial capital expenditure is a sunk cost that has already been paid. The incremental cost of continuing to generate power is much lower.> Solar drives baseload plants bankrupt, which is why coal plants are going out of business.Coal plants have a substantial fuel cost, which puts them at a disadvantage. They operate at a loss if the price of electricity drops below the price of coal, and then shut down, and then have to recover their capital costs by operating for fewer hours. Nuclear plants continue to operate at 100% output pretty much regardless of the price of electricity because their fuel cost is negligible. Notice that it&#x27;s the existing coal plants going out of business and not the existing nuclear plants.Nuclear also has untapped potential for things like cogeneration, thermal storage and on-site desalination, all of which would make it more cost competitive but are not currently being exploited. reply lovecg 14 hours agorootparentprevI’m with you on nuclear, I’m just pessimistic it’s possible today politically. I wish we all pulled a France back in the 60s, but it seems like the window on that has closed. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThe main thing preventing nuclear is lobbying from fossil fuel energy companies and petroleum exporting countries. You often hear anti-nuclear claims from environmental groups, but follow the money and see who is financing them:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;doceo&#x2F;document&#x2F;P-9-2022-00127...But they lobby against anything that could practically reduce dependence on fossil fuels, not just nuclear. If you want to do anything about it you have to overcome that. reply runarberg 11 hours agorootparentprevFrance in the 60s was a repressive colonial power with access to Uranium via their colonies.I certainly hope we have learned the horrors of colonialism and won’t repeat that disastrous period. reply pptr 14 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, it looks like costs have stagnated in recent years: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-... reply reducesuffering 14 hours agorootparentprevWind, Hydro, and batteries will all contribute to a significant baseload. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentThe only one of those which is actually baseload is hydro, which is already installed in most of the areas with suitable geography. You can&#x27;t use wind without storage for electric heat or people will freeze to death.Batteries are a storage technology, but we&#x27;re going to be putting the bulk of battery production capacity into electrifying transportation for the foreseeable future. replyfulafel 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s 50%. It&#x27;s significant, as much as gas car economy improvements over a few decades. We should of course still take it, but it&#x27;s not nearly enough.We need a order of magnitude improvement to make the globally growing car use remotely sustainable. Reducing car usage can be done many ways, eg ensuring gas is taxed enough that gas-based cars don&#x27;t stay in everyday use, and developing non car transport and urban structure. reply 6D794163636F756 7 hours agorootparentprevThe only nuance is that it&#x27;s often better to continue using your existing car than buying a new ev. That&#x27;s the only situation I&#x27;ve heard any real suggestions that ice is more environmental than an ev. reply krmboya 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the story for safe disposal&#x2F;recycling of used batteries? reply picture 16 hours agoparentprevWell the real answer is to reduce consumption. It can and should be done without sacrificing comfort. This is a very uphill battle against systems that are interested in distracting you by turning your attention towards fads (recycling, electrification, carbon capture) when in reality we need degrowth and permaculture. (Please read this thread a bit more, including my replies, before you tell me what I think degrowth means. I&#x27;m only using it to mean \"less [economic] growth\")In a bit more detail:How about less cars? More effective public transit is good for people and the climate.Let&#x27;s do away with golf lawns and pools for every house... Perhaps architecture can be adapted to suit the specific location instead of stamping the same stock photo \"American house with garage that can fit 4 cars.\" Look at passive cooling and stuff. [Again, I&#x27;m talking about redefining comfort. Is a personal pool and large car and trimmed lawn really, honestly, what makes you comfortable? Or is it more a product of culture and advertising? You&#x27;re absolutely free to believe either way, and I don&#x27;t want anyone to force you to do anything.]And honestly, we need to consoom less. Devices should not have a lifecycle of one year. You and I don&#x27;t really need all these gadgets and trinkets, either. Let&#x27;s stop buying random thingsIf you think this is a distraction or that it won&#x27;t work because we can&#x27;t get everyone to agree: Degrowth and permaculture requires honestly no critical mass. You can choose to buy things that last longer, and use them a bit more. Learn to fix things, etc. These are all nothing but straight benefits to you (more money in your pocket, skills that can make you more valuable in the current system, more time available now that you aren&#x27;t swiping short form videos all day). reply trts 16 hours agorootparentThere is no way this world exists without an authoritarian global government.Have you analyzed the impact of the total elimination of 4 car garages, golf courses, \"trinkets\", and enforced 5-year upgrades on devices? do those rank among the highest-impact against climate change, or do you just not like them very much?Do you expect that the people who would have the authority to make and enforce these decisions agree with you about which things are important or not, and have also done the cost-benefit analyses correctly and in good faith?And they&#x27;re resistant to buy-off by the industries that have the most to lose under a degrowth paradigm? reply picture 15 hours agorootparentI never said anything about forcing this idea on other people. I believe that degrowth and permaculture are about yourself, not other people. I believe that this change needs to start from the local level, in an organic way, instead of being signed into law and all dissenters be crushed. By engaging locally, logistics and politics problems that you speak of are pretty much solved.I believe that I can change people&#x27;s opinion by talking about this possible world, and they are completely free to act how they wish. I also think that doing these things are straight selfish benefits for you (more money in your pocket, skills that can make you more valuable in the current system, more time available now that you aren&#x27;t swiping short form videos all day) reply gnramires 13 hours agorootparentSigned, this is what I believe as well; I also think there are technological solutions, but technology alone won&#x27;t save us this time, because of the scale of the issue. How much carbon we need to remove from the atmosphere even optimistically (it&#x27;s already planned that we need to remove an astronomical amount! even for the less good projections) is frankly nuts, astronomical. Removing carbon is much, much more difficult than burning buried carbon.I also echo the sentiment that we should both create a culture of questioning excesses, enjoying a simplified lifestyle of essentials: good health (address pollution, agriculture filled with toxic compounds, etc.), peace, arts and culture, instead of often self-destructive excesses; and that we should look at effective interventions: feeling good about it is not enough, we need actual effective change!Some of the most effective changes you can do individually[1] is (1) reducing meat consumption significantly;[2] (2) Less air travel (3) Use alternative forms of transportation (bike, walk, public transit, live near work?).(Of course, if you have a huge house with tons of appliances... I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s highly significant!)I&#x27;m doing all those things personally. And as honest as I can: I think my health and wellbeing genuinely improved (I&#x27;ve lost weight due to better mostly-plant diet, am much more fit due to walking and public transit; I guess there&#x27;s a psychological factor from knowing I&#x27;m helping too!). Public transit is the most inconvenient sometimes (other times it&#x27;s far more convenient), but then I&#x27;m not absolute and take a ride faring app every now and then. Living this way isn&#x27;t only possible, it&#x27;s genuinely good.Discovering places nearby to travel and connecting with local history and culture is something I also think we could do a lot more.And by all means, be politically active on this issue! (I can&#x27;t change things like energy matrix with individual habits, but I can vote well)I&#x27;m with you dude :) Hack the planet![1] This seems to be a pretty good source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;here-are-the-most-effective-thin...

Unwavering optimism that things will be fine is exactly how we got where we are today; decades of knowing global warming is on the horizon with nowhere near enough response. reply kdmccormick 15 hours agorootparentprevBullshit.Bike, ped, and rail infrastructure can be built at the national, state, and sometimes even local level. These things all reduce the need for owning so many cars.Governments at any level can reduce how much they subsidize waste removal.

It can and should be done without sacrificing comfort.Comfort Or reducing their standard of living. Remember for most people in the world this they will keep consuming to get to *a* standard and will not care until they get there. One can say that the average person in a sub saharan african country X consumes 1&#x2F;10th or 1&#x2F;50th of the carbon that an american does. But unless N generations of X don&#x27;t rise well above the poverty line they will continue to emit and it will add up by 2100 or 2200.You don&#x27;t even have to go to sub saharan africa. I believe there is non negligible double digit percentage of this country that is on the \"edge\" when it comes to many important living factors like Health, Education and Childcare Cost. Any of which when breached make one not care about reducing consumption. reply lamontcg 14 hours agorootparentprevAs you&#x27;ve seen \"degrowth\" is a counter-productive argument and you are your own worst enemy and this gives ammunition to the side which claims that climate change is only possible via severe personal sacrifice -- which again reinforces the notion that climate change is an individual problem and failing and the whole \"just recycle harder\" idea.We need to decarbonize the fucking electrical grid. Just get it done and that addresses the majority of the problem.You&#x27;d also probably be better off if you focused on just changing the incentives and regulations which promote disposable culture. The CAFE standards need an overhaul and the Chicken tax needs to go away, that would do wonders towards getting us smaller, cheaper vehicles. Right to repair laws and EU regulations around replaceable batteries that are being imposed now on companies like Apple will help a lot. Better public transportation, sure, but that means building it (which means more economic output and jobs, but differently). But we&#x27;re not going to manage to forcefully stop a lot of people from consuming, so we need to focus on making that impact less, particularly when it comes to GHGs, because that is more or less an emergency right now. We can have scalable carbon-neutral energy which still powers a lot of economic growth for the future up until we&#x27;re all dead. And if you argue against that you will lose the broader war for the sake of trying to be a perfectionist (#include ) reply palata 11 hours agorootparentHard disagree.Degrowth is the only reasonable future if you understand the big picture: it&#x27;s all about energy. Climate change and biodiversity loss are consequences of what humans do with abundant energy. Again: biodiversity loss is not due to CO2 at all, yet we are currently living a mass extinction. Replace fossils with nuclear fusion, you may solve climate change, but you will still be in a mass extinction.Now let&#x27;s be honest, we don&#x27;t know a technology today that can replace fossil fuels. And fossil fuels are not unlimited (we still have enough to finish messing up the climate, unfortunately, but we are around the peak of production globally right now). So anyway, the days of a world with abundant energy are soon over, you&#x27;ve got to deal with it. That&#x27;s called degrowth.Either we go into a controlled degrowth, or we go into uncontrolled degrowth (that&#x27;s poverty, global instability, wars, famines, ...). reply jacquesm 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s pretty much it. And that&#x27;s the elephant in the room, or &#x27;an uncomfortable truth&#x27;. The problem is that very few people want to admit it, and even fewer people want to act on it and even fewer people than that are acting on it (and those are not usually near the seats of power).Uncontrolled degrowth it is, for now. You forgot pandemics by the way, those are one way in which the loss of biodiversity and the ever increasing way in which humans force their way into animal territory is manifesting.

More effective public transit is good for people and the climateWell, I&#x27;m about to renew the annual rail passes (which cover our entire local region) for two of our children, but this approach only works because we happen to live 5 mins walk from a local station and their school is 10 mins walk from another station, on the same line.Good luck persuading people who don&#x27;t have the benefit of such \"lucky geography\" to do the same :&#x2F; reply picture 15 hours agorootparentI feel like I&#x27;m doing a good job of, if not persuading people, at least putting the idea in people&#x27;s heads by talking about it. Being optimistic is our best bet :) reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentThe trouble with \"more effective public transit\" is that it&#x27;s really not about having more transit, it&#x27;s about having higher density housing construction so there are more areas that you can run a subway or a bus and have it full of passengers.In cities this means you have to fight with property owners who want to keep housing costs high by limiting supply. And even if you win it will be years before the necessary amount of new housing is built to even start talking about new mass transit lines, whereas we need to do something now.And in rural areas it&#x27;s just not going to happen at all. The farmer is always going to have a truck. But it could be an electric truck. reply jandrewrogers 13 hours agorootparent> The farmer is always going to have a truck. But it could be an electric truck.Farm trucks are a pathological case for electrification. They often have fairly extreme range requirements under adverse weather conditions and heavy loads. They spend much of their time far from the electrical grid, never mind a proper charging station. In some regions they have to account for being too far from a normal gas station, which is one of the reason you can buy barrels of fuel to bring with you or an extended tank.But it doesn&#x27;t matter because there aren&#x27;t that many of them. Certainly not something we need to optimize for. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentFarm trucks are a perfect case for electrification. You install solar panels at the farmhouse and the thing is sitting there with a full charge every time you go to use it without ever making you drive 100 miles away to buy fuel. Farmers often have a commercial driver&#x27;s license or drive on private roads where one isn&#x27;t necessary, so the thing can be big and heavy and have enough capacity to run whatever equipment you may need to run in the middle of a field.But the point isn&#x27;t about farmers in particular, it&#x27;s anyone who lives in a rural or suburban area without enough density for mass transit. Plumbers and real estate agents in those areas are not going to find a bus there to take. And there are a lot of those. reply logifail 14 hours agorootparentprev> it&#x27;s about having higher density housing constructionUmm, how would one go about selling that policy? Do enough (any?) people want that?FWIW, my wife and I have spoken at length over the last year about what it would take for us to move, leaving our house and garden and safe streets and clean parks, our open countryside being only a short walk in pretty much every direction, and that our 7 year-old is able to walk the half mile to her primary school on her own every morning......and as it stands, there is no job offer _at all_ that would persuade us to move to the city.Especially after what we saw during the pandemic. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparent> Umm, how would one go about selling that policy? Do enough (any?) people want that?The thing preventing it right now is that it&#x27;s illegal. Most areas zoned for higher density housing already have it, so to make more it would have to go somewhere currently zoned for lower density, which the existing zoning prohibits.As for whether people want it, why does the existing higher density housing tend to cost more rather than less per square foot? Because it&#x27;s nearer to jobs and shops and mass transit, and many people like that.Nobody is forcing you to live there. In fact, if the place you currently live was one of the ares rezoned, it would net you a tidy sum -- the value of the land goes up because now someone can build a condo tower on it, meanwhile you can go use a fraction of the money to buy another single family home for even less than the one you have now is worth because the new construction reduces housing scarcity. reply logifail 13 hours agorootparent> The thing preventing it right now is that it&#x27;s illegalJust like towers (condos or any other kind) are round here.Your local politicans are elected?

But then why ban them, if no one would build them anyway because no one wants to live in them?The current problem is that the people who want to live in them are priced out of the areas where they would have to go by the zoning rules they would want to change. Having a 20% lower cost per square foot doesn&#x27;t make it more affordable to move there when the smallest available unit is required to have three times as many square feet. But since they can&#x27;t afford to move there they can&#x27;t vote to change the law there.It&#x27;s effectively a local law against poor people living there, which the poor people can&#x27;t vote against because they don&#x27;t live there.

Aviation is 2% of emissions. There are lots of little things that they add up. Like concrete being 3%, but nobody says that have to give up concrete.

If you don&#x27;t respect other people&#x27;s views, and if you think they&#x27;re all a product of manipulation you definitely don&#x27;t, then you won&#x27;t have any compunction in overriding them by force.

Your preference for petrol powered transport is merely a manipulation by the system and thus has no validity.In practice, comfort is mostly a function of stuff. Yes there are aspects that aren&#x27;t to do with stuff but they&#x27;re things that are really hard to move the needle on: loving families, low corruption, stable government and so on.

Improving access to and making people aware of less resource-intensive forms of comfort doesn&#x27;t have to come from an authoritarian place. One of my major motivations for seeking out a more walkable area was urbanist YouTubers extolling the benefits.

All other variables being excluded, time to do what I want is at least as important for me as stuff (luckily I like my job so time&#x2F;money aren&#x27;t usually in conflict). And I think for many people \"stuff\" like cars and nice lawns aren&#x27;t inherently drivers of comfort, but rather just possible reifications of goals like \"pretty yard\" or \"fast&#x2F;easy transit,\" both of which can be realized in less resource intensive ways.

When people say \"degrowth\" they often mean a reduced standard of living. But it&#x27;s possible to reduce raw resource utilization while at the same time improving quality of life and building wealth.A high-quality, well-maintained car or a phone that lasts longer is more valuable than the disposable equivalent. Developing dense city centers creates wealth, reduces environmental impact, and improves quality of living all at the same time.In an economy that really is shrinking, things tend towards stasis and people spend much more time fighting over the shrinking pie. A lot of the built environment needs to change to become sustainable, and that&#x27;s only possible if the economy is vibrant, housing and transportation are plentiful, and people are motivated to improve their communities.I don&#x27;t know the solution to convincing suburban Americans to buy smaller houses and smaller cars, but I think the only way it works is if there is a positive vision of the future with both more wealth and a healthier planet. reply ramblenode 15 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t know the solution to convincing suburban Americans to buy smaller houses and smaller cars, but I think the only way it works is if there is a positive vision of the future with both more wealth and a healthier planet.While I agree, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that this framing overlooks the significant central planning component.The suburban lifestyle is heavily subsidized from nearly every direction (housing, autos, roads, fuel, power and water grid, shipping) which makes something that is actually a luxury lifestyle feel like a median lifestyle. If suburban living were priced at the free market rate we would see an organic shift to denser developments and more efficient resource usage. reply wizofaus 14 hours agorootparentMost of that subsidization has already happened and will be locked in place for some time unfortunately - it&#x27;s not like governments can realistically get away with discontinuing infrastructure maintenance while people are still living in an area. More politically feasible is higher levels of direct subsidisation for neighbourhoods that do measurably have a lower ecological impact per capita, to entice people to move to them. After all those who&#x27;ve grown up in suburbia with various expectations around house&#x2F;land size and ability to get yourself everywhere via private motor vehicle are going to need quite some persuading that they can maintain their desired standard of living in much more built-up areas where transit&#x2F;walking&#x2F;cycling are the standard ways of getting around. OTOH there&#x27;s still a lot more than can be done to massively reduce the carbon footprint of the average suburban home (and its occupants).And yes, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that in many first world countries (esp. my own), many higher density neighbourhoods actually have relatively high environmental footprints - usually because they&#x27;re quite affluent ones. But also because they&#x27;re often occupied by single people who don&#x27;t have as many opportunities to share&#x2F;pool resources with others as those in suburbia.

My association with \"de-growth\" is that it means stopping or reversing GDP growth in order to reduce research consumption. Some degrowth people think that we can continue to increase quality of life in ways that the GDP metric doesn&#x27;t capture, while others think that quality of life needs to be reduced to preserve the environment.I think we agree then about \"alternative growth\" or \"eco-growth\" where GDP and resource consumption are decoupled, where GDP continues to increase while environmental impact simultaneously falls. Most wealthy countries are already actually at that point already - CO2 emissions are falling while they still grow (adjusted for offshore emissions). It&#x27;s an important point to me because the degrowth people I&#x27;ve encountered are kinda defeatist and I don&#x27;t think will be able to grow a coalition, but decoupling the environment from growth is eminently doable.Noah Smith is my main influence on this topic: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noahpinion.blog&#x2F;p&#x2F;people-are-realizing-that-degr... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noahpinion.blog&#x2F;p&#x2F;degrowth-we-cant-let-it-happen... reply jshen 13 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a ton we can do before we talk about degrowth.

Now everybody does research for things that will either become profitable next year or in any case when they are multi-year projects they are just improvements of established techniques, with known market, so that there is a very low risk that they might not be profitable.The only way in which hydrocarbon synthesis would see the level of investment that is required for making it cost effective would be with some form of governmental intervention.We could have had already today cost-effective hydrocarbon synthesis if a lot of money and research time would not have been wasted with research in various directions that have been considered as futile by most since the very beginning, especially for methods of hydrogen storage and for hydrogen fuel cells. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentInstitute a carbon takes and those kinds of technologies may find an application for things like aviation fuels even at their existing pricing, after which you might see enough economies of scale to get the price down.But you might not.

Now they need to realize that electric cars are technologically simpler than the vast complexity of internal combustion, and they cannot reclaim that with \"but wait...\" any longer. reply jgreen10 16 hours agoparentprevThe amount of carbon emissions is simply far too large for sequestration efforts, natural or otherwise, to make a significant dent.In the end, what the world needs is an abundance of cheap energy without proportional carbon emissions. Everything else is secondary. reply arthur2e5 16 hours agorootparentAny hypothetical sequestration into a fuel (as in the parent parent comment) would also require a power source, so the question goes back to low-carbon power! reply nvm0n2 16 hours agorootparentAlthough in fairness liquid fuels are storable, so you can use intermittent solar and wind to run syngas processes. Low carbon power isn&#x27;t really the hard part, grid stability and the existing vehicle fleet is.Also of course, you could theoretically build nuke plants in the middle of nowhere that are remotely operatable, then use the power to make fuel. That could avoid NIMBY related costs. reply alexchamberlain 16 hours agorootparentprevI think low-carbon power is fairly well understood in the form of solar and wind, and in future, maybe wave. The big problem is we can&#x27;t store it or meaningfully transport it over huge distances. reply simpleblend 15 hours agorootparentprevYou would think that if the world is truly on the brink of devastation, it would be at least worthy of TRYING nuclear power. reply lamontcg 15 hours agoparentprev> With the recent advances of turning CO2 into other substances, such as propane, should we be focusing more on closing the carbon cycle and simply be producing fossil fuels from the waste products of yesteryear?Being able to do that cheaply is still science-fiction.Wind and Solar are here right now. reply bwanab 16 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a good chance EVs aren&#x27;t the best long run solution. But, right now, we don&#x27;t need long run, we need immediate, short term solutions to the problem that we&#x27;ve got right now which is the need to keep people employed during the transition which, since people in many countries tend to live outside of transportation hubs, means keeping them in cars for the time being. EVs allow the use of non-fossil fuels to power that auto transport.But, where you&#x27;re definitely right is t",

    "originLink": "https://raft.github.io",
    "originBody": "The Raft Consensus Algorithm Quick Links Raft paper raft-dev mailing list Raft implementations What is Raft? Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are available today. Hold on—what is consensus? Consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make progress when any majority of their servers is available; for example, a cluster of 5 servers can continue to operate even if 2 servers fail. If more servers fail, they stop making progress (but will never return an incorrect result). Consensus typically arises in the context of replicated state machines, a general approach to building fault-tolerant systems. Each server has a state machine and a log. The state machine is the component that we want to make fault-tolerant, such as a hash table. It will appear to clients that they are interacting with a single, reliable state machine, even if a minority of the servers in the cluster fail. Each state machine takes as input commands from its log. In our hash table example, the log would include commands like set x to 3. A consensus algorithm is used to agree on the commands in the servers' logs. The consensus algorithm must ensure that if any state machine applies set x to 3 as the nth command, no other state machine will ever apply a different nth command. As a result, each state machine processes the same series of commands and thus produces the same series of results and arrives at the same series of states. Raft Visualization Here's a Raft cluster running in your browser. You can interact with it to see Raft in action. Five servers are shown on the left, and their logs are shown on the right. We hope to create a screencast soon to explain what's going on. This visualization (RaftScope) is still pretty rough around the edges; pull requests would be very welcome. The Secret Lives of Data is a different visualization of Raft. It's more guided and less interactive, so it may be a gentler starting point. Publications This is \"the Raft paper\", which describes Raft in detail: In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout. A slightly shorter version of this paper received a Best Paper Award at the 2014 USENIX Annual Technical Conference. Diego Ongaro's Ph.D. dissertation expands on the content of the paper in much more detail, and it includes a simpler cluster membership change algorithm. More Raft-related papers: Doug Woos, James R.

Furthermore, the fallibility of real-world hardware (handling memory&#x2F;disk corruption and grey failures), the requirements of real-world systems with tight latency SLAs, and a need for things like flexible quorum&#x2F;dynamic cluster membership make implementing it for production a long and daunting task. The commit history of etcd and hashicorp&#x2F;raft, likely the two most battle-tested open source implementations of raft that still surface correctness bugs on the regular tell you all you need to know.The tigerbeetle team talks in detail about the real-world aspects of distributed systems on imperfect hardware&#x2F;non-abstracted system models, and why they chose viewstamp replication, which predates Paxos but looks more like Raft.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jepsen-io&#x2F;maelstrom&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tigerbeetle&#x2F;tigerbeetle&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;DE... reply mananaysiempre 11 hours agoparent> [Viewstamped replication] predates Paxos but looks more like Raft.Heidi Howard and Richard Mortier’s paper[1] on the topic of Paxos vs Raft has (multi-decree) Paxos and Raft written out in a way that makes it clear that they are very, very close. I’m very far from knowing what consequences (if any) this has for the implementation concerns you state, but the paper is lovely and I wanted to plug it.

One of the most challenging projects I&#x27;ve tried to do.The Raft paper is very gentle to read, and gives you a great intuition on its own. Even if you don&#x27;t want to implement it, you probably use software that uses it: like etcd or consul or cockroach or tidb, etc.I collected all the resources I found useful while doing it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eatonphil&#x2F;goraft#references. This includes Diego Ongaro&#x27;s thesis and his TLA+ spec.Some people say Figure 2 of the Raft paper has everything you need but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just not true. It&#x27;s a little bit more vague than looking at the TLA+ spec to me anyway. reply skowalak 37 minutes agoparentI had to implement Raft for a network programming course during my bachelors and I had the same experience regarding how gentle the paper was. Especially for people new to distributed algorithms, I can really recommend it.My implementation is probably not that great, but I put it online anyway if anyone is interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skowalak&#x2F;fastapi-raft&#x2F; reply agonz253 19 hours agoparentprevThis looks great.

It&#x27;s equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it&#x27;s decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are available today.After reading that I still have no idea.

They are titled \"consensus\" because the machines need to come to a consensus for what decision to make about a piece of data when a failure event occurs.For example, you have three servers all replicating the same SQL database:(A) - (B) - (C)The network connection linking (C) to the other two drops; (A) and (B) are notified and (B) is promoted to be the primary (it receives the writes and then distributes them to the replicas).However, (C) doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, and continues to receive some writes. The network connection is restored, and now (A) and (B) and (C) need to decide what to do. (B) and (C) have both independently received a different set of writes, and the servers need to come to a consensus on what to do with the data.This is what Raft, Paxos etc. are attempting to solve in a consistent and performant fashion. reply abraae 7 hours agorootparent> Arguably it&#x27;s a good description because it automatically filters out audiences who don&#x27;t know what it means; if you&#x27;re building a distributed system and looking at different consensus algorithms then it&#x27;s a simple and clear explanation, but if you aren&#x27;t then it&#x27;s not a relevant algorithm for you anyway!Somewhat discourteous to the 99% of people who don&#x27;t fall into the target audience - you&#x27;re leaving it to them to thrash around until they work out for themselves they&#x27;re at the wrong bar. reply oasisaimlessly 11 hours agoparentprevDid you try reading the next paragraph (\"Hold on—what is consensus?\")?Sometimes concepts are too \"big\" to be introduced to someone with no background in a single paragraph; such is life.

In many distributed systems, you want to distribute intake as well. reply _benedict 2 hours agoparentLeaderless protocols exist in the literature (EPaxos, Caesar, Tempo, ...). These systems usually have a \"leader\" per transaction, but the leader role is uncontested in normal operation, as it is self-declared by the coordinator of the transaction, so an election only takes place if the coordinator of that transaction fails for whatever reason. Multiple leaders may exist concurrently for any given datum&#x2F;key the operation involves.Cassandra is currently developing a leaderless protocol in this vein called Accord. In fact, Cassandra is already using a leaderless protocol for its LWTs; an optimised variant of classic (single-decree) Paxos, but this has significant overheads when competing transactions are declared for the same key at the same time. reply vhiremath4 19 hours agoparentprevThere are algos which prioritize high fault tolerance and do so by increasing the number of leaders (or the minimum number of nodes that must have a copy of the lookup data).One such algo is Chord:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chord_(peer-to-peer)It’s a peer-to-peer ring of nodes which have their values consistently hashed between them. The network leverages these things called “finger tables” which essentially store replication information in the form of a table. This table can have information which is incorrect or outdated and the peer you go to can tell you to go to another peer (usually the “next”&#x2F;“successor”) until you find the value (or don’t).Reason this algo can be used with no “leader” is because it can also work by just going to a node and doing a linear scan across all nodes. You don’t need a thumb table to speed up queries. reply toast0 17 hours agoparentprevElecting a leader and sending changes through the leader simplifies the system and improves throughput and predictability in the presence of contention.If your transactions are on independent topics, you can distribute the load by sharding leaders: assign ranges of the key space to different leaders and manipulate the elections so each node has a reasonable share of leadership.You can go leaderless and structure each write as essentially an election: broadcast the tenative transaction (or a request to transact, if the transaction is large enough) to all nodes, if you get a quorum of acceptance, you win and can commit the transaction. But if multiple nodes attempt transactions near the same time, consensus may be time consuming. If you have many nodes, and they all have pending transactions for the same topic, electing a leader and sending all transactions through the leader is going to be a lot faster than establishing consensus on every transaction individually. reply lostcolony 14 hours agorootparentOr more succinctly - a quorum agreeing to a leader to serialize writes through is both less work than trying to get a quorum to agree on every individual write, and equally as consistent. reply Vervious 10 hours agoparentprevNot really; there are algorithms where many nodes propose proposals in parallel, but eventually only one of those proposals gets finalized (or they maintain only a partial ordering, not a full ordering).

(in fact Redis does use a version of Raft).Simple use case, you&#x27;re running a database across three servers, so that users can ping any one of the servers and it still works (fault tolerance).User X pings server A to write something to a table.

Generally they are limited to picking a single server to act as a short-term leader. That server then is responsible for managing the data itself.Though you can conceive of a system where all data flows through the consensus algorithm, practically speaking that would introduce significant overhead at a granularity where it isn&#x27;t adding value.There isn&#x27;t neceasarily one dictator for the whole cluster, but rather usually they are scoped to each domain that requires serialization. reply dcchuck 19 hours agoparentprevSimplest terms - your app needs several different services or instances of a service to agree upon a value. There are a lot of reasons you can&#x27;t use things like the system clock to agree upon when something happened for example - this is where RAFT steps in.You&#x27;ll see \"fault-tolerant\" and \"replicated state machines\" often alongside them. Let&#x27;s break those down in this context.For \"fault-tolerance\" - think production environments where I need to plan for hardware failure. If one of my services goes down, I want to be able to continue operating - so we run a few copies of the app, and when one goes down, another operating instance will step up.In that case - how do we pick what&#x27;s in charge? How do all copies agree on things while everything is working smoothly? Raft.For \"replicated state machines\" - let&#x27;s stay in this world of fault-tolerance, where we have multiple instances of our app running. In each service, could reside a state machine. The state machine promises to take any ordered series of events, and always arrive at the same value. Meaning - if all of our instances get the same events in the same order, they will all have the same state. Determinism.This is where it all comes together, and why I think the jargon becomes tightly coupled to an \"easy to understand\" definition.You will reach for replicated state machines when you need deterministic state across multiple service instances. But the replicated state machines need a way to agree on order and messages received. That&#x27;s the contract - if you give everything all the messages in the same order, everything will be in the same state.But how do we agree on order? How do we agree on what messages were actually received? Just because \"Client A\" sends a messages \"1\", and \"2&#x27;, in a specific order does not guaranteed it is delivered at all, let alone in that order.Raft creates \"consensus\" around these values. It allows the copies to settle on which messages were actually received and when.So, you could use other approaches to manage \"all your service copies getting along\" but a replicated state machine is a nice approach. That replicated state machine architecture needs some way to agree on order, and Raft is a great choice for that. reply adunk 19 hours agoparentprevWikipedia has a nice list of software using the algorithm: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raft_(algorithm)#Production_us... reply oriettaxx 15 hours agorootparentapparently there is no reference to Docker in swarm mode, where it is used to decide what node should be the Leader reply uw_rob 19 hours agoparentprevThink databases which run across many different machines.Distributed databases are often conceptually modeled as a state machine. Writes are then mutations on the state machine.With a starting state (empty database), if everyone agrees that on a fixed list of mutations which are executed in a rigidity defined ordering, you will get the same final state.Which makes sense, right? If you run the following commands on an empty database, you would expect the same final state:1. CREATE TABLE FOO (Columns = A, B) 1. INSERT INTO FOO (1, 2) 1. INSERT INTO FOO (3, 4)Which would be:``` FOO: |A|B| |-|-| |1|2| |3|4| ```So where does \"consensus\" come into play? Consensus is needed to determine `mutation 4`. If the user can send a request to HOST 1 saying &#x27;Mutation 4. should be `INSERT INTO FOO (5, 6)`&#x27; then HOST 1 will need to coordinate together with all of the other hosts and hopefully all of the hosts can agree that this is the 4th mutation and then enact that change on their local replica.This ordering of mutations is called the transaction log.So, why is this such a hard problem? Most of the reasons are in [Fallacies of distributed computing](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fallacies_of_distributed_compu...) but the tl;dr is that everything in distributed computing is hard because hardware is unreliable and anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Also, because multiple things can be happening at the same time in multiple places so it&#x27;s hard to figure out who came first, etc.RAFT is such an algorithm to let all of these hosts coordinate together in a fault tolerant way to figure out the 4th mutation.Disclaimer: The above is just one use of RAFT. Another way RAFT is used in distributed databases is as a mechanism for the hosts to coordinate a hierarchy of communicate among themselves and when a host in the hierarchy is having problems RAFT can be used again to figure out another hierarchy.

Permitted concentrations of the lice-killing chemical, emamectin, in the sediment of sea lochs have increased from 12 to 272 nanograms per kilogram between 2017 and 2023. The increase followed a series of interventions from salmon farming companies, based on private research. Campaigners said this was a “shocking” example of how regulators bowed to industry pressure, and warned that marine wildlife would suffer. The process was a “shambles” characterised by “backroom dealing and secrecy”, they said. Environmental regulators insisted they “remain confident” that the process was “led by scientific evidence”. The salmon farming industry described the approach as “scientifically robust” and said it would protect the marine environment. The repeated weakening of proposed new safety limits for emamectin has been disclosed in a consultation currently being conducted by the Scottish Government. It is asking for views before 24 July on when the limits should be introduced. Emamectin, marketed as Slice, is fed to caged salmon in lochs around Scotland to kill lice that can plague them. But it is excreted and dumped into the water where it can harm shrimps, crabs, lobsters and other crustaceans. The Ferret’s previous revelations about the salmon farming industry’s seven-year campaign to block tougher environmental limits on the pesticide resulted in the affair being dubbed “Slicegate” by campaigners. After scientific research uncovered dangers to marine wildlife, in 2016 the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) proposed a complete ban on emamectin. But this was secretly abandoned after pressure from salmon farming companies and the Scottish Government. Instead, in October 2017, Sepa set an “interim” limit on the amount of emamectin allowed in sediment of 12 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg). This only applied to applications to increase existing discharges or for new fish farms. Sepa asked the UK Technical Advisory Group (UKTAG), which brings together scientists from all the UK’s environmental regulators, to recommend safety limits for the pesticide. The Ferret disclosed in 2019 that UKTAG was lobbied by salmon farming companies and emamectin’s US manufacturer, Merck, to relax its proposed limit, based on an unpublished report. In November 2019 UKTAG recommended, and Sepa accepted, that the interim limit should be raised from 12 to 23.5 ng/kg. But UKTAG said that evidence from the industry needed to be reviewed before final recommendations could be made. In July 2022, following further submissions from salmon farming companies, UKTAG recommended the limit again be raised, this time to 131 ng/kg. It agreed with the industry’s suggestion that the proposed safety factor, crucial for calculating the limit, should be reduced from 50 to 10. ‘Industry-owned’ pesticide study Then in January 2023 the Scottish Government postponed publishing the consultation on the introduction of the new limit after an intervention by Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming firms. According to the government, Salmon Scotland had detected a “possible error” in the derivation of the limit. As a result, UKTAG conducted another reassessment and concluded that the limit should be raised for a third time to 272 ng/kg in March. According to a UKTAG memo from 24 February released by Sepa, Salmon Scotland’s latest intervention relied on an “original, industry-owned study report”. UKTAG had seen summaries, but hadn’t had access to the full report. “UKTAG does not routinely request study reports owned by industry, as these are proprietary information and may contain trade secrets or confidential commercial information that the study owners claim exempt them from public disclosure,” the memo said. Nevertheless, UKTAG “worked with Salmon Scotland” and accepted that there had been an error in its assumptions that meant that the proposed safety limit for the pesticide should be doubled. Relaxing safety limits for emamectin Date Permitted concentration in sediment for new salmon farms (ng/kg) Date Permitted concentration in sediment for new salmon farms (ng/kg) October 2017 12 November 2019 23.5 July 2022 131 March 2023 272 Source: Scottish Government While the safety limit was being considered, salmon farmers increasingly turned to emamectin as other pesticides became less effective at killing lice. According to a report in March by the campaign group, WildFish, there was a 26 per cent increase in the pesticide’s use at fish farms in Scotland between 2021 and 2022. WildFish pointed out that emamectin was “highly toxic” and had been found to have a “persistent and detrimental” impact on marine wildlife. “Weakening the proposed safety limits for this chemical could have profound and long-term ecological impacts,” warned the group’s campaign manager, Dr Matt Palmer. “The newly proposed 23-fold increase in emamectin environmental safety limits is yet another shocking example of regulators bowing to pressure from industry lobbyists. For this increase to also be based on unpublished data commissioned by the industry itself is the antithesis of a transparent and precautionary approach.” Pesticide saga ‘sorry tale’ The Coastal Communities Network, which brings together 24 groups in Scotland keen to protect the marine environment, said that no other industry was allowed to dump as much pesticide into the sea as salmon farmers. “The saga of emamectin is a sorry tale,” said the network’s John Aitchison. “It shows how much the fish farming industry is able to affect the standards that are supposed to protect our seas from its toxic chemicals, and how hard it is to uncover what is happening behind the scenes when these decisions are made.” The process was a “shambles”, Aitchison argued. “All this backroom dealing and secrecy is as counterproductive as it is ridiculous. Fish farming in Scotland has a big problem with loss of trust.” He criticised the Scottish Government for consulting on a “heavily watered down” safety limit years after the dangers had been recognised. “Instead it ought to be asking itself whether the process that has recommended that pollution standard and others is fit for purpose,” he told The Ferret. The Scottish Greens suggested that swimmers and fishers shouldn’t have to worry about pesticides in the water. “The full background and explanation for this latest increase in permitted pesticide levels must be made more transparent,” said the Green MSP for the Highlands and Islands, Ariane Burgess. “This is so everyone who cares about our coasts can be confident that the safe level was determined by independent scientific evidence, not lobbying from the salmon farming industry.” Pesticide limit ‘led by scientific evidence’ The Scottish Environment Protection Agency stressed it had clear “aspirations” for safeguarding marine wildlife. “Sepa has been applying interim environmental standards to ensure protection of the environment,” said head of ecology, Peter Pollard. “We remain confident in the approach undertaken by UKTAG which is led by scientific evidence.” Sepa has accepted UKTAG’s recommendations. Sepa confirmed it had not seen the industry study which led to the latest relaxation of the safety limits for emamectin. Using “robust study summaries” rather than full reports was “normal practice” by regulators around the world, it said. Sepa pointed out that the pesticide limit now proposed – 272 ng/kg – was still 5.6 times stricter than the one in force before 2017. The UK Technical Advisory Group said it was committed to providing accurate guidance. “We conducted an extensive review of published scientific papers to derive recommendations for a new standard for emamectin,” a spokesperson told The Ferret. “All reports included in the evidence base complied with international standards for experimental design.” According to UKTAG, the latest change to the safety limit was made after “an industry representative” brought a “small arithmetical error” to its attention. The error was in a conversion factor used to derive the limit. As evidence, the industry “provided an extract of a methodology from a private research report”, which UKTAG said it agreed with. Other evidence came from “relevant unpublished third-party research” shared with UKTAG “on a voluntary basis by industry”. The Scottish Government stressed it was committed to protecting Scotland’s wildlife. “The implementation of new environmental standards for emamectin is crucial to this aim,” said a spokesperson. “We are confident that the UKTAG methodology is scientifically robust, and includes obtaining independent scientific peer reviews of the evidence. As such, Scottish Ministers have accepted their recommendations.” Dr Iain Berrill, head of technical at the industry body, Salmon Scotland, said: “UKTAG independently sets the environmental quality standard based on European Commission guidance. “As more data has become available, UKTAG is following a scientifically robust approach to review the environmental quality standard and set evidence-led limits that protect the marine environment.” Cover image thanks to iStock/richard johnson.

The goal of any company lobbying to reduce limits isn&#x27;t for the safety of the consumer, it&#x27;s for increasing profit margins even if it has bad downstream effects (because slight increases to cancer rates or whatever would not have a measurable effect on a company that will be dead in 10-20 years).

It&#x27;s only a problem when government officials abuse their office for personal gain (eg. taking bribes).

I have a close friend who had to go through chelation therapy because her blood had so many heavy metals from eating sushi 2-3 a week for a year.Industries that create pollution need MORE regulation, not less and things like this is depressing, where industry is able to corruptly change laws to benefit themselves and poison the people around them. reply fnordpiglet 15 hours agoparentThere problem is if there’s any more politically powerful force than “the children” it’s “the farmers,” despite the fact almost all farming is done by large corporations exploiting migrant labor and blasting the earth with chemicals to induce low quality substances that resemble vegetables and grains but lack almost all the nutrition. If we stopped today it would take a generation to make the soil independently viable again. reply mschuster91 14 hours agorootparentLarge scale mass farming as a consequence of consolidation is also responsible for the massive reduction in insects and birdlife biodiversity. Basically, miles upon miles of monoculture, that&#x27;s a food desert for the insects, and the birds don&#x27;t have any habitat as there are no bushes, no shade, nothing. And on top of that come the issues with deadly pesticides that kill off bees and other pollinators and leach into groundwater.People keep asking me why I&#x27;m so strongly opposed to GMO in food, outside of stuff like Golden Rice. The reason is that we can&#x27;t trust Big Ag to not do the wrong thing: for one, there are serious questions on monopolies and dependence of farmers, even entire nations in the end upon suppliers, and it&#x27;s almost exclusively about introducing resistence against pesticides, with the aforementioned effects on biodiversity. reply londons_explore 13 hours agorootparentGovernment could easily do something about this.You could just make a law that farms will be ranked by some biodiversity metric - for example, how many unique species of plant and animal were found by an inspector on an annual inspection. Any farm in the bottom 50% of rankings would need to pay perhaps 1% of revenue as an extra fee&#x2F;fine for being insufficiently wildlife friendly.Clearly people will game this metric, but most ways to fake having hundreds of species of animal on your farm are good for wild animals too. reply myshpa 13 hours agorootparentJust 1% of revenue for being insufficiently wildlife friendly?

Nut orchards replacing dairy farms. Regenerative practices like syntropic agriculture, natural farming, and permaculture to nurture soil. No pesticides or herbicides, limited fertilizers, compost over manure, smaller diverse fields, hedgerows, companion and nitrogen fixing plants.Think vast untouched forests, biodiverse corridors, and thriving meadows.It&#x27;s not merely a 1% revenue concern; it&#x27;s about safeguarding the Earth and prioritizing biodiversity.

Soils are degrading because the crops use too much nutrients and because the wildlife - particularly small burrowing animals - get killed off by pesticides directly or because their food got killed off by pesticides. On top of that, heavy farm machines compress the soil... and so it can&#x27;t soak up water any more, leading to flood and drought issues (it can&#x27;t retain water because the soil is too compacted for the water to seep through, so no buffer for drought times, and when rain falls it just washes the topsoil with it and is gone). And that doesn&#x27;t even mention insects and their role in food chains.> GMO&#x27;s should be regulated so that pesticide restiance is mitigated. Personally I think GMOs should have multiple pesticide restistances for each class of pest so that resistant pest mutations can be treated with a seperate pesticide.You didn&#x27;t get my point: pesticides kill everything but the GMO plants that are designed to be resistant, thus impacting the food chain of nature as an ecosystem. We&#x27;ve engineered places that are literally inhospitable to wildlife, with serious and far-reaching consequences. We barely understand food chains and anchor species as a concept, we only discovered just how huge a role wolves and beavers play in nature a few decades ago [1].

Modern agriculture is generally better for the soil than traditional. Look up the difference between till and no till. You just can’t do no till at the scale needed to feed the world unless we all start picking weeds full time.2. The point that they are making is that there are ways to create biodiversity within modern ag that are actually required by law. You are not supposed to plant gmo or spray your whole field to keep a remnant of the original population, riparian buffers, cover crops (voluntary), and other voluntary buffer zones (pollinator fields etc). These can all preserve biodiversity and prevent resistance while still outputting the food needed at the price we all want to pay. reply heyoni 10 hours agorootparentprevI just realized there aren&#x27;t any bugs on my windshield when I drive but that wasn&#x27;t the case when I was a kid... reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentprev> Big Ag, mono culture, pesticides all come with the territory.I am getting the impressing that you are not familiar with corrupt practices of Big Ag, most which have nothing to do with producing more food, and have everything to do with padding their profit margins and abusing their power.For example, farmers hire agronomists, but actually agronomists make more money from kickbacks from producers of pesticides &#x2F; agrochemicals than they do from farmers. Many of them are actually undercover pesticide pushers, rather than trusted professionals.We have metric tons of research that shows that pesticides are overused, and poorly targeted. Not unlike the opioid crisis in US reply hombre_fatal 14 hours agorootparentprevMost agri land is also used to grow crops for animals for a tiny return on the calories fed to them (tropic levels).We could get serious about that if we decide to get serious about agri land use, deforestation, soil depletion, etc. reply pard68 14 hours agorootparentTotally possible to raise animals without this though. There is a massive percentage of the land that cannot grow much other than grasses and shrubs. Animals can convert that to calories we can consume, leaving more biologically diverse land available for other species.The issue is that animals raised on pasture need more land and more time, which equals more money. It&#x27;s cheaper to raise animals on what amounts to junk food (soy, corn, legumes).We raise and sell pork, chicken, eggs, and dairy products that never eat anything that our own land doesn&#x27;t produce (grass&#x2F;nuts&#x2F;native fruit). But my hogs grow over a year not six months, my chickens don&#x27;t lay in the winter, and my cows don&#x27;t produce 10+ gallons per day. My business is only sustainable because of people who care for quality of cheaper quantity. reply hgomersall 13 hours agorootparentWithout meaning to suggest that there&#x27;s no much better ways to raise animals for meat, it&#x27;s still a fundamental truth that the land area needed to support animals is much higher than crops. If we were to only eat meat from animals that were raised in a biodiversity sustainable fashion, we&#x27;d all have to eat far less meat (which I totally support as a flexitarian). reply pard68 13 hours agorootparentI wholeheartedly agree. There is no possible way to raise animals the way we do at a scale that can sustain the current demand for meat. But at my small scale, I can make a profit while matching the sales price of mass-produced animal products, and I do that with no government subsidies.My point was merely, there is a middle way, that makes better products, cheaply, and more ethically. reply brnt 13 hours agorootparentprev> There is a massive percentage of the land that cannot grow much other than grasses and shrubs.Things may seem that way since those areas have been cultivated since prehistory, but this is not correct in general. Also, commercial fields (aka green concrete) and naturally grazed steppe&#x2F;savannah are very different. reply pard68 13 hours agorootparentYes, I am in favor of doing our best to return America&#x27;s savannahs back to their previous state, though that state was not quite \"wild\" as you rightly point out, as Native Americans tended to the land and practiced regular burning of both the forests, savannahs, and plains. Likewise, bison did a huge part and sadly they cannot do that huge part anymore. But we can still get the land back to something healthier for everyone.My cattle (Jerseys, I do not raise commercial beef cattle) prefer my savannah land. I have approx. 100 acres of oak savannah which I have worked hard to restore to its former glory. My savannah (I don&#x27;t call it pasture, it&#x27;s not) is far more productive and biodiverse. I do have to remove my herds from it because trees cannot handle the constraint weight and trampling of large animals, and so I do also have a small 20 acre pasture that I keep for the off-time. I also have a 5 acre lot I keep for the winter months (Jan-April) so my cattle don&#x27;t destroy dormant plants and so the grasses have time to mature in the spring. reply myshpa 13 hours agorootparentprev> massive percentage of the land that cannot grow much other than grasses and shrubs.

Most of the important nutrients such as omega-3s (DHA), micronutrients, and and apparently one of the most effective antioxidants that is Astaxanthin, are all picked by fish directly or indirectly (via other fish) from eating algae.While algae may not have the same taste-profile or texture as fish, at least we would be able to make a difference (particularly with climate change and better preserving our environment from toxins as described by the article) by making socially-normal algae-based options for people who currently choose to eat fish on a more regular basis for nutritional reasons. reply phendrenad2 14 hours agorootparentI look forward to the headline \"Pesticide safety limit for algae farms watered down after industry lobbying\" reply amluto 13 hours agoparentprev> chelation therapy because her blood had so many heavy metals from eating sushi 2-3 a week for a year.Was this because of a blood test showing levels indicating chelation therapy or was this for some other reason? What heavy metals? What is the evidence that it came from sushi? What kind of fish?Mercury in fish is partially, but not fully, humanity’s fault, and the evidence that it’s problematic (at least if you’re not eating whales) is mixed.For a surprising and fascinating rabbit hole, there are papers like this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11356-021-12361-7As far as I can tell, the jury is very much out as to the significance of dietary mercury. reply adrian_b 4 hours agorootparentThat paper only says that the danger of mercury must always be estimated by also taking into account the content of selenium.Some fish contain enough selenium that it will combine with a part or even with all mercury, making that part of the mercury non-dangerous, so reducing the effective content of mercury.A few fish may contain so much selenium that it may make the mercury non-dangerous, but the selenium will be toxic itself, making the fish unfit for consumption.The main problem with polluted food like fish is that normal people cannot afford to have a chemical analysis laboratory, to check whether the food they want to eat is healthy or harmful.So they can only hope that there are adequate laws about the content of pollutants in food and that they are really enforced. Enforcing such regulations for fish is particularly difficult due to the great differences in effective mercury content that may happen between individuals of the same kind of fish, so even when a few fish from a vendor are sampled for chemical analysis, that does not reduce much the risk of eating fish with too much mercury. The same happens with seeds and nuts that may contain too much lead and cadmium, and so on.So even when you are aware of the dangers of eating toxic food, it is difficult to make choices that would significantly reduce the risks, because any choice that decreases some risks increases others. reply melling 13 hours agoparentprev“but things like this to me are a much more pressing issue”That’s what we’ve been saying for almost half a century.Guess what, we can do both. reply heavenlyblue 14 hours agoparentprevI am sorry but I thought that heavy metal poisoning is due to eating fish that eats other fish, thus distilling the heavy metals in their own body. i.e. eating shark is worse that eating salmon.Is that not correct?

We’ve been “genetically modifying” crops for years with selective breeding, we have now just been able to speed up the process.Genetic engineering has enabled us to grow potatoes, corn, and cotton that contain some DNA from bacteria that encodes (I.e contains the recipe for) a protein, referred to as Bt Crystal Toxin, that disrupts the metabolism of some major pests. They are regarded as safe for humans because it requires both a higher pH (alkaline) and specific receptors that humans lack in order to do damage to an organism. reply SenAnder 14 hours agorootparentGMOs as technology, and the effects of GMOs on food sovereignty, are two very different things. I don&#x27;t want multinational biotech companies to be the only ones able to compete.Though the technology isn&#x27;t harmless either. Let&#x27;s assume sufficient care is and perpetually will be taken to avoid major disasters. What remains is amoral for-profit companies that now have far more ability to engineer food for market fit. Why is this bad? Because carrots and apples will slowly turn into the equivalents of Snickers and Cheetos - those are the products we get when not constrained by nature. reply cma 12 hours agorootparentYou may not really get carrots and apples either, those are domesticated.

My rudimentary understanding (I am a farmer just not a fruit farmer, so I just know what other farmers tell me) is that these non-native fruit trees have to contend with bugs it has no defense for. The native fruits are far more successful.My personal experience matches. Our apple and cherry and peach harvests are hit or miss.

You start to think that if such a rich person, who has access to the best financial advice, can come to this state, what chance do I have? If you read deeper into his or her story you will find that he has come to this state because he violated some basic rule of life. The Golden Rules of Financial Safety of Harry Browne are the basic rules for financial success. They are simple and obvious and if you abide by them, there is less chance than one in a million that you could lose all that you have…. Let us learn what they are… Your career Rule 1: Your career provides your wealth Build your wealth upon your career.You most likely will make far more money from your business or profession than from your investments. Only very rarely does someone make a large fortune from investments. Your investments can make your future more secure and your retirement more prosperous. But they can’t take you from rags to riches. So don’t take risks with complicated schemes in the hope of multiplying your capital quickly. Your investment plan should be aimed, first and foremost, at preserving what you have—preserving it from investment loss, government intervention, or mismanagement. Most part-time investors who try to beat the markets lose part or all the savings they’ve worked so hard to accumulate. Can you make big profits by relying on an expert who does have the proper qualifications? How do you find a true expert? That task is no easier than picking the right investments. If you don’t understand investing as well as the pros, you won’t know how to check those who seek to advise you. And you can’t rely on an advisor’s track record, even when it’s presented honestly. Track records tell you only how advisors did in the past – not how they will do next year. You’re violating Rule #1 if you think your investments can be the sole source of your retirement wealth – or if you steal time from your work to manage your investments – or if you think about abandoning your job to become a full-time investor. Your Wealth May Be Non-Replaceable Rule 2: Don’t assume you can replace your wealth. Advertisement The fact that you earned what you have doesn’t mean that you could earn it again if you lost it. Markets and opportunities change, technology changes, laws change. Conditions today may be considerably different from what they were when you built the estate you have now. And as time passes, increasing regulation makes it harder and harder to amass a fortune. So treat what you have as though you could never earn it again. Don’t take chances with your wealth on the assumption that you could always get it back. You earned your wealth because your talent and effort harmonized with the circumstances in which you found yourself. But the world won’t stand still for you or repeat itself when you need it to. So assume that what you have now is irreplaceable, that you could never earn it again – even if you suspect you could. Say “No!” to any proposition that asks you to risk losing it. Investing vs. Speculating Rule 3: Recognize the difference between investing and speculating. When you invest, you accept the return the markets are paying investors in general. When you speculate, you attempt to beat that return — to do better than other investors are doing — through astute timing, forecasting, or stock selection, and with the implied belief that you’re smarter than most other investors. You’re speculating when: You select individual stocks, mutual funds, or stock market sectors you believe will do better than the market as a whole. You move your capital in and out of markets according to how well you think they’ll perform in the near future. You base your investments on current prospects for the nation’s economy. You use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, cyclical analysis, or any other form of analysis or system to tell you when to buy and sell. There’s nothing wrong with speculating — provided you do it with money you can afford to lose. But the money that’s precious to you shouldn’t be risked on a bet that you can outperform other investors. Forecasting the Future Rule 4: No one can predict the future. Beware of fortune tellers. Events in the investment markets result from the decisions of millions of different people. Investor advisors have no more ability to predict the future actions of human beings than psychics and fortune-tellers do. And so events never unfold as we were so sure they would. Yes, there have been forecasts that came true. But the only reason we notice them is because it’s so exceptional for even one to come true. We forget about all the failed predictions because they’re so commonplace. No one can reliably tell you what stocks will do next year, whether we’ll have more inflation, or how the economy will perform. As with the rest of your life, safety doesn’t come from trying to peer into the future to eliminate uncertainty. Safety comes from devising realistic ways to deal with uncertainty. We live in an uncertain world – and that no one can eliminate the uncertainty for you. Look for ways to assure that the uncertain future won’t hurt you – no matter what it turns out to be. Investment Advice Rule 5: No one can move you in and out of investments consistently with precise and profitable timing. Don’t expect anyone to make you rich. You’ll hear about many Wall Street wizards, but the investment advisor with the perfect record up to now most likely will lose his touch the moment you start acting on his advice. Investment advisors can be very valuable. A good advisor can help you understand how to do the things you know you need to do. He can help call your attention to risks you may have overlooked. And he can make you aware of new alternatives. The Helper (accountant, etc) is worth listening to. He or she can acquaint you with investment alternatives you weren’t aware of, and that might be a good fit for you. He can teach you the mechanics and procedures for getting things done in the investment world. He can raise the questions you need to answer in order to devise a portfolio that suits your needs. He can help you reduce the tax bill on your investment profits. You don’t act on the advice of someone you never heard of. And you hear of him only after – and because – he has made several profitable recommendations in a row. The investment expert with the perfect record up to now will lose his touch as soon as you start acting on his advice. But no one can guarantee to have you always in the right place at the right time. And worse, attempts to do so can sometimes be fatal to your portfolio. Trading Systems Rule 6: No trading system will work as well in the future as it did in the past. You’ll come across many trading systems or indicators that seem always to have signaled correctly where your money should have been, but somehow the systems never come through when your money is on the line. Trading systems generally arise from one of two sources. The first source is a commonsense observation about human behavior – which someone then tries to transform into a quantifiable, mechanical system. For example, Contrary Opinion is a theory that says, among other things, that an investment is likely to be near its peak when everyone seems to know how good its prospects are. The idea makes some sense. If everyone already knows something is a good investment, most people who are likely to buy it probably already have done so – leaving very few investors to buy it and push its price still higher. In such a case, you should be skeptical about its prospects as a speculation. But that doesn’t mean we know precisely when or at what price the investment will peak. You know only that there doesn’t seem to be room for the price to go much higher. But people who devise trading systems aren’t satisfied with anything so indefinite. They devise indicators to measure the precise degree of bullishness and bearishness surrounding a specific investment – and then construct formulas that provide specific signals for buying and selling. This is similar to taking an obvious truth – such as that attendance at sporting events is generally smaller on rainy days than on sunny days – and constructing a formula that supposedly translates the number of inches of rainfall into an exact forecast of the attendance. The second source is probably finding something that has worked in the past and assuming it will work in the future. Trading systems are based on the unstated assumption that the world doesn’t change. But the world is in constant change – as desires change, demand changes, and supplies change. Operate on a Cash Basis Rule 7: Don’t use leverage. When someone goes completely broke, it’s almost always because he used borrowed money. In many cases, the individual was already quite rich, but he wanted to pyramid his fortune with borrowed money. Using margin accounts or mortgages (for other than your home) puts you at risk to lose more than your original investment. If you handle all your investments on a cash basis, it’s virtually impossible to lose everything—no matter what might happen in the world—especially if you follow the other rules given here. Make Your Own Decisions Rule 8: Don’t let anyone make your decisions. Many people lost their fortunes because they gave someone (a financial advisor or attorney) the authority to make their decisions and handle their money. The advisor may have taken too many chances, been dishonest, or simply incompetent. But, most of all, no advisor can be expected to treat your money with the same respect you do. You don’t need a money manager. Investing is complicated and difficult to understand only if you’re trying to beat the market. You can preserve what you have with only a minimum understanding of investing. You can set up a worry-proof portfolio for yourself in one day — and then you need only one day a year to monitor it. Allowing the smartest person in the world to make your decisions for you isn’t nearly as safe as setting up a safe portfolio for yourself. Above all, never give anyone signature authority over money that’s precious to you. If you should put money into an account for someone else to manage, it must be money you can afford to lose. Understand What You Do Rule 9: Don’t ever do anything you don’t understand. Don’t undertake any investment, speculation, or investment program that you don’t understand. If you do, you may later discover risks you weren’t aware of. Or your losses might turn out to be greater than the amount you invested. It’s better to leave your money in Treasury bills than to take chances with investments you don’t fully comprehend. It doesn’t matter that your brother-in-law, your best friend, or your favorite investment advisor understands some money-making scheme. It isn’t his money at risk. If you don’t understand it, don’t do it. Diversification Rule 10: Don’t depend on any one investment, institution, or person for your safety. Every investment has its time in the sun — and its moment of shame. Precious metals ruled the roost in the 1970s while stocks and bonds were in disgrace. But then gold and silver became the losers of the 1980s and 1990s, while stocks and bonds multiplied their value. No one investment is good for all times. Even Treasury bills can lose real value during times of inflation. And you can’t rely on any single institution to protect your wealth for you. Old-line banks have failed and pension funds have folded. The company you think will keep your wealth safe might not be there when you’re ready to withdraw your life savings. We live in an uncertain world, and surprises are the norm. You shouldn’t risk the chance that a single surprise will wipe out a large part of your holdings. Diversify across investments and institutions – and keep things simple enough to manage yourself – you can relax, knowing that no one event can do you in. Balanced Portfolio Rule 11: Create a bulletproof portfolio for protection. For the money you need to take care of you for the rest of your life, set up a simple, balanced, diversified portfolio. I call this a “Permanent Portfolio” because once you set it up, you never need to rearrange the investment mix— even if your outlook for the future changes. The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event — including an event that would be devastating to any individual element within the portfolio. In other words, this portfolio should protect you no matter what the future brings. It isn’t difficult or complicated to have such a portfolio this safe. You can achieve a great deal of diversification with a surprisingly simple portfolio. The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event – including events that would be devastating to any one investment.Three absolute requirements for such a portfolio are: 1. Safety:It should protect you against every possible economic future. You should profit during times of normal prosperity, but you also should be safe (and perhaps even profit) during bad times – inflation, recession, or even depression. 2. Stability:Whatever economic climate arrives, the portfolio’s performance should be so steady that you won’t wonder whether the portfolio needs to be changed. Even in the worst possible circumstances, the portfolio’s value should drop no more than slightly – so that you won’t panic and abandon it. This stability also permits you to turn your attention away from your investments, confident that your portfolio will protect you in any circumstance. 3. Simplicity:The portfolio should be so easy to maintain, and require so little of your time, that you’ll never be tempted to look for something that seems simpler, but is less safe. You leave it alone – to hold the same investments, in the same proportions, permanently. You don’t change the proportions as you, your friends, or investment gurus change their minds about the future. Your portfolio needs to respond well only to those broad movements. And they fit into four general categories: 1. Prosperity:A period during which living standards are rising, the economy is growing, business is thriving, interest rates usually are falling, and unemployment is declining. 2. Inflation:A period when consumer prices generally are rising. They might be rising moderately (an inflation rate of 6% or so), rapidly (10% to 20% or so, as in the late 1970s), or at a runaway rate (25% or more). 3. Tight money or recession:A period during which the growth of the supply of money in circulation slows down. This leaves people with less cash than they expected to have, and usually leads to a recession – a period of poor economic conditions. 4. Deflation:The opposite of inflation. Consumer prices decline and the purchasing power value of money grows. In the past, deflation has sometimes triggered a depression – a prolonged period of very bad economic conditions, as in the 1930s. Investment prices can be affected by what happens outside the financial system – wars, changes in government policies, new tax rules, civil turmoil, and other matters. But these events have a lasting effect on investments only if they push the economy from one to another of the four environments I’ve just described. The four economic categories are all-inclusive. At any time, one of them will predominate. So if you’re protected in these four situations, you’re protected in all situations. Thus four investments provide coverage for all four economic environments: STOCKS take advantage of prosperity. They tend to do poorly during periods of inflation, deflation, and tight money, but over time those periods don’t undo the gains that stocks achieve during periods of prosperity. BONDS also take advantage of prosperity. In addition, they profit when interest rates collapse during a deflation. You should expect bonds to do poorly during times of inflation and tight money. GOLD not only does well during times of intense inflation, it does very well. In the 1970s, gold rose twenty times over as the inflation rate soared to its peak of 15% in 1980. Gold generally does poorly during times of prosperity, tight money, and deflation. CASH is most profitable during a period of tight money. Not only is it a liquid asset that can give you purchasing power when your income and investments might be ailing, but the rise in interest rates increases the return on your dollars. Cash also becomes more valuable during a deflation as prices fall. Cash is essentially neutral during a time of prosperity, and it is a loser during times of inflation. Any attempt to be clever in assigning portions to the investments probably will do more harm than good. I prefer the simplicity of allocating 25% to each of the four investments. The only maintenance required is to check the portfolio’s makeup once a year. If any of the four investments has become worth less than 15%, or more than 35%, of the portfolio’s overall value, you need to restore the original percentages. When you make your once-a-year check of the portfolio’s value, if all four investments are within the 15-35% range, no rebalancing is necessary. During the year, if you happen to notice that there’s been a big change in investment prices, you may want to check the values of the investments. Again, if any investment has strayed outside the 15-35% range, go ahead and rebalance the entire portfolio. The test of a Permanent Portfolio is whether it provides peace of mind. A Permanent Portfolio should let you watch the evening news or read investment publications in total serenity. No actual or threatened event should trouble you, because you’ll know that your portfolio is protected against it. If someone warns about the “alarming parallels” between the current decade and the 1920s, you shouldn’t wonder whether you need to sell all your stocks. You’ll know that your Permanent Portfolio will take care of you – even if next year turns out to be 1929 revisited. The deflation that could devastate stocks would push interest rates downward and bring big profits for your bonds. When someone claims the inflation rate is headed back to 15%, you shouldn’t wonder whether to dump all your bonds. You’ll know that the gain in your Permanent Portfolio’s gold would far outweigh any losses on the bonds. When someone announces that a new debt crisis is on the way, or that a bull market is about to begin in stocks, bonds, or gold, you won’t feel pressured to decide whether he’s right. You’ll know that the Permanent Portfolio will respond favorably to any eventuality. I can’t list every potential event. So if you become concerned by any possibility, reread this chapter and you should be reassured that there’s an investment in your Permanent Portfolio that will cover you if the worst should occur. Whatever the potential crisis or opportunity, your Permanent Portfolio should already be taking care of you. The portfolio can’t guarantee a profit every year; no portfolio can. It won’t outperform the hotshot advisor in his best year. And it won’t outperform the best investment of the year. But it can give you the confidence that no crisis will destroy you, the assurance that your savings are secure and growing in all circumstances, and the knowledge that you’re no longer vulnerable to the mistakes in judgment that you or the best advisor could so easily make. Speculation Rule 12: Speculate only with money you can afford to lose. If you want to try to beat the market, set up a second — separate — portfolio with which you can speculate to your heart’s content. But make sure this portfolio contains no more of your wealth than you can afford to lose. I call this second pool of money a “Variable Portfolio” because its investments will vary as your outlook for the future changes. It might be all or part in stocks or gold or something else — whatever looks good at any time — or just in cash. You can take chances with the Variable Portfolio because you know that, whatever happens, no loss can be devastating. You can lose only the money you’ve already decided isn’t precious to you. International Diversification Rule 13: Keep some assets outside the country in which you live. Don’t allow everything you own to be where your government can touch it. By having something outside the reach of your government, you’ll be less vulnerable — and you’ll feel less vulnerable. You’ll no longer have to worry so much about what the government will do next. For example, maintaining a foreign bank account is quite simple; it’s little different from having a mail or Internet account with an American bank or broker. Keeping some investments abroad provides safe and easy protection against surprises that might happen anywhere – confiscation of gold holdings by the government, exchange controls, civil disorder, even war. No one knows how the people elected in the coming years might choose to solve the economic problems the country will face. It might strike them that the quick and easy solution is to take your property – as has happened so often already. Your assets will be safe even if war, civil disorder, a weakening of law enforcement, or a physical catastrophe should disrupt record-keeping in your own country. Your entire estate will no longer be vulnerable to economic, political, or legal setbacks in your own country. Geographic diversification is a necessary part of making sure the Permanent Portfolio can handle whatever hazard materializes. Tax Shelters Rule 14: Beware of tax-avoidance schemes. Tax rates are still low enough in the U.S. that you might gain very little from the risk and effort of constructing elaborate tax shelters. And a great deal of money has been lost by people who hoped to beat the tax system. The losses came from investments that provided special tax advantages but didn’t make economic sense, and from tax shelters that were disallowed by the IRS — incurring penalties and interest on top of the liabilities. There are a number of simple ways available to minimize taxes — through such things as IRAs and 401(k) plans. Take advantage of these tax reduction plans. These plans are effective but non-controversial. They won’t come back to haunt you.Tax deferral is the basic method for reducing the tax burden on your investment program. With tax deferral, the money you don’t pay in taxes today can work to produce more earnings every year until you finally have to pay the tax. Questions Rule 15: Ask the right questions In what economic circumstances is the investment’s price likely to go down? Are other investments in your portfolio likely to take up the slack by gaining in those same circumstances? Under what circumstances could I lose a substantial share – 20% or more – of my investment? Under what circumstances could my entire investment be lost? Would I have any residual liability – that is, can I lose even more than the cash I invested? Interest rates generally reflect an investment’s risk. A higher interest rate means there’s a greater possibility the capital can be lost – through default or inflation. Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to appreciate? Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to depreciate? In good circumstances for the investment, will the overall return – yield plus capital appreciation – help your portfolio overcome losses in other investments? If the investment is a mutual fund, you want the fund with the lowest yield – other things being equal. Any dividend paid by a mutual fund simply reduces the price of your shares “Is this company a potential takeover candidate?” The crowd isn’t always wrong, but you can’t make much betting with it – because you will buy at a price that’s already high. By going against the crowd, you buy when an investment is out of favor and cheap; if it does succeed, there’s a long way for it to go up. So the most important factor in speculating is whether you expect something that most people don’t expect. For example, the time to consider buying inflation hedges speculatively is when most people believe inflation is under control. The time to consider buying a particular company is when everyone knows what a dog it is – not when everyone talks about its great promise. Unpopularity doesn’t guarantee profits, but you’ll never make a killing with a popular investment. “Do the technical factors favor the investment now?” You must have an investment plan. Without a plan, you will be tossed and turned by all the conflicting ideas you read and hear- – and you’ll never ask the right questions. With a plan, you’ll have a basis for evaluating whatever you hear. You’ll know to ask the questions that help you determine whether an investment furthers your plan. Enjoyment Rule 16: Enjoy yourself with a budget for pleasure. Your wealth is of no value if you can’t enjoy it. But it’s easy to spend too much while the money’s flowing in. To enjoy your wealth, establish a budget of money that you can spend yearly without concern. If you stay within that amount, you can feel free to blow the money on cars, trips, anything you want — knowing that you aren’t blowing your future. When in Doubt . . . Rule 17: Whenever you’re in doubt about a course of action, it is always better to err on the side of safety. If you pass up an opportunity to increase your fortune, another one will be along soon enough. But if you lose your life savings just once, you might never get a chance to replace it. If you wind up losing something, let it be only an opportunity that was lost – not precious capital. People rarely go broke playing it safe. But many go broke taking great risks or making investments they know too little about. If you’re hesitating, it’s because you don’t yet know enough about the investment or the problem to make a confident decision. That means you shouldn’t take the plunge until you know more and you’re sure you understand all the ramifications. The premise for speculation is that you’re more astute than most other investors – that you understand the market better, that you have information not available to other investors, that you can make better decisions, or that your interpretation of available information is especially perceptive. The elements of speculation are timing, forecasting, trading systems, and selection. Any time you use any of these tactics you’re speculating. Investment forecasts can be exciting. But in other areas of our lives, we think of fortune-tellers as entertainers. Forecasts are not entirely useless. Someone’s predictions can help you recognize that your own expectations for the future aren’t the only possible outcome. This can help keep you humble and prudent. If you come to feel a given event is quite possible but most people disagree with you, the market probably will provide a big payoff if you bet on that event and prove to be right. So if you like to watch the investment markets closely and you see a potential future that most people are ignoring, you may want to make a small speculation with money you can afford to lose. A sure way to lose what you’ve accumulated is to risk the funds that are precious to you on the idea that some event is inevitable. In 1970, the chief gold trader at the largest Swiss bank told a friend of mine that the gold price would never go above $40. When asked how he could be so sure, the trader replied, “Because we control the market.” “Insiders” are no more help than fortune tellers or high-priced pros. You can protect yourself against the possibility of institutional crisis by using more than one institution. You can protect yourself against the failings of individuals by relying only on yourself. And you can protect yourself against investment roller coasters by diversifying across investment markets. Split the 25% stock-market portion among three mutual funds. For the bond portion, you don’t want to have to monitor credit risk, so buy only U.S. Treasury bonds. So long as the U.S. government has the ability to tax people or print money to pay its bills, there is virtually no credit risk. Put the 25% in the Treasury bond issue that currently has the longest time until it matures. That will be close to 30 years. Ten years later, the bond will have only 20 years to maturity; at that time replace it with a new 30-year bond. Buy bullion coins – coins whose only value is the gold bullion they contain. They sell for about 3-5% more per ounce than gold bullion. That means a one-ounce coin will sell for about $310-$315 if the price of gold is $300 an ounce. The cash portion should be kept in a money market fund investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury securities, so that you don’t have to evaluate credit risk. These securities are safer than bank accounts and other debt instruments. If your cash budget is large enough, divide your holdings between two or three funds – for further protection against the unthinkable. The value of real estate in your portfolio is indivisible, and everything else must accommodate it. Just like a 15-foot piano in the living room, you have to arrange the rest of the furniture around it. Your house is a consumption item – the place where you live and enjoy your life. Don’t play games with your Permanent Portfolio. Don’t wait for any investment to become cheaper before you buy it. And don’t go overboard investing in something that happens to be doing well now. Just put 25% in each of the four categories. No matter how strong your expectations about the near future, you could easily be mistaken. And the point of the Permanent Portfolio is to ignore your own expectations and let the portfolio take care of you no matter what may come. Fund it with equal portions of all four investments and don’t worry over which is going to do best. It is a package of investments that provides the safety you need. Tear apart the package and you tear apart the safety. A foreign account in any country outside your own is a tremendous improvement over having everything in your home country. But some countries are more hospitable than others. And some have legal traditions that protect your privacy. I’ve always been partial to Switzerland and Austria, because each has a centuries-old tradition of respecting privacy and fending off inquiries from other governments. If you buy and hold gold through the foreign bank, the gold most likely will be stored within the bank itself. The secret – that things rarely work out as expected – is shared unwittingly by investors, brokers, advisors, newsletter writers, and financial journalists, few of whom can bring themselves to acknowledge it. Each wants to appear to be in command of the situation, on top of the markets, aware of what’s happening and what’s going to happen – and to appear as though everything that has already happened was anticipated. A professional needs to keep up this guise because he must look sharper than his competitors. Even investors often pose as members of the all-knowing – perhaps because no one wants to appear to be the only loser, and everyone else seems to be so smart. When you give up the search for certainty, an enormous burden is lifted from your shoulders. The less you know – and the more honestly you recognize the limits of your knowledge – the more likely your investment program will turn out okay. Humility is accepting that you don’t know everything, or even everything about any particular topic, and it is an investor’s most vital asset. Arrogance eventually ruins any investor. The Rules of Life The rules of safe investing are little different from the rules of life: recognize that you live in an uncertain world, don’t expect the impossible, and don’t trust strangers. If you apply to your investments the same realistic attitude that produced your present wealth, you needn’t fear that you’ll ever go broke. Share this: TwitterFacebook Loading...

There is an official policy that cash will lose some % of its value each year! Holding 25% of your wealth in cash is planning to throwing away years of life.For this sort of dead-basic investment advice, there is no point being ready for situations where a cash position is advantageous. People are much more likely to panic, do something stupid or get ground down by inflation.It is better to hold enough cash for an emergency fund then a mix of productive and hard assets. Gold is good as a hard asset, but anything that is durable would be ok. The advantages of cash are small compared to the risks and locked-in losses.EDITAlthough thanks to other commentators I see that the fine print says that cash isn&#x27;t literal cash and is actually \"short-term U.S. Treasury securities\"; making the whole complaint a bit moot. Once the money is in bonds it becomes a matter of strategic thinking rather than a simple \"don&#x27;t do that\". I wouldn&#x27;t do that right now, but given the level the article is pitched at I think it is fair advice as long as people read that cash doesn&#x27;t mean cash cash. reply brilee 18 hours agoparentThe advice says keep 25%, but it also says to rebalance every year. In a year when stocks are down, cash becomes a larger fraction of your portfolio and you would use it to buy stocks precisely when they are at their lows! On the flip side, when stocks are great, then cash becomes a smaller part of the portfolio and rebalancing implies selling stock when it is high.I do agree overall that these transitions happen infrequently enough that the opportunity cost of not being in the market is likely to outweigh the potential upside of being ready to buy at a dip reply jandrewrogers 15 hours agorootparentThe issue with rebalancing is that it often has tax implications if you aren&#x27;t careful. You have to weigh the benefits of rebalancing with the tax loss. It works in tax deferred accounts but, at least in the US, a significant percentage of people do not have material access to such accounts. reply anonporridge 10 hours agorootparentThis is why the first order move when \"rebalancing\" is to just adjust your allocations of new investment money from your post tax income.e.g. if your stocks and bonds are doing very well and have inflated beyond their allocation, stop buying them and divert all of your savings to cash and gold&#x2F;bitcoin. reply jandrewrogers 7 hours agorootparentYes, and also you can sometimes select tax lots that minimize or completely eliminate the net tax exposure. This does have practical limits though e.g. if the portfolio greatly exceeds income or all of your tax lots of consequence are deep into positive territory. reply hammock 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you have 10% in cash you ought to have enough to cover the tax bill from rebalancing, in most years reply roenxi 18 hours agorootparentprevSuperficially that makes sense, but on reflection you may observe that logic will apply to any assets as the relative prices change. Rebalancing from any asset to shares when shares are cheap will net good results. reply lumost 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you have enough assets not to simply invest in the general market. Then there is also an opportunity cost to not having the funds to buy into \"unique\" opportunities. Whether they be distressed assets, innovative ideas - or simply buying Nvidia when ChatGPT came out. While the optimal strategy for an uninformed investor is diversification and buying the market... There are different strategies for informed well to do investors. reply liquidpele 17 hours agorootparentprev“When stocks are great”… ie buy low sell high, easy to say but damn near impossible to do. reply DennisP 17 hours agorootparentTiming the market is hard but periodically rebalancing your portfolio is easy, and generally recommended. reply liquidpele 16 hours agorootparentRebalancing according to risk is recommended, not doing it because you think you know what the market is going to do. For instance, let&#x27;s say right now, the market is headed up. When is the right time to \"re-balance\" to more cash? This is just assuming that the market is going to go lower than it currently is, which is just as much a gamble as thinking it&#x27;ll go up for the next year.In short, don&#x27;t try to guess the market and keep some magical percent of cash&#x2F;investments unless you have the means to gamble that money. Talk to a financial advisor and choose a risk-based investment strategy that makes sense for your point in life. reply DennisP 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t involve guessing what the market will do. Just as Browne recommended, you pick a percentage to hold for each asset, and rebalance on a fixed schedule that&#x27;s long enough to avoid short-term tax rates. If percentages aren&#x27;t off by much, don&#x27;t bother.It&#x27;s not gambling, and it&#x27;s not original with Browne. The percentages aren&#x27;t magic, they&#x27;re just anything that has worked reasonably well historically over many different economic conditions. Most fee-based financial advisors will give you a strategy like this. It&#x27;s probably the most widely-accepted strategy in finance. reply sacado2 15 hours agorootparentprev> When is the right time to \"re-balance\" to more cash?When you look at your balance at the end of the year and your cash proportion happens to be below 20% instead of 25%.Rebalancing is pretty much standard practice nowadays, nothing magical there. Any financial advisor will tell you to rebalance your portfolio from time to time. reply lmm 6 hours agorootparentprev> For instance, let&#x27;s say right now, the market is headed up.

A financial advisor will rarely tell you anything more than the basic middle-of-the-road advice you find on the internet or elsewhere, and they&#x27;ll charge you a substantial amount for the privilege. replyghaff 18 hours agoparentprev>Rule 11 deserves a rethink. There is an official policy that cash will lose some % of its value each year! Holding 25% of your wealth in cash is planning to throwing away years of life.That depends on lots of things including how old you are and the current economic situation.For someone on the older side, getting a very low risk 5% on a chunk of their money doesn&#x27;t seem like a half-bad strategy at the moment especially if they already own their home. reply roenxi 18 hours agorootparentThey could hold gold. Similar risk profile, much more likely to hold value long term and be better to hand on to the kids if there is some left over.I&#x27;m not saying cash is so terrible that a nervous, confused and delicate grandma can&#x27;t just eat the losses for security. I mean, sure. If you think you&#x27;re probably going to lose money anyway then 10%!But a 25% allocation by default is just giving money to wealthy men wearing suits. They already own suits, they don&#x27;t need it. Keep the wealth. Donate it towards lobbying for Georgism instead of new wars, maybe, if you feel like burning a few % on a cause. reply osigurdson 18 hours agorootparentIf you look at the chart for the GLD it doesn’t resemble and inflation proof investment imo.

When viewing cash in isolation, it&#x27;s tempting to conclude that holding cash is bad due to inflation. However, cash needs to be seen in contrasting with other investment vehicles.It&#x27;s true that cash is losing 7% annually due to inflation. But at a time when stocks are losing 50% and bonds are losing 20% due to raising rate, losing 7% is a good deal. When everything is losing value, the one losing the least is a good investment.Since you can&#x27;t predict the market to move cash in and out of the market, holding 25% cash and rebalance periodically doesn&#x27;t sound too absurd. reply kurthr 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d also say that \"cash\" includes a lot of things like savings&#x2F;sweep accounts, short term treasuries (5.3%), and even CDs.

The Permanent Portfolio has had pretty good overall returns extremely consistently despite its low (25%) stock allocation because it holds four assets with poor correlation and rebalances between them, and because one of them is cash.These assets each do well under different economic conditions. The cash asset does well during periods of sharply rising interest rates since it retains its principle and gets higher rates, while all the other assets get wrecked. Because cash’s correlation with the rest of the portfolio assets is 0% or negative, you tend to store some gains from the other assets in the cash section during up years, and then use the cash section to buy other assets once they have down years - in effect buying low and selling high. This is why the permanent portfolio gets pretty good returns with a low standard deviation: the cash protects the downside, but doesn’t significantly hamper portfolio performance due to the rebalancing effect. (It also helps that your cash should be in short treasuries per Harry Browne’s advice, which almost always have better yield than bank accounts with basically no risk).You could remove or titrate down the cash portion, but then you’re left with three risky assets in stock, gold, and 25- to 30-year bonds. (Anyone who doesn’t think long bonds are risky doesn’t understand interest rate risk). Does this raise the expected return? Yes! But it also raises the risk of extended periods of poor performance, or acute periods of terrible performance. The Permanent Portfolio made 1.8% in 2008. It didn’t have a 10-year rolling period since 1972 with real returns below 3%, with all of them falling between 3 and 6.1%. A 60&#x2F;40 portfolio achieved better returns but with much higher risk, including full decades of negative real return [0].Ultimately I think your objection to the portfolio is because you think it’s advantageous to take on more risk. For a young investor with high risk tolerance I agree with you, but for older investors and retirees who need to be mindful of sequence of returns risk, and young investors who can’t stomach volatile portfolios, I think it’s an underrated choice.Even if you’re not convinced by the rest of the argument, consider that holding half your fixed income in cash and the other half in very long bonds tends to produce similar performance to holding it all in intermediate bonds, which is often the recommended duration for an investor’s bond holdings.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Permanent-Portfolio-Long-Term-Investm... reply koolba 15 hours agorootparent> Anyone who doesn’t think long bonds are risky doesn’t understand interest rate riskThe past year is a great lesson in what happens to long term bonds when rates finally move.Though to be fair to Harry, his financial advice was written before zero rate policy.

For a young investor with high risk tolerance I agree with you,I agree with everything you write except this bit deserves an expansion.There is a growth-optimal balance between assets and it depends only on the joint probabilities of future returns, which means it&#x27;s unknowable -- but it also means it depends not at all on the age of the investor. (Which makes sense, if you think about it -- why would the optimal growth rate depend on the age of the person owning the money?)However, the optimal growth rate is only guaranteed asymptotically, and aiming for it could result in some wild swings up and down before getting there, so for people without infinite time on their hands it makes sense to keep a higher proportion of wealth in low-risk assets. reply tornato7 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is interesting.

So in the UK, the electoral register (open and closed) is used by credit reference agencies to see if you are linked to an address. The credit reference agencies then pass on information to would be lenders and banks, and banks also update the credit reference agencies with your monthly bank account totals and your direct debit payments so they can see your monthly outgoings and see if you are paying your overheads reguarly, so other banks and lenders can see if you are worth lending money to.Now even if you dont need to borrow money, pay your bills as soo as they come through the letter box if they are not handled by direct debit, that information is still passed on by your bank to multiple credit reference agencies who then disseminate the data around the world to different countries because programming teams can exist in multiple countries, different laws and then you get stuffed if you value your privacy, and thats before hackers get involved hacking the likes of Experian. reply distances 18 hours agorootparentprevThe \"cash\" in the article does not mean physical cash.

The only way to assume that&#x27;s even possible is if the company tripled in value without raising more money.

Since 2007 it had just one really bad year (2022, -13%, and even then it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the above allocation), other than that, it was always positive or close to zero.A simple portfolio that almost never loses money and still has a decent, yet significantly smaller than its competitors, CAGR.

But half cash is bad advice. Even if you are 85, you might have lots of cash equivalents, but you wouldn’t have 25% gold.Picking a single year isn’t a productive example because the point of investment is to keep for multiple years.With a 10+ year horizon, you should definitely be willing to stomach a 25% drop one year, because that happens. And of course the market was up over 100%+ in the following 10 years.It’s not useful to compare Browne’s allocation without mentioning how it was much worse than the s&p500 over that period.To compare strategies, you want to look at them compared to one another. And of course past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance. But it can be helpful.“Almost never loses money” is not a very good strategy unless you are in retirement already.

    "originBody": "nomad Blog Code cola: a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing Riccardo MazzariniSeptember 2, 2023 In this blog post I’ll talk about the theoretical background and the technical implementation of cola, a text CRDT for real-time collaborative editing written in Rust. Reading this is not at all necessary to be able to use cola, so if that’s all you’re interested in you can safely skip this post and go straight to the documentation. The post is divided into three parts: in the first part we’ll go over how to represent the state of the document and the edits that transform it in a way that guarantees convergence across all replicas. The ideas presented in this part are widely covered in the literature, so if you’re already familiar with text CRDTs you can probably skip it; in the second part we’ll see how to efficiently implement the framework discussed in the first part in code; finally, in the third part we’ll look at some benchmarks comparing cola to other Rust-based CRDT libraries. First part: Intro to text CRDTs A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type, or CRDT, is an umbrella term for any data structure that can be replicated and modified concurrently across multiple sites, and is guaranteed to converge without the need for a central authority to coordinate the changes. There are many different kinds of CRDTs: counters, sets, maps, lists, trees, etc. Here we’ll focus on a sequence CRDT that can be used to represent plain text documents. In the setting of our problem we have a number of peers on a distributed network all editing the same document. Each peer can insert or delete text and immediately see the changes applied to their local replica. These edits are then sent to the other peers which somehow integrate them into their own replicas. The only assumption we make on the network layer is that every edit is received by all the peers in the network. Edits can be sent multiple times and in any order, but they must eventually reach all the peers. Our goal is to design a data structure that can, at the very minimum, converge to the same state at every peer once all the edits have been received. The final document we end up with should also “make sense” from the user’s point of view. For example, we could have a CRDT that sorts the inserted characters in alphabetical order. This would technically solve all concurrency problems, but I doubt anyone would use it. Anchors in a sea of text Let’s start by looking at the simplest approach: doing nothing. When someone inserts or deletes some text we just broadcast the edit “as is”: insert \"abc\" at offset 8, delete between offset 10 and offset 13, etc. This is clearly wrong because all we need to diverge is for another peer to concurrently modify the document in the 0..offset region. The problem is that offsets depend on the state of the document at the time an edit was made. We can’t just exchange offsets without also exchanging the context they depend on. What if we used characters to refer to positions in the document instead of offsets? We could then send insert \"abc\" after the 'd' or delete between the 'f' and the 'o'. When a peer receives that edit it doesn’t matter where the 'd' ended up, they’ll know they have to insert \"abc\" after it. But what if there are multiple 'd's in the document? What if the 'd' was deleted? We still have to think some things through, but the idea of using content to refer to positions is a step in the right direction. Let’s solve the first problem: how do we tell our 'd's apart? In our universe time only flows in one direction, so we could assign an increasing number to each character as it’s inserted into the document. The first character a peer inserts gets the number 0, the second 1, and so on. Timestamping in this way works because for every n, a peer can only insert its n-th character once, so we can use this number as a stable identifier for a position in the document. Or can we? After all there could many n-th characters in the same document, one for every peer that ever contributed to it. To distiguish them we also assign each peer a unique identifier, called a ReplicaId in cola, and use the pair ReplicaId.n to uniquely identify a character. Guaranteeing uniqueness of the n half is both possible and easy: we just increment a local counter. Doing the same for the ReplicaId half without a central server is not. The best we can do is to use random integers big enough to make the probability of a collision negligible, like a UUID. This n number is also called a temporal offset in cola, and the ReplicaId.n pair is called an Anchor. Anchors are incredibly important because they allow us to specify both insertions and deletions in a concurrency-enabled way. Insertions are identified by a single Anchor which tells us where to insert the text, while deletions are identified by two Anchors, one for the start and one for the end of the deleted region. Breaking ties When a peer integrates an insertion it may find other insertions in its replica that have the same Anchor. How do we decide which one comes first? Intuitively we’d want the last insertion to come first. But the concept of a “last” operation is not well defined in a distributed system. Using wall clock timestamps is problematic because wall clocks lack monotonicity and also suffer from clock drift. What we really want is a way to determine if an insertion was made in an environment in which another insertion was already present. This is exactly what Lamport timestamps are used for. A Lamport clock is a logical clock that is updated by a very simple algorithm: every time a peer inserts some text it increases its clock by one, and when it receives a remote insertion it sets the clock to max(current, remote_timestamp) + 1. This guarantees that if insertion A is made by a peer that has already integrated insertion B, then A’s Lamport timestamp will be greater than B’s. We can now handle conflicting insertions by sorting them in descending order by their Lamport timestamp. When we integrate a remote insertion we start at the insertion's Anchor. We then skip blocks until we find the first one whose Lamport timestamp is less than or equal to the one of the insertion that's being integrated. There’s one last case we need to handle: conflicting and concurrent insertions, i.e. insertions with the same Anchor and Lamport timestamp. From the user’s point of view there’s not an order that’s more “correct” than the others, so all we care about is consistency between peers. cola breaks the tie by sorting in ascending order on the ReplicaId of the peer that made the insertion. Insertions with the same Lamport timestamps are sorted by their ReplicaId in ascending order. Here the 'R' is inserted by Peer 1 and the 'D' by Peer 2, so the 'R' goes before the 'D'. Deletions With insertions out of the way let’s now focus on deletions. As I’ve briefly mentioned, every time a peer deletes some text we transform the start and end offsets representing the deleted range into Anchors, which we can broadcast to the other peers. Deletions are a bit easier to reason about because, unlike with insertions, we don’t have to worry as much about concurrency or causality issues. Two peers concurrently deleting the same region of text produces the same result as if only one of them had done it1: the text is gone. There are however three problems we need to tackle before we can consider deletions solved: what do we do with the deleted regions of text? We can’t entirely remove them from the document because there may be edits we haven’t yet seen whose Anchors lie within them; how do we know when a remote deletion is ready to be integrated? We’ll diverge if a peer integrates a deletion before it has received all the content that the peer who created the deletion had when they made it; within the region of text included between the start and end Anchors of a deletion, how do we determine which characters should be deleted and which should be kept? We’ll diverge if the peer who integrates a deletion deletes text that wasn’t yet received by the peer who created the deletion. The solution to the first problem is to use tombstones. A tombstoned character is simply marked as deleted, but it’s still kept in the document. This clearly increases the memory footprint of our data structure as more and more text is deleted. We’ll see in the performance section how we can mitigate this problem. A solution to other two problems is to include in the deletion message a map where the keys are ReplicaIds and the values are the timestamps of the last character that the peer who created the deletion had seen when they made it. This is called a version vector2. Version vectors are useful because we can implement a partial order on them that lets us compare what content different peers have seen. If peer A’s vv is >= than peer B’s vv then we know that A has seen at least as much content as B, and possibly more. Using version vectors we can solve the second problem by making a peer wait to integrate a deletion until its vv is >= than the vv included in the deletion message. We can also solve the third problem by skipping over characters whose timestamp is strictly greater than the timestamp included in the deletion’s vv. Second part: cola’s implementation In the previous part we’ve walked through the theoretical framework cola uses to solve collaborative editing. It’s now time for the fun part: implementing it in code in a performant way. Linkin Blocks Let’s start by designing the data structure each peer will use to represent the state of its local replica of the document. This is called a Replica in cola. As we’ve seen, every time a peer inserts some text we assign each character its own block, which includes a temporal offset and a Lamport timestamp. It’s very natural to represent this sequence of blocks as a linked list, so that’s where we’ll start. Before we dive further into the implementation I’d like to point out something. Up until now I’ve been including the textual content associated with each block in every illustration. This was mostly done for clarity, but none of the algorithms we’ve discussed so far actually need to know what the content of an insertion is. This also means we can decouple all the CRDT machinery we’re building from the implementation of the text buffer itself. In fact, there’s not a single function in cola’s API that takes a string as an argument. cola has no idea what the content of the document you’re editing is, all it deals with are blocks of numbers. RLE all the things The first big optimization we can do is to reduce the number of blocks we need to represent the document. We can’t have any hope of landing on a performant implementation if we have a bunch of metadata associated with every single character that’s ever been inserted. Luckily, we don’t have to. Every time there’s a run of blocks whose character timestamps increase sequentially we can run-length encode them into a single block. This means pasting the entire Wikipedia page on the Manhattan Project will only take up a single block instead of 107,000. RLEing in this way also allows us to represent a sentence typed character-by-character without moving the cursor or deleting anything with a single block, instead of one per key press. These runs of consecutive blocks are called EditRuns in cola. Once an EditRun is broken it remains fixed for the remaning lifetime of the document and can’t be extended anymore. A run that’s not yet broken is called active. When text is inserted in the midle of an existing EditRun we simply split it into two shorter runs and insert the new text between them. When text is removed from the document we split it off from the run it’s part of and mark it as deleted (tombstones, remember?). Deleted runs can also be RLEd in the same way as active runs, which mitigates the memory footprint problem we mentioned in the previous section. A better alternative: B-trees There’s two distinct paths we need to think about while designing our data structure: the upstream path, which deals with transforming a local edit specified in terms of offsets into the document into an edit that can be sent to other peers, and the downstream path, which deals with transforming a remote edit received from another peer into a local edit that can be applied to the document. Let’s start by improving the upstream path. For both insertions and deletions this boils down to: finding the run that contains an offset to create an Anchor; if necessary, splitting it into a max of two (for insertions) or three (for deletions) smaller runs. Since we’re using a linked list the second step is O(1). The first one however requires us to scan the entire list from the beginning of the document until we land on the right run, which is a linear time complexity. Not good. We could improve this by caching a pointer to the currently active run together with the run’s offset in the document. This helps because when we edit a document we don’t jump around randomly. We usually insert or delete entire runs of characters before moving the cursor. There are editing patterns that don’t follow this assumption like when using multiple cursors, but it’s still a good heuristic. While this makes the best-case performance constant, the worst case would still be linear. If the user inserts a character at the start of the document and then another one at the end we still have to walk the entire list. It’s clear that a linear data structure won’t cut it if we want to be performant with all kinds of editing patterns. We need a logarithmic worst-case complexity. This is where B-trees come in. A B-tree is a balanced tree where every node can have a variable number of children between a minimum and a maximum. “Balanced” simply means that for every internal node, all its children have the same height. The runs that where previously the nodes of the linked list are now represented as leaves in the B-tree. Leaves are grouped into internal nodes, or inodes for short. Each inode stores not only its children but also the sum of their lengths (with tombstoned runs contributing a length of 0). Inodes are in turn grouped into other inodes all the way up to the root, whose length coincides with the length of the document. B-trees are a great fit for our problem because they can be traversed and inserted into in logarithmic time. To reach a given run we start from the root and loop through its children until we find the one containing the offset we’re looking for. We then simply repeat the same process with the child until we reach a leaf node. Inserting a new run is in general a bit more involved because we need to make sure that the tree remains balanced and that all its other invariants are preserved. I won’t go into the details here, but the important thing is that this can be done in O(log n). By using a B-tree we can do local edits in logarithmic time. Great! But what about integrating remote edits? If we receive an edit like insert 2.3..7 at 1.2 we currently have no way to efficiently find the run that contains the anchor 1.2. We’d have to check every single run from the beginning of the document until we find the right one. An even better alternative: G-trees The problem with our B-tree is that we don’t have a way to identify its leaves, and if we can’t identify them we can’t efficiently perform the anchor -> run conversion. We could store pointers to the leaves somewhere, but what do we use them for? Having a pointer to the leaf of a B-tree doesn’t really help because insertions are performed top-down, starting from the root, and a pointer doesn’t tell us how to “navigate” down the tree to reach the leaf it points to. Well, then “just do them bottom-up!” you might say. This would require to store a parent pointer in every node of the tree (except the root), effectively creating a sort of “doubly-linked” B-tree. Also remember that cola is written in Rust, and the Rust compiler really doesn’t like data structures that don’t have a clear ownership hierarchy. If you tried to implement this in safe Rust you’d quickly end up with with a bunch of Rc>s everywhere, which is not only slow but also ugly. By wondering into the unsafe lands of Rust we could probably do it with raw pointers and Pinned nodes, but to prove that that kind of code is safe I’d have to reason a lot more about how computers actually work than I’d like to. I like Rust because it allows me not to do that. The ownership model of a B-tree is very simple: every inode owns its children. Unfortunately this simplicity leads to the kinds of problems I’ve described if we want to do bottom-up operations. What we need is a way to express which children belong to which parent, without having the latter actually own them (in the Rust sense of the term). The solution is surprisingly simple: we can store every node in a dynamic array, (a Vec in Rust) and use indices into this vector to refer to other nodes. This solves the ownership problem because the vector now owns all the nodes. And by simply storing the index of the parent in every node we can navigate the tree in both directions without having to use any unsafe code. This all hinges on the assumption that once we’ve inserted a node into the vector its index never changes. Inserting new nodes doesn’t cause any issues: we just append them to the end. Removing a node however would be doubly bad: not only is it a linear operation (because we’re now using a vector instead of a tree), but it would also invalidate all the indices of the nodes that come after it. But as we’ve seen we never remove runs from the document anyway. Deleting some text only marks the corresponding run as tombstoned, but it’s still there, so we don’t have to worry about this. I couldn’t find any established name for this kind of tree-in-a-vector data structure, so I’ve been calling it a G-tree, short for grow-only tree. The Rust code for it is slightly more efficient than what I’m presenting here, but it’s basically: trait Leaf ( fn len(&self) -> u64; ) struct Gtree ( inodes: Vec, leaves: Vec>, root_idx: InodeIdx, ) struct Inode { children: Vec, parent: Option, total_len: u64, } struct Leaf { value: L, parent: InodeIdx, } enum NodeIdx { Inode(InodeIdx), Leaf(LeafIdx), } struct InodeIdx(usize); struct LeafIdx(usize); The nice properties of the B-tree that we care about, namely top-down search and insertion in logarithmic time, are still here. This is because we still have the structure of a B-tree, i.e. the parent-child relationships between the nodes, we’ve just changed its representation in memory. But this is not all. By using a G-tree we get a few other nice properties for free: we can use the index of a leaf in the vector – a.k.a. the LeafIdx – as a stable identifier for that leaf. No pointers, yay! remember when we considered caching the pointer to the currently active run when we were trying to make the linked-list-based implementation faster? We can do that now, except instead of storing a pointer we store the LeafIdx of the run. This is a big deal because it makes repeated edits at the same cursor location extremely fast. We just extend the active run and update the length of every ancestor all the way up to the root. Let’s do a bit of math to estimate just how (in)expensive cursor-cache hits are. cola’s G-tree has a branching factor of 32, with an average occupancy of around 20 children per inode3. With just 4 levels we usually store around 160k distinct EditRuns, and even documents with very long editing histories barely reach a fraction of that4. This means a cache hit costs us a few integer comparisons and 2-4 integer additions. No tree traversals and no new allocations. It doesn’t get much faster than that; serializing and deserializing becomes trivial. (De)Serializing things that are represented as trees in memory is always a bit annoying because it involves “flattening” the tree into a linear sequence of bytes in a way that preserves its structure. But in a G-tree everything is already stored linearly in memory, so we can just (de)serialize the vector. Anchors to Leaves Let’s recap our performance journey so far: we started with a linked list of runs, which was slow (linear) for both upstream and downstream operations; we then switched to a B-tree, which was logarithmic for upstream operations but still still linear for downstream ones; we’ve finally landed on the G-tree which, like the B-tree, is logarithmic for upstream operations, but can also be logarithmic for downstream ones. Remember that downstream operations involve integrating remote edits of the form insert 2.3..7 at 1.2 or delete between 3.4 and 2.2. All the operations are specified in terms of anchors. To turn them into concrete edits the user can apply we need to convert the anchors into offsets into the document, i.e. turning them into something of the form insert 2.3..7 at 18 or delete between 17 and 25. We’ve also seen how the G-tree can be traversed in both directions, so if we knew which run contains a given anchor we could easily get the corresponding offset by traversing the tree upwards. And “knowing which run” really means “knowing which LeafIdx”, because as we’ve seen the LeafIdx acts as a stable identifier for a run. We’ve reduced the problem of integrating remote edits into performing the Anchor -> LeafIdx conversion. But this is relatively easy compared to what we’ve done so far. A simple solution would be to keep a secondary G-tree (or even a B-tree) where the leaves contain the ReplicaId, the temporal range and the LeafIdx of the run containing the same ReplicaId and range in the main G-tree, like so: Note how the leaves of this tree are totally ordered, first by ReplicaId and then by temporal range. A total order allows us to bubble the greatest Anchor within the children of an inode up to the root, and use Anchors as offsets into this tree. When we need to convert an Anchor into a LeafIdx we just navigate the tree downwards until we find the right leaf, which will contain the LeafIdx we’re looking for. This is a perfectly valid design since search and insertion both run in O(log n), where n is the total number of runs in the document, which is the same complexity as the main G-tree. With that said, you won’t find this secondary G-tree in cola’s source code. I won’t go over the details of the actual implementation cola uses because it’s a bit involved and there’s not a ton to learn from it. The important thing to know is that both search and insertion are O(log f), where f is the number of “fragments” that the EditRun containing the anchor has been split into over time. Of course f is always <= than n, and usually much smaller than it. Aaand.. we’re done! We’ve finally reached a design that guarantees convergence, intent preservation and good performance (we’ll see just how good in the following (and final) section). There’s actually still work to do to make cola production-ready like supporting undo/redo and a few other things, but the foundation is there. Third part: Benchmarks I’ve benchmarked cola against 3 other CRDTs implemented in Rust: diamond-types, automerge and yrs. I’ve measured the time each CRDT takes to process the editing history of a real-world character-by-character editing trace taken from this dataset using criterion, a popular benchmarking library for Rust. Each trace was measured in both the upstream and downstream directions. This is the code that’s being benchmarked. In the following graphs I’m using cola’s performance times 100 as the deadline, so if a CRDT is more than 100x slower than cola its measurement is not shown. The benchmarks were run on a 2018 MacBook Pro with a 2.2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7. If you run them on your machine you’ll probably get different results, but the relative performance of the CRDTs should be similar. In the upstream direction both yrs and automerge go over the deadline, with cola being 1.4-2x faster than diamond-types. Upstream results. The results in the downstream direction are similar, except now diamond-types crashes with every trace so I couldn’t get any measurements (if it was my fault for not using the library correctly please let me know and I’ll update the post). Downstream results. cola is ~2x slower than before, which is expected since integrating remote edits is in general more expensive than creating local ones, but it still performs amazingly well. It’s about as fast as (if not faster than) the fastest rope libraries in both directions, and it’s currently the fastest text CRDT implementation I know of. ✌🏻 this is not true if we want to support undoing deletions, which cola doesn’t do at the moment.↩︎ in cola this is called a version map instead of a version vector because, well, it’s shaped like a map and not like a vector.↩︎ just like in a B-tree, the inodes of a G-tree have a variable number of children. A branching factor of 32 means that every inode can have between 16 and 32 children, except for the root which can have as few as 2 children.↩︎ after processing the automerge-paper editing trace cola’s G-tree has around ~15k EditRuns. And that trace is huge! It contains 260k edits and was recorded over several days.↩︎",

This still stores pointers, they are just in units of the node size instead of bytes and relative to the first array element instead of the beginning of the address space. A complete binary tree stored in a array without any explicit references, i.e. an implicit representation with the children of the node at index x stored at indices 2x + 1 and 2x + 2, is still referred to as a binary tree, just with an implicit representation. reply dgb23 3 hours agoparentIt’s useful to talk about representation though. Especially in a language that nudges you away from absolute references towards relative, self managed ones.A quite clever representation of a tree that I read about is to store nodes in DFS order in a flat array. Given that it’s read only and the readers want to traverse it depth first anyway, this can be quite efficient. S-expressions and HTML come to mind. reply danbruc 2 hours agorootparentMy point was not that it might not be important, just that you probably do not want to assign a new name to a data structure just because you use a different representation. If the implementation would have been in a different language, then adding parent pointers into the B-tree would have been less of a concern and the representation with an array would maybe never have come up. It would be weird to say that this CRDT is based on a B-Tree with parent pointers, unless you implement it in Rust, then it is based on a G-tree. reply czx111331 1 hour agoprevNice work! However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a fair benchmark. It doesn&#x27;t calculate and store the ops, nor does it store the actual text.

I.e that the user define a model&#x2F;schema to describe semantically valid states. If you just merge e.g JSON you might end up in a state that&#x27;s syntactically valid, but doesn&#x27;t make any sense.Similar how the Pretext algorithm know that bold&#x2F;italic&#x2F;underlining operations are additive while highlighting colouring is not, I&#x27;m thinking the user could control the schema to declare that \"state: notStarted\" and \"completionDate: 2023-09-04\" is incompatible reply refset 14 minutes agorootparentCRDT synthesis feels like a promising direction, e.g. see \"Katara: Synthesizing CRDTs with Verified Lifting\"&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2205.12425 &#x2F; previous discussion https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32977887 reply paulgb 48 minutes agorootparentprev> I always wondered if it would be possible to create a more general purpose \"structured data\" CRDT.Technically yes; one approach would be to use a list CRDT containing representations of operations on the data structure. Each replica would play the operations forward and reject any that broke the schema to “project” the operations onto a local representation of the shared data structure.So in your example, the operation to set state: notStarted would be rejected if a completion date were present.Besides the fact that the computational cost of the data structure will only ever grow, another consideration is that even though you are locally only appending to the list of operations, operations from peers may arrive that are not at the end of the global order.This approach would only guarantee that the data is consistent and meets the schema — it doesn’t guarantee that merges are semantically what a user would expect. reply matlin 13 hours agoprevAny comparisons to Automerge or Y.js&#x2F;Yrs regarding performance or features? reply jayunit 13 hours agoparentThe “third part” of the post starts with “I’ve benchmarked cola against 3 other CRDTs implemented in Rust: diamond-types, automerge and yrs.” This cola library appears to perform favorably in operation speed.I’d be curious to know about memory usage, too. reply gyulai 2 hours agoprevJust a nitpick &#x2F; editorial suggestion: The acronym \"CRDT\" is not extremely common, and never defined in the document.

After all, that stuff is expensive.By the hour, most of that content is TV shows. Most of the unseen ~5% is produced pilot episodes that didn&#x27;t get picked up for a full season.

Many video game developers don&#x27;t work with union actors at all, with plenty of games either not having voice acting period or hiring whatever random staff they have around to fill those roles.For instance, many of Nintendo&#x27;s games have very little voice acting, or have it done by random internal staff rather than professional actors. So most of the Mario, Kirby, Donkey Kong, Pikmin, Metroid, Animal Crossing, etc series could probably keep on going without any issues. And those franchises that did use voice acting recently (mostly Zelda) could probably just go release a few games in the old style where voices were limited to the odd grunt or yell and it wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference. Heck, Pokemon doesn&#x27;t really have voice acting in its games even now, and that&#x27;s the biggest media franchise in the world.Add that to how the industry worked fine up til about the N64&#x2F;PlayStation era without any voice acting (or at best, very limited acting) and how a large percentage of lower budget and indie games don&#x27;t have it at all, and it&#x27;s a lot less important than acting is in the film or television industry. Hollywood actors go on strike and don&#x27;t appear in films or TV shows? Those industry comes to a screeching halt, since the cast is an essential part of the medium. Actors don&#x27;t appear in video games? Well, guess the number of silent protagonists goes up significantly this year.I do wish them the best of luck here and I do understand their concerns, it&#x27;s just that games need actors a lot less than films do, and that gives them far less leverage as a result. reply the_lonely_road 17 hours agoparentOne of the most popular add ins for World of Warcraft released in recent memory is one that adds voice acting to all of the quests that were previously text only.

The ghosts from Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3 are voiced by Next Level Games development and marketing staff, the voice for Yoshi is Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka, Shy Guys are voiced by Nintendo of America localisation manager Nate Bihldorff, the WarioWare cast were voiced by Treehouse (localisation) staff until WarioWare Gold, Donkey Kong 64 had Rare&#x27;s staff voicing characters (like composer Grant Kirkhope as DK himself), etc. reply philistine 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re not wrong, but you&#x27;re going a bit historical there with DK 64, which came out in the 90s. On top of that, British developers were notorious for picking employees for voice work.Nintendo still uses internal staff for incidental stuff, but you can see the trend of professionalization. Tears of the Kingdom came out on the same day around the world with a large professional voice cast for every supported language.

Just like banking software is not relevant.There are games that do require it, those are relevant. reply crazygringo 18 hours agorootparentExactly. This is about games like GTAV and RDR2. These games don&#x27;t exist without whole casts of talented actors, and they&#x27;re SAG-AFTRA because every working actor at that level belongs to the union. reply rhdunn 14 hours agorootparentprevSo what will happen is that the games using SAG-AFTRA voice actors will be delayed&#x2F;dropped from production, while the games using non-US union voice actors or not needing voices will be produced. Therefore, the SAG-AFTRA games and the associated companies will suffer but the industry will not.The situation is different for films and TV where no US-based TV show or film can be produced without the actors or writers. There are interim agreements that allow some TV shows and films to be produced. Even there, there are a lot of older or foreign TV shows and films that are slowly taking over. reply mcpackieh 18 hours agorootparentprevMost of the games that &#x27;require&#x27; voice acting actually don&#x27;t, and could work with text. The reason they have voice acting is because mass audiences expect it, but consumer expectations are malleable and subject to change. reply wlesieutre 17 hours agorootparentSure, and Hollywood could stop recording audio and go back to silent movies because movies don’t ‘require’ sound. reply mcpackieh 17 hours agorootparentBasically correct, although it wouldn&#x27;t actually happen unless sound in movies became cost prohibitive (which is what we&#x27;re discussing.)However in video-games this is even more true. &#x27;Talkies&#x27; crushed silent movies, out-competed them very rapidly in the span of a few years. But in video games this didn&#x27;t happen, video games with voice acting have existed for roughly 30 years now but video games without voice acting still frequently find commercial success. In fact the most successful video game of all time, minecraft, has no voice acting despite competing against innumerable contemporary games with voice acting. reply nirvdrum 16 hours agorootparentAnd some of the top grossing video games of all time have voice acting. The modern Rockstar and Naughty Dog games would be less attractive and have much less emotional impact without the characters coming to life via voice. Character models help sell games, too. Sure, voice acting isn&#x27;t required for all genres and many don&#x27;t need motion capture, but if they didn&#x27;t add anything studios could save a ton of money by cutting it out. It turns out not everyone wants to play indie platformers or sandboxed builders.You could of course use non-union voice actors, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to tell when games use random people to narrate or voice characters. It often harms the product. reply squeaky-clean 15 hours agorootparentprevMinecraft has no storyline or named characters though. It&#x27;s not really \"competing\" against games with voice acting, as they&#x27;re totally different genres.

If your industry is two or three companies you can&#x27;t leave for a better job. So you have to either collectively negotiate or not negotiate at all.While I disagree that AI is presently capable of replacing voice actors, I don&#x27;t think it matters. We already have a global agreement that impacts AI, which is the copyright on the training data used in the models[0]. While you probably can&#x27;t stop someone from training on public data entirely[1], you definitely can prohibit the use of derived models to generate work that competes in the same market using copyright.US businesses were able to break the backs of working-class unions like UAW using free trade agreements with countries that don&#x27;t respect organized labor. Mexico and China[2] are hideously anti-union in ways that would be patently illegal in the US. I&#x27;m not entirely sure this process would work for creative talent.

Fair enough (I suppose), if they create an entirety synthetic person (that&#x27;s totally been a thing for decades, for massive, anonymous crowds), but if you make something that&#x27;s based on me, looks like me, moves like me, sounds like me, isn&#x27;t that partly my creation, and shouldn&#x27;t I get some credit, and some compensation?I mean, maybe someday they may create entirely synthetic background actors, and then the point will be moot, but for now they&#x27;re not quite there, and they&#x27;re trying to get away with using actual peoples&#x27; work in ways that weren&#x27;t ancicipated, and for which they were not compensated. replycrazygringo 16 hours agoparentprevI think you&#x27;re misunderstanding the debate.This isn&#x27;t mostly about background actors -- digital extras are already widely used for things like large crowd scenes. And it&#x27;s far cheaper currently to hire an extra to be a bartender who hands the main character a drink, than to 3D render that -- so it&#x27;s not about that either.It&#x27;s about studios wanting to own the likenesses and voices of every actor they hire for a project, so they can hire someone with a really unique look for a single episode, then be able to produce the rest of the season with a cheaper actor and use AI to do a face swap and voice swap.And that&#x27;s unacceptable. Actors should be able to retain the rights to their likenesses, end of story. A standard contract shouldn&#x27;t require that an actor signs over all rights to their likeness for an entire series just in order to be paid for a single episode. That&#x27;s not right. reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentNo, that’s stupid. Nobody cares about the likeness of nobody actors. They are completely fungible. And if the actors guild thinks this is the hill to die on then they may win the battle and lose the war by an enormous margin.the obvious near term future is that they don’t even get the single episode.Your example is silly. Hire someone who is funny looking to be a bartender and then have someone cheaper do them later on? My dude, the funny looking bartender is already going to be as cheap as it gets because they’re a nobody actor. And the barrier to face swapping a generated face that is just as good as the funny looking dude’s onto a different nobody from the beginning is very small. reply TheCoelacanth 13 hours agorootparentIf studios don&#x27;t want to do it, then they should have no problem signing a contract saying they won&#x27;t do it. reply jncfhnb 12 hours agorootparentI doubt this would be a major issue if this were the only demand.

If SAG-AFTRA get that demand, it then means productions like Rogue One (AI Leia and Moff Tarkin), The Mandalorian (AI Luke), and de-aged Professor Xavier and Magnito in the X-Men are not possible.It also prevents an aspiring writer from using AI tools to help with the writing process -- not do it all for them, but work co-operatively like copilot and other auto-complete tools do for programming.Even using tools like Photoshop, Blender, Unreal Engine (as used in shows like The Mandalorian) could be dicey as they incorporate AI models and techniques. -- Would things like NVidia&#x27;s AI upscaling tech count for raytraced CGI? (I ask as it looks like SAG-AFTRA are after a blanket AI ban, not just around actor voice&#x2F;image or writer text.)Another thing that the production companies could do is to use public domain audio, video, and scripts as SAG-AFTRA cannot ban the use if AI on those. reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentNobody&#x27;s saying no AI ever.The union is just saying that if you want the rights to use an actor&#x27;s likeness without actually employing the actor to act, you have to pay separately for that, and pay what it&#x27;s worth.Which makes perfect sense. In your example of a de-aged Luke Hammill in the Mandalorian, Luke Hammill was paid $$$ for that. They didn&#x27;t get to cast him for free just because he was in previous Star Wars movies. Nor should they.That&#x27;s all this is about. Go ahead and use AI, but pay the actors for their likeness. Don&#x27;t force them to give it away for free as a condition of doing a single episode. reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentThat’s just insane though. People don’t care about continuity in background actors or what they look like. Many background actors will be reused in different contexts as different people.If studios can apply their likeness to a cheaper actor, they can also apply a made up likeness to a cheaper actor. Or the likeness of a model. Or the likeness of a volunteer who thinks it’d be cool.The only case where this applies, maybe, is for characters with speaking roles that have enough positive reception that they have negotiating power for their cost to return for future works. But that’s a tiny segment far removed from the majority of this guild. And if it’s actually sensible to do this over hiring the actor then they could probably just do this from the beginning. reply crazygringo 12 hours agorootparentWhy are you bringing up background actors?This isn&#x27;t primarily about background actors (who usually aren&#x27;t even members of SAG-AFTRA to begin with, because they usually don&#x27;t even have acting training&#x2F;experience or anything).This is primarily about working actors with lines but who aren&#x27;t big stars able to negotiate their contracts -- we&#x27;re talking non-lead series regulars, guest stars, recurring guest stars, and the like.

The industry is being forced to change and consolidate all at once. As much as I sympathize with the actors, they&#x27;re arguing from a position of weakness, not strength. Their industry is struggling.AI is going to bring the costs of production down 100x or more, and we&#x27;re all going to be the beneficiaries of that. Content will be faster and cheaper to make, cheaper to buy, and it will tailor to an increasingly long tail of interests that have never before been served.The task has always been storytelling, not location scouting, set decorating, lighting, electrical, blocking, capturing grids of photos, then splicing them together.Folks that couldn&#x27;t dream of starting their own film studio will now realistically be able to power than endeavor from home, and that includes these actors and writers that are complaining. The YouTube-ization effect where small creators monetize will lead to Hollywood capital outflows and more money being spent to prop up individual and small team creators.Those at the bottom rungs are complaining about technology that will give them a bigger platform with more autonomy than they&#x27;ve ever had before.

Ideally without showing contempt for said original material. Either that or create something original - something that has new and fresh ideas. And blindly replacing one sex for another or one color of person for another is not my idea of \"new\" or \"fresh\".To me it seems like they decided that these things don&#x27;t matter anymore. So I don&#x27;t mind if they go belly up. reply sammyteee 15 hours agoprevIsn&#x27;t this similar to worries about machines taking over human jobs in other areas?

It&#x27;s not \"yes AI\" vs \"no AI.\" It&#x27;s more around can you use my likeness, writing, or artwork to train AI with minimal to zero compensation (what studios want) or with compensation structure both sites negotiate (what unions what). Or can the result of AI be used to undermine labor. Currently, the output of AI isn&#x27;t up to expected standards for much of anything. Studios are obviously trying to use that output to replace \"writing credit\" which has a historical structure with higher compensation. The person they pay to go \"punch it up\" won&#x27;t get that. The resulting product would be mostly the same, but the person polishing and finishing it does a lot more work with less compensation.AI is also just a relatively minor part of what unions are trying to negotiate. reply jncfhnb 18 hours agoparentprev> I think maybe all unions should ban together for a general strike to force a ubi vote, so that when ai does take jobs people can still eat and pay rent.Pit the old creatives against the young ones.

How hard it is to perform lines in a way that seems like real life, as opposed to seeming like bad acting (melodramatic exclaiming of lines).Of course, a lot of people don&#x27;t understand just how difficult and skilled screen acting is, because the entire point is that you&#x27;re not supposed to notice acting at all.

Sure, you will have the occasional Oscar worthy actor that is some level of creativity that doesn’t work, but vast majority of acting is not finding new ways to show something in a script, the creativity came from the writing and directing choices.Art was also thought to require human creativity until recently. We’re not going to produce a new paradigm of art or Picasso level impact, but the median artist can be replaced today in most ways imho. reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparent> but vast majority of acting is not finding new ways to show something in a script, the creativity came from the writing and directing choices.I&#x27;m sorry, but you have clearly never worked in film and television, and certainly never in casting. Because your impression of acting is simply wrong.Casting offices will audition literally hundreds of actors to find the one who can bring the right unique take to the role, that no other actor can. There are TV shows and plays that simply don&#x27;t get made because they can&#x27;t find an actor who can play the part with the needed charm and magnetism for the specific role. I&#x27;m not talking Oscars, I&#x27;m talking bread-and-butter network comedies and procedurals.People watch shows and movies for the story&#x2F;script, but they also watch them for the unique spark and charisma that the actors bring just as much.

The entire point of the machines was to cut down on labor costs and increase production, which the company could do with or without the Luddite workers; they simply brought in unskilled workers, because the machine didn&#x27;t need all of the skill (and therefore higher labor cost) of Luddite craftspeople.The same will happen with AI here, if companies can cut down labor costs, what will the current laborers do? They are striking, yes, but just like the Luddites, if there comes a technology that can replace them with cheaper labor, then that&#x27;s what companies will do, and I don&#x27;t think the current laborers have any recourse (in the long term, not the short term, as I know Luddites tried to destroy the machines but in the end they were defeated). reply donatj 18 hours agorootparentprev [–] One days pay for one days work seems fair.

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE Google Preemptively Banned Hundreds of Millions of ‘Pirate’ URLs Last Year yesterday by Ernesto Van der Sar HOME > ANTI-PIRACY > DMCA > Google remains committed to tackling online piracy. In a recent letter to the US Patent and Trademark Office, the company says that it blocked hundreds of millions of URLs before they appeared in the search engine. These preemptive takedowns are part of a broader strategy that also deals with advertisements for streaming piracy that hasn't happened yet. Under the current DMCA legislation, US-based Internet services are expected to remove infringing links, if a copyright holder complains. This process shields these services from direct liability. In recent years there has been a lot of discussion about the effectiveness of the system but it remains standard practice. Google has always maintained that the DMCA works well. However, faced with critique from rightsholders, the company has taken a variety of extra anti-piracy measures across numerous services while pointing out that copyright holders have a key role to play. Google’s View on Piracy A few days ago, Google reiterated this stance. In a response to the US Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) inquiry about future anti-piracy strategies and policies, Google stresses that the availability of legal content is key. “For over two decades, we have observed that unmet consumer demand is a key driver of piracy. If demand is unmet by legitimate supply, users will seek pirated content. That is why one of the best ways to combat piracy is to provide better, more convenient, and legitimate alternatives,” Google writes. With YouTube Music and YouTube TV, Google helps out on the supply side. At the same time, the company also tweaked its search engine to steer people away from piracy. Like all other online service providers, Google processes DMCA takedown notices. When copyright holders find a link to pirated content in Google’s results they can report the URL, asking for it to be removed. This happened seven billion times over the past decade. Preemptive Takedowns This doesn’t mean that Google actually removed that many URLs from its search index. As reported before, Google also supports ‘preemptive‘ takedowns, which means that it will block reported URLs before they are indexed by the search engine. These preemptive takedowns ensure that rightsholders can report content before Google picks it up. This isn’t required by the DMCA, but rightsholders use this feature en masse. In the USPTO letter Google reveals that in 2022, more than 40% of the takedowns submitted via the web form were for content that hadn’t yet been indexed. “Search accepts notices for web pages that are not even in our index at the time of submission. Nevertheless, we will proactively block such web pages from appearing in our Search results and will apply these notices to our demotion signal. “In 2022, more than 40% of the over 680 million URLs we received via our web form were not in our Search index and therefore, have never appeared in our Search results,” the letter reads. Pre-Piracy Removals This percentage, which isn’t reported in Google’s transparency report, shows that ‘preemptive’ takedowns are quite popular. Interestingly, the search engine goes a step further, as it also accepts takedown notices for piracy that hasn’t happened yet. For popular live-streaming broadcasts, such as the Super Bowl, UFC events, and World Cup football matches, pirates often generate websites in advance to announce their unauthorized streams. Copyright holders can now take these offline before a stream starts. “Rightsholders are able to pre-notify us of web pages that advertise they will illegally stream a live event in the future,” Google writes. Demoting Pirate Sites All the copyrighted URLs that rightsholders report are added to a scorecard. Sites that are often targeted are actively demoted in search results, making these less visible to the public at large. According to Google, this works well. “Our experience shows that demoted sites lose an average of 89% of their clicks from Search. In addition to these efforts, we have made it much harder for sites to evade demotion by redirecting people to a new domain,” Google writes. The full letter also includes other steps that the company has taken to address piracy. While not explicitly mentioned, Google appears pleased with how things are right now and doesn’t have any concrete anti-piracy proposals for the future. That said, Google stresses that it is committed to investing in new tools and processes to combat the ever-evolving piracy challenge. — A copy of Google’s full letter to the US Patent and Trademark Office is available here (pdf) Next Post Previous Post Tagged In: google You Might Also Like: ANTI-PIRACY Google Removes ‘Pirate’ URLs from Users’ Privately Saved Links August 30, 2023, 20:12 by Ernesto Van der Sar ANTI-PIRACY Telecoms Regulator Gives Google a Week to Join IPTV Piracy Fight August 25, 2023, 21:20 by Andy Maxwell ANTI-PIRACY Manga Piracy Apps Stay Up on Google & Apple, Publisher Moves to Unmask Devs August 17, 2023, 11:38 by Andy Maxwell Submit a correction or tip.

    "originBody": "The Ruffian Subscribe Sign in Stories are bad for your intelligence How Historians (and Others) Make Themselves Stupid IAN LESLIE SEP 2, 2023 ∙ PAID 56 2 Share Catch-up service: The Social Media Cage Fight Barbearheimer This is Henry Cort. You probably haven’t heard of him unless you’re an Industrial Revolution nerd (I hadn’t until this week). He isn’t as well known as James Watt or Joseph Priestley - he wasn’t one of the Lunar Men - but Cort played a critical part in the creation of the modern world. He invented a method of production which made it much easier and cheaper to turn scrap iron into high-quality iron, ready to build railways, warships, bridges and balconies. Cort pioneered and combined two innovations. One was an improvement on Peter Onions’s puddling process, which we needn’t dwell on here - really, I just wanted to write out, “Peter Onions’s puddling process”. The other was the use of grooved rollers. Traditional rolling mills used flat rollers to roll hot metal into simple, flat shapes. Cort’s rollers had grooved edges which made for perfectly smooth, welded bars. The “Cort process”, introduced in the 1780s, led to a quadrupling of Britain’s iron production over the following twenty years, making Britain one of the world’s leading iron producers. Fifty years after his death, the Times called Cort “the father of the iron trade” and today he’s regarded as one of the twenty or so most important innovators of the era. Now comes a twist in the tale. A lecturer in science and technology at UCL called Jenny Bulstrode has published a paper which argues that what she calls “the myth of Henry Cort” is based on a lie. In the prestigious journal, History and Technology, Dr Bulstrode argues that Cort stole his innovations from black slaves who had developed them independently in an iron works in Jamaica. Bulstrode traces a complex chain of events by which Cort, who as far as we know never visited Jamaica, ended up claiming credit for a process which was collectively invented by 76 enslaved factory workers (Bulstrode refers to them as “Black metallurgists”). Bulstrode’s paper centres on a Jamaican ironworks run by an English industrialist called John Reeder. Within a few years of setting up, his foundry became successful and profitable. Reeder’s workforce included slaves trafficked from West Africa and trained by English experts he shipped over. Bulstrode argues that the black workers, drawing on ancient African traditions of ironwork, and from their experience of sugar production (where a kind of grooved roller is used) developed these new methods of their own volition, and that it was this which accounted for the factory’s impressive profits. So how did Cort find out about it? Well, he ran an ironworks in Portsmouth, which he took over in 1775. Bulstrode notes that in 1781 a man with the surname of Cort arrived in Portsmouth from Jamaica. She describes him as a ‘cousin’ of Henry Cort, although as she notes, that term was often used to mean a distant relative. This second Cort had no connection to Reeder’s mill either, but Bulstrode argues that he must have heard all about the foundry and its innovative process when he was in Jamaica. She says he then met Henry Cort in Portsmouth, and passed on this valuable information. A few months later, in 1782, Reeder’s factory was razed to the ground under orders from the British government. This was previously thought to have been because the colony was under threat from rival European powers and the British wanted to prevent the foundry from falling into French or Spanish hands. Bulstrode says that the military governor disclosed an ulterior motive: the British wanted to stop the factory from being taken over by black Jamaicans, who might then be empowered to overthrow their colonial rulers (in an interview with a podcast called The Context of White Supremacy, Bulstrode even suggests that Henry Cort instigated the destruction via contacts in the British government). Bulstrode says that components from the destroyed factory were then shipped to Portsmouth, with the implication being that Cort then reverse-engineered the process, and patented the secrets under his own name. Bulstrode’s paper has made a big splash. It’s been hailed by her academic peers as a major breakthrough, and picked up by big media outlets including the Guardian, the New Scientist, and NPR. If you Google “Henry Cort”, it’s these reports which come up. Wikipedia has already incorporated it into Cort’s biography. Bulstrode’s paper fits the zeitgeist in historical studies - that the economic success of Britain and the West owes much more to the exploitation of black ingenuity and ideas than mainstream historians have hitherto allowed for. Subscribe If the story Bulstrode tells sounds incredible, that’s because it is. Right after Bulstrode’s paper made the headlines, Anton Howes, the proprietor of an excellent Substack on the history of innovation, noted the almost total lack of evidence for the paper’s central claims. Last week, he returned to it in a piece sparked by a new paper from Oliver Jelf which examines Bulstrode’s paper in detail and provides the most thorough debunking of it imaginable. Jelf’s paper is a crisply argued, ruthless demolition job which makes for a gruesomely compelling read (I suggest reading Bulstrode’s paper first). Jelf takes each of Bulstrode’s central claims and finds them to be, not just dubious, but demonstrably false. He draws on his own expertise on the period but often, all he has to do is point us to the very sources Bulstrode cites in order to show that her conclusions are unsupported. In reality, John Reeder’s foundry used very ordinary (run-of-the-mill?) production processes. No innovations were introduced there, by the workers or anyone else. Its profitability needs no extraordinary explanation; Reeder had the only foundry on the island and supplied the Royal Navy. The elaborate chain of events by which Cort is supposed to have found out about these non-existent innovations simply didn’t happen. Cort’s cousin did not go to Portsmouth, but to Lancaster. Henry Cort lived in complete and blissful ignorance of John Reeder’s factory. The factory was destroyed because of the foreign invasion threat and only because of that; at no point did the military governor or anyone else suggest otherwise. No components from the foundry, which was thoroughly destroyed, were shipped to Portsmouth or anywhere else. I could go on but, simply put, none of the assertions Bulstrode makes in her paper stand up to even cursory scrutiny. Bulstrode hasn’t yet responded to Jelf or Howes in public, but it’s hard to see how her paper can be creditably defended. I’m left wondering two things: one, how she arrived at her narrative at all, and two, how on earth it survived the review process. On the first, I suspect Bulstrode fell under the spell of story. Her paper has the feel of a messy and flawed first draft of a historical novel. It begins in Lisbon in the fifteenth century (even here, her assertions seem to be mistaken) before skipping to eighteenth century Jamaica, West Africa, and Portsmouth, weaving a web of vague and tenuous connections as it goes. It is clogged with deadening and risibly anachronistic jargon (“sugar and iron shared much overlapping conceptual space”). Most uncomfortably, there is a strain of quasi-Orientalism to its depiction of the black metalworkers, who are presented as magical figures: exceptionally skilled “metallurgists”, conceptual innovators, custodians of ancient and mystical wisdom, noble freedom-fighters. But it is full of nuggets which fire the imagination; names of forgotten people; dim outlines of dramatic events. I doubt that Bulstrode set out to deceive. My guess is that she came across a few suggestive fragments in her reading (the ‘cousin’ of Cort travelling from Jamaica to England) and wanted so badly to make them into a story which fitted her ideologically determined prior - that the British stole ideas from those they enslaved - that she got carried away, fabricating causes and effects where none existed. It’s one thing for a young and passionate academic to make mistakes; it’s quite another for a series of experienced academics to let her make them. The paper had two anonymous peer-reviewers (Bulstrode thanks other historians in an endnote, though they may not have read the paper). Even to an ignorant reader like me, the paper just smells funny - it has the aroma of the fantastical. How on earth did these experts read it without becoming suspicious? Why didn’t they double-check its remarkable claims? My guess is that they were also seduced by story. It’s not just that Bulstrode’s storytelling mind went into overdrive, it’s that the master-narrative into which her paper fits now exerts such a grip over some historians that they will blind themselves to anything which undermines it. According to this narrative, Britain’s Industrial Revolution was not the product of ingenuity or the free exchange of ideas, but of thievery and exploitation. The British stole, not just the labour and materials of black countries, but their ideas too. If your paper fits that narrative, it’s more likely to get published, even if it has holes in it; even if it is nothing but holes. The discipline, or a sub-set of it, has become helplessly in thrall to one of the archetypal narrative forms: Good vs Evil. Naturally, the academics are on the side of the Good. Share Anton Howes argues that, like the field of psychology has done in recent years, history must confront its own “replication crisis”. Errors are allowed to survive and spread throughout the corpus for decades. His solution is widen access to archival sources to make it easier for peer-reviewers to check claims. But if peer-reviewers aren’t motivated to be sceptical, this may not help much. I draw a different moral, which is that historians need to train, or retrain, themselves, to be suspicious of story and narrative. Historians have an increasingly strong incentive to tell dramatic stories which gain attention and make ‘impact’. But anyone in the business of reporting on reality - scholars, scientists, journalists - ought to be suspicious of narrative, even if they use it. So should those of us who consume these reports. Just because information is conveyed in narrative form doesn’t make it false, but it does mean that it’s going to seem more true than it is. Stories are reality filters. By definition, they leave out information - all the messy stuff that doesn’t fit - and draw attention to what the storyteller wants us to notice. In that sense they are like ideologies: both are methods of rolling and shaping the hot metal of reality into smooth ready-made shapes. Stories don’t accommodate randomness or structural forces very well; they rely on chains of causation and on individual motive. Covid-19 can’t be an accident and we needn’t bother ourselves too much with biology; it is a plot perpetrated by evil people. Bulstrode’s paper has the flavour of a conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories aren’t theories; they’re stories. Stories act like an anaesthetic on our sceptical, questioning faculties. It can be valuable and pleasurable to subdue that part of our brain, and immerse ourselves in an imaginary world; I love reading stories, including non-fictional ones. But if you come across a history book, or a scientific study, or a news report, which tells a great story, or which slots neatly into a master-narrative in which you already believe, you should be more sceptical of its truth-value, not less. Narrative can give an illusion of solidity. When the expert narrative about the world changes, as with China (see below), we shouldn’t just conclude that the old narrative was false, but that all such narratives are unreliable. In Metahistory, his classic work of historiography, Hayden White argued that historians are always drawing on literary forms, like tragedy or comedy, whether they realise it or not. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but if you’re a historian you have to be aware of it; otherwise the story writes you rather than the other way around. Moralising narratives are particularly potent. Historians of the British empire are currently substituting one simplistic narrative for another in popular books. In a sense, Cort was an easy target for Bulstrode because he didn’t have a story of his own; he was narratively undefended. If Cort is less well known than Watt or Priestley that’s because neither his life or work have been moulded into a story; other than his innovations, Cort left barely a trace behind. He wasn’t a flamboyant character, but one of those diligent, determined, curious tinkerers on whom the Industrial Revolution was built (in my book CURIOUS I call them “thinkerers”). His innovations probably emerged from years of slow, sooty experimentation, without any eureka moments or dramatic breakthroughs. Stories are indispensable, nourishing and delightful. They are also attacks on the rational immune system. TED Talks are, famously, all about stories, but when the economist Tyler Cowen did one he used it, rather subversively, to warn against “story bias”. Cowen argues that any time someone believes in a story they are effectively subtracting ten points from their IQ (by which he means, broadly speaking, their analytical intelligence). That’s a deal we will often take willingly, since stories can bring pleasure and meaning to our lives and deepen our understanding of the world. But let’s be clear about what the deal is.

There is nothing surprising on that, given that the success of our species relies on coordinating large numbers of people. The problem is that, sometimes, it is very difficult or impossible for the individual to choose the \"right\" flag, whatever the definition of right may be. In communist and totalitarian countries, the problem is solved for the individual by allowing only one flag.

You must publish often and your work most be \"novel.\" The more novel, the more prestige, the more frequent the faster you rise.This is a system that&#x27;s problematic for science, but crazy in humanities. One reason in science is it discourages replication. But there is a parallel here in something like history, reinvestigation. Something like the Roman Empire is well studied and there&#x27;s lower novelty to be gained. But do we want to discourage such research? Discourage modern people for maintaining such records?Under the current system, we can encourage these people to continue studying popular areas but do we encourage maintaining historical truth and integrity? I conjecture that the answer is no. It encourages making things up, especially to fit a modern narrative. It&#x27;s a system that makes people not know they&#x27;re lying because they are true believers and no credible experts push back.This isn&#x27;t a problem unique to the study of history, but you can find issues like this is all research in academia. It is very hard to measure the quality of research. Citations, h-index, and so on do not mean a lot. We&#x27;ve seen in the past few months very popular researchers found to be frauds, with high positions in prestigious institution like Stanford. Even in practical areas that should be treatable: psychology, medicine, machine learning, and more. We want to believe, but do we have strong evidence and strong understanding? We make easy metrics at first to be \"good enough\" or because we lack better ones. But we often forget the limitations of those metrics as time goes by because we get caught up in the rat race. You can&#x27;t just ask yourself if the metric makes sense, but instead need to ask if there&#x27;s an easier way to score on the metric that isn&#x27;t the intended object of measurement. We can see here that citations can be hacked easily by fun stories, surprising results, and we&#x27;ll never uncover them because the only people who attempt to replicate are those in junior positions like undergrads and grad students, who are more likely to question their results than the original work. Those failures never get written about.Science is really about progressing knowledge. Publications are really about communication. Both these are very vague and can be accomplished in many different ways.I say instead of making narrow easy to define metrics that will never be good enough we embrace the chaos and noise. Let the researchers be free and let ̶G̶o̶d̶ time sort it out. We don&#x27;t know what is good research until 5-20 years down the line. We don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s a good teacher until the same. By removing the metrics you force nuance to not be ignored. Most of the time it&#x27;s a \"know it when you see it\" definition and if that&#x27;s true we have to be careful about levels of confidence. The thing that makes us human is the ability to handle nuance. It is what differentiates us from animals and LLMs. If the downside is that in a field where people are required to think hard and carefully have to... Think hard and carefully, then that&#x27;s okay. ML is very successful with the arxiv model because despite much hype, noise, and even many bad actors, us researchers can sniff it out. We have to do it anyways, as that&#x27;s our job.I fear if we don&#x27;t fix things we will continue to just degrade our foundation. We&#x27;ve seen this experiment fail over the last century. It&#x27;s time to just get rid of the bureaucracy. Let academics be academics. Micromanagement isn&#x27;t helping. Research can take decades, but people concerned with the next quarter will never allow that. Academics is about risks, challenging the status quo, and nuance. It is not to be run like a business.

For example, I see constant attempts to deny that the Wrights&#x27; 1903 Flyer was the first powered, controlled flight. The evidence presented is always a pile of fanciful conjecture.This rewrite occurs with modern events, too. For example, the narrative on the 737MAX crashes. I&#x27;ve posted about it here many times. On a recent trip, I ran into a 737-800 captain on layover, and struck up a conversation. I chided him a bit about remembering the stab trim cutoff switch. Well, that opened the floodgates. He told me in no uncertain terms that those accidents would have never happened to him, because he knew how to fly the 737. He told me one way they could have recovered the airplane was the one I mentioned here many times - trim to normal and turn off the stab trim system. He said there was another way. The EA airplane was operating at full throttle. The overspeed warning could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder. The pilots ignored it. Overspeed is a very dangerous situation, as the air loads on the airplane exceed design limits. All the pilots had to do was just pull the throttle back. Then they could have manually retrimmed the stabilizer, which they tried to but could not because of the overspeed.He added that all the 737 pilots he knew knew about this, but were afraid to speak up.Remember all the narrative about the pilots could not have diagnosed stab trim runaway? This infuriated him, because when the trim runs, it spins two wheels right by the pilots&#x27; knees, making a loud and unmistakable clack-clacking sound. Something I was told about by Boeing engineers, but it was nice to hear it from a captain.I suspect that the reason the single point of failure design of the MCAS went through is Boeing simply assumed that the pilots would just turn off the stab trim system if it misbehaved. And this is exactly what happened in the first MCAS incident - the crew turned it off, and continued the flight normally and landed safely. reply cameldrv 6 hours agoparentAs far as is publicly known, the failure has occurred three times, and has led to two crashes. It is possible to recover from if you know what you&#x27;re looking for and you act promptly. However, Boeing did not tell pilots what to look for.The pilots did not diagnose it as stab trim runaway because it&#x27;s not stab trim runaway. When MCAS is malfunctioning in this way, it engages nose down trim for 9.3 seconds, and then pauses for 5 seconds. A runaway trim is where you have a stuck trim microswitch or relay or some sort of short circuit. You&#x27;re expecting a continuous trim input. The confusing thing about MCAS is that it appears to resolve itself, but then waits 5 seconds and comes right back.By the way, the wheels going clack clack is a normal thing at that phase of flight. The 737 has something called Speed Trim and another thing called Mach Trim that automatically adjust the trim as the speed of the aircraft changes. In the initial climbout, this will be running constantly.Both the speed trim and mach trim systems are documented in the 737 manual and pilots are required to know how they work to get a type rating. The workings of MCAS were deleted from the manual before it was released because Boeing was concerned that the FAA would require more training on the system, which would cause Boeing to have to pay a contractual penalty to Southwest Airlines.edit:Also, Boeing&#x27;s own test pilots failed to respond promptly to this failure in the simulator: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aviationweek.com&#x2F;air-transport&#x2F;aircraft-propulsion&#x2F;b...It&#x27;s very easy as a pilot to say that you would do a better job and something like this would never happen to you.

MCAS failure exhibits as exactly this. The most likely cause of uncommanded movement is an electrical fault of some sort. Electrical faults are often intermittent. When you don&#x27;t know why an intermittent fault is happening, you turn it off. This is not rocket science. In the first LA crash, the crew restored normal trim 25 times. The uncommanded trim happened twenty five times. In what universe is this not runaway trim?From what I&#x27;ve seen the definition you&#x27;re using is one invented after the fact by parsing word meanings like a lawyer. If it&#x27;s your butt in the pilot&#x27;s seat, I recommend thinking like a pilot, not like a lawyer.From your link:\"in at least one simulator session, Boeing pilots took more than 10 sec. to react to a runaway stabilizer\"First off, they don&#x27;t seem confused about what a \"runaway\" is. Secondly, 10 seconds was plenty of time, as in both incidences the crew battled it for several minutes.\"Aerodynamic loads on the mis-trimmed aircraft made the trim wheel hard to turn\"The loads were too high because the pilots were at full throttle and ignored the overspeed warning horn.> It&#x27;s very easy as a pilot to say that you would do a better job and something like this would never happen to you.And in the first incident, that&#x27;s what the crew did.

Here&#x27;s the runaway stab trim checklist from 2018, before the accident [1].Right at the very top, it says:Condition: Uncommanded stabilizer trim movement occurs continuously.MCAS produces an intermittent fault, not a continuous one, therefore you are not supposed to run that checklist.There should be a checklist for MCAS failure, and the system and its failure modes should be explained, like every other system on a 737, but Boeing deliberately decided not to.To your point, yes, you&#x27;d better pay attention in training. But, in order for that training to be of any use, they can&#x27;t keep aircraft systems that can fail and kill you a secret from the pilots![1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b737.org.uk&#x2F;images&#x2F;runawaystab2013.jpgedit: Further to your point about the overspeed, the overspeed was not caused by the thrust levers being at full. The overspeed was caused by MCAS pushing the nose down and causing the plane to pick up speed. The pilots were trying to get the nose back up. The difficulty in moving the wheel comes from a combination of the airspeed and how far out of trim the plane is. Both of these problems were caused by MCAS putting in nose down trim. Yes, the pilots could have throttled back and bought themselves a little more time, but that is not the primary reason that they were unable to turn the trim wheel. reply jncfhnb 9 hours agoparentprevAs someone who did not follow this in great detail, I don’t anyone claiming it was not possible to diagnose, merely that the signals towards it were very poor and that training for things was bad, and that the crews that experienced crashes had fewer safety features than typical western crews or something like that.Your position here seems zany to me.

The director of the Smithsonian refused to believe them, and championed an alternate \"first powered flight\" for a long time. This is why at least one Wright flyer wound up in the Science Museum in London. It only got fixed after he died&#x2F;retired.The lack of history on display in the Air & Space Museum on this, is quite interesting: it&#x27;s like the whole \"tell the truth, the whole truth\" thing completely passed them by (Admittedly I was last there 15 years ago, it may be fixed now) reply cpitman 6 hours agorootparentAir and Space has been undergoing a massive renovation, and reopened the first half last year.

In older models, manually adjusting the trim using the thumb switch would generally interrupt and disable automatic trim adjustments, including those by the Speed Trim System, a predecessor to MCAS.In the original 737 MAX design, using the thumb switches to adjust the trim didn’t necessarily disable the MCAS, which could re-activate and adjust the trim again. This was a significant point of contention and contributed to difficulties pilots faced in maintaining control of the aircraft during the two fatal crashes. reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparentThe MCAS system could be overridden with the electric thumb switches, and both crews did just that.What they didn&#x27;t do is then turn it off. The stab trim cutoff switch turns it off. When the MCAS reactivated, then it was time to cut it off.The LA crew restored trim to normal with the thumb switches 25 times. reply totetsu 3 hours agoprevI didn&#x27;t read this (and i don&#x27;t plan to) but; I thought that the oldest of human history was recorded aurally in songs, ballads and epics, where the more dramatic things were the better they could be remembered.

It&#x27;s entertainment, and it&#x27;s written and dramaticized to get readers&#x2F;viewers and ad views. This is true on both sides of the political spectrum. Strong opinions engage viewers, often even if they don&#x27;t agree with them. Fox News or MSNBC don&#x27;t care if people are watching them because they love them or hate them, as long as they are watching. reply PaulDavisThe1st 12 hours agoparentprevFairly sure this is wrong, on both fronts.History is story telling about a period of time for which we do not have easy access to all the information, nor full access to the participants and their motivations and self-conceptions. In addition, even with the benefit of hindsight, it is common to be unable to identify conclusively which possible elements of the story are the most significant (and as a corollary, which are cotemporal but irrelevant). Consequently, there are different ways to tell the story, and no \"objective\" set of rules to decide which to choose. Like all human story telling, history must come with a point of view that is critical in framing the elements used in the telling.Now repeat everything I&#x27;ve just said, but substitute \"news\" for \"history\". reply lsmeducation 11 hours agorootparentI’ll do you you one better, replace everything with “bullshit”.History is susceptible to narratives because anything that isn’t clear cut (slavery, holocaust, etc) is open to subjective interpretation.It’s the conspiracy theorists that are the real wildcard in all of this. They will take the clear cut (slavery, holocaust) and make that open to subjective interpretation.Funny stuff. reply PaulDavisThe1st 11 hours agorootparentI tend to think of subjective interpretation as \"That was good\" or \"This is bad\".But there&#x27;s something required beforehand: definining what this or that is. It&#x27;s not really a subjective process, but it certainly isn&#x27;t objective either.Before you can decide whether or not William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of the British Isles was a good or a bad thing, you first need a description of how the invasion was carried out and \"all\" the consequences. But there is no \"objective\" or \"clear cut\" version of this. What do you include? What do you exclude? reply lsmeducation 11 hours agorootparentOh, I meant subjective in terms of your own perspective (informed by world view and life experiences). However you can fit the square pegs into your own round holes.Regardless, I suppose the bigger point I want to make is the truth for non clear cut things is only as true as the number of people that co-sign it. If there’s simply more people on one side, welp, that’s that. That’s the truth, as far as we know.Right or wrong or true or false are almost not even in the equation (enter the conspiracy theorist).I don’t know, based on what I just said, what do you believe?You see? reply chargingmarmot 6 hours agorootparentThis reminds me of how historians trying to find out about the historical Jesus have come up with some (objective?) criteria about what to accept as true.Examples:* Multiple attestation. Do we have multiple independent sources telling us the same thing?* Contextual credibility. Do people behave in a way that&#x27;s plausible given their setting (the languages they spoke, what they knew at the time).* Embarrassment.

It&#x27;s different groups of people focusing on different parts of the same events. Most of the time when you get two competing narratives for an event, neither are actually dishonest, they&#x27;re just a collection of events that tell a particular story that is of particular concern to a group. Usually the events all actually happened but their importance and relatedness are re-arranged. reply lsmeducation 10 hours agorootparentYou can spot the deliberateness when we go from the variable N to the other side saying !N, followed by !!N, and so on.I’d argue we’re well past the days of distinct alternative narratives around events. reply demondemidi 12 hours agoprev [5 more] [flagged] reckon3r 7 hours agoparentIsn&#x27;t \"ideological emotional-string pulling\" what the original historian was after by writing a story that fit the current popular narrative within academia?Wouldn&#x27;t holding one fraudulent historian accountable be withholding the credibility of historians, rather than &#x27;despise&#x27;ing them?Are you not the nihilist to be so pessimistic about the intentions of people who agree that the story was fabricated for popularity?Honest questions that I would be interested in hearing a response to. reply lsmeducation 11 hours agoparentprevI just hate everybody if you need an anecdote that HNers don’t hate historians in particular. reply iepathos 11 hours agoparentprevHistorians aren&#x27;t hated here, rather sensationalism at the expense of facts and logic are despised here.

The tool helps you comply with technical style guides like those by Microsoft and Google, and the out-of-the-box Vale rules (the extent of the Vale rules I am unsure; I got way more suggestions when installing the Microsoft and Google extensions).A few notes while getting it set up for macOS: 1. brew install vale 2. Create .vale.ini (in root dir, I think) 3. A minimal setup that lets you lint with Microsoft and Google style guides: MinAlertLevel = suggestion StylesPath = styles Packages = Google, Microsoft [*] BasedOnStyles = Vale, Google, Microsoft 4.

If I could wave my wand, I&#x27;d want a way to:* apply vale to just the doc I was working on* have a minimal set of rules* add to them over timeAt $curjob, we have a detailed public list of rules of doc ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FusionAuth&#x2F;fusionauth-site&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Do... ) and as our team expands, I&#x27;d love to have them be applied rigorously. vale seems like a good fit, but there&#x27;s an activation energy that I haven&#x27;t been able to get over yet.I am not aware of any other cli tools similar to this, though, so totally admire the team behind it. reply starkparker 10 hours agoparentIronically, perhaps, considering its popularity among technical writers, Vale&#x27;s documentation is ambiguous in places and difficult to navigate. reply MilStdJunkie 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s in keeping with traditional techpubs software being an unmitigated dumpster fire. :)Not Vale, though.

My impression from the window screenshot alone is you choose rule docs and a text doc, and it tells you what parts of the text doc violate parts of the rule docs .

Just the other day I&#x27;ve tried proselint for the first time, and became annoyed that I&#x27;d have to hack something together to only have it lint over the text in my markdown file. It doesn&#x27;t ignore code blocks, as it just supports text, as is not aware of any file format.Vale seems to do this out of the box, which is great, but the suggestion I get, while better than nothing, are still very rudimentary compared to Grammarly[1] (which I haven&#x27;t used for at least a year at this point).For example, I&#x27;ve enabled all styles. The alex and write-good ones gave actionable suggestions. Readability however had suggestions of the form \"Try to keep the Automated Readability Index (8.83) below 8.\", \"Try to keep the SMOG grade (11.35) below 10.\", \"Try to keep the Coleman–Liau Index grade (9.57) below 9\". If I knew what that was maybe I could improve my score. Is there another FLOSS tool that can turn those in actionable steps?[1] And LanguageTool, even if sometimes advertised by FLOSS folk as a Grammarly alternative, it really isn&#x27;t.

An instrument for taking note of my life and my journey on this pale blue dot. reply Swizec 11 hours agorootparentprev> I would think this would make your writing more \"boring“As a fellow iA Writer enthusiast – it makes your writing less boring because it nudges you to get rid of filler.for example: “Usually you can just remove some words that iA Writer suggests are filler and your sentence improves so much” —> “You can remove words that iA Writer suggests are filler and your sentence improves” reply starkparker 10 hours agoparentprevIf you use it for all general prose, Vale is terrible for those reasons. So is dogmatic adherence to any style guide.For docs, technical writing, and other formal content where you have multiple authors and consistency matters, Vale can be a fantastic tool to remind users of situations where rules help maintain standards without needing to dedicate time to editing. It can also be terrible, if it&#x27;s used to force awkwardness to satisfy rules arbitrarily, especially in something like CI (which is where I see Vale abused most often - never block a docs contribution on a prose style rule violation that has no functional effect on the content, just iterate on the language). reply jhbadger 14 hours agoparentprev(human) Copy editors have long been part of the professional writing field, though. It&#x27;s not like applying rules to writing is something new. Yes, \"genius\" writers can and do break the rules, but 99% of writers aren&#x27;t them. reply andrepd 13 hours agorootparentOne thing is a human editor with taste and understanding of the text. Another very different is a dumb LLM. reply trws 13 hours agoparentprevHaving used it myself, though maybe not the usual way, I have a feeling you might like it more with a bit of context. If you take a huge rule set, like Microsoft’s style for example, it can definitely have the effect you’re talking about. That’s what I love about vale though. It makes it very easy to build up rules for my own projects, import ones we care about, and not run anything else. I work on a number of API and programming language standards where specific “words of power” are used, and must be used, to have specific effects. Being able to write rules for common mistakes with these has helped me many times. Having one for weasel words I can run on my papers, or those of my graduate students, can save a good deal of time. It’s the flexibility to make it fit my needs&#x2F;wants on each thing that make it so useful. To the point about poetry, I haven’t tried it, but it wouldn’t shock me if you could make some rules useful to certain styles of rhyming or verse to help catch technical mistakes. reply kstrauser 14 hours agoparentprevI use(d) Grammarly to double-check my personal blog posts. A lot of its purely technical catches, like duplicating words, mismatching tenses, mismatching plurals, etc. are great. I usually ignore its style suggestions altogether, especially when I&#x27;m deliberately breaking a rule because the \"wrong\" text reads better. reply sidpatil 8 hours agoparentprevIt depends on what you&#x27;re trying to communicate and why. Controlled languages [1] have been around for a while — the goal is to simplify the semantics and syntax, in order to improve consistency and ease of use&#x2F;understanding.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Controlled_natural_language reply petesergeant 14 hours agoparentprevThis is for when three different people on your marketing team decide to come up with “opensource”, “open source”, and “open-source” respectively when writing whitepapers. reply CharlesW 13 hours agorootparentTo \"yes, and\" this, it gets even worse — employees often mess up their own company, technology, and people names.

That said I&#x27;d love the idea of a locally hosted https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hemingwayapp.com&#x2F; to help with keeping things short and simple ... this linter sadly isn&#x27;t it. reply jasonjmcghee 16 hours agoprevAs there&#x27;s a theme in comments here - I&#x27;m surprised people are so confused by the landing page. Between \"a linter for prose\" and the screenshot at the top of the page, I found it quite clear what the use case and point of the tool was.Personally interested where the confusion is- maybe unfamiliarity with \"linting\" or \"prose\"? reply dmarchand90 16 hours agoparentI think it&#x27;s the lack of examples. Also, because this is very cutting edge, I&#x27;d like to know a bit of the technology behind it to know the strengths and limits. E.g. is it based on hard Coded grammar and thus a bit stiff and dumb? Or is it llm based and therefore with data control issues?It would also be nice to see examples of what it can do. Again, if it&#x27;s hard Coded grammar it would be nice to see the complexity it can handle, if llm, the lengths the token limits can manage reply jonahx 15 hours agoparentprevI didn&#x27;t think it was bad but there were some points of confusion that could be improved:1. \"Your style, our editor\" Wait is this an editor or a command line tool? I was able to figure it out but the word \"editor\" is ambiguous here.2. \"that brings your editorial style guide to life.\" Ok, so do I have to write all my own rules? Or is it like eslint where I choose a base config with ability to override, and possibly add more? These questions are so fundamental I would like to see succint answers at least hinted at in another tag line or short paragraph, even if I can figure them out by digging into the docs. reply layer8 15 hours agoparentprevIt’s the lack of examples (I actually browsed the site for 2–3 minutes for some and didn’t find any), and that the screenshot doesn’t show the input prose text that the output applies to.Instead of the long list of integrations, more exposition and context would be helpful, or at least an immediate link to an introduction page providing that. In earlier times, software documentation would provide a whole introductory book chapter providing the context, use cases, and some examples.As a side note, regarding the screenshot, I’m wondering whether the tool also provides a rationale for each item, as the displayed text isn’t very informational on the why. reply alpaca128 12 hours agoparentprev> Personally interested where the confusion isThere is no clear explanation of what it actually is, just a vague sentence saying \"brings your editorial style guide to life\" which can mean a lot of things. And the screenshot is a wall of text in the smallest font size across the entire page (even smaller than the labels of the logos that make up 50% of the area), so if it was intended as carrier of important information it wasn&#x27;t the right choice.The HN post title says more in four words than the entire landing page. reply playingalong 15 hours agoparentprevThe name linter is not widespread in its use as some think. In some ecosystems it&#x27;s just called \"static analysis tools\" or something. I came to learn the tool \"linter\" after having exposure to a few tools of this kind, several years into the programming career. reply hhh 16 hours agoparentprevI found it clear when I looked at the site, but never thought about prose being used in this way. I didn&#x27;t know the actual definition though, and after googling it&#x27;s clear. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agoprev [–] I don&#x27;t really understand this, what is a linter for prose? Like Grammarly? Is it an end-user product or for a programmatic interface? If the former, why are there \"integrations?\" What does it mean to integrate this into Kong, for example? Does it work through VSCode?Edit: Ok, now I see, it is like an offline version of Grammarly for the editor of your choosing, as well as a lint tool for CI for your docs, like docs.konghq.com. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
