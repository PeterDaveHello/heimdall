This message was posted to our OpenCollective here. However, their page layout leaves a lot to be desired, with the post being very far down the page. So it is reproduced here for posterity. We have quite a budget collected over the last 5 years, and while we're really happy to see so many in the Jellyfin community contribute to us, we want to ask you to stop! No, really. We don't actually need your money. At least, not here and now. We have over $24,000 in the bank, and with average monthly expenses of only ~$600, that's over 40 months (3.3 years) of runway! So, we have plenty of money for the near future. Thus, at this time, we want you to seriously consider donating to the authors of Clients you use, instead of (or in addition to) the main project. Client support is the hardest part of the Jellyfin ecosystem to keep going, and most of them are maintained by only a single person or very small team. With the API changes in 10.9.0 and the upcoming 10.10.0 releases, they're going to be very busy trying to keep up, and thus could really use your support in a way that the core project here doesn't right now. So, if there's a client you use every day and that you love, consider finding it's author in our list of official clients, and sending them a little something instead (or too). No, this doesn't violate our policy of \"no paid development\", because donations are just that - donations. We will still not honour bug bounties or similar, and still not use our collective finance here for paid development. So don't feel like you're doing something wrong, you're not! I'll leave this notice up until we drop to ~1 year (12 months) of remaining runway, at which time we can re-evaluate where we're at. Happy watching! 5 1 SethBacon Offline Junior Member Posts: 34 Threads: 2 Joined: 2023 Nov Reputation: 2 Country: #2 2024-06-06, 08:12 PM Seriously someone send neils some cash for asprin at least.

Instead of asking to stop, they should do just what they suggest, without further ado - distribute the income to the ecosystem devs the way they see fit. Make it transparent, make application to these funds posssible, make feature bounties, write it besides the donation button. Once someone stops donating, it is unlikely they will put up the effort of continually researching on which client/dev to support. This would be much better handled by Jellyfin maintainers. reply barnabee 7 hours agoparentSpending it on other projects is a bad idea: - it'd be distracting, they're open source devs/maintainers not fund managers - it could be divisive and they'd risk taking flak if they get it \"wrong\" - it creates a class of \"approved\" clients and related projects I think the Jellyfin team's approach is pretty reasonable. That said, if I was them I'd probably do what the Helix devs do [0] and rather than telling people to stop donating, remind them that donations are a \"tip\" to the project and shouldn't be assumed to be buying you anything or paying to ramp up development (or marketing or anything else). I really appreciate that stance and their attitude that it's great to have the money and they'll spend it if and when they need it, while also encouraging people to consider donating elsewhere if they want to have a bigger impact. [0] https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2220 reply illegalmemory 7 hours agorootparent> it'd be distracting, they're open source devs/maintainers not fund managers Exactly this! It is extra responsibility which distracts from the core project. reply djbon2112 4 hours agorootparentprevExactly. This is something we've discussed internally a LOT and this is basically my take as to why not to distribute the money elsewhere, with the added #4 of \"people who donated to us, donated to us - is it really right to take their money and give it to other projects, even if we think it is?\". reply paledot 2 hours agorootparentYes. I'm not sure what a donation is for, if not for the recipient to spend as they see fit. And this isn't a matter of spending donor money on unrelated but deserving causes - as you say, supporting clients supports the ecosystem. I understand the argument that deciding who gets the money and how much is nontrivial and perhaps better left up to individual donors, but I disagree that it would be dishonest or misappropriating funds if you were to do so. reply holowoodman 6 hours agorootparentprevAnd spending on other projects might create tax problems for them, their donors and maybe the other projects... reply GTP 7 hours agoparentprevI instead like what they did: they were transparent about their finances and told their supporters that there are others that would benefit more from their support at this time. They were under no obligation of doing this, but it likely felt them like the right thing to do. reply rob74 7 hours agorootparentYeah, they could have done what e.g. the Wikimedia foundation does (find ways to spend the money and keep asking for more), but they didn't. Saying \"we're good, we have all the money we need for the time being\" is very refreshing... reply nullfrigid 4 hours agorootparent> the Wikimedia foundation does (find ways to spend the money and keep asking for more), I remember reading an article about that, how Jimmy Wales was driving super expensive sportscars around and such - it made me pretty much resolve to never donate to them. Ever. Not withstanding the super aggressive please for cash every September or whenever they do it. reply trogdor 4 hours agorootparent> I remember reading an article about that, how Jimmy Wales was driving super expensive sportscars around and such - it made me pretty much resolve to never donate to them. Ever. What is the connection between Jimmy Wales’ personal spending choices and your decision to never donate to the Wikimedia Foundation? As far as I can tell, Wales is not paid by the Wikimedia Foundation. reply sincerely 9 hours agoparentprevIf I donated to a specific project or organization, I would feel seriously deceived if they turned around and donated that money elsewhere. This is the correct move reply pjerem 7 hours agorootparentAnd even then, redistributing money will inherently make the organization have political issues. Choosing who \"deserves\" it is just hard work, takes time, needs an internal political alignment and strategy where the people working on this project are just doing it for fun on their free time. In fact their decision is pretty mature and nice : they have enough to support the project costs but they don’t want the project to become their job and that’s exactly what money flowing over a hobby does : changing it to a job. reply eitland 9 hours agorootparentprevMozilla is a prime example of this. I think many have donated to Mozilla thinking they were donating to Firefox only to later realize donations never reach Firefox. reply scosman 7 hours agorootparentprevThey could donate to their dependencies that need it? Still directly supporting the code running in the project. Balances out that people seem happier to donate to the UI/product layer than something like ffmpeg. Might be a bad example, but I’m sure some of their dependencies are underfunded. reply 3836293648 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's one thing if you donate to wikipedia and it ends up at some random wikimedia project you've never heard of and a completely different thing if you donate to Jellyfin and it ends up at Jellyfin Android. But as others have said, the hax office might not like it reply swores 3 hours agorootparentIt may be a bit different, but there's still plenty of potential for people to donate and not be happy that their donation is forwarded to a third party Jellyfin Android if they personally have no interest in the existence of Jellyfin Android. (I also agree with various other reasons in other people's comments, most of all that this lets donors vote with their money on which third party projects that work on top of Jellyfin get the money, rather than Jellyfin having to decide which ones deserve what proportion of spare money.) reply TZubiri 6 hours agorootparentprevIf I bought a cheeseburger, I would feel seriously deceived if they turned around and bought cheese from a diary provider and buns from a bakery and... reply bronson 5 hours agorootparentJellyfin of course spends the money on ingredients that go into the project: “if you do want to help us cover some operating expenses like our VPS hosting, domains, developer licenses, metadata API keys, and other incidental expenses, check out our OpenCollective page to donate.” https://jellyfin.org/contribute/ Why would anyone feel deceived? reply tgsovlerkhgsel 6 hours agorootparentprevEven if you donated to Jellyfin, and the money went to the developers of Jellyfin clients, which are listed everywhere as part of the project? reply bluGill 6 hours agorootparentI'd prefer to donate to the clients I use - there are many I wouldn't use (for whatever reason) and so donations to them do not help my goals. For that matter there are causes completely unrelated to jellyfin that I also support: knowing jellyfin has enough money frees to some money to donate to those other causes. There are more deserving projects in the world than there is money. If you don't want to manage who gets the money directly (this could be called micromanage!) then something like united way which redonates to projects that you haven't heard of is probably a good use of your money. (United way is controversial and they do not support open source but they are still a good use of your money if you want to do the most good with the least thought) reply cxr 5 hours agorootparentIf you're trying to make a donation to a project but want to be able to specify what they can(not) do with the money, then you're not really trying to make a donation. reply willcipriano 3 hours agorootparent\"Here are some groceries, bring them home to your children and don't trade them for drugs\" Is a donation even if the other party is upset about it. reply cxr 3 hours agorootparentThere's a whiff of a suggestion with this comment that makes it seem like the intent is to frame it as a contradiction of the comment it's a reply to, but it isn't. reply cr3ative 9 hours agoparentprevThat sounds like a lot of work which could lead to people complaining that their money didn’t go where they wanted it to go. This is simpler. reply jenscow 8 hours agorootparentAnd if they decide to split the donations equally, a few crappy clients would get made, just to get a slice of the pie. reply RealStickman_ 8 hours agorootparentAnd if they decided to only support official clients, plenty of other people would complain why their favourite third-party client didn't get anything. reply throwaway7ahgb 7 hours agorootparentIt's almost as if wealth distribution is not a easy thing , even on a simple OSS project. reply darkwater 5 hours agorootparentIt is not indeed. Also being a politician is not easy: you will be criticized by someone whatever you say or do. reply ygjb 5 hours agoparentprev> Instead of asking to stop, they should do just what they suggest, without further ado - distribute the income to the ecosystem devs the way they see fit Probably not. The amount of money they are taking in is very small, and if they start to ramp up revenue, then they actually need to start paying people for non-core work, like lawyers and accountants. Assuming that the money is received in Canada, by an Ontario registered non-profit, then it is really easy to do the accounting work for small dollar amounts (I ran several Manitoba and BC based non-profits previously for conferences and community work). If you start paying people who can't invoice you, then you need to sort out cross-jurisdictional payroll, and if you are making alot of purchases through other services. Comments like this are unhelpful because it assumes that the developer of the project has a desire to run a business (and non-profits are businesses) rather than building and shipping an open source tool that scratches an itch. It's cool to speculate on what could be, but if you think that is the right approach, fork it, run the business transparently, and allocate a portion of revenue to be held in reserve the moment the core team for the project you forked asks for it. reply KnobbleMcKnees 7 hours agoparentprev>Not happy about this post. Instead of asking to stop, they should do just what they suggest, without further ado - distribute the income to the ecosystem devs the way they see fit. Make it transparent, make application to these funds possible, make feature bounties, write it besides the donation button. Additional admin that will lead to more costs in a self-fulfilling cycle. This is a bad idea. People who are donating are already doing so with intent. Trying to gues where their money would be best placed is playing unnecessary financial games. They're a software developer, not a pension fund manager. >Once someone stops donating, it is unlikely they will put up the effort of continually researching on which client/dev to support. This would be much better handled by Jellyfin maintainers. They're already using the client just as they're using Jellyfin, how is this any more effort than what they've put into donating to Jellyfin directly? reply blowski 9 hours agoparentprevI agree, it would be nice to make it easy to donate, and then the donations are spread to others within the ecosystem. But perhaps they're worried about a ruckus when they choose to make a donation someone doesn't agree with, so they'd need to have a layer of bureaucracy that they don't want to manage. reply greatgib 8 hours agorootparentI don't think that it is the job of Jellyfish but it would be nice to have a foundation dedicated to do that for all projects. Especially in Europe where you can get a nice tax deduction but only if you do the donation to a well (and complexly) registered non profit reply blowski 8 hours agorootparentDon't we have that with Patreon, GitHub Sponsors? reply holowoodman 6 hours agorootparentNo. Tax deduction effectively excludes middlemen if they don't exclusively distribute to tax-deductible purposes. And at least in Germany, the hurdle is high, as is the risk of being retroactively declared non-deductible, after which you need to pay all the retroactive taxes, usually bankrupting your org and even the middle-men. reply its-summertime 6 hours agoparentprevFooting the legal costs of making sure that doing such complies with the open collective policies, the policies of the group OC is delegating management to, their prior statements, etc, would easily take up such a small amount, leaving nothing for no one. reply benhurmarcel 7 hours agoparentprevSo like Mozilla? Then you got people complaining that they can't donate just to the project they support instead of the others. reply sbergot 8 hours agoparentprevWhen you accept donations you have to be transparent about how it is going to be used. They cannot change their mind like that. reply swores 3 hours agorootparentThey can't do it retroactively for already received donations (not ethically at least, I don't think it would be illegal in this situation), but it wouldn't at all be a problem for them to announce \"donations from today on will be used in this new way\" instead of making the announcement they just made. (I personally think they made the right choice, am just responding to your comment disagreeing that it would be a transparency issue if they changed how things worked moving forwards.) reply rat9988 7 hours agoparentprevWhat you suggest is closer to fraud to me than the right thing to do. If I donate to a project, it's not for the maintainer to choose to to use the money for something else. reply hoten 9 hours agoparentprevThey should probably do both. Make an announcement like this, but add that beyond x years of runway the remaining donations will be funneled to the community projects. reply roenxi 6 hours agoparentprevIMO they should probably put their thinking hat on and try to find a way of spending more money. If the community says they want $20,000 spent on some project; then spend it. Buy some ads or something. In theory a project funded by donations is best run at around break even. This is a signal from their supporters that they should be spending more. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparent$20000 isn't a useful amount of money. If they are getting $20k/month they can think about hiring a developer to work full time on the project, but at their current donation levels they could hire a developer for maybe 3 weeks before they run dangerously low on money. Remember, Jellyfin is a fork of Emby which was a fork of Plex - both those projects were open source and then went paid. After being burnt twice like that I think it is understandable why many Jellyfin developers have had enough of that and will reject anything that even slightly could be seen as going paid. So while hiring someone might be possible and in the best interest of Jellyfin in a different world, they cannot do that in this world without losing support. reply jck 3 hours agorootparentEmby was not a fork. Plex server has never been open source. reply _heimdall 6 hours agorootparentprevThat is assuming people are donating money to change the project rather than support the project as it already is. The money doesn't have to be spent just because it's there. Personally I'd be a little annoyed if I donted to a project and the only change they made was to burn the cash on advertising that they otherwise didn't do. reply calibas 4 hours agoparentprevHow do you know he's not already donating the extra? If I was running a popular open-source project, I wouldn't make it public that I've got extra money that I'm giving away. That comes with all sort of complications... reply amelius 8 hours agoparentprev> distribute the income to the ecosystem devs the way they see fit Except the IRS may step in and spoil the idea ... reply sokoloff 8 hours agorootparentIf Jellyfin operated as a 501c3 charity, the IRS would have standing to ensure that funds were used in accordance with those requirements. I couldn’t find evidence that they do. If you donate money to me (not a 501c3) because you like something I do and want me to keep doing it, I can do anything (legal) with that money without IRS comment. (However, your donation to me is not deductible to you.) reply vetinari 7 hours agorootparentBut then you have to tax the donation as your income; after that, you can redistribute and the receiving party has to tax it again... that's what charities are shielded against. By donating directly, there's one income tax layer removed. reply sokoloff 6 hours agorootparentIf it's able to be treated as a gift, it is not taxable to the recipient. I an not a tax professional, but I would expect most of what people call \"donations\" to Jellyfin would be considered gifts by the tax court. reply Gormo 7 hours agorootparentprevBut if Jellyfin isn't a registered 501(c) charity, then the point is moot. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentThere are many different options to register jellyfin in the US, and many other options to register in other countries. Each as their own set of rules. If Jellyfin isn't registered in any way then the law gets even more complex (if you are registered anywhere other countries will generally recognize that and accept the laws of where you registered apply, but if not registered nobody knows but the lawyers can spend millions fighting it out) reply venson 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you think Jellyfin would operates out of the US? I would say the majority of core devs isn't even located on the American continent. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentI'm not clear what exactly you mean. However every country has their own equivalent of the IRS with their own rules. I'm not going to look up the legal structure of Jellyfin (boring...), but whatever it is there are legal rules as to what they can do with any money they get. reply satyrnein 4 hours agoparentprevGreat example of how taking people's money leads to new expectations! reply Chris2048 7 hours agoparentprev> distribute the income to the ecosystem devs the way they see fit It sounds like they have a general policy of \"no paid dev\". Further, it's possible that part of the motivation is the belief that if they did have it, it might lead to negative consequences (fewer contributions from non paid devs, squabbles over compensation, generally having to manage payouts etc) reply eYrKEC2 4 hours agoparentprevHis contrarian post got to front page of Hacker news. I think he won. His message to redirect funds to sub-maintainers is being heard. reply rtpg 9 hours agoparentprevI mean they say in the post that you should donate to clients right? reply TZubiri 6 hours agoparentprevmoney and foss greybeards don't mix. reply newsclues 9 hours agoparentprevLove jellyfin but don’t understand some of their choices like abandoning Reddit for a forum with no traffic reply specproc 6 hours agorootparentA dedicated forum, open to read without login, and controlled by the project. They have easy access to all their data, decision-making power on features to support, and it's their call whether or not to allow advertising (they don't) or AI training of their data. Seems like a perfectly good place for it to me. reply geerlingguy 6 hours agorootparentWe definitely need more forums. And with Discourse being a huge improvement over BB and other forum software from the 90s, it's not hard to set up multiple forum accounts and even tie them to some other login if you want. reply iamacyborg 6 hours agorootparentprevReddit isn’t conducive to many types of conversations due to the voting mechanism for posts and comments. reply Chris2048 7 hours agorootparentprevI understand abandoning reddit in any situation reply venson 4 hours agorootparentprevThe forum has 10000 users and averages around 30-40 posts a day ... i would not say thats \"no traffic\" reply yard2010 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy would they want to use Reddit? reply worble 9 hours agoprevI recently started using Jellyfin for friday movie nights with me and a few friends who no longer live near each other. The sync feature on the web UI works surprisingly well, we hang out on VC and it's as close to watching something physically together it can be. Overall I've found it to be really solid, although I've not really dabbled much with other media center software to compare it to. My only real complaint is that for whatever reason it really does not like my folder structure - most of my files work but it'll randomly decide that a bunch of episodes in a folder are a single \"file\" with multiple \"versions\". Reading their docs it seems like they really want you to conform to a specific folder structure, but not only would this take me forever (I've been growing this collection for 15+ years now!), I just don't want to change it; I'm happy with my folder layout and it makes sense to me, it's really surprising that Jellyfin can't just show me the raw files. reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agoparentI suppose you could change the structure rather fast with a few well-placed batch operations in a shell, though I also understand why you wouldn't want it. Regarding the randomly merged episodes, perhaps the culprit isn't the folder structure or file name patterns, but metadata on the files themselves? I never had this particular situation, but I wasted my fair share of life dealing with assumptions music players make about ID3 tags, and how they're routinely broken by files sourced from random places on the Internet. reply theshrike79 5 hours agorootparent> I wasted my fair share of life dealing with assumptions music players make about ID3 tags, and how they're routinely broken by files sourced from random places on the Internet. Musicbrainz Picard is a life-saver. I don't add any audio to my collection without putting it through Picard first. reply Retr0id 8 hours agoparentprevI haven't tried implementing it, but my idea is to write a script that automatically creates a \"correctly\" organized directory tree, populated with symlinks to the arbitrarily-located real files. reply ThatMedicIsASpy 6 hours agoparentprevManage your stuff with tinymediamanager. It will auto rename files folders, download nfos thumbnails, covers. TV shows just need s01e01 Then import the folders and dont allow jellyfin to fetch online data. reply theshrike79 5 hours agorootparentThe *arr stack can be used to rename files in a sane way A good tip is to include the imdb or tmdb ID in the file name for movies and in the directory for TV/Anime, it'll make things unambiguous reply LelouBil 4 hours agoparentprev> The sync feature on the web UI works surprisingly well. Hmm ? I've been having issues with SyncPlay since forever. Media stuck for some people, stuck at loading. Playing until some point, then freezing. Basically whenever I'm doing something with SyncPlay it's \"press play and if it does actually start never press pause\" But that's literally my only issue with Jellyfin, I've been using it for the past year and it's awesome. reply xbmcuser 7 hours agoparentprevI used to have similar problem till I started using hardlinks because of arr apps now I have pretty looking file and folder structure for jellyfin. reply crtasm 8 hours agoparentprevTry dashboard > libraries > display > Display a folder view to show plain media folders reply reddalo 6 hours agorootparentThis is interesting, I feel like Plex doesn't have such a feature reply bcraven 6 hours agorootparentTV Shows > TV Shows [dropdown, top left] > Folders It's very poorly laid out in a list, but I have found it useful before. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agoparentprevWhat is VC? reply shubb 9 hours agorootparentInternet slang for voice chat reply bovermyer 8 hours agorootparentOtherwise known as an acronym. reply rickcecil 8 hours agorootparentTo be perfectly pedantic, it’s an initialization. Acronyms are initializations that can be pronounced as words. reply dillydogg 8 hours agorootparentTo add to the pedantry, I believe the correct word is initialism. reply albert_e 7 hours agorootparentTherefore the pendatry was not \"perfect\" as it was claimed above. One might even argue that it is impossible to be \"perfectly pedantic\". reply layer8 7 hours agorootparentOtherwise known as an oxymoron. reply NicoJuicy 8 hours agoparentprevDo you have a separate library for movies and tv shows? reply worble 8 hours agorootparentYes, I've tried separating them out, I've tried putting them all together, I even tried putting it as a photo library because apparently that was supposed to be closer to a raw folder layout, but the issue still persisted. I think there's a kind of disconnect between the kind of users that use these media libraries - a lot of people seem to really value the metadata aspect of it, how it collects all the info the IMDB or whatever and tries to sort and match stuff. And then there's people like me who just want a server that can handle any file I throw at it and play it over the internet, I'm not too fussed about the other aspects. Part of me thinks that maybe I'm using the wrong tool for the job, but Jellyfin does otherwise work really well for what I want, folder gripes aside. reply doix 7 hours agorootparent> And then there's people like me who just want a server that can handle any file I throw at it and play it over the internet I just use nginx (with directory listing enabled), let's encrypt and HTTP basic auth. That basically gives you what you're asking for. But it won't do the fancy web sync so that you can watch it with your friends. reply tracker1 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's part of why I now have multiple Shield TV boxes in my home, mostly using Kodi over SMB/CIFS shares to my NAS. It's not as friendly for outside the home, but it's nice internally. I've been thinking I'd like to expand to start capturing the YouTube channels I watch most and dump into series directories for them. I've gotten tired of trying to work around what YouTube seems fit to shove in my direction. I really wish there was a \"don't show me content from this channel\" option, as if you click on any bait, you keep getting that channel for weeks after under suggestions. reply c-hendricks 1 hour agorootparent> I really wish there was a \"don't show me content from this channel\" option In a browser, tap the 3 dots on any video and \"don't recommend channel\" is right there. reply Sakos 8 hours agoparentprevJellyfin doesn't even work quite right if you try to follow their documentation to the letter in how to structure and name your directories. I hope they improve that aspect, because it can be time consuming and irritating to fix when it doesn't work right. It largely works though. reply Hamuko 8 hours agorootparentDoes Jellyfin allow using external metadata agents and scanners like Plex? I basically couldn't use Plex at all if I didn't have HAMA and ASS installed for scanning anime files. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentYes, you set Jellyfin to use local .NFO or .INFO files .. these can be created by third party agents ( eg: ember https://github.com/DanCooper/Ember-MM-Newscraper , etc ) Jellyfin will alter those to add paths to media it downloads and perhaps overwrite curated descriptions with those from theTVDB, IMDB, theMovieDB, etc. YMMV test in isolation to be sure, etc. reply Hamuko 8 hours agorootparentThat's not really the same thing though. With Plex, you can customise the code it runs to scan the filenames and you don't need to create any additional files. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentThere are multiple approaches to curating metadata. Maintaining .nfo mastersbackups is handy when migrating between media managers or finetuning descriptions not in line with online data DB's. reply Sakos 8 hours agorootparentprevIt has plugins for other metadata providers like anidb, anilist and anisearch. I've had no issues identifying all the anime I have. reply Hamuko 8 hours agorootparentSo if you give it \"[GroupName] Name of the Series - Electric Boogaloo - 03 (1080p).mkv\", it understands that it's season one, episode one of a show called \"Name of the Series - Electric Boogaloo\"? Because Plex in its default state would rather you using the Name.of.the.Series.Electric.Boogaloo.S01E03 formatting, which would entail renaming basically everything. That's why having ASS as the scanner to avoid renaming is essential for me. reply Sakos 7 hours agorootparentI'm not certain about that specific example. I think it should work if it's, say, a single season show. Otherwise if you put it under Show\\Season 1\\, I think it should work too. I have a range of different naming schemes and Jellyfin is able to recognize all of them. I've only had to put in manual effort for extras like interviews and trailers, which can be put in an \"extras\" folder in a show/movie directory next to the actual video file(s). reply InsomniacL 9 hours agoprevSome very-well-requested features/clients have gotten no traction at all, with no one coming in willing to start/help developing them. We've had to abandon some (like Chromecast for a while, though it's getting new life in the last few weeks) because of this. We're aware that probably the biggest complaints about Jellyfin are about the lack of client support, and the rough edges/lack of polish. We do hear you. We do want this to improve this just as much as you do. But we need people to help us do so. We need more volunteers who can help make the code better, write new code, document, and generally improve things. We need your help to push past what I call the Development Bystander Problem, get some new blood into the project, and especially, help to make it better! https://jellyfin.org/posts/a-call-for-developers/ It's noble to want to be a 100% volunteer force but it's frustrating that they know they have issues and a big pot of money but won't solve them. Even without paying for development, money could be spent to improve the developer experience and attract new devs. They have acknowledged client development is an issue in the OP and the link above. Could they not support client devs with hardware, licences, costs, etc... reply 3np 1 hour agoparentWhy should distributing surplus funds fall on them, though? That's work, and it's not fun. Setting up a wider Jellyfin-ecosystem-donation-fund (or your favorite FLOSS project) is something anyone can do. Maybe someone reading this comment will get the motivation to step up? (And no, we don't need another platform, just plain honest human volunteering) reply cqqxo4zV46cp 7 hours agoparentprevYeah. I didn’t know this before, and I’m now beginning to see why Jellyfin never comes close to satisfying me whenever I use it, when compared to Plex. What they’re trying to do is really hard. As much great work as they’re putting into it, they’re really treading water with what they’re currently able to muster with people that are willing to volunteer their time. There’s obviously a lot of people that want to put money toward the effort. reply IshKebab 7 hours agoparentprevI don't understand why they even care about not paying for development. Is paying for development somehow immoral? Of course not! reply wccrawford 7 hours agorootparentNot immoral, but it's a huge HR headache. Once people get paid, you have to deal with what people are worth. And everyone thinks everyone (including themselves) is worth different amounts. Coming to a consensus about that is a huge hassle, and will still end up with hurt feelings. Bad moral is bad for code. If you have enough money, you can swallow that pill and push through. If you don't, it will make things worse. They have enough money for what they do, but they haven't got nearly enough income (donations) to pay everyone market wages. reply InsomniacL 5 hours agorootparentI find it hard to believe receiving nothing is better for moral than receiving something. They acknowledge they have issues they can't fix due to a manpower shortage, they also acknowledge they have more money than they can spend. Paying market wage may not be realistic, but supporting or donating something to developers who support them would go a long way to attracting additional volunteers. reply wccrawford 1 hour agorootparentSome people might be receptive to getting $100 for something they spent dozens of hours on, but then others will wonder why they didn't also get $100 for their dozens of hours recently. Others will look at that and calculate how far under minimum wage it was, and start to question if it's worth their time after all. You end up with bad feelings on every side unless you pay market wages, and even then you end up with people questioning if they just took on another full-time job, instead of a hobby. It's really, really hard to add money to the equation and not make things worse. reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure I agree. I mean, a silicon valley developer getting paid $200k/year might fix a bug in some open source software for free because it was bothering him and he wanted to give something back to the project. But if I offer that same developer $100 to bail on date night with his wife to fix a bug for me? That's not an offer I'd expect him to take me up on. reply swores 3 hours agorootparentI broadly agree with your point - that in many situations people feel happier and more willing to donate their time than to be paid but paid less than they feel their time is worth commercially. But you made the point badly, confusing things by adding in the date night - so that instead of comparing \"fix bug for free\" vs \"fix bug and be paid, but much less than their usual hourly rate\", you instead compared \"fix bug for free at a time that suits them\" vs \"fix bug at an inconvenient time and get paid less than their usual hourly rate\". I can't actually work out why you bothered to bring bailing on a date night into it at all... reply michaelt 37 minutes agorootparentI mention that merely to illustrate that our hypothetical $200k developer has good things he could be doing with his limited discretionary time. The time spent fixing a bug for $100 doesn't get magicked out of nowhere - that's time that could be spent meeting friends, doing sports, spending time with family, reading books, creating art, enjoying good food and wine, learning new things, or even sleeping! For a similar concept expressed in a wordier way, read about Maslow's hierarchy of needs [1]. Our hypothetical developer's physiological and safety needs are fully met - and their unmet needs won't be much helped by $100. I avoided this and chose the wording I did because some of Maslow's wording like \"self-actualization\" and \"transcendence\" kinda invites confusion IMHO. Far less confusing and questionable, I thought, to merely argue that sex is more fun than software development. But apparently not... [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs reply n3m4c 6 hours agorootparentprevCould they go the tinygrad route and post bounties like \"$1000 for fixing this major bug\" reply ori_b 6 hours agorootparentThat's not nearly enough to sustain a competent developer, but it is enough to make a project feel like work to a hobbyist. reply wccrawford 1 hour agorootparentprevIf they really have something that can't be done by their current developers, rather than just something they don't have time for yet, that might work. But it'd be a lot more than $1000 bounty, and they'd still need people to maintain it. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevThey're the FOSS entrant in the category dominated by Plex, which has a history of monetization strategies that upset the community. Jellyfin probably wants to stay completely clear of even the appearance of being a paid project because the main reason someone would choose them over Plex is to get away from the influence of monetary incentives. reply djbon2112 4 hours agorootparentThis is exactly why. When I (and the other original folks) decided to fork Emby to make Jellyfin, we had seen exactly what trajectory other projects in this space had been taking: 1. Start off small and FLOSS. 2. Attract a userbase. 3. Start requesting more and more money. 4. Start \"paying full-time developers\" or similar. 5. Add nagscreens, premium features, and the like to \"increase revenue\". 6. Go proprietary. My extremely hardline stance on this has been to nip this trend in the bud right at steps 3 and 4 by taking ALL money out of the development process. What we use donations for is a very small list, as mentioned on the OpenCollective page: 1. Paying for Infrastructure. Domains, VPSes, etc. 2. Each team member (contributors who are distinguished and invited into the org) gets a single one-time $300 USD credit for buying a client device to help them work on the project. And that's it. This is why I made this post, to basically say - in many more words - \"hey, we have enough runway for a few years. Donate to individual people or other projects instead\". reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentprevThey make a 'free software media solution that puts you in control and respects your privacy' and if they're not naive, they probably suspect a decent portion of their users are playing pirated movies. So from a certain perspective, saying \"no-one gets paid\" is more consistent than saying \"us developers get paid, those anime studios don't\". For another thing, if you pay for the upfront development of software, it still needs ongoing support. And that support commitment comes with a funding commitment; you don't just pay $x0,000 for an eastern european developer to spend a year adding smart TV support - to keep the developer around and the feature working, you've now got to raise that money every year, forever. reply eadmund 1 hour agoprevI’m a happy user of Jellyfin, and I’d like to amplify what others have said about $24,000 or 40 months’ expenses being not nearly enough. At a conservative safe withdrawal rate, $24,000 of capital is only $60/month — in other words, a tenth of what the project needs to cover its monthly expenses. If the project wants to be self-sufficient, they thus need ten times as much money. Then they can invest it, and cover expenses with the income from their investments. If the project doesn’t want to be self-sufficient, that’s something else. Maybe they would prefer to think it will better align incentives for their users to keep them hungry? Personally, though, I think that self-sufficiency should be everyone’s goal. reply domh 8 hours agoprevThis is my first time hearing about Jellyfin, and wow what a breath of fresh air compared to the typical hyper growth model employed by a lot of OSS projects. Any Jellyfin users here that can vouch for it? I currently have a SMB share on a Raspberry Pi 4 and I connect to that on my Amazon Fire Stick using the VLC SMB features. It works ok but the VLC UI leaves much to be desired. Would Jellyfin be better for this? Is there a client that works on the Fire TV stick? (This one I think? https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv) reply swed420 5 hours agoparentI've been using Jellyfin since the beginning and it's been a total joy to use. Even though I trust the project now, in the beginning when I was migrating off of Plex I had both running simultaneously in separate VMs referencing the same read-only library. This dual config worked great, though I didn't use Plex much at all after Jellyfin quickly proved itself even in the early days of its development. The diverse client support is awesome. In addition to streaming video content to various house devices, my favorite is my \"jukebox\" music listening setup consisting of a RPi 3B+ with ALLO Piano 2.1 DAC hat feeding separate speaker and subwoofer amps with desired crossover frequency. Running on the Pi is Mopidy with the Mopidy-Jellyfin extension to access Jellyfin's libraries along with the Mopidy-mowecl extension which provides a slick web front end for the DAC (you can also queue music from the Jellyfin GUI and \"play to\" the DAC). Highly configurable and fun to tinker with. For example, I have a USB numberpad keyboard plugged into the Pi with assigned hotkeys by way of the triggerhappy service. I love being able to keep the music playing if my desktop workstation is off or rebooting. https://github.com/jellyfin/mopidy-jellyfin https://github.com/sapristi/mopidy-mowecl The best thing is it's all FLOSS, so I don't have to worry about the rug being pulled out from under me! reply dscottboggs 8 hours agoparentprev> Any Jellyfin users here that can vouch for it?

Kodi also cannot handle this on that device reply vundercind 5 hours agoparentprevI use it with a weak x86 server (used workstation off EBay) and stronger clients (Apple TV, iOS devices, browser on strong laptops) so I don’t need transcoding, since my server can’t manage real-time transcoding. Works great with that set-up, crazily better than XMBM/Kodi ever was in a dozen or so attempts, and people who aren’t me can pick it up and confidently use it, without immediately getting stuck in some weird UI mode and giving up forever, which is what Kodi always led to. [edit] I use the download links in the browser UI and then VLC playback on an iPad for kids’ movies on long road trips. It even (with an assist from VLC) fills that use case. reply pmx 8 hours agoparentprevI switched from Plex to JF after being a plex user from the very beginning. It's not as polished as plex but it has none of the bloat and works flawlessly for me. It's super easy to manage my libraries and the meta scanners work 95% of the time, very rarely needing me to manually tweak data or images for media. Jellyfin android works fine on firetv. The only thing you might struggle with if you run the server on a pi is transcoding, especially if you have 4k media files. reply eythian 5 hours agoparentprevI've been using Jellyfin for several months now, for me it works nicely. I did a bit of tuning over time (e.g. \"OK, now I'll spend a bit of time improving how subtitles work\"), and after learning how to set that aspect up, it just trucks along working. I have a handful of friends using my setup too and haven't had complaints. Beware though that if any transcoding is needed, the RPi probably won't be up to it. Instead I shelled out a little bit for a small Intel NUC thing that can do hardware conversion. reply ryandrake 4 hours agoparentprevI've been using XBMC (now Kodi) clients + a single NFS file server for 16 years, now installed on three media PCs throughout my house.

Jellyfin integrates really well with other services like Radarr, Sonarr, and Jellyseer so you can request media, have it downloaded, indexed, and available automatically.

Sometimes it just won't find subtitles, or metadata and it's highly annoying to fix it. The TV app is a bit rough sometimes. The android app feels very barebones. The HDR tone mapping is either horrible or non-existent (can't remember which, but I could never play proper HDR). So yeah, there are a lot of rough edges, but I think this is the best on offer if you want a true self-hosted media library that mostly works out of the box across various platforms. reply Larrikin 9 hours agoprevI hope the project succeeds and think this is a good move.

I too have a Plex lifetime pass and it has been rock solid, my library lives in network mounted NAS drive, formatted with filebot. I've unpinned the default views that it comes with when you install the client and pinned just my libraries. It just works on all devices, absolutely no issues, no memory leaks, the UI is beautiful and Netflix like, which is important for my family. The central account is what makes claiming the server and sharing the library with others and the overall remote login experience very easy, this is what enables plex.tv/link functionality.

One feature I quite enjoy is syncing watch status between servers. So if one has multiple servers they use (multiple they control or friend’s servers) their watch status can be synced. In my case I have a travel/portable Plex server and my main Plex server so it’s nice to have my watch state kept in sync. And there are more features from having a central account, this is just one of them to disprove that linking is the only reason you need an account or that it’s the only feature of having an account. reply kortilla 8 hours agorootparentprevIt does match your experience, you just explained their justification. There is no reason to require a central account. Linking discovery, etc is completely possible without it. Even if they did have the account, the unforgivable part is that you cannot use the mobile app for your family and have people have different profiles because the plex pass is tied to a profile. That’s a sleazy cash grab that drove me off of plex. reply jorvi 7 hours agorootparentUnless they changed it, having Plex Pass on the account that manages the server “blesses” that server, unlocking all Plex Pass features for everyone using that particular server. reply alt227 5 hours agorootparentThey have changed it. An example of this is sunsetting Plex Sync and replacing it with Plex Downloads. At the time they used the whole 'Sync never worked right' argument to justify why they got rid of it. In reality, Plex sync used to allow any user to download videos from any server where the server owner had plex pass. Now with downlods, the user must have Plex Pass to download anything. https://support.plex.tv/articles/downloads-sync-faq/ There are other examples where they have done this as well. reply arsome 8 hours agorootparentprevI used to feel the same way about Plex til they started flooding my less savvy family with ads for their own content and useless features unrelated to what they want to do. Really not impressed by that one. I realized how bad it was when I got a call about a broken movie I didn't even have. Plex still seems slicker than Jellyfin in some ways but after that experience I'd certainly consider a switch. Offline is the only reason I still use plex, but their offline setup is pretty buggy too. reply walthamstow 8 hours agorootparentprevPlex is great.

To say that you actually like Plex is some sort of great offence that attracts at least a few replies telling you that you’re wrong. I’m so incredibly confident that there’s a large contingent of people that wouldn’t care an iota that Plex phones home, if not for the fact that they’re so deep into the Plex Hate scene that they’ve learned to be up in arms about it.

I think it attracts the same sort of ‘power user’. reply karolist 6 hours agorootparentYou might be onto something. I think it's to do with the fact that self hosting attracts a certain crowd, and when you have a product that is popular to self host, but is not open source and with some paywalled features, it irritates them deeply.

But from the other comments in this thread I get the impression that even that tricky process is no longer an option. reply close04 9 hours agorootparentprevI think this is the worst part of Plex, it's self hosted but not really. Still depends on the company's continued existence. If the company goes bust my solution will probably just stop working. It took some time to set it up properly so the bloat is thoroughly swept under the rug, never in sight. This gives me a more than decent experience and the interface/UX is spot on for me. The best of Jellyfin is that it's truly self hosted. But no matter how much set up I do, the experience is still never too good. I don't really like the UI/UX but I could get used to it. My biggest issue is how it handles the folder structure and metadata for series. They will always have to be neatly organized in folders to be properly picked up. You can't throw an episode file here, an episode in a folder there, the rest of the season in another folder and so on. They're just seen as independent material, no metadata. This makes the watching experience very stunted. reply perryizgr8 7 hours agorootparentprev> I need a plex.com account to use my own self hosted instance? And anybody could log into their plex account on my instance! The way they handle accounts for self-hosted instances is either deliberately convoluted or ineptly designed. reply nolok 9 hours agoparentprevDo you have any specific exemples ? reply yegle 9 hours agorootparentI can give a couple examples: 1) Jellyfin supports reading NFO files to help determining matching the file with the correct metadata (https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/metadata/nfo/). This is arguably superior than Plex's way (you have to name your file with IMDb id or tmdb id https://support.plex.tv/articles/201018497-fix-match-match/#...), but I still constantly find media w/o metadata in Jellyfin. 2) The way you fix the matching in Jellyfin has a pretty terrible UX. You select the movie w/o metadata (there's no filter to \"find all media that Jellyfin fail to match w/ metadata) and click \"Identify\" in the 3-dot menu, then fill in the information and search (why can't Jellyfin prefill useful metadata, at the very minimum the year that should be easily identified using regex?), then pick either IMDb or tmdb (why do I have to choose one of them? Can I bulk-switch my library to use IMDb instead of tmdb?), with a checkbox to confirm you want to \"replace existing images\" (why do I have any images to replace? Jellyfin did not match the media to any metadata right?) you now have some useful metadata. 3) When I need to force a rescan of a library, there's no way (that I can find) to do that when you are viewing the library. The only way to do this is to go to Settings -> Dashboard -> Scan All Libraries. 4) There's no offline media playback support (AFAIKT). reply nolok 9 hours agorootparent1 - I'm not sure what you mean. Jellyfin can use the NFO, and if not will do a normal search and match. 2 - I agree that Find all without set metadata in a library would be nice. However when identifying you don't need to chose one or the other, you just type whatever info you have (the name, or the year, or both, or ...) and search and it search in all providers it has a plugin for (so in your case, both imdb and tmdb) and show all results from both. The do you want to replace image is because it's very common to switch to another provider for obscure series for exemple, but want to keep you hand replaced image. It doesn't really apply to \"blockbuster\" series or movies, so I guess it could be nice to have a default you can set. 3 - It separates the admin part and the viewing part, I think it's good. If you're solo user it can feel bothersome, but for me it's a better thing. 4 - You can download the files for later viewing offline. Overall the only one I agree with is the figure out which movie or serie you didn't identify and let me fix that in bulk, that process could be improved, but it's also a one time thing at first setup. reply yegle 9 hours agorootparent1) I do generate NFO for all my media and Jellyfin should have enough information to match the metadata, yet it fail to match constantly. 2) When I try to identify the media, I would expect Jellyfin to pre-fill the form with the name, year etc, basically anything it can find, either from parsing the filename or the NFO. But Jellyfin did nothing here to make it easier. 4) Oh I just found this functionality in the Android client! But this is over simplified, for TV shows it doesn't support \"download the next N unwatched episodes\". I also tried to download a movie just now and I got a notification \"download unsuccessful\" w/o more insight to debug the issue (although to be fair Plex is not better in giving a reason why download failed). And I don't see in the UI to manage all downloaded media (maybe because I haven't had a successful download?). reply nolok 8 hours agorootparentFor 1) I use folder and file naming myself rather than NFO so I can't help you more, but if it fails on such a large scale you should submit a bug with an example as it's obviously not normal behavior. 2) I understand what you mean,but I would disagree, usually it would get in the way for me (whatever it identified or thought it did was wrong). 4) The log will be on the server, admin, logs. There won't be a manage my upload though, it's a client thing and the current client does consider that outside of its scope. Personnaly when needed it's download then use Vlc when I want to watch. reply ThatMedicIsASpy 6 hours agorootparentprevI have 20tb+ of movies, tv shows, anime, documentations I do not allow jellyfin to scrape online.

Jellyfin could be better here, but there's almost no friction in entering the title, hitting enter, selecting the right movie and then completing it.

Does Jellyfin work well on this platform? reply vundercind 5 hours agorootparentJellyfin works well except that if you’re not transcoding, you’ll need Infuse for (IIRC?) a couple not-ubiquitous-but-not-rare audio codecs that Apple TV doesn’t natively support. I use Infuse with Jellyfin. My server’s way too weak for reliable transcoding, plus not using it avoids a large proportion of bugs in the Jellyfin issues tracker at any given time. reply bronson 5 hours agorootparentprevUsing the Jellyfin webui on AppleTV without even installing an app works decent.

I can understand when one needs some media to play on different devices at the same time, also remotely, but for individual use I found a kodi box near my TV and configured to navigate NFS/SMB directories and filenames on my NAS, to be so immediate that I can't imagine doing things differently. Also, by streaming from box A (NAS) to box B (PC) it would probably need a lot more computing power from the usually smaller and less powerful hardware, and it would also move a lot more data on the home network because the video is transcoded by the weaker hardware and before being transmitted. ...Unless streaming in this context means a completely different thing and therefore I'm wrong. reply hencoappel 5 hours agoparentI mainly use Plex, but the key benefits are that it remembers what you've watched, allows for multiple accounts, allows for easily continuation of a film or series without having to remember what time/episode you were on. Also allows for easy remote viewing. reply squarefoot 4 hours agorootparentKodi does all of this, except remote viewing that possibly could be done through external addons, but I'm not sure about that. Some features like remembering what you were watching requires it not to be turned off. Sleep is fine however, and on my mini PC it goes to sleep when it detects I turned off the TV via HDMI/CEC connection. When you wake it up you'll be in the same place and it remembers also the time watched, while if you turned it off you have to navigate back to the place you were watching, but it still keeps the time of that file and any other one, prompting you to continue from when you left or start over. Watched files and time are saved as part of the backup that can be scheduled to run automatically in the background, so one can upgrade it, then restore the backup to get back every change to the interface, addons, configuration, etc. It also runs on phones, and I installed it also on my Pixel with GrapheneOS along with some addons, but the interface is really hard to operate there. reply scheeseman486 4 hours agorootparentI am sure about Kodi not being able to perform remote viewing with the same compatibility and convenience as any of the popular dedicated media streaming platforms. I get that you like Kodi, but listen to yourself. Kodi does all of this! Except you might need a plugin that doesn't exist for the one big feature that spurred the existence and popularity of Plex, except that some features work but not reliably, except that you need to actively manage the backend, except that the phone UI sucks. So, there's your answer? reply scheeseman486 5 hours agoparentprevSoftware like Jellyfin and Plex allow for streaming to more than just Kodi boxes (your phone, tablet, set top box smart TV apps, web browser) and transcoding allows the flexibility to adapt the bitrate to reliably push video over the internet and to work around compatibility issues with clients that might not support certain codecs (keeping in mind transcoding only happens when it needs to). reply herunan 8 hours agoprev40-month runway is not that long and doesn’t account for any exceptional issues that may arise… reply djbon2112 4 hours agoparentTo be honest, it's right around a line that I feel is fine to make this request. The thing that triggered this, that isn't really mentioned by me in the post, is that we've had a few sudden swells of donations around both the 10.9.0 release and the latest 2 Plex kerfuffles, and I get the very distinct impression that people donating are not reading all the \"fine print\" about what we use it for. We also have a lot of recurring donations which should pay for a huge chunk. The goal here is to basically just make another public \"hey, we never really asked for donations, and we appreciate it, but hey for now we'd rather you donate to individuals than the org since the org can coast on this money for a few more years\". Which we absolutely can. I can't envision any real situation that would require us to use a huge sum of this money in one go, so it's really just the monthly recurring costs to cover which are relatively stable and consistent. reply beezlebroxxxxxx 8 hours agoparentprevI was expecting a much bigger number than 40 months, but then again for an entirely donation supported project it's quite good. I don't think I can remember a project telling people to stop donating directly to them before, though. It's a little odd really. I get it, but seems like investing in the S&P500 and then withdrawing your money the moment you get the slightest gainz. reply ramon156 8 hours agoprevLove jellyfin, I'm even considering port forwarding so my friends can make use of it! reply GardenLetter27 8 hours agoparentYou can use ProtonVPN for port forwarding if your ISP doesn't support it (or you want to protect your home IP). reply GaryNumanVevo 8 hours agoparentprevDon't port forward it's a pain in the ass to expose your home network to the internet. Just use something like Tailscale VPN (p2p wireguard) and buy a domain to point to the internal Tailscale IP. reply kortilla 7 hours agorootparent“Don’t click a few buttons in your router UI to forward a port and setup a dynamic DNS client in the same way that has worked for 25 years. Instead use a bunch of other 3rd party shit that builds a VPN and tough shit if people are using a TV.” What you’ve described is a pain in the ass from a setup perspective. I think what you were trying to say is “be careful about jellyfin vulnerabilities”, but that’s definitely not what came out. reply perryizgr8 7 hours agorootparentExposing a port to the internet is a huge pain nowadays. You never know if it is going to work, and even if it works it is incredibly flaky. What's changed is that a lot of ISPs are using double NAT or CGNAT now, which wasn't as common before. Which means router based DDNS will simply not work. On top of that every single router I've used is extremely unpredictable about respecting uPNP or whatever. So for most people a tailscale vpn or cloudflare tunnel is the best option. reply ssl-3 3 hours agorootparentIt depends on the situation. In my situation at home, port forwarding is stupid-simple and just works. My ISP does not saddle me with CGNAT (or any other form of NAT). I don't use UPnP. I have a real (dynamic, but just-for-me and almost never changing) IPv4 address to use, and I simply use it. It works predictably. It works reliably. It is not even a little bit flaky. There is no voodoo involved. And it doesn't require me to teach my elderly mother how to use Tailscale with her Roku STB. (I recognize that others may have different situations. But the existence of different situations doesn't mean that one must declare a particular solution to be the \"best\", does it? KISS.) reply GaryNumanVevo 3 hours agorootparentprevExactly, my old ISP and current ISP both use double NAT.

I have a custom domain that isn't used but I'd like to point it to a machine that's on Tailscale. Do you just put your Tailscale DNS on public DNS servers or do you use an internal one? Do you use a reverse proxy to route port 80/443 to the port your app is running on? reply SushiHippie 5 hours agorootparentYou could just get a wildcard certificate with lets encrypt, via a dns challenge. E.g. lego supports many different dns providers https://go-acme.github.io/lego/ And then internally inside of tailscale you could have your own dns server, which serves subdomains of your domain, and for all subdomains you can use the same wildcard certificate. This also does not 'expose' your subdomains on Certificate Transparency logs reply sanroot99 2 hours agorootparentI had once ran dns server from pihole inside tailscale. Worked pretty decent, but latency was the issue and had reliability issue. reply domh 5 hours agorootparentprevCool thanks! I'll have to spend some more time looking into this. Do you have any recommendations for a DNS server to run inside Tailscale? reply SushiHippie 3 hours agorootparentDepends, if you only want dns and nothing more, then probably dnsmasq. That's basically one of the most used dns/dhcp servers. Otherwise you could use solutions like AdGuard Home or PiHole, which both have a Web Interface for configuration, and the ability to block ads and tracking domains. Note that I don't use Tailscale myself, so I don't know if Tailscale 'needs' something else. But I use pure wireguard, and all of the services mentioned above work with 'pure wireguard'. reply sanroot99 2 hours agorootparentprevI can recommend pihole, it have a dns server, easy to use with web interface. reply GaryNumanVevo 4 hours agorootparentprevI run nginx proxy manager that gives out certs for each subdomain via letsencrypt + provider API reply honeybadger1 7 hours agorootparentprevI must be a networking genius because I run about 30 websites in dockers behind a reverse proxy(one static IP) with gazillions of port forwards and static routes over a consumer router and I have no issues. reply GaryNumanVevo 3 hours agorootparentI certainly hope you don't run anything commercially like this reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentprevTailscale funnel? reply PLG88 7 hours agorootparentWhole bunch of alternatives too - https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling.

Kodi connects via SMB to my NAS (Odroid HC-4, OpenMediaVault) and can easily show all my content. Would Jellyfin improve my experience? I could run it on odroid without transcoding, and then use the official android-tv client. Would it be worth the effort of switching? reply defrost 9 hours agoparentDepends on how much you value your Kodi setup and how many \"difficult to auto match\" showsmovies you have. I wanted to run KodiJellyFin in parallel (two Kodi client Android TV's in house) so that visitors with iPhonesAndroidsTables could browse content. The local Kodi TV clients used the NAS box MariDB to hold meta data held in the local to content .NFO files (show ID's, descriptions, etc) I've held off on that as the JellyFin docs are not clear and the small experiments I tried in isolation proved tricky to resolve issues. The issues being getting JellyFin to load details from local.nfo files w/out making changes and|or getting JellyFin to not make additional .INFO files (more or less duplicates) and|or getting JellyFin to not trash existing artwork with new downloads. I'm sure there are solutions here (eg: JellyFin can use seperate directories for it's meta-data (but then doesn't read the local .nfo files to get ambiguous shows 'right')), I've yet to put the hard hours in and these are the kinds of hiccups you may face. It's moot if you have a small collectiondon't care about existing artworketc. IIRC you can disable transcoding on fly by server and trust the networkviewing client to handle full original content, etc. I like JellyFin and used Emby in the past and use small JellyFin setups today - I just haven't resolved the issues in pointing it at a large curated collection and letting it rip making it's own parallel meta data w/out affecting pre-existing meta data. reply hi_hi 9 hours agoparentprevAs someone else mentioned, the benefit of Jellyfin is it updates with newly added media quite consistently. I previously was a heavy Kodi user, on a small Android TV set top box. I now use Jellyfin exclusively, without transcoding as you mentioned. Another benefit I've found is it's much easier to add new subtitle to a show/movie, without needing to setup specific subtitle databases as I did with Kodi. The only issue of note is the occasional crash, but given the level of polish with Jellyfin, and zero cost, it feels absurd to mention it. Oh, and if you have multiple household members, checkout Jellyseerr [0]. It lets others easily request shows/movies (which you can get notified about and approve) without bugging you. [0] https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr reply beAbU 9 hours agoparentprevI'm not a Jellyfin user, but I use Emby, which has the same ancestry and similar features. I can connect to my media server from literally anywhere in the world, using basically any device. I have a Chromecast with Google TV that I pack with me when we go away, and I pop it in the TV, configure wifi and I have my entire media collection right there. My phone, laptop, tablet and the wife's devices all have the client installed & configured. I have friends and family that I share my media collection with and they are on the other side of the planet. All I give them is a URL, username+password and they are off to the races. If this is not your use case, then Kodi with SMB is probably more than good enough. reply Semaphor 9 hours agoparentprevSingle-client is IMO where Kodi shines. This way you also have less complexity as Kodi doesn’t need a ton of things that are integrated in Jellyfin, I’d not switch if you don’t have any pain points with this set up. reply NoboruWataya 8 hours agoparentprevThere is a Jellyfin add-on for Kodi which you could use if you want to keep using Kodi for other stuff like streaming. That's what I do (Kodi runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to the TV) and it works fine, though honestly I'm not a particularly heavy or advanced user so my needs are low. Another advantage of that setup is that I can use the Jellyfin clients on my laptop while using Kodi for the TV. reply bestouff 9 hours agoparentprevI had the same setup until recently. I always had troubles with Kodi not indecing very well my movies; and also when wartching my moview far from home I had to copy them first, than think about marking them as \"watched\" in my library - and if I stopped watching mi-movie that was even more complicated. Really, Jellyfin has been quite the upgrade. The indexing is better, I can watch things far from home, everything is there. As a bonus, I can create accounts for close friends/family so they can watch what I download without hassle. Just try it. reply bambax 8 hours agoparentprevI had this setup with a Netgear NAS (old and slow). I switched to a better NAS and Jellyfin and could not be happier. Well, I could be happier because Jellyfin has some quirks, but I'm pretty happy. The main difference is that it works everywhere, from any device on the LAN (browser, iPad, Android phone, you name it), and even remotely (using Tailscale, to avoid exposing Jellyfin to the world). It's like you have your own little Netflix that you can access from absolutely anywhere. reply renegade-otter 8 hours agoprevI need to take the time to finally switch from Emby (what Jellyfin was forked from). reply sam0x17 5 hours agoprev$24k is not a lot to have in the bank for an org who is (whether they like it or not) mortal enemies with plex reply rpgbr 5 hours agoparentAFAIK, Jellyfin isn't an org, it's a non-profit project run by people who don't look for compensation. reply djbon2112 4 hours agorootparentCorrect, we're not even an \"org\" in any official sense. Just a loose collection of people working on the project. reply zeroq 4 hours agoprevI had a very weird experience with Jellyfins team. Recently I decided to give the app a try, and it worked fine, but I have serious issues with their media scanner (nested structures, a lot of misc content like interviews, etc.). Years ago I wrote my own script that scans my drives, downloads imdb database, and 100% accurately matches media to imdb-id and fetches all auxilary data like cast, synopsis, posters, and so on. I asked on their forum if I could use that to somehow bypass the scanner, prepopulate the database or write my own scanner based on theirs. I was repedatley said it would be impossible and to not touch the code. \"Seriously, do not do this\" said one of the team members. I mean I do understand they were trying to save me a lot of headache, but at the same time they're running a campaign for developers. I just found it very odd. reply djbon2112 4 hours agoparentThe reason is that, it's basically impossible. The issue comes down to the Library handling code. It's legacy Emby code that we've been slowly but surely trying to replace but it's a huge task. This is huge chunk of Jellyfin. Writing your own parser is a great idea, but directly hooking it into Jellyfin will just be giving yourself a lot of headaches and will NOT be easy to do. You're best to write out NFOs and then let Jellyfin just import those with all external metadata providers removed. reply andrew_eu 4 hours agoparentprevI can't speak for their developer/support team, but that kind of feedback indeed feels strange. Even more so because this kind of intervention is possible without touching any of Jellyfin's code. In particular you can create an NFO file (same stem, next to the media, with a .info extension) that contains this data. With stuff like the IMDB ID given, Jellyfin is pretty good at extracting metadata from there; without it, false matches aren't uncommon. It's even documented.

Not everything has to be a subscription or a hyper growth business, not every product needs to do everything.

They won’t come back magically when they will need them. Plus as stated before, they can divert the money to other projects related to Jellyfin themselves. They don’t need the community to do that for them. Honestly, if you are a project the size of Jellyfin and you ask donations to stop because you have a measly three years of operational runway without funding anything and without any idea of what to do with the money, I seriously question your ability to survive. reply s_dev 5 hours agorootparent>They won’t come back magically when they will need them.

As they point out in the post, Jellyfins No1 problem is keeping their clients up to date with new features and design polish. They have identified that the money being donated to them would be much better donated to the maintainers of the clients to encourage them to do more/better work, but they dont feel its right that they choose how that is distributed and they want the users to donate to the client they favour most. I think this is great, and hopefully some of the clients which have been dragging recently can get some donations and encourage some fresh development on them. reply 8 more comments...

    "originBody": "Pin July 19, 2024 The Pin type (and the concept of pinning in general) is a foundational building block on which the rest of the the Rust async ecosystem stands. Unfortunately, it has also been one of the least accessible and most misunderstood elements of async Rust. This post is meant to explain what Pin achieves, how it came to be, and what the current problem with Pin is. There was an interesting post a few months ago on the blog of the company Modular, which is developing a new language called Mojo. In a brief section discussing Pin in Rust, I found that it very succinctly captured the zeitgeist of the public discussion of the subject: In Rust, there is no concept of value identity. For a self-referential struct pointing to its own member, that data can become invalid if the object moves, as it’ll be pointing to the old location in memory. This creates a complexity spike, particularly in parts of async Rust where futures need to be self-referential and store state, so you must wrap Self with Pin to guarantee it’s not going to move. In Mojo, objects have an identity so referring to self.foo will always return the correct location in memory, without any additional complexity required for the programmer. Some aspects of these remarks confuse me. The term “value identity” is not defined anywhere in this post, nor can I find it elsewhere in Mojo’s documentation, so I’m not clear on how Modular claims that Mojo solves the problem that Pin is meant to solve. Despite this, I do think the criticism of Pin’s usability is well stated: there is indeed a “complexity spike” when a user is forced to interact with it. The phrase I would use is actually a “complexity cliff,” as in the user suddenly finds themself thrown off a cliff into a sea of complex, unidiomatic APIs they don’t understand. This is a problem and it would be very valuable to Rust users if the problem were solved. As it happens, this little corner of Rust is my mess; adding Pin to Rust to support self-referential types was my idea. I have ideas of how this complexity spike could be resolved, which I will elaborate in a subsequent post. Before I can get there though I need to first try to explain, as efficiently as I know how, what Pin accomplishes, how it came to exist, and why it is currently difficult to use. Requirements To explain why Pin exists, we need to step back to the original development of async/await. The problem we were trying to solve was that in order to support references in async functions, we needed to be able to store those references inside of a Future. The problem was that those references might be self-references, meaning they point to other fields of the same object. Consider this toy example: async fn foo(z: &'a mut i32) { ... } async fn bar(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 { let mut z = x + y; foo(&mut z).await; z } Both of these functions evaluate to an anonymous future type; the future type that an async function evaluates to has a state for each possible step at which it could pause: when it starts, every await point, and when it finishes. For the purposes of our example, we will call the anonymous future that foo evaluates to Foo (the 'a being the lifetime of the z argument) and the anonymous future that bar evaluates to Bar. Let’s ask ourselves, what would the internal states of Bar be? Something like this: enum Bar { // When it starts, it contains only its arguments Start { x: i32, y: i32 }, // At the first await, it must contain `z` and the `Foo` future // that references `z` FirstAwait { z: i32, foo: Foo } // When its finished it needs no data Complete, } Note the '? in for the lifetime of the Foo future: what lifetime could that be? It isn’t a lifetime that outlives Bar, Bar has no lifetimes. The Foo object instead borrows the z field of Bar, which is stored along side it in the same struct. This is why these future types are said to be “self-referential:” they contain fields which reference other fields in themselves. Here we must make a clarifying distinction: the goal of Pin is not to allow users to define their own self-referential type in safe Rust. Today, if you tried to define Bar by hand, there is really no safe way to construct its FirstAwait variant. Making this possible would be a worthy objective, but it is orthogonal to the goal of Pin. The goal of Pin is to make it safe to manipulate self-referential types generated by the compiler from an async function or implemented with unsafe code in a runtime like tokio. However a self-referential type has been defined, once it exists it presents a problem. Imagine that Bar has been put into the FirstAwait state, so it contains references to its own z field. If you were to move Bar, those references would now dangle and point to dead memory, which may be re-used for a different value. Therefore, it is essential that once Bar could be put into the FirstAwait state, it is not moved again. Prior to the development of Pin, any object in Rust could be moved if you had ownership of it, or even if you had a mutable reference to it. So this was the problem that we needed to solve: we needed to express the requirement that from a certain point an object cannot be moved. Non-solutions: move constructors and offset pointers Before we continue, I want to spend a moment to discuss two solutions to the problem which are often proposed but don’t work (at least in Rust). These both take a rather different approach from the approach taken by Pin: instead of saying the value cannot be moved again, they try to make it so that self-referential values can be moved after all. The first of these is the move constructor. The idea is that you would run some code whenever a value is moved, similar to the destructor that is run when the value is dropped. This code could then “fix-up” any self-referential pointers so that they now point to the new location. I’ve discussed this in the past in my post about the history of async Rust, but this is not a viable solution because in Rust, those pointers could exist anywhere, not just “inside” the value being moved. For example, you could instead have a vector of pointers into your own state, and so the move constructor would need to be able to trace into that vector. It ultimately requires the same kind of runtime memory management as garbage collection, which wasn’t viable for Rust. The other reason move constructors don’t work is that Rust very early on affirmed that it would never have move constructors, and a lot of unsafe code exists which assumes it is possible to move values by just copying their memory. Adding move constructors would be a breaking change for Rust. The other non-solution that is sometimes proposed is the offset pointer. The idea in this case is that rather than compile self-references to normal references, they are compiled to offsets relative to the address of the self-referential object that contains them. This does not work because it is not possible to determine at compile time if a reference will be a self-reference or not: its possible for the same value to be both in different branches. For example, here’s a modified version of bar from before: async fn bar(x: i32, y: i32, mut z: &mut i32) { let mut z2 = x + y; if random() { z = &mut z2; } foo(z).await; } By the time you call foo, z may be a pointer into the same object or it may be a pointer elsewhere. Its not possible to determine at compile time. You would need to compile references to some sort of enum of offset and reference; this was deemed unrealistic when we were working on async/await. The “pinned typestate” Having eliminated any option to make these objects movable, we therefore have a requirement that the object be immovable. But we need to clarify exactly what the requirements are, because people often make the wrong assumption about what is required. Most importantly, these objects are not meant to be always immovable. Instead, they are meant to be freely moved for a certain period of their lifecycle, and at a certain point they should stop being moved from then on. That way, you can move a self-referential future around as you compose it with other futures until eventually you put it into the place it will live for as long as you poll it. So we needed a way to express that an object is no longer allowed to be moved; in other words, that it is “pinned in place.” While we were experimenting with APIs for expressing this requirement, Ralf Jung was kind enough to formalize the idea. In Ralf’s model, even before the work on async/await, objects could be in one of two “typestates”: they are “owned,” in which state they can be moved freely, or they are “shared,” in which state they cannot be moved for some lifetime (because they have references pointing to them). To support self-referential future types, Ralf’s model gained a third typestate, which is called “pinned.” Once an object enters the pinned typestate, it can never be moved again. More specifically, its memory cannot be invalidated without first executing its destructor. This definition also includes some other edge cases, like freeing memory without running the destructor, but the main way you invalidate an object’s memory without the destructor running is by moving the object to a new location. The easiest way to understand the pinned typestate is to think of it as requiring that the object never is moved again. Another fact about the pinned typestate is that for most types it is completely irrelevant. If the value of type can never contain any self-references, pinning it is useless. So for most types of objects, one would want types to be able to opt out of ever entering the pinned typestate so that you can move them again if you want. There is a more detailed description of the pinned typestate in the formal model of Rust on Ralf’s blog for people who are interested. But having understood the requirements of pinning (first informally, and then formally by Ralf), we had the problem of finding the best way to represent an object entering the pinned typestate in the surface language of Rust. Ralf’s model describes the semantics of the language, but doesn’t specify a user-facing API or syntax. The solution that we ended up with was the Pin type, but it wasn’t the first solution we tried. ?Move Before we tried Pin, we tried a solution based on a new trait which we called Move. The idea was that most types would implement Move, and nothing about them would change, but any type that could contain self-references would not implement Move. For these types which don’t implement Move, whenever you take a reference to a value of that type, that value enters the pinned typestate and no longer can be moved. This definition is at the same time somewhat complex - people often assume Move controls moving at all, which wasn’t the original proposal - and also in other ways somewhat intuitive - you can’t possible store a self-reference in a value without taking a reference to that value to store, so tying the transition to the pinned typestate to the taking of a reference provides a straightforward guarantee of safety. And the check for this could be implemented automatically in the compiler: for types that don’t implement Move, disallow moving values of those types after they’ve been referenced in the same way you disallow moving values of non-Copy types after they’ve been moved. This behavior was even implemented in a branch. The design has one fundamental limitation, which is that sometimes you want to take a reference to a value that will later be self-referential without pinning it in place. For example, maybe you want to store it briefly in an Option and then use Option::take to take it away. This would probably be the most significant problem with this original Move trait, but we didn’t even get to the point of really identifying that problem, because we discovered early on that adding Move would not be a backward compatible change. I’ve written about this before, but let me reiterate. There are two kinds of automatically implemented “marker traits” in Rust: Auto traits: these are automatically implemented for types if all their fields implement them. Major examples include Send and Sync. ?Traits: these are automatically implemented for types if all their fields implement them, and generic parameters are assumed to implement them as well unless they explicitly opt out. The only example of this is ?Sized. We knew all along that we couldn’t make Move an auto trait, because there are stable APIs that depend on the fact that you can always move out of a mutable reference. The classic example of this is mem::swap, which swaps the location of two values of the same type. You can’t allow swapping types that don’t implement Move, but there’s no Move bound on that API, and adding a new bound to it would be a breaking change. Our assumption, therefore, was that we would need to add Move as a ?Trait: ?Move. By default, all generics would be assumed to be Move, but if an API doesn’t require the ability to move the parameter it can add a T: ?Move bound to the API. This was already not very appealing: a lot of APIs don’t need the value to be movable and would presumably gain a ?Move bound, making Rust documentation harder to understand across the board. But the whole plan went down with the fact that adding Move as a ?Trait was also not backward compatible. The problem is with associated types: the place to add ?Trait bounds to associated types is at the trait’s definition site. If the associated type of a trait does not have a ?Trait bound, all code which uses that trait is allowed to assume that the associated type implements that trait. Moreover, relaxing that bound on an existing trait would be a breaking change, because code is allowed to exist which relies on that bound Here is an example using IntoFuture, which assumes that the associated future type has the behavior of a type that implements Move: fn swap_into_future(into_f1: T, into_f2: T) { let mut f1 = into_f1.into_future(); let mut f2 = into_f2.into_future(); // This would become an error if you add // `type IntoFuture: ?Move` to the trait: mem::swap(&mut f1, &mut f2); } This problem is widespread, because many fundamental operators involve associated types. For example, you could not even have a mutable reference to a ?Move type implement DerefMut, because the target of a pointer is an associated type: fn swap_derefs>(mut r1: T, mut r2: T) { // This would become an error if you add // `type Target: ?Move` to the trait: mem::swap(&mut *r1, &mut *r2); } The same is true of the return type of a function, the item of an iterator, the value returned by the index operators, by the arithmetic operators, and so on. It is simply not backward compatible to add another new ?Trait, and an edition cannot be easily used to solve the problem, because it is necessary that the interfaces of traits remain the same so that two crates in different editions can be composed together. Pin Given that limitation, we set out to solve the problem in a completely different direction. Instead of making the pinned typestate a property of the object’s type which it enters whenever it is referenced, we designed a new category of reference which puts the object into the pinned typestate when the reference is created. This is represented with the Pin type. Pin is a wrapper type that can wrap any kind of pointer (both the built-in reference types and library-defined “smart pointers” like Box). It means that that pointer puts its target into the pinned typestate so it must never be moved again. To make the changes necessary as minimal as possible, we implemented this as a library API, rather than having immovability enforced by the compiler. This means that when code actually needs to mutate the object that is pinned, it must use an unsafe API get access to it and guarantee that the object is not moved through that ordinary mutable reference. Since most types don’t have a meaningful difference between the pinned typestate and normal, the Unpin auto trait was added. This allows getting a mutable reference from a pinned pointer without unsafe code if the type can’t be self-referential. It’s perfectly safe to move the object out of a Pin if it implements Unpin. This is a lot like Move, but by tying this behavior only to pinned pointers, we avoid the issue of backward compatibility as well as the original problem that you couldn’t reference a ?Move object without pinning it in place. Because pinning only applies to pinned pointers, ordinary unpinned references still work just fine with types that are not Unpin. There are more details in the documentation for the Pin type and for the pin module, which over the years have grown into a comprehensive and clear explanation of pinning as it exists in Rust today. Of course, the biggest advantage of the Pin interface was that it was backward compatible to add. Because all of the APIs that can move referenced data like swap require a mutable reference, once you pin a object with Pin you can’t call them on that object anymore. But because the new pinned typestate only applies to special pinned references, it doesn’t require breaking changes to the rest of the Rust language. This is why we went forward with this design: it was possible to add without breaking any existing code and violating Rust’s backward compatibility guarantees. The problems with Pin Despite meeting our requirements in a backward compatible way, Pin has proven to have several problems in terms of usability. It is indeed a “complexity spike” when users have to deal with Pin. But what is the cause of this complexity? One theory would be that the problem is that whereas the Move trait was to be enforced by the compiler, the Pin trait requires unsafe code to mutate objects while they’re pinned. With the Move trait, this was automatically enabled by marking mutating APIs which don’t move the object ?Move. To some extent this is true, but we should be careful not to exaggerate it. For example, you can already assign to a pinned object using Pin::set, which is totally safe. And code which actually needs to mutate pinned objects is actually rare: in general, that’s code generated by the compiler when it lowers your async function to a future, not code you write yourself. Another theory (advanced by Yosh Wuyts here) is that the reason Pin is difficult to use is that its “conditional.” This also does not strike me as the problem. Plenty of things in Rust and programming are “conditional” but are lauded as making programmers’ lives easier. For example, non-lexical lifetimes were all about making lifetimes end at different point in different branches of a conditional, and everyone sees this as making Rust easier to understand. Maybe there was some naming issue that has made it hard to understand the relationship between Pin (a type) and Unpin (a trait), but I don’t think this is the heart of the problem. In my opinion, the problem with Pin is that it was implemented as a pure library type, whereas the ordinary reference types have plenty of syntactic sugar and support as built-in types that are part of the language. A lot of nice features that references have disappear when you are dealing with pinned references. This makes the experience much worse, and more importantly breaks many users' mental models, because they’ve built up an understanding of how references behave based on what the compiler accepts, and similar code stops being accepted once you are dealing with pinned references. A very prominent example is the notion of “reborrowing,” which normal mutable references have but pinned references do not. Consider this: &mut T does not implement Copy, and yet its perfectly permissible to pass it as an argument multiple times in a row, like so: fn incr(x: &mut i32) { *x += 1; } fn incr_twice(x: &mut i32) { incr(x); incr(x); } It never occurs to most users to ask why this is allowed, but in fact it violates a basic rule of Rust: types which don’t implement Copy can’t be moved more than once. The reason is that there is an implicit coercion in the compiler called “reborrowing,” in which when mutable references are used, it will functionally insert a “reborrow” (as if you wrote &mut *x instead of x), to borrow the reference again, instead of moving it. Pin does not have this affordance, because it is a normal library type that doesn’t implement Copy. This means that when you use a Pin more than once, you get an error about using the value after a move or sometimes an even more inscrutable error about lifetimes. Instead, you have to explicitly reborrow Pin using the Pin::as_mut function. This difference is the cause of a lot of confusion when users try to use Pin. I could go on and on. Consider the example of set mentioned above: that its safe to assign to Pin, but you need to use the set method. You can just assign to a mutable reference using a dereference and the assignment operator. But this is not true of Pin, you need to learn the special API. Many such special cases exist, and they are because Pin is a library type with no support in the language’s syntax. Undoubtedly the worst of problem in this category is the problem of “pinned projections.” A “projection” is the fancy programming language term for a field access: “projecting” from an object to a field of that object (I guess in the same sense that an awning might project out of a wall). The problem of pinned projections is that it is challenging to take a pinned reference to an object and get a pinned reference to a field of that object. There are third party crates like pin-project-lite to solve this problem, but they require learning a complex new API involving macros, emphasizing the way that pinned references are much harder to use than ordinary references because they are a library type. The worst part of this is a very unfortunate interaction between pinned projections and the Drop trait. The problem arises because Drop::drop takes a normal mutable reference. Consider this possibility: you have a type which has a field that is a self-referential field. You pin project to that field and poll it. Then, in the destructor, you move out of that field (because you now have an unpinned mutable reference), pin that future to the stack, and poll it there. You’ve just violated the pinning guarantees. The solution that crates like pin-project-lite use is to restrict your ability to define a destructor. This works alright in practice, but this very fact is additional complexity that has to be documented when explaining what precisely the pinning guarantees are. Unfortunately, Drop was stable before Pin, so we had to work around it. In my next post… Despite these problems of usability, Pin is my proudest accomplishment of my work on Rust. We enabled users to compile async functions which contain arbitrary references safely into self-referential objects; without this async/await would not have been nearly as usable a feature as it has been, because references are a fundamental part of how users write Rust. And we did so in a manner which was entirely backward compatible with the language that already existed. Pin is now a fundamental component of a thriving ecosystem for high-performance network services and other use cases of asynchronous programming. But I do agree with the critics: Pin represents a complexity cliff and working with a pinned reference is much harder than working with an ordinary reference. That’s why in a few days I will turn to the subject of how Pin could be improved. The key concept is the notion of pinned places. rust pinning",

In particular, lots of documentation claims things like “Pin ensures that an object is never moved”, which isn’t true! It’s only true if the object is not Unpin, but most normal objects are Unpin, so Pin usually does nothing. It took me a very long time to finally understand this. The set of types T for which Pin does anything at all is very niche and weird and IMO this isn’t sufficiently highlighted by the documentation. reply withoutboats3 9 hours agoparentI think this is good feedback and it would be good for the docs to be clearer about this. Of course for the types that you're going to deal with pinned (futures and streams), they're a lot more likely to be those niche objects. I also do think the documentation has improved a lot over the years. I was surprised when I checked it while drafting this that it seemed to focus on the right things pretty well; circa 2019 I remember it being a lot more focused on specifying the contract in a way that really belongs in something like the Rust reference and not the std API docs. reply iknowstuff 4 hours agoprevWhen teaching, to make it clear that an \"Unpin\" item is unaffected by \"Pin,\" I’d suggest analogies from real life where objects remain unaffected despite the use of something designed to hold them in place: 1. Velcro hooks do not stick to smooth surfaces: Pin -> Velcro, Unpin -> Smooth 2. Magnets do not affect non-magnetic materials: Pin -> Magnet, Unpin -> NonMagnetic/Glass/Brass 3. Glue does not adhere to non-stick surfaces: Pin -> Glue, Unpin -> NonStick This way, it becomes clear that a \"Velcro\" fixes an item in place, and if an item is \"Smooth,\" it is unaffected by the \"Velcro\" mechanism. Given Rust’s ecosystem naming themes it would have been beautiful to rename the trait to something something magnet and non-magnetic :’) reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 3 hours agoparentBut a smooth object can't be velcroed, nor can wood hold up a magnet. Isn't it that `Unpin` means the object is always ready to be pinned? (I read the article last night and already forgot whether pinning requires a fixup step) So a `T: Pin + !Unpin` is like a sheet of paper that can only be fixed by stapling it, but a `T: Pin + Unpin` is like a painting with a hook which can be mounted on a nail and unmounted without damaging the hook reply iknowstuff 2 hours agorootparentI think two things fuck with our brains here: - the double negative of „!Unpin” - Rust trait names are not adjectives Pin + Detach(-able) would be a less confusing name. That being said, you can velcro smooth objects all you want, but you'll still separate (Move) them easily :) or put a magnet to glass/brass objects. PS mind you that Pin is not a trait, only Unpin is, so Pin or Pin is a more accurate way or writing what you described :) reply weavie 5 hours agoprevI've been programming Rust professionally for several years now and being totally honest I don't really understand Pin that well. I get the theory, but don't really have an intuitive understanding of when I should use it. My usage of pin essentially comes down to \"I try something, and the compiler complains at me, so I pin stuff and then it compiles.\" It's never been such a hurdle in the day to day coding I need to do that I've been forced to sit down and truly grok it. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 3 hours agoparentSame. It's one of my most common cases of \"Just avoid unsafe and be glad some smart compiler folks already solved this all for me\" Whereas in C++ I was regularly treading in the water of \"stuff I don't know, but must use\" and getting eaten by crocodiles reply LegionMammal978 10 hours agoprevMy take on why users find Pin difficult: by itself, it has no meaning! This is different from every other wrapper in the language (except maybe AssertUnwindSafe, which basically no one uses for its original purpose). Given a Pin, there's nothing about Pin in the language or standard library that tells you what you can and can't do with it. (Unless the InnerType declares that it's Unpin, which implies that you can do anything you can do with an ordinary pointer.) Instead, it operates as more of a \"bring your own meaning\", where the provider of the InnerType further creates any number of (internally unsafe) methods and APIs to manipulate a pinned object soundly. The only purpose of Pin itself is to provide a pointer with fewer \"intrinsic capabilities\" (e.g., swapping &muts, moving out of Boxes, etc.), so that the inner type can allow further capabilities on top of that. I suspect it's this nebulousness of meaning that confuses people the most. It certainly took me a fair while to figure it out. All the ideas about structural vs. non-structural fields are just to facilitate popular access patterns like \"this one field is just plain old data, but this other field contains an object that itself wants to be pinned\". reply withoutboats3 9 hours agoparentPin does have meaning: it means you cannot move the target of this pointer ever again (or invalidate its without running its destructor, which is what moving does that's the problem), unless the type of the target implements Unpin. This giving up of certain rights gives other rights (such as to store self-referential values), which are the reason you give it up. This is how contracts between components just work: similarly, giving up the right to mutate through a reference allows you to alias the reference at the same time. I'm always reminded of this line from Lincoln, about a very different and much graver subject: \"If we submit to law, Alex, even submit to losing freedoms - the freedom to oppress for instance - we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us.\" I do agree that the fact that you can't use those rights in safe code is an educational problem, because one can't easily demonstrate what you can do with a pinned reference except \"call a poll method which the compiler has generated for you.\" reply LegionMammal978 7 hours agorootparent> Pin does have meaning: it means you cannot move the target of this pointer ever again (or invalidate its without running its destructor, which is what moving does that's the problem), unless the type of the target implements Unpin. Sure you can: it's just that the target has to provide its own methods for it. It's perfectly valid (if pointless) to write struct PracticallyUnpin(..., PhantomPinned); impl PracticallyUnpin { fn unpin_mut(self: Pin) -> &mut Self { // SAFETY: We're the ones writing the rules here unsafe { Pin::into_inner_unchecked(self) } } ... // (no other unsafe methods or impls) } and then the caller can do whatever they want with that reference, e.g., moving the value. Unpin isn't a magic word: it's just a generic way for the target to indicate that pinned pointers can safely regain full capabilities. Of course, putting a Pin around an object does further restrict what you can do with it generically in unsafe code. But I'd further count these under the umbrella of \"intrinsic unsafe capabilities\", which Pin removes, but which the target can later restore ad libitum. Compare the question of whether a fn replace_with(&mut T, impl FnOnce(T) -> T) (aborting on panic) is sound, which really comes down to the \"unsafe capabilities\" of a &mut reference. This is not to say, of course, that the target need not be very circumspect about which capabilities it restores! It has a responsibility not to create an unsound interface that might result in UB under permitted usage. E.g., if we have a type that owns a generic non-Unpin future, then that type must follow the strictest Pin invariants w.r.t. that future. But otherwise, it's entirely up to the target type which capabilities it wants to restore under which circumstances. reply withoutboats3 7 hours agorootparentThere are a couple of ways to interpret this code: 1. If this were public, or if you ever move out of the reference you get from that function, you would be violating the pin contract so this code would then be invalid. 2. Since its impossible to depend on the pin contract generically and this type doesn't actually depend on it, this is really just an indirect equivalent of implementing Unpin for the type, which is safe, so this code is valid. I do think the second interpretation is correct (and I think its what the UCG group has decided), but this is a really nuanced conversation about the interpretation of unsafe code and validity. You started this thread by saying this is the reason pin is difficult for users: I am completely certain the median user is not in the weeds about what is and isn't valid unsafe code in pointless hypotheticals; the totally different set of idioms to get the same behavior for pinned references as for ordinary references is a much more pressing issue. reply LegionMammal978 2 hours agorootparent> I am completely certain the median user is not in the weeds about what is and isn't valid unsafe code in pointless hypotheticals; the totally different set of idioms to get the same behavior for pinned references as for ordinary references is a much more pressing issue. I agree that the latter is indeed a pressing issue. But my point is that the former isn't about unsafe code so much as safe code: safe users of a concrete pinned target type may observe any number of different API surfaces, some of which allow modifying or swapping out various parts of the pinned object. For a practical example of this, when the target type uses one of the pin-projection crates, it has a choice in which fields to denote as structural or non-structural, which affects how much the user can modify each field down the line. Indeed, a type could usefully choose make all of its fields non-structural, if only its address is externally referenced. The pinning invariants simply don't fully constrain what the user of the target type can and cannot do, except for those constraints needed for the target type's own soundness. reply withoutboats3 28 minutes agorootparentIn my next post, one of the major features I write about is pinned projection, and its true: for any type that supports pinned projection, it needs to decide for each field if pinning is transitive or not. This is different from how mutability works (mutability is always transitive). There is a more elegant design which is basically reversed from pinning, but that's backward compatible with Rust. I also describe that in the next post. This pinned fields vs unpinned fields aspect of the behavior is the \"necessary accidental complexity\" of existing in the context of all in which we live and what came before us. reply alain_gilbert 16 hours agoprevShould add \"rust\" in the title, so that we know what the article is talking about.

The talk is \"Value Semantics: Safety, Independence, Projection, & Future of Programming\" [0] [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QthAU-t3PQ4 reply withoutboats3 9 hours agoparentIt's clear that Mojo is in some sense inheriting Swift's notion of \"value semantics,\" but Rust also has \"value semantics\" in the same sense. Rust just also has references as first class types, whereas Swift (and as far as I can tell, Mojo) only allows references as a parameter passing mode; Mojo expands on Swift's inout parameters by having an immutable reference passing mode as well. Not being able to store references in objects does solve the problem of \"self-referential structs\" in that you just can't implement code like the code Rust compiles to, but that isn't at all what the quoted paragraph says about Mojo so I am quite lost as to what they mean. reply demurgos 7 hours agorootparentMy understanding of _value identity_ refers to the `StableDeref`/yoke approach to self-regerential structs. The value is constructed at a stable address (usually some heap allocation) and you always access it through some pointer. The address is the value's identity. The pointer can move, but the value doesn't move. reply withoutboats3 7 hours agorootparentCould you link to a source for this in Mojo's documentation? This would be a logical interpretation, but it would mean Mojo is planning to adopt a much worse implementation of async than Rust and the post is claiming that Mojo is both faster and easier than Rust. reply demurgos 3 hours agorootparentI'm not familiar with Mojo, so my understanding above was based on their blog post that you linked, and assumptions based on context. Checking their website, I find a sentence equating \"identity\" with \"having an address\" though: > So far, we've talked about values that live in memory, which means they have an identity (an address) that can be passed around among functions (passed \"by reference\"). Source: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#trivial-... --- If their self referential structs require indirection, I agree that they're weaker then what's available in Rust. Hopefully they provide more details at some point. The \"No pin requirement\" section in particular focused on Mojo's async ergonomics, not Mojo's async perfs. reply fallingsquirrel 16 hours agoprevThe problem as I see it is that having a &mut reference to something lets you move it via mem::swap/replace (and maybe a few others?) -- but actually needing to do so is rare. It seems to me that if that weren't allowed, taking a &mut reference to a self-referential value would be perfectly safe. Maybe there could have been a way to opt in to moving-via-reference for those rare cases when you need it. Or maybe this whole problem could have been avoided by making swap and replace unsafe? I'd love to see someone explore that design space. reply withoutboats3 9 hours agoparentThis is true. When were working on the problem, the way Aaron Turon put it was that &mut is \"too powerful.\" If &mut didn't give the power to move out of it, the whole design would be a lot simpler. I'll discuss this in my next post about this. Rust has to be backward compatible and already decided you can move out of an &mut, but there are definitely cleaner designs that can be, unburdened by what has been. reply Sytten 15 hours agoparentprevThis just doesn't scale and it would have been a non starter because it would break so much exiting code. Mem swap is just one of the ways to move via mutable references, there are many many others. Option::take is one that I use quite often and it would be super weird if that was unsafe. reply verdagon 14 hours agoprevI can imagine a Rust-like language where we have move-constructors (in TFA), and every generated Future subtype is opaque and also heap allocated for us. I think the need for Pin could then disappear, because the user would have no way to destroy it, since it's opaque and elsewhere on the heap, and therefore no way to move it (because having move-constructors implies that moving is conceptually destroying then recreating things). reply pornel 6 hours agoparentPin is a state rather than a property of the data itself. This has a very nice effect of allowing merging and inlining of Futures before they're executed. It's similar to how Rust does immutability — there's no immutable memory, only immutable references. reply withoutboats3 9 hours agoparentprevYou don't need move constructors if every future is heap allocated. But then every call to an async function is a separate allocation, which is terrible for memory locality. Some kind of virtual stack would be much better than that (but then you need garbage collection if you want the stacks to be memory-optimized to be small by default). reply anonymoushn 8 hours agorootparentYou could use an actual stack. As I understand it this was not done for questionable reasons relating to borrows of thread-locals. You could also allocate a top-level async function and all of its transitive async callees all at once, if you force the user to put all this information in 1 translation unit. Or you could use a bump allocator specifically for futures used in a certain part of the program, if you're willing to give up using a global allocator for everything. So it seems like there are a lot of options. reply josephg 13 hours agoparentprevYeah. I can guess how disruptive it would be, but I really wish rust bit the bullet and added a Move trait to std, baked into the language at a similar level as Copy. Move defines a function which moves a value from one address in memory to another. Structs without impl Move cannot be moved. Almost all types would #[derive(Move)], which implements a trivial move function that copies the bytes. But this opens the door to self-referential types, futures, and lots of other things that need more complex move behaviour. (Actually, it might make more sense to define two traits, mirroring the difference between Copy and Clone. One is a marker trait which tells the compiler that the bytes can just be moved. The other allows custom \"move constructor\" implementation.) I want move because pin is so hard to understand. Its a complex idea wrapped in double- or sometimes triple negatives. fn(...). Wat? I drop off at unsafe pin-projecting. When is that safe? When is it not? Blah I'm out. Moving from rust-without-move to rust-with-move would be inconvenient, because basically every struct anyone has written to date with rust needs #[derive(Move)] to be added. Including in std. And all types in existing editions that aren't pinned would need the compiler to infer a Move trait implementation. This should be possible to do mechanically. It would just be a lot of work. Async rust is horrible. Especially compared to futures / promises in almost any other language. At some point, someone will make a new rust-like systems language which has an improved version of rust's memory safety model, a Move trait, and better futures. I'd personally also love comptime instead of rust's macro system. I love rust. I love all the work the team has put into it over the years. But the language I’m really looking forward to is the language that comes after rust. Same idea, but something that has learned from rust’s mistakes. And it’s increasingly becoming clear what that better rust-like language might potentially look like. I can't wait. reply conradludgate 10 hours agorootparentI very much disagree that Pin is as hard as everyone makes it out to be. Using the pin! macros, the pin-project crate, and enough as_mut() to get it to compile and it's not hard at all to get a future impl working. It would be good to get this native (which is what boats wants) so it's easier to discover but it's not at all hard by any means I think a lot of people think pin is confusing but don't actually try to learn it. When I've sat with people and helped them they understand pretty quickly what pin solves and how it works. I very strongly think move constructors would be even more complex than pin. reply josephg 6 hours agorootparentI can only speak from my experience, but I really struggled with it. Ok, I understand moving. Pin is ... not moving. But the struct can still move, just ... not when you have a pointer to the struct. Ok, weird, but ok. Pin has a weird, limited set of functions to access the data fields of the struct. Some are unsafe. And then there's Unpin, which sounds like its not-not-move, so, something can move? No. From std: > Implementing the Unpin trait for T expresses the fact that T is pinning-agnostic: it shall not expose nor rely on any pinning guarantees. So, ??. Then there's macros for pin-project, which most projects in the wild use, but some are unsafe. Why? Which of my fields can I safely expose using pin-project? I tried to implement a custom SSE-style streaming protocol over HTTP, to make a rust server implementation of Braid. I spent about a week trying, including pouring over the implementations of server-sent events and websockets in one of the HTTP libraries. Ultimately I failed to get it to work. (This is before TAIT and some other recent features, so things are probably be better now.) I picked up javascript to write my server instead, and I had the protocol implemented about 20 minutes, in just 20 or so lines of code. I adore rust, and I'd much rather a rust implementation than one based on nodejs. But I ran into skill issues here. Pin and futures in rust are hard. Or at least, I found them hard. I'm sure if I took another crack at it I'd be able to figure it out. But I don't want to spend so many of my brain cells on the language. I want to spend my attention thinking about my problem domain. Like I can in javascript. Rust is an amazing language. But yeah, I really think that pin doesn't meet the standard that the rest of the language sets. I think it could use a rethink. reply withoutboats3 6 hours agorootparentI'm curious why you needed to deal with `Pin` instead of using async functions. What led you to a path in which you needed to implement poll methods yourself? For what it's worth, all of the practical problems you encountered with using Pin are exactly what my next post is to show how to solve. reply josephg 5 hours agorootparentI look forward to your next post on the topic then! > I'm curious why you needed to deal with `Pin` instead of using async functions. The protocol I was trying to implement streams messages over time over a single HTTP request thats kept alive for a long time. This is how Server-Sent Events (SSE) works, and its how Google Chat in gmail was first implemented in a way that supported IE 5.5 (!!!). This was a couple years ago now, so the details are a bit fuzzy. And I was relatively new to rust at the time. I was, at the time, still sometimes surprised by the borrow checker. My goal was to make a writable async stream that I could push messages into from other parts of my program. And it also needed backpressure. When you sent messages into the stream, the protocol implementation it encoded them and streamed them into the body of my HTTP response object. I was (I think) using hyper. This is before TAIT was in rust, and for one reason or another I needed to store / reference the future object I was making. (If you use an async fn(), you don't get a name for the Future type the function returns. So I couldn't put the return type in my struct, because I couldn't name it.) So I ended up writing a custom struct that implemented Future, so I could reference the future elsewhere in my code. Hence, implementing Poll myself. I can't honestly remember how Pin came into it all. I think hyper's API for doing this sort of thing stored a Pin or something. I remember at some point trying to write a where clause using higher ranked type bounds to describe the lifetime of a future object that was- or wasn't- associated with the lifetime of the corresponding HTTP request. And that may or may not have been Pinned, and I gave up. It might be fun to revisit this at some point now rust's async support has matured a little. And now that I've matured a lot in how I understand rust. I certainly don't imagine that everyone using async will run into the sort of quagmire that I hit. But this was the first thing I ever really wanted to do with async rust, and it felt horrible to fall on my face trying. reply raggi 34 minutes agorootparentWhen I worked on Fuchsia and we had a heavily async set of system interfaces, users went through this learning path very regularly, and it was very painful for many. Folks who reached out for help early in their first engagement on this kind of path got help and following a \"learn by doing\" started to understand what was going on after a few iterations of the same challenge. Those who struggled trying to figure it out all on their own had a really awful time and in one example even went back to c++ for a sizable project because of the wall they ran into. There's a big gap here for folks who want to self-help their way through this. TAIT reduces the number of cases that come up, but there are still plenty. Reflecting on a point from the article, it's possible that the ?Move being required in every declaration might have been better on this aspect. The point here about not being able to remember where the requirement to deal with Pin comes from is an indicator: the virality of the key traits involved, along with implicit implementation is a particularly tricky mix, it leads to action at a distance, which is also why first time engagements are so hard for users. Mix in some misunderstandings and you're in nope territory. reply withoutboats3 4 hours agorootparentprevThanks for your write up. This sounds like a perfect use case for async generators (which yield many times and compile to Stream instead of Future), a feature I hope Rust will gain in the next year or two. To receive messages from other parts of the program, I would have the async generator hold the receiving end of a channel. reply sophacles 2 hours agorootparentprev> Async rust is horrible. Especially compared to futures / promises in almost any other language. Having written a bunch of async code over 20 years (first exposure was twisted in the early 2000s and all sorts of stuff since - including manual function/stack wrangling on my own reactor), async in rust is like many other things in rust: It forces you to deal with the problems up-front rather than 6-12 months later once something is in prod. It helps to stop and understand why the compiler is yelling at you - for me anyway once I do grok that I'm glad I didn't have a repeat of $BUG_THAT_TOOK_DOWN_PROD_FOR_A_WEEK - that was a bad week. reply orf 9 hours agoprevI think “Pin” is a good example of a technically correct but hard to understand name. “Drop” has a much more familiar meaning because it’s a common action, whereas “pinning” isn’t so common and can mean different things in different contexts. Rather than “pin!(…)”, would “immovable!(…)” be any better? Probably not, and it’s difficult to think of a better one. So maybe a shorthand “colloquial” name doesn’t make sense, and something descriptive like “prevent_moving!(…)” and a PreventMove trait might be better? reply jollyllama 6 hours agoparentIt's a bad name for any application handling a Personal Identification Number of any kind. reply raggi 49 minutes agoprevI think most people get a partial idea of what Pin is fairly quickly when they try, but that's part of the problem. They struggle a lot more with Unpin, and particularly the dynamics as code changes. This comes up more often than in probably should in an async context. (re. \"should\", the problem is it shows up because of closure changes most often, and the errors (last I was teaching) take the user to the wrong place, typically the just need to allocate, but there's no practicum on their error understanding path, see below). Users are integrating a change of some kind, get a compiler error and then struggle even further to really understand when and how the unpin marker exists, but a change, potentially at a fair distance from the code that they're editing, is now making compilation time demands that they both understand and address the issue. When those users enter the argument with rustc, they come to a page that starts with: Implementing the Unpin trait for T expresses the fact that T is pinning-agnostic: it shall not expose nor rely on any pinning guarantees. This, in turn, means that a Pin-wrapped pointer to such a type can feature a fully unrestricted API. In other words, if T: Unpin, a value of type T will not be bound by the invariants which pinning otherwise offers, even when “pinned” by a Pin pointing at it. When a value of type T is pointed at by a Pin, Pin will not restrict access to the pointee value like it normally would, thus allowing the user to do anything that they normally could with a non-Pin-wrapped Ptr to that value. Now this is reasonable documentation if you're in the thick of this universe, but to the average reader this is full of self-referential definition. When you have a weak understanding of Pin, then Unpin being defined in terms of Pin makes no sense, it's the same as Pin being defined in terms of Pin. All of this documentation needs to shift to a \"systems engineering\" or \"in practice\" basis first, and follow with theory. Most users give up with the docs before the second sentence they can't understand. All of the cleverness (reliance on a priori theory) in the docs for these core types needs to be moved out of the way for most readers - replaced by much simpler terminology and practicum suitable for the average knuckledragger. Normal people who end up here in practice are on average already at saturation point for working memory, they have \"no stack space left\" for trying to unpack language theory. reply withoutboats3 2 minutes agoparentI agree that this definition of Unpin should be improved, but I'm confused about the scenario you're describing. When does a user encounter an error because of Unpin? Is it just that they use an API which requires Unpin? If so, what APIs do you encounter causing the issue most often? reply api 5 hours agoprevSuch an insane amount of work to avoid fixing the real problem: the inefficiency of threads. All async code -- all of it -- is a hack to implement lightweight threads through a lot of syntactic sugar for state management. In a language like Rust it adds a ton of complexity that simply doesn't need to exist without it. Fixing the efficiency and scaling issues of threads would make all of this just go away. Poof. Gone. It's a bit like the trillion dollar mistake of \"null\" in languages like Java-- a ton of complexity that results from one design decision (or in this case lack thereof). reply pornel 3 hours agoparentThreads don't support cancellation in any reasonable way. Cancellation is immensely useful for networked applications and for GUIs. Threads make it difficult to fully use CPU and network, without over-subscribing either one. If you start handing off tasks between threadpools, you're on the path to reimplementing futures (or you work on callbacks/events, which make the code fragmented, and which async/await was meant to be a syntax sugar for). The alternative for cancellation and timeouts requires weaving a Context object like golang does, and then having issues with leaf code naively calling functions that don't obey the Context properly, which is only marginally better than pains with non-async functions in async code. reply api 2 hours agorootparentEverything you're describing goes back to problems with thread APIs. I agree that threads as implemented are very coarse grained and limited. What I dislike is the idea of inflicting an explosion of cognitive load onto the programmer to manually manage things instead of thinking about how to implement a better kind of thread. The latter is what Go did. I'm not a giant Go fan but not having async is far and away the best thing about the language and makes up for almost all its other faults. Anything the language makes the programmer think about detracts from the programmer's ability to think about the actual problem they are solving. BTW Rust is still superior to C++ and I use it, so I am not dissing Rust too badly. The async cancer is found across the entire ecosystem, not just Rust, so my comment was more against async programming in general as opposed to getting threading right. If we could get threading right we would massively simplify all programming everywhere. Ultimately it boils down to the fact that it's 2024 and we still run everything on 1970s operating systems. reply umanwizard 2 hours agoparentprevI doubt rewriting the Linux kernel to \"fix the efficiency and scaling issues of threads\" is possible, but even if it is, the Rust experts who figured out how to get Pin to work are presumably not the same as the set of kernel experts who would be capable of doing so. So what do you think they should have done, concretely? Just thrown up their hands and said \"well, we won't add async to our language, because in theory someday someone might fix Linux to make threads magically fast\" ? reply withoutboats3 4 hours agoparentprevMarking the difference between a function that synchronizes with a concurrent process and a function that does not is good, actually. reply davery22 3 hours agorootparentIf I could ask independently of the sentiment of this thread - I am genuinely curious: Why is marking the difference good?

The harmful decisions Rust made highlight its ingrained culture of doubling down on previous mistakes at all costs.

I'd just wager that the effort of getting something like that into shape is smaller than the costs of async/await. (And no, Rust's playing with green threads once 15 years ago and failing due to quality-of-implementation issues is not an excuse to dismiss everything that came after it off the bat.) Though it's probably not worth discussing this whole topic with Rust fans currently: Many made async/await part of their personality and have little experience to offer besides breathlessly pointing to one of the half dozen blog articles trying to defend async/await.

This is very often needed for FFI callbacks, among others. 1. trivial copies. This is similar to 2, but means you do not have to do `swap`-like things in cases for non-destructive moves (which are, in fact, also important, they just shouldn't be the only kind of move. Note that supporting destructive moves likely implies supporting destructuring). 2. trivial moves. You can just use `memcpy`, `realloc`, etc. This is the only kind of move supported by Rust. C++ can introspect for it but with severe limitations. Note that \"trivial\" does NOT mean \"cheap\"; memory can be large. 3. moves with retroactive fixup (old address considered dead). What you do here is call `realloc` or whatever, then pass the old address (or the delta?) to a fixup function so that it (possibly with offset) can be replaced with the new address. Great caution is required to avoid UB by C's rules (the delta approach may be safer?). The compiler needs to be able to optimize this into the preceding when the fixup turns out to be empty (since generic wrapper classes may not know if their fields are trivially-movable or not). 4. full moves (both old and new address ranges are valid at the same time). C++ is the only language I know that supports this (though it is limited to non-destructive moves). One major use for this is maintaining \"peer pointers\" without forcing an extra allocation. Note that this can be simulated on top of \"no moves\" with some extra verbosity (C++98 anyone?). Related to this, it really is essential for allocators to provide a \"reallocate in place if possible, else fail\" function, to avoid unnecessary move-constructor calls. Unfortunately, real-world allocators do not actually avoid copies if you use `malloc_usable_size` + `realloc`. If emitting C, note that you must avoid `__attribute__((malloc))` etc. to avoid setting off the bug-laden-piece-of-crap that is `__builtin_dynamic_object_size`. Random reminder that \"conditionally insert and move my object(s) into a container (usually a map), but keep my object alive if an equal one was already there\" is important, and most languages do it pretty badly.

    "title": "Jiff: Datetime library for Rust",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff",
    "originBody": "Jiff Jiff is a datetime library for Rust that encourages you to jump into the pit of success. The focus of this library is providing high level datetime primitives that are difficult to misuse and have reasonable performance. Jiff supports automatic and seamless integration with the Time Zone Database, DST aware arithmetic and rounding, formatting and parsing zone aware datetimes losslessly, opt-in Serde support and a whole lot more. Jiff takes enormous inspiration from Temporal, which is a TC39 proposal to improve datetime handling in JavaScript. Dual-licensed under MIT or the UNLICENSE. Documentation API documentation on docs.rs Comparison with chrono, time, hifitime and icu The API design rationale for Jiff Example Here is a quick example that shows how to parse a typical RFC 3339 instant, convert it to a zone aware datetime, add a span of time and losslessly print it: use jiff::{Timestamp, ToSpan}; fn main() -> Result { let time: Timestamp = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse()?; let zoned = time.intz(\"America/New_York\")?.checked_add(1.month().hours(2))?; assert_eq!(zoned.to_string(), \"2024-08-10T23:14:00-04:00[America/New_York]\"); // Or, if you want an RFC3339 formatted string: assert_eq!(zoned.timestamp().to_string(), \"2024-08-11T03:14:00Z\"); Ok(()) } There are many more examples in the documentation. Usage Jiff is on crates.io and can be used by adding jiff to your dependencies in your project's Cargo.toml. Or more simply, just run cargo add jiff. Here is a complete example that creates a new Rust project, adds a dependency on jiff, creates the source code for a simple datetime program and then runs it. First, create the project in a new directory: $ mkdir jiff-example $ cd jiff-example $ cargo init Second, add a dependency on jiff: $ cargo add jiff Third, edit src/main.rs. Delete what's there and replace it with this: use jiff::{Unit, Zoned}; fn main() -> Result { let now = Zoned::now().round(Unit::Second)?; println!(\"{now}\"); Ok(()) } Fourth, run it with cargo run: $ cargo run Compiling jiff v0.1.0 (/home/andrew/rust/jiff) Compiling jiff-play v0.1.0 (/home/andrew/tmp/scratch/rust/jiff-play) Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.37s Running `target/debug/jiff-play` 2024-07-10T19:54:20-04:00[America/New_York] The first time you run the program will show more output like above. But subsequent runs shouldn't have to re-compile the dependencies. Crate features Jiff has several crate features for customizing support for Rust's standard library, serde support and whether to embed a copy of the Time Zone Database into your binary. The \"crate features\" section of the documentation lists the full set of supported features. Future plans My plan is to iterate on the Jiff API and make occasional breaking change releases over the next ~year. Assuming API breaking changes have settled down after about one year's time, my plan will be to release Jiff 1.0 and commit to the API for a long period of time. (Measured, at least, in years.) The purpose of this plan is to get Jiff to a 1.0 stable state as quickly as possible. The reason is so that others feel comfortable relying on Jiff as a public dependency that won't cause ecosystem churn. Performance The most important design goal of Jiff is to be a high level datetime library that makes it hard to do the wrong thing. Second to that is performance. Jiff should have reasonable performance, but there are likely areas in which it could improve. See the bench directory for benchmarks. Platform support The question of platform support in the context of datetime libraries comes up primarily in relation to time zone support. Specifically: How should Jiff determine the time zone transitions for an IANA time zone identifier like Antarctica/Troll? How should Jiff determine the default time zone for the current system? Both of these require some level of platform interaction. For discovering time zone transition data, Jiff relies on the IANA Time Zone Database. On Unix systems, this is usually found at /usr/share/zoneinfo, although it can be configured via the TZDIR environment variable (which Jiff respects). On Windows, Jiff will automatically embed a copy of the time zone database into the compiled library. For discovering the system time zone, Jiff reads /etc/localtime on Unix. On Windows, Jiff reads the Windows-specific time zone identifier via GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation and then maps it to an IANA time zone identifier via Unicode's CLDR XML data. I expect Jiff to grow more support for other platforms over time. Please file issues, although I will likely be reliant on contributor pull requests for more obscure platforms that aren't easy for me to test. Dependencies At time of writing, it is no accident that Jiff has zero dependencies on Unix. In general, my philosophy on adding new dependencies in an ecosystem crate like Jiff is very conservative. I consider there to be two primary use cases for adding new dependencies: When a dependency is practically required in order to interact with a platform. For example, windows-sys for discovering the system time zone on Windows. When a dependency is necessary for inter-operability. For example, serde. But even here, I expect to be conservative, where I'm generally only willing to depend on things that have fewer breaking change releases than Jiff. A secondary use case for new dependencies is if Jiff gets split into multiple crates. I did a similar thing for the regex crate for very compelling reasons. It is possible that will happen with Jiff as well, although there are no plans for that. And in general, I expect the number of crates to stay small, if only to make keep maintenance lightweight. (Managing lots of semver API boundaries has a lot of overhead in my experience.) Minimum Rust version policy This crate's minimum supported rustc version is 1.70.0. The policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate can be increased in minor version updates. For example, if jiff 1.0 requires Rust 1.20.0, then jiff 1.0.z for all values of z will also require Rust 1.20.0 or newer. However, jiff 1.y for y > 0 may require a newer minimum version of Rust.",

I suppose if you don't like that you can just write: let span = Span::new().days(5).hours(8).minutes(1); at the expense of a couple characters, which is not too bad. reply DemocracyFTW2 13 hours agoparentI stumbled over use jiff::{Timestamp, ToSpan}; fn main() -> Result { let time: Timestamp = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse()?; I seem to remember Rust does that thing with interfaces instead of classes, is it that? How come I import a library and all of a sudden strings have a `parse()` method that despite its generic name results in a `Timestamp` object? or is it the left-hand side that determines which meaning `str.parse()` should have? What if I have two libraries, one for dates and one for say, Lisp expressions that both augment strings with a `parse()` method? Why use this syntax at all, why not, say, `Timestamp.parse( str )`? I have so many questions. reply kam 12 hours agorootparent`parse` is actually an inherent method on `str` that always exists: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/primitive.str.html#method.par... Its return type is generic, and here it's inferred from the left hand side. It's implemented using the `FromStr` trait, and you can equivalently write `Timestamp::from_str(t)`. You're thinking of the \"extension trait\" pattern for using traits to add methods to existing types when the trait in scope, but that's not what's going on here. Jiff's `ToSpan` mentioned above is an example of that pattern, though: https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/trait.ToSpan.html reply nindalf 12 hours agorootparentprevAll of these options work and are equivalent. - let time = Timestamp::parse(\"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\")?; - let time: Timestamp = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse()?; - let time = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse::()?; You’re free to choose whatever you prefer, although the compiler needs to be able to infer the type of time. If it can’t, it’ll let you know. So a fourth option is allowed, as long as the subsequent lines make the type of time unambiguous. - let time = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse()?; This is a direct consequence of Timestamp implementing the FromStr trait. reply Sharlin 11 hours agorootparentlet time = Timestamp::from_str(\"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\")?; I think you meant :) reply nindalf 10 hours agorootparentHaha, yes I did. If only the HN textbox integrated with rust-analyzer, it would have caught the mistake. reply nrabulinski 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s because Timestamp implements the FromStr trait which is one of the first traits everyone learns about when learning rust. So when you say that your value is a Timestamp and the expression is string.parse()?, the compiler knows that it has to use the implementation which returns a Timestamp. There will never be two libraries that clash because of Rust’s orphan rule: you can only implement either a trait which you define on any type, or define a foreign trait on a type which you define, so there’s no way for some random library to also ship an implementation of FromStr for Timestamp reply Tigress8780 12 hours agorootparentprevRust will determine what `parse` does based on the inferred return type (which is being explicitly set to `Timestamp` here). This is possible when the return type has `FromStr` trait. reply 0x457 1 hour agorootparentprev> I have so many questions. Not being snarky, but I suggest starting by reading at least a little about traits? None of your questions are really about this library - it's just FromStr and an orphan rule. reply csomar 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's implied. Here is the full syntax. > let time: Timestamp = \"2024-07-11T01:14:00Z\".parse::()?; reply dhosek 12 hours agorootparentThat :: thing at the end is called a turbofish. It is rarely necessary to give it explicitly (but sometimes you do when the compiler cannot infer the return type on its own—thusfar in my own rust coding I’ve needed it exactly once). reply bluejekyll 5 hours agorootparentIt’s useful to know the full syntax, I’ve definitely encountered needing it more than one time. reply frereit 12 hours agoparentprevI agree. Personally, I'd prefer let span = 5.days() + 8.hours() + 1.minutes(); reply mutatio 11 hours agorootparentLooks like it should be supported: https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/struct.Span.html#impl-Add%3... reply wging 3 hours agorootparentThat isn't an implementation of addition between Spans and other Spans. It looks like there isn't one in the library right now. `impl Add for &'a Zoned` means a borrow of Zoned is on the left hand side, and a Span on the right. So it says that if z is a Zoned (not a Span) and s is a Span, you can do `&z + s` to add a span to a Zoned. There are a bunch of implementations there, DateTime + Span, Date + Span, Time + Span, Offset + Span. All with Span on the right, but none for Span + Span (nor Span + &Span, or &Span + &Span, ...). reply burntsushi 2 hours agorootparentThis is correct. You can't do a `span1 + span2`. You'd have to use `span1.checked_add(span2)`. The main problem I had with overloading `+` for span addition is that, in order to add two spans with non-uniform units (like years and months), you need a relative datetime. So `+` would effectively have to panic if you did `1.year() + 2.months()`, which seems like a horrific footgun. It would be plausible to make `+` for spans do _only_ component wise addition, but this would be an extremely subtle distinction between `+` and `Span::checked_add`. To the point where sometimes `+` and `checked_add` would agree on the results and sometimes they wouldn't. I think that would also be bad. So I started conservative for the time being: no `+` for adding spans together. reply csomar 12 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if OP will accept a PR for such a change. Your proposal is much readable and flexible (it's not clear from the docs if you can add random time ranges together). Plus, you'll be able to create your own ranges like `1.decade` or `1.application_timeframe` and add/subtract them. reply mijoharas 11 hours agorootparentprevHave you checked the API to see if that works? I imagine it does. reply coldtea 3 hours agoparentprevI like your version's consistency. The original looks like something Ruby would do. reply waterhouse 41 minutes agoparentprevOr 0.days(5).hours(8).minutes(1)? reply tempodox 29 minutes agorootparentCool, that gives us 0-days. reply tomas789 13 hours agoparentprevI agree with that. In my thought process is to specify what I’m doing and only then some details. This is the other way around. When reading the code, it would be better to see that I’m dealing with span at first. reply Sharlin 11 hours agoparentprevYeah, or there could simply be a `days()` free function (and equivalents of the other methods too). No need for struct constructors to be associated functions. reply creata 10 hours agorootparentI haven't tried it (so I'm sorry if it's wrong or not what you're talking about) but can't you get a freestanding days function by use jiff::ToSpan::days; reply the_mitsuhiko 10 hours agorootparentYou cannot import trait methods as free standing functions. I'm not sure if there was a discussion about making this a possibility but it's definitely not something you can do today. reply dathinab 40 minutes agorootparentmultiple discussions happened for this and I don't quite remember the outcome. But it's much less simple then it seems. Because `use Trait::method` would not be one (potential generic) method but a group of them so it would be it's own kind of thing working differently to free functions etc. Furthermore as generics might be on the trait you might not be able to fill them in with `::` and even if you fill them in you also wouldn't be able to get a function pointer without having a way to also specify the type the trait is implemented on. All of this (and probably more issues) are solvable AFIK but in context of this being a minor UX benefit its IMHO not worth it, 1. due to additional compiler complexity but also due to 2. additional language complexity. Through maybe it will happen if someone really cares about it. Anyway until then you can always define a free function which just calls the method, e.g. `fn default() -> T { T::default() }`. (Which is probably roughly how `use` on a trait method would work if it where a thing.) reply the_mitsuhiko 12 minutes agorootparentIgnoring the technical and UX complexities the desire is somewhat obvious. Particularly for things like ::default(). reply creata 9 hours agorootparentprevOh, sorry about that then. reply gpderetta 10 hours agoparentprevCan you do 5.days() + 8.hours() + 1.minutes()? reply Galanwe 13 hours agoparentprevIf only Rust had named function parameters, you could write what is IMHO the most readable option: Span::new(days=5, hours=8, minutes=1) reply _flux 11 hours agorootparentYes, that could've been lended almost as-is from OCaml, in particular as Rust doesn't have partial application so optional arguments would work out-of-the-box as well. reply berkes 11 hours agorootparentAre named arguments on the roadmap somewhere? Or is it a won't-fix? reply PoignardAzur 10 hours agorootparentThe feature is controversial enough that it's basically a wontfix. reply _flux 9 hours agorootparentIs it really, though? I didn't read all the comments, but the ones I read, very few were opposing the concept as such: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-named-arguments/16... However, many were opposing overloading the same pre-rfc was suggesting. reply darby_nine 9 hours agorootparentI'm guessing that general support doesn't translate to support for a specific syntax with changes to the calling convention. I wouldn't put money on this coming together any time soon. reply _flux 10 hours agorootparentprevI haven't seen anything for or against in actual roadmaps. But there is, of course, at least one pre-proposal: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-named-arguments/16... It doesn't think about optional arguments (but somehow does include overloading). And a bit in a related fashion, it doesn't permit for reordering calling arguments, which I consider a downside: > Reordering named arguments when calling > No it is not possible. Just like unnamed arguments and generics, named arguments are also position-based and cannot be reordered when calling: register(name:surname:) cannot be called as register(surname:name:). > Reordering them at the definition site is an API break, just like reordering unnamed arguments or generics is an API break already. The rationale for this expressed in the comments says it's incompatible with overloading, but to me I don't see why named arguments and overloading should go hand-in-hand—or, indeed, how desirable overloading is in the first place. Or why should overloading be able to overload that kind of scenario. The other reasons for this don't seem really problems at all. > fn func2(pub name: u32, name hidden: u32) { /\\* ... */ } > fn func3(name hidden1: u32, name hidden2: u32) { /* ... */ } > func2 and func3 could work in theory: named arguments as proposed in this RFC are position-based and their internal names are different: just like two arguments can have the same type without ambiguity, those functions could be allowed. Maybe there are technical reasons that are simpler when considering type compatibility between function types that have or don't have labeled arguments? Seems the proposal has misunderstood something about OCaml labeled arguments when placing it under https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-named-arguments/16... , though. In addition the proposal doesn't seem to have a neat syntax for forwarding named parameters, like in constructing records you can just fill in a field called foo by mentioning its name by itself—or, like in OCaml you can have let foo ~bar = bar + 1 let baz ~bar = foo ~bar let main () = baz ~bar:42 If it used the .-prefix as mentioned as an idea elsewhere, then this too could be naturally expressed. Maybe there are other ideas how to go about the labeled arguments, though that one seems pretty well thought-out. One thing I've enjoyed with Python (and Mypy) is the ability to require the caller to use named arguments with the asterisk marker in the parameter list. This idea is mentioned in the proposal. reply DemocracyFTW2 12 hours agorootparentprevcould you do that with `struct` / `record` fields? In JavaScript which doesn't have named function parameters either I often write functions with a single `cfg` parameter that are called like `f({ hours: 2, seconds: 53, })` which I find nice b/c it re-uses existing data structures. reply devanl 12 hours agorootparentIn Rust, you can't implicitly omit fields when instantiating a struct, so it would have to be a bit more verbose, explicitly using Rust's analog to the spread syntax. It would have to look something like: f({ hours: 2, seconds: 53, ..Default::default() }) The defaults could come from some value / function with a name shorter than Default::default(), but it would be less clear. reply estebank 4 hours agorootparentAdding support for struct default field values would allow for - leaving some mandatory fields - reduce the need for the builder pattern - enable the above to be written as f(S { hours: 2, seconds: 53, .. }) If that feature ever lands, coupled with structural/anonymous structs or struct literal inference, you're getting everything you'd want from named arguments without any of the foot guns. reply kibwen 1 hour agorootparentHas anyone ever proposed it? It's such a straightforward feature with such obvious semantics (\"default field values are const contexts\") and impossible-to-bikeshed syntax (`a: i32 = 42`) that I've been meaning to write up an RFC myself for around, oh, ten years now... reply Galanwe 12 hours agorootparentprevWell the beautiful thing about software engineering is that pretty much everything is possible, it essentially boils down to \"but should you really\"? :-) reply 4hg4ufxhy 12 hours agorootparentprevKind of inefficient. Also it's less ergonomic since every struct is it's own type, so you need to have the signature on both sides. reply benmmurphy 11 hours agorootparentIt should compile to the same because a struct passed by value is loaded into the registers the same as method arguments. reply nurettin 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm all for named parameters. C++ is sorely lacking that feature as well. Currently using vs code with C++, I like how it handles the missing language feature by adding a grayed out parameter name before the value for function calls and initializers. Maybe there is something like that for rust. reply hypeatei 7 hours agorootparentThese are called \"inlay hints\" and exist for most editors/languages. reply umanwizard 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, editors can be configured to do the same thing for rust. reply magnio 5 hours agoprevI have seen many people downplaying the complexity of a datetime library. \"Just use UTC/Unix time as an internal representation\", \"just represent duration as nanoseconds\", \"just use offset instead of timezones\", and on and on For anyone having that thought, try reading through the design document of Jiff (https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/master/DESIGN.md), which, as all things burntsushi do, is excellent and extensive. Another good read is the comparison with (mainly) chrono, the de facto standard datetime library in Rust: https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/_documentation/comparison/i... Stuffs like DST arithmetic (that works across ser/de!), roundable duration, timezone aware calendar arithmetic, retrospective timezone conflict detection (!), etc. all contribute to a making the library correct, capable, and pleasant to use. In my experience, chrono is a very comprehensive and \"correct\" library, but it is also rigid and not very easy to use. reply TacticalCoder 4 hours agoparentI love burntsushi's ripgrep and certainly use it all the time, calling it directly from my beloved Emacs (and I do invoke it all the time). If was using ripgrep already years before Debian shipped rg natively. I was also using JodaTime back when some people still though Eclipse was better than IntelliJ IDEA. But there's nothing in that document that contradicts: \"just represent duration as nanoseconds\". Users needs to see timezones and correct hour depending on DST, sure. Programs typically do not. Unless you're working on stuff specifically dealing with different timezones, it's usually a very safe bet to: \"represent duration as milliseconds/nanoseconds\". That humans have invented timezones and DST won't change the physics of a CPU's internal clock ticking x billion times per second. Just look at, say, the kernel of an OS that didn't crash on half the planet a few days ago: there are plenty of timeouts in code expressed as milliseconds. Reading your comment could be misinterpreted as: \"We'll allow a 30 seconds cooldown, so let's take the current timezone, add 30 seconds to that, save that time as a string with the time 30 seconds from now, complete with its timezone, DST, 12/24 hours representation and while we're at it maybe add exta code logic to check if there's going to be a leap second or not to make sure we don't wait 29 or 31 seconds, then let the cooldown happen at the 'correct' time\". Or you could, you know, just use a freakin' 30 seconds timeout/cooldown expressed in milliseconds (without caring about whether a leap second happened or not btw because we don't care if it actually happens after 29 seconds as seen by the user). reply burntsushi 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what the issue is here exactly, but there are surely use cases where a `std::time::SystemTime` (which you can think of as a Unix timestamp) is plenty sufficient. ripgrep, for example, uses `SystemTime`. But it has never used a datetime library. Just because Jiff exists doesn't all of a sudden mean you can't use `SystemTime`. But there's a whole world above and beyond timestamps. reply tijsvd 4 hours agorootparentprevOf course you don't need a calendar library to measure 30 seconds. That's not the use case. Try adding one year to a timestamp because you're tracking someone's birthday. Or add one week because of running a backup schedule. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparentprevUnless you're just using time information to implement a stopwatch on your program, anything you do with time will eventually have to deal with timezones, and DSTs, and leap seconds, and tons of other intricasies. Even something as simple as schedulling a periodic batch process. reply throwawaymaths 4 hours agorootparentprev> That humans have invented timezones and DST won't change the physics of a CPU's internal clock ticking x billion times per second. Increasingly we are programming in distributed systems. One milli or nano on one node is not a milli or nano on another node, and that is physics that is more inviolable. reply tracker1 4 hours agorootparentIn which case, does being off a few milli actually matter that much in any significant number of those distributed instances? No precision is exact, so near enough, should generally be near enough for most things.

When working with Pandas, there is .tz_convert() and .tz_localize() and that is basically it for timezone conversions. My benchmark for this is: given a date, get first hour of CET/CEST day in UTC. In Pandas a very simple operation. In Chrono, you have to have a NaiveDate, convert to DateTime and then to DateTime. And there is no pattern in those conversions I managed to find. Sometimes it is a member function, other times a static method on the timezone object. I hope somebody will rectify this at some point.

This is mostly caused by using UNIX timestamps instead of TAI internally, and this lib is no different unfortunately. There seems to be some way to support it with tzif files, but it does not have first-class support. Here is the relevant Jiff issue with more details: https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/7 UNIX timestamps don't use the SI second definition (instead it's 1/86000th of the current day, all UNIX seconds don't have the same duration) which breaks all correct duration computations. I understand that the tradeoff was to inherit compat with older time tracking methods and enable faster calendar formatting, I disagree that it was the right trade-off. UNIX timestamps mix representation concerns with data. In my opinion, leap seconds should be treated exactly like the 29th of February or time zones. reply burntsushi 4 hours agoparentWhy do you want it? What's your use case? And why doesn't a specialized scientific library like `hifitime` work for your use case? Whenever people talk about leap seconds, it always seems to be in some abstract notion. But it's very rare to see folks connect them to real world use cases. I get the scientific use case, and I feel like that's well served by specialized libraries. Do we need anything else? I'm not sure that we do. reply LegionMammal978 2 hours agorootparentIt's not really in Rust (at least, not unless I choose to rewrite it in WASM), but there is one case where a lack of leap-second support has really been a thorn in my side. I've been working on and off on a JS web application that performs certain high-precision astronomical calculations, and leap seconds are a big challenge w.r.t. future correctness. Ephemerides don't change very much, but leap seconds can. I can embed a big list into my application, but then I have to remember to periodically update it until 2035, or maybe longer if they decide to keep leap seconds after all. So I can try to download a leap-seconds.list from somewhere, except that only a few sources set \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\", and none promise to keep it set indefinitely. The annoying part is, applications on both Windows (since 10) and Unix-like systems generally have access to up-to-date leap-second information; at worst, browsers can be expected to be updated regularly. But since the JS standards devs want to stick strictly to POSIX time, they provide no means to obtain this information from the inside, through Date, Intl.Locale, or the proposed Temporal. This is all to say, I would really love to always have some way available to get \"all leap-second info that the current system knows about, if it does have any such info\". For its part, hifitime either downloads from a fixed URL (which doesn't have that Access-Control-Allow-Origin header IIRC), consults a fixed list, or gets the user to locate the info, which isn't nearly as general or foolproof as it could be. reply burntsushi 2 hours agorootparentYeah the way Jiff's leap second support worked (before I ripped it out) is that it would just read from `/usr/share/zoneinfo/leap-seconds.list` (or `/usr/share/zoneinfo/leapseconds`, whichever was available) and use that with some rudimentary caching. That way, Jiff isn't responsible for keeping the list up-to-date. The sysadmin is. Just like what we do for tzdb. reply LegionMammal978 1 hour agorootparentIndeed. The problem is, in the absence of one good solution like that, there are no good solutions, as is the case with web JS. Currently (on the desktop or laptop), the best bet is hifitime's leap-seconds parser, but then the programmer is still responsible for coming up with a sane fallback path for all their target systems. (Which can be tricky for individuals to do, e.g., I have no way to tell whether the tz database is in an expected location on macOS or iOS.) reply demurgos 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is about the \"pit of success\", being correct and predictable by default. A difference of timestamps not returning the corresponding elapsed wall-time is _very_ surprising. I want to be able to compute durations between timestamps stored in the DB, received from API calls or retrieved from the system and get the right duration \"out of the box\". Computing these durations lets me apply business logic relying on it. A message can be editable for x amount of time, a token is valid for y amount of time, a sanction expires after z amount of time, etc. For example, I want to issue some token valid for 60s. What should I set the expiry time to? `now + 60s`. Except if `now` is 2016-12-31T23:59:30Z, then most libs will return a time 61s in the future. 1 second may not be a big error, but it's still an error and depending on context it may be relevant. This is a systematic error unrelated to time sync / precision concerns, so it's pretty frustrating to see it being so common. It seems though that we won't have any new leap seconds in the near future so eventually it will just become a curiosity from the past and we'll be stuck with a constant offset between UNIX and TAI. > I feel like that's well served by specialized libraries. Agreed that you need a specialized lib for this, but my point is that _you shouldn't have to_ and the current situation is a failure of software engineering. Computing `t2 - t1` in a model assuming global synchronized time should not be hard. I don't mean it as a personal critique, this is not an easy problem solve since UNIX timestamps are baked almost everywhere. It's just disappointing that we still have to deal with this. reply burntsushi 3 hours agorootparentWhat I'm not clear on though is what the failure mode is in your scenario. What happens when it's wrong? Does something bad happen? If something is one second longer or shorter than what it ought to be on very rare occasions, then what does wrong? I would, for example, imagine that the business use case of \"editable for x amount of time\" would be perfectly fine with that being plus-or-minus 1 second. It's not just about correctness, it's about the error and what it means. A few months ago, Jiff did have leap second support. It worked. I know how to do it, but none of the arguments in its favor seem to justify its complexity. Especially when specialized libraries exist for it. You can't look at this in a vacuum. By make a general purpose datetime library more complex, you risk the introduction of new and different types of errors by users of the library that could be much worse than the errors introduced by missing leap second support. reply egnehots 12 minutes agorootparentI think that you have made the right decision. One of the most common and high-impact failure mode is crashing when parsing a leap second that is represented as \"23:59:60\". Jiff is able to parse leap seconds, and beyond that, I doubt that there are many scenarios where you care about leap seconds but not enough to use a library that supports them. reply demurgos 2 hours agorootparentprev> You can't look at this in a vacuum. By make a general purpose datetime library more complex, you risk the introduction of new and different types of errors by users of the library that could be much worse than the errors introduced by missing leap second support. Agreed, I can easily imagine that it could cause situation where some numeric value is not interpreted correctly and it causes a constant offset of 37 seconds. UNIX timestamps are entrenched, so deviating from it introduces misuse risks. Regarding my use-cases, I agree that these ones should still work fine. I could also come up with issues where a 1s error is more meaningful, but they would be artificial. The main problem I can see is using some absolute timestamp instead of a more precise timer in a higher frequency context. Overall, it's the general discussion about correctness VS \"good enough\". I consider that the extra complexity in a lib is warranted if it means less edge cases. reply burntsushi 2 hours agorootparent> Overall, it's the general discussion about correctness VS \"good enough\". I consider that the extra complexity in a lib is warranted if it means less edge cases. Yeah I just tend to have a very expansive view of this notion. I live by \"all models are wrong, but some are useful.\" A Jiff timestamp is _wrong_. Dead wrong. And it's a total lie. Because it is _not_ a precise instant in time. It is actually a reference to a _range_ of time covered by 1,000 picoseconds. So when someone tells me, \"but it's not correct,\"[1] this doesn't actually have a compelling effect on me. Because from where I'm standing, everything is incorrect. Most of the time, it's not about a binary correct-or-incorrect, but a tolerance of thresholds. And that is a much more nuanced thing! [1]: I try hard not to be a pedant. Context is everything and sometimes it's very clear what message is being communicated. But in this context, the actual ramifications of incorrectness really matters here, because it gets to the heart of whether they should be supported or not. reply airstrike 4 hours agoprev> Jiff is pronounced like \"gif\" with a soft \"g,\" as in \"gem.\" Over my dead body! reply faitswulff 4 hours agoparentWell, it had a good run at the top of hackernews for a minute, but I think we can all see its glaring flaws now.

This is one thing I really like about Durations, they can't be negative and therefore match physical reality. reply burntsushi 3 hours agoparentISO 8601-2:2019 defines it as: negative duration: duration in the reverse direction to the proceeding time scale Matching \"physical reality\" is a non-goal. What's important is modeling the problem domain in a way that makes sense to programmers and helps them avoid mistakes. A negative span doesn't give you any extra expressivity that \"subtract a span from a datetime\" doesn't already give you. Both are a means to go backwards in time. And they line up with human concepts that talk about the past. So for example, if I say, \"I went camping 1 year ago.\" I am expressing a concept that is modeled by a negative span. And there are also just practical benefits to allowing a span to be signed. For example: use jiff::{ToSpan, Unit, Zoned}; fn main() -> anyhow::Result { let now = Zoned::now().intz(\"Europe/Kyiv\")?; let next_year = now.checked_add(1.year())?; let span = now.since((Unit::Month, &next_year))?; println!(\"{span}\"); Ok(()) } Has this output: $ cargo -q r -P12m If negative spans weren't supported, what would the behavior of this routine be? It could return an error. Or maybe an out-of-band sign. I'm not sure. But this seems like the most sensible thing. And of course, Temporal has negative durations too. This design was copied from them. reply jcgrillo 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the explanation. I agree signed spans make it easier to express concepts like \"1 year ago\" vs \"1 year from now\". And clearly if the concept of a negative duration has made it into the standard then it makes sense to support it. But I do wonder if there's some value still in being precise, if I think I've measured a negative duration--e.g I look at my watch and write down t0, wait a bit, look at my watch again and write down t1 and find t0 > t1--that's something surprising that probably warrants further investigation. The explanation likely isn't \"well time just went backwards for a bit there\" :P. This happens frequently in computers, though, so maybe making the programmer handle an error each time is excessive. reply burntsushi 2 hours agorootparentYeah it's hard for me to get a sense of where that would really matter in practice, or even when it would be correct to do so. You could a `assert!(!span.is_negative());`. Although, you have to be careful, because system time can change arbitrarily. Your watch example is actually an important use case that specifically isn't served by Jiff. You should be using monotonic time (in Rust, that's `std::time::Instant`) for things like that. In that case, you really do get a guarantee that the duration between two instants (one in the past and one in the future) is non-negative. And if it weren't, then that would be worthy of an assert. But you get no such guarantees with system time. reply zokier 7 hours agoprevWhile this does seem to be an improvement in general, I find it extremely disappointing that we now got another, greenfield, library that ignores leap seconds and continues the propagation of UNIXy time. I appreciate that it was at least informed decision, and seems to have been tough call to make. So full respect to burntsushi nevertheless. That makes it mostly uninteresting to me; nice api is nice to have, but I'd personally appreciate correct results more. From the wider ecosystem C++ std::chrono seems like the only one that shows some promise on this front. Last I checked the implementations were not there quite yet though, and the API definitely didn't seem all that pleasant. Maybe in couple of years we'll see how it'll work out. Hifitime 4.0 seems like almost the only option at this point, and it is in early alpha still. I recall using astropy at one point just for time calculations, but it is quite overkill solution. The quest for perfect datetime lib (for any language) continues. reply burntsushi 5 hours agoparentCan you say why you wouldn't want to use a TAI time zone? Like, generate the TZif data for TAI and then just do `jiff::tz::TimeZone(\"TAI\", tzif_data)`. Then you'll get leap second accurate durations. Can you also say why you need the precision? Like, what's the use case? What happens if your program computes durations that are off because of leap seconds? reply spenczar5 4 hours agorootparentI work in astronomy, on detection of asteroids. Catalogs of historical asteroid detections may be reported in UTC from some observatories for historical reasons. Finding a trajectory that matches several candidate detections is called “linking” and it is very sensitive to time. Being off by even one second will result in a predicted position which is far off course, and so a candidate asteroid detection will not be linked. Linking is not quite sensitive enough to demand a relativistic time scale, but definitely sensitive enough to require correct leap seconds. reply burntsushi 4 hours agorootparentRight, but I address this in the issue linked elsewhere in this thread: https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/7 Like yes, scientific applications are a very valid use case for this. But scientific applications usually want other things not afforded by general purpose datetime libraries, like large time ranges and high precision. What I ask in that issue, and what I don't understand, is why folks who want leap second support aren't happy with using specialized libraries for that task, and instead request that leap second support be added to general purpose datetime libraries. reply spenczar5 4 hours agorootparentYeah, I use the specialized libraries. But in Python, this has been painful: the good astronomy library is Astropy’s Time, but everyone uses datetime. So if I want to use a third library - for my database, or for making plots, or whatever - it will use datetime, and now I have to think really hard about how to do conversions. You can imagine how hard that is to get right! Since Jiff hopes to be ubiquitous (I think? Seems that way) it would be nice if this sort of thing could be avoided. Time is such a fundamental in many APIs that having one common library is very important. reply burntsushi 3 hours agorootparentI think I would rather see this supported by paved path conversions to-and-from the specialized library. It's very hard to be all things to all people because there are irreducible trade-offs. The linked issue does a tortured tour through the trade-offs. I found it very difficult to wire in leap second support in a way that was satisfying. And even if Jiff supported leap seconds, that doesn't mean it would be well suited for scientific applications. Do you need more precision than nanoseconds? Do you need a bigger range than -9999 to 9999? If so, those come at the cost of everyone else by using bigger representations. They _could_ be opt-in crate features, but now we're talking about non-trivial additional maintenance/testing burden. IDK, maybe there is a way to unify everything in a satisfying way, but they seem way too different to me. reply zokier 3 hours agorootparentprevGoing through TAI is probably the best way for me, I'll have to play around with Jiff to see how practical that is. I'm glad if there is good support for TAI though! One random use-case (reminded by other thread on the front-page) is that I occasionally have needed to analyze some logs, and get some stats from the data. For example having logs like \"2024-07-24T14:46:53.123456Z Foo id=42 started\" and \"2024-07-24T14:46:54.654321Z Foo id=42 finished\", and wanting to get some histogram on how long \"Foo\" took. Sure, ideally you'd have some explicit metrics/tracing system or some other measurements for getting that data, but unfortunately in practice that is not always the case and I have to make do with what I have. Or even more simple, I just want to sort bunch of events to establish a timeline. UNIX style time handling makes that difficult. NTP adjustments can also cause problems in these sort of cases, but at least the systems I work with are usually kept in relatively tight sync so the \"window of uncertainty\" is much less than 1s. reply burntsushi 3 hours agorootparentI think Jiff should handle that log use case pretty fine? That seems pretty standard. Just parse into a `jiff::Timestamp` and then you can sort or whatever. reply kibwen 6 hours agoparentprevBurntsushi explains here in great detail the reasoning for not supporting leap seconds: https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/7 reply zokier 6 hours agorootparentYes, that was what I was referring to with > I appreciate that it was at least informed decision, and seems to have been tough call to make but you are right, having that link here helps others. reply binarycoffee 4 hours agoparentprevTBH I consider the C++ `std::chrono` as the worse possible design. `tai_clock::now` does not actually take into account leap seconds. Unless it does, who knows (\"Implementations may use a more accurate value of TAI time.\"). Likewise, `tai_clock::from_utc/to_utc` does not correct for leap second. It just translates the UTC epoch to the TAI 1958 epoch. I found Hifitime to be very opinionated and give a false sense of security due to its automatic computation of leap seconds based on historical tables. Yes, leap seconds are announced some ~6 month in advance, but what if you don't update regularly the library? Or if you can't because it is deployed on an embedded system? In the end I wrote my own minimalistic TAI timestamp library [1] and made the conscious decision to let the user take the responsibility to deal with leap seconds in UTC conversion. [1] https://github.com/asynchronics/tai-time reply fanf2 6 hours agoparentprevLeap seconds are being abolished. The current rotation speed of the earth is very close to 24h/day and is changing very slowly, so it is not very likely there will be another leap second before they are abolished. reply weinzierl 5 hours agorootparentWhile leap seconds are planned to be abolished, there is no plan to give up the coupling of UTC and the Earth's angle. Leap seconds are just to be replaced by a yet to be defined adjustment, likely leap minutes. If you don't like leap seconds and don't care about a small (but increasing) deviation from Earth's angle you can do so today: Just use TAI. reply zokier 6 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn't change the situation of past leap seconds in any way, those still need to be accounted for. reply spenczar5 4 hours agorootparentThe nice thing is that you would have a static table of leap seconds, and would not need to poll a URL to check for new leap second data (as Astropy does, for example, on import!). reply arijun 13 hours agoprevA little off topic but does anyone know the purpose of dual licensing MIT and the UNLICENSE?

I don't know how they'd respond to your challenge, but here is how I would: \"The freedom to deny the freedom of other people\" is impossibly vague, because \"the freedom of other people\" can mean zillions of things. It's also confusing to talk about since we have two separate freedoms here, so let's talk about the freedom(1) to deny the freedom(2) of other people. Suppose we put \"the freedom to kill other people\" in the freedom(2) slot. Most of us think that isn't a freedom people are entitled to, so the freedom(1) to deny that particular freedom(2) would be a good thing. Suppose we put \"the freedom to breathe the air\" in the freedom(2) slot. Most of us think that is a freedom people are entitled to, so the freedom(1) to deny that particular freedom(2) would be a bad thing. In the present case, what goes in the freedom(2) slot is something more complicated and less clear-cut -- it isn't a Super-Obvious Fundamental Human Right like the right to go on breathing, but it also isn't a Right To Do Very Evil Things like the right to murder. It's something like \"the freedom to read and modify the source code of a particular piece of software\". We demonstrably don't presently have that freedom as regards many widely-used pieces of software; the world's legal systems pretty much unanimously agree that if you put this in the freedom(2) slot then the freedom(1) to deny it is worth having. Why? Well, the usual arguments would be (1) that creating something gives you some rights to limit what other people do with it, and (2) that giving creators some such rights is a good thing overall because it increases the incentives for people to create nice things. Of course you might disagree! (And, also of course, even if you agree with #1 and #2 in the abstract you might think that \"intellectual property\" law as currently implemented across the world is a very bad way to get #1 and #2.) But I hope your reasons are a matter of thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved, not just of saying \"yay freedom\" and therefore denying every instance of \"it's good for X to have the freedom(1) to deny Y's freedom(2) to do Z\". Not least because you literally can't consistently do so in every case -- if you say no one should ever have the freedom(1) to deny freedom(2) to others, whatever specific freedom(2) may be, then what you are calling for is precisely to deny that freedom(1) to others. reply richrichardsson 10 hours agorootparentprev> severely limits freedom of makers of end-user software Ironic for a \"free\" software license. It would be great if there was a license somewhere inbetween GPL and MIT: you'd be required to upstream (or make available) any changes you made to the parts of other people's code you're making use of, but not required to open your entire codebase. reply jstarks 10 hours agorootparentI think the MPL attempts to be that license. reply GoblinSlayer 8 hours agorootparentprevThat's LGPL. reply agosz 8 hours agorootparentprevMPL or CDPL reply nindalf 12 hours agoparentprevBurntsushi has written many important crates in the Rust ecosystem.

It's arguably quite possible, though not as straightforwards as one may hope.

I ask because Result/? along with libraries like thiserror/anyhow/etc. are right there and arguably easier/more concise, so unwarranted unwrap()/etc. would seem \"harder\" to write/justify than the alternative. The main exception I can think of are more one-off cases where the author is intentionally sacrificing robust error handling for the sake of speed/convenience, but that's a more language-agnostic thing that pretty much \"doesn't count\" by definition. > I hope this philosophy do not reach the Linux kernel.

When the dependency chain of library loading is fired, almost always I checked some unwrap ends within the program's runtime, so distinguishing whether those are genuine cases of violations (IMHO they can't be genuine if a lib can panic the program), or if it was just a unfinished prototyping part or etc, I think is not exactly important as individual until it reach terms of generalized behavior along the language libraries, and even seen in some programs of the community. > IIRC this is being worked on, especially given Linus's position on panics in the kernel.

For references/documentation/tutorials I think the use of unwrap() and friends is a tradeoff. It (arguably) allows for more focused/self-contained examples that better showcase a particular aspect, though with the risk that a reader uses those examples as-is without taking other factors into consideration. There's also the fact that documentation examples can be used as tests, in which case use of unwrap() in docs/examples/etc. is arguably a good thing. > And at same time by not being actively promoted that such methods should not be used within a library runtime or similar at least, because many people do not see it as wrong, what convert it in philosophy I guess. I think it might depend on where you're looking. For example, the Rust book has a section titled \"To panic! or Not to panic!\" [0] which outlines some things to consider when deciding whether to panic/call unwrap()/etc. Not sure if that counts as active promotion, but the fact it's in official docs should count for something at least. > IMHO they can't be genuine if a lib can panic the program I feel this is a rather strong position to take. Given how panics are intended to be used (handling unexpected state/precondition violations/etc.), it seems it seems akin to saying \"just don't write bugs\", which would certainly be nice but isn't really realistic for the vast majority of development. I suppose one could hypothetically bubble up every possible error but that comes with its own maintainability/readability/etc. costs. In addition, that stance seems similar to stating that there's no \"genuine\" assertion failures or similar in libraries, which seems... bold?

And yes, it's exactly as ridiculous as you think it is. I'll link my blog on the topic again because I think it might help here as well: https://blog.burntsushi.net/unwrap/ `unwrap()` contains an assertion. Just like `slice[i]` or even `Box::new(whatever)`. The way to avoid these in C is to commit UB instead of panicking. I've seen arguments that seem understandable for why this is maybe appropriate in the Linux kernel (\"I'd rather continue executing with garbage than shut down the user's system\"), but I don't think it applies much beyond that. And to be clear, I'm not saying I agree with that either. reply the_mitsuhiko 8 hours agoparentprevThat is not my experience at all. It’s very rare that libraries unwrap. Beyond example code and tests I rarely see unwrap. reply bigstrat2003 4 hours agoparentprev> I hope this philosophy do not reach the Linux kernel. Well, I hope it does. Albeit it almost certainly will not, because Linus is opposed to it. But ever since I read Joe Duffy's blog posts on the Midori research project at MS, I have been convinced that using panics leads to increased reliability, not decreased. From his blog[1]: \"Given that bugs are inherently not recoverable, we made no attempt to try. All bugs detected at runtime caused something called abandonment, which was Midori’s term for something otherwise known as “fail-fast”.\" And: \"Abandonment, and the degree to which we used it, was in my opinion our biggest and most successful bet with the Error Model. We found bugs early and often, where they are easiest to diagnose and fix.\" I think that the Midori team's work shows that a practice of \"there's a bug, stop everything\" leads to more reliable software. Sure, there's an initial period of pain where you're fixing a ton of bugs as they cause the software to panic. But you reap the rewards of that effort. I don't think Linux will ever move towards a model like this, but I think it would be beneficial in the end if they did. 1: https://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/#bugs-ar... reply burntsushi 8 hours agoparentprevEh?

In the future, these updates will push eBPF code. Friday July 19th provided an unprecedented example of the inherent dangers of kernel programming, and has been called the largest outage in the history of information technology. Windows computers around the world encountered blue-screens-of-death and boot loops, causing outages for hospitals, airlines, banks, grocery stores, media broadcasters, and more. This was caused by a config update by a security company for their widely used product that included a kernel driver on Windows systems. The update caused the kernel driver to try to read invalid memory, an error type that will crash the kernel. For Linux systems, the company behind this outage was already in the process of adopting eBPF, which is immune to such crashes. Once Microsoft's eBPF support for Windows becomes production-ready, Windows security software can be ported to eBPF as well. These security agents will then be safe and unable to cause a Windows kernel crash. eBPF (no longer an acronym) is a secure kernel execution environment, similar to the secure JavaScript runtime built into web browsers. If you're using Linux, you likely already have eBPF available on your systems whether you know it or not, as it was included in the kernel several years ago. eBPF programs cannot crash the entire system because they are safety-checked by a software verifier and are effectively run in a sandbox. If the verifier finds any unsafe code, the program is rejected and not executed. The verifier is rigorous -- the Linux implementation has over 20,000 lines of code -- with contributions from industry (e.g., Meta, Isovalent, Google) and academia (e.g., Rutgers University, University of Washington). The safety this provides is a key benefit of eBPF, along with heightened security and lower resource usage. Some eBPF-based security startups (e.g., Oligo, Uptycs) have made their own statements about the recent outage, and the advantages of migrating to eBPF. Larger tech companies are also adopting eBPF for security. As an example, Cisco acquired the eBPF-startup Isovalent and has announced a new eBPF security product: Cisco Hypershield, a fabric for security enforcement and monitoring. Google and Meta already rely on eBPF to detect and stop bad actors in their fleet, thanks to eBPF's speed, deep visibility, and safety guarantees. Beyond security, eBPF is also used for networking and observability. The worst thing an eBPF program can do is to merely consume more resources than is desirable, such as CPU cycles and memory. eBPF cannot prevent developers writing poor code -- wasteful code -- but it will prevent serious issues that cause a system to crash. That said, as a new technology eBPF has had some bugs in its management code, including a Linux kernel panic discovered by the same security company in the news today. This doesn't mean that eBPF has solved nothing, substituting a vendor's bug for its own. Fixing these bugs in eBPF means fixing these bugs for all eBPF vendors, and more quickly improving the security of everyone. There are other ways to reduce risks during software deployment that can be employed as well: canary testing, staged rollouts, and \"resilience engineering\" in general. What's important about the eBPF method is that it is a software solution that will be available in both Linux and Windows kernels by default, and has already been adopted for this use case. If your company is paying for commercial software that includes kernel drivers or kernel modules, you can make eBPF a requirement. It's possible for Linux today, and Windows soon. While some vendors have already proactively adopted eBPF (thank you), others might need a little encouragement from their paying customers. Please help raise awareness, and together we can make such global outages a lesson of the past. Authors: Brendan Gregg, Intel; Daniel Borkmann, Isovalent; Joe Stringer, Isovalent; KP Singh, Google.

This doesn’t seem grounded in reality. If you follow the link to the “hooks” that Windows eBPF makes available [1], it’s just for incoming packets and socket operations. IOW, MS is expecting you to use the Berkeley Packet Filter for packet filtering. Not for filtering I/O, or object creation/use, or any of the other million places a driver like Crowdstrike’s hooks into the NT kernel. In addition, they need to be in the kernel in order to monitor all the other 3rd party garbage running in kernel-space. ELAM (early-launch anti-malware) loads anti-malware drivers first so they can monitor everything that other drivers do. I highly doubt this is available to eBPF. If Microsoft intends eBPF to be used to replace kernel-space anti-malware drivers, they have a long, long way to go. [1]: https://microsoft.github.io/ebpf-for-windows/ebpf__structs_8... reply brendangregg 5 hours agoparentYes, we know eBPF must attach to equivalent events to Linux, but given there are already many event sources and consumers in Windows, the work is to make eBPF another consumer -- not to invent instrumentation frameworks from scratch. Just to use an analogy: Imagine people do their banking on JavaScript websites with Google Chrome, but if they use Microsoft Edge it says \"JavaScript isn't supported, please download and run this .EXE\". I'm not sure we'd be asking \"if\" Microsoft would support JavaScript (or eBPF), but \"when.\" reply surajrmal 4 hours agorootparentThis assumes eBPF becomes the standard. It's not clear Microsoft wants that. They could create something else which integrates with dot net and push for that instead. Also this problem of too much software running in the kernel in an unbounded manner has long existed. Why should Microsoft suddenly invest in solving it on Windows? reply wongarsu 1 hour agorootparentMicrosoft has invested in solving this for at least two decades, probably longer. They are just using a different (arguably worse) approach to this than the Unix world. In Windows 9x anti-malware would just run arbitrary code in the kernel that hooked whatever it wanted. In Windows XP a lot of these things got proper interfaces (like the file system filter drivers to facilitate scanning files before they are accessed, later replaced by minifilters), and the 64 bit edition of XP introduced PatchGuard [1] to prevent drivers from modifying Microsoft's kernel code. Additionally Microsoft is requiring ever more static and dynamic analysis to allow drivers to be signed (and thus easily deployed). This is a very leaky security barrier. Instead of a hardware-enforced barrier like the kernel-userspace barrier it's an effort to get software running at the same protection level to behave. PatchGuard is a cat-and-mouse game Microsoft is always loosing, and the analysis mostly helps against memory bugs but can't catch everything. But MS has invested a lot of work over the years in attempts to make this path work. So expecting future actions isn't unreasonable. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection reply philistine 4 hours agorootparentprevApple took the lead on this front. It has closed easy access to the kernel by apps, and made a list of APIs to try and replace the lost functionality. Anyone maintaining a kernel module on macOS is stuck in the past. Of course, the target area of macOS is much smaller than Windows, but it is absolutely possible to kick all code, malware and parasitic security services alike, from accessing the kernel. The safest kernel is the one that cannot be touched at runtime. reply nullindividual 4 hours agorootparentI don't think Microsoft has a choice with regards to kernel access. Hell, individuals currently use undocumented NT APIs. I can't imagine what happens to backwards compat if kernel access is closed. Apple's closed ecosystem is entirely different. They'll change architectures on a whim and users will go with the flow (myself included). reply becurious 3 hours agorootparentBut Apple doesn’t have the industrial and commercial uses that Linux and Windows have. Where you can’t suddenly switch out to a new architecture without massive amounts of validation costs. At my previous job they used to use Macs to control scientific instrumentation that needed a data acquisition card. Eventually most of the newer product lines moved over to Windows but one that was used in a validated FDA regulated environment stayed on the Mac. Over time supporting that got harder and harder: they managed through the PowerPC to Intel transition but eventually the Macs with PCIe slots went away. I think they looked at putting the PCIe card in a Thunderbolt enclosure. But the bigger problem is guaranteeing supply of a specific computer for a reasonable amount of time. Very difficult to do these days with Macs. reply adolph 1 minute agorootparentSounds like they need a nice Hackintosh for that validated FDA regulation app-OS-HW combo. nullindividual 2 hours agorootparentprev> validated FDA regulated environment stayed on the Mac Given how long it takes to validate in a GxP environment, and the cost, this makes sense. reply Xunjin 4 hours agorootparentprev> The safest kernel is the one that cannot be touched at runtime. Can you expand what you mean here? Because depending on the application you are running, you will need at least talk with some APIs to get privileged access? reply Agingcoder 1 hour agorootparentBeing allowed to talk to the kernel to get info and running with the same privileges ( basically being able to read / write any memory ) is different. reply odo1242 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, Apple doesn’t allow any user code to run in kernel mode without significant hoops (the kernel is code signed) and tries to provide a user space API (e.g. DriverKit) as an alternative for the missing functionality. Some things (FUSE) are still annoying though. reply brendangregg 4 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft have been driving the work to make eBPF an IETF industry standard. reply riskable 2 hours agorootparent...just like they did with Kerberos! And just like with Kerberos they'll define a standard then refuse to follow it. Instead, they will implement subtle changes to the Windows implementation that make solutions that use Windows eBPF incompatible with anything else, making it much more difficult to write software that works with all platforms eBPF (or even just its output). Everything's gotta be different in Windows land. Otherwise, migrating off of Windows land would be too easy! In case you were wondering what Microsoft refused to implement with its Kerberos implementation it's the DNS records. Instead of following the standard (they wrote!) they decided that all Windows clients will use AD's Global Catalog to figure out which KDC to talk to (e.g. which one is \"local\" or closest to the client). Since nothing but Windows uses the Global Catalog they effectively locked out other platforms from being able to integrate with Windows Kerberos implementation as effectively (it'll still work, just extremely inefficiently as the clients won't know which KDC is local so you either have to hard-code them into the krb5.conf on every single device/server/endpoint and hope for the best or DNS-and-pray you don't get a Domain Controller/KDC that's on an ISDN line in some other country). reply MawKKe 1 hour agorootparentEmbrace, extend, ... reply jrockway 4 minutes agorootparentThis doesn't really seem like their strategy anymore. It's not like Edge directly interprets Typescript, for example. While they embraced and extended Javascript, any extinguishing seems to be on the technical merits rather than corporate will. In the case of security scanners that run in the kernel, we learned this weekend that a market need exists. The mainstream media blamed Crowdstrike's bugs on \"Windows\". Microsoft would likely like to wash its hands of future events of this class. Linux-like eBPF is a path forward for them that allows people to run the software they want (work-slowers like Crowdstrike) while isolating their reputation from this software. numbsafari 1 hour agorootparentprev> Why should Microsoft suddenly invest in solving it on Windows? If they can continue to avoid commercial repercussions for failing to provide a stable and secure system, then society should begin to hold them to account and force them to. I’m not necessarily advocating for eBPF here, either. If they want to get there through some “proprietary” means, so be it. Apple is doing much the same on their end by locking down kexts and providing APIs for user mode system extensions instead. If MS wants to do this with some kind of .net-based solution (or some other fever dream out of MSR) then cool. The only caveat would seem to be that they are under a number of “consent decree” type agreements that would require that their own extensions be implemented on a level playing field. So what. Windows Defender shouldn’t be in the kernel any more than CrowdStrike. Add an API. If that means being able to send eBPF type “programs” into kernel space, cool. If that means some user mode APIs, cool. But lock it down already. reply nullindividual 4 hours agoparentprevMicrosoft already has an extensible file system filter capability in place, which is what current AV uses. Does it make sense to add eBPF on top of that and if so, are there any performance downsides, like we see with file system filters? reply mauvehaus 3 hours agorootparentThey've done a technology transition once already from legacy file system filter drivers to the minifilter model. If they see enough benefit to another change, it wouldn't be unprecedented. Mind you, it looks like after 20-ish years Windows still supports loading legacy filter drivers. Given the considerable work that goes into getting even a simple filesystem minifilter driver working reliably, it's safe to assume that we'd be looking at a similarly protracted transition period. As to the performance, I don't think the raw infrastructure to support minifilters is the major performance hit. The work the drivers themselves end up doing tends to be the bigger hit in my experience.

You cannot prove that any arbitrary piece of code will stop, but you can prove that specific types of code will stop and reject anything that you're unable to prove. The trivial case is \"no jumps\"—if your code executes strictly linearly and is itself finite then you know it will terminate. More advanced cases can also be proven, like a loop over a very specific bound, as long as you can place constraints on how the code can be structured. As an example, take a look at Dafny, which places a lot of restrictions on loops [0], only allowing the subset that it can effectively analyze. [0] https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~agurfink/stqam/rise4fun-Dafny/#h25 reply jkrejcha 2 hours agorootparentAdding on (and it's not terribly relevant to eBPF), it's also worth noting that there are trivial programs you can prove DON'T halt.

That's the premise. reply umanwizard 5 hours agorootparentprevWell it is useful in practice, there are some pretty useful products based on eBPF on Linux, most notably Cilium (and, shameless plug for the one I’m working on: Parca, an eBPF-based CPU profiler). reply lucianbr 4 hours agorootparentBad wording on my part, and I still don't know how to word it better. I'm sure this thing is useful, I don't think everyone who contributed code was just clueless. However, the claim \"in the future, computers will not crash due to bad software updates, even those updates that involve kernel code\" must be false. There is no way it is true. Whatever Cilium is, I cannot believe it generally prevents kernel crashes. reply umanwizard 4 hours agorootparentCorrect, you will never be able to write any possible arbitrary code and have it run in eBPF. It necessarily constrains the class of programs you can write. But the constrained set is still quite useful and probably includes the crowdstrike agent. Also, although this isn't the case now, it's possible to imagine that the verifier could be relaxed to allow a Turing-complete subset of C that supports infinite loops while still rejecting sources of UB/crashes like dereferencing an invalid pointer. I suspect from reading this post that that is the future Mr. Gregg has in mind. > Whatever Cilium is, I cannot believe it generally prevents kernel crashes. It doesn't magically prevent all kernel crashes from unrelated code. But what we can say is that Cilium itself can't crash the kernel unless there are bugs in the eBPF verifier. reply lucianbr 4 hours agorootparentIf the verifier allowed a Turing-complete language, it would solve the halting probem, which is impossible. reply umanwizard 4 hours agorootparentMy point is that the verifier could be relaxed to accept programs that never halt, thus not needing to solve the halting problem. You could then have the kernel just kill it after running over a certain maximum amount of time. reply lucianbr 2 hours agorootparentWhy do you think the kernel crashes when crowdstrike attempts to reference some unavailable address (or whatever it does) instead of just denying that operation and continuing on? That would be the solution using this philosophy \"just kill long running program\". And no need for eBPF or anything complicated. But it doesn't work that way in practice. This is just such a naive view. \"We can prevent programs from crashing by just taking care to stop them when they do bad things\". Well, sure, that's why you have a kernel and userland. But it turns out, some things need to run in the kernel. Or \"just deny permission\". Then it turns out some programs need to run as admin. And so on. There is a generality in the halting problem, and saying \"we'll just kill long runing programs\" just misses the point entirely. Likely what will happen is that you will kill useful long-running programs, then an exception mechanism will be invented so some programs will not be killed, because they need to run longer, then one of those programs will go into an infinite loop despite all your mechanisms preventing it. Just like the crowdstrike driver managed to bring down the OS despite all the work that is supposed to prevent the entire computer crashing if a single program tries something stupid. reply umanwizard 2 hours agorootparent> Why do you think the kernel crashes when crowdstrike attempts to reference some unavailable address (or whatever it does) instead of just denying that operation and continuing on? Linux and windows are completely monolithic kernels; the crowdstrike agent isn't running in a sandbox and has complete unfettered access to the entire kernel address space. There is no separate \"the kernel\" to detect when the agent does something wrong; once a kernel module is loaded, IT IS the kernel. Lots of people have indeed realized this is undesirable and that there should be a sandboxed way to run kernel code such that bugs in it can't cause arbitrarily bad undefined behavior. Thus they invented eBPF. That's precisely what eBPF is. I don't know whether it's literally true that someday you will be able to write all possibly useful kernel-mode code in eBPF. But the spirit of the claim is true: there's a huge amount of useful software that could be written in eBPF today on Linux instead of as kernel modules, and this includes crowdstrike. Thus Windows supporting eBPF, and crowdstrike choosing to use it, would have solved this problem. That set of software will increase as the eBPF verifier is enhanced to accept a wider variety of programs. Just like you can write pretty much any useful program in JavaScript today -- a sandboxed language. You're also correct that due to the halting problem, we'll either have to accept that eBPF will never be Turing complete, OR accept that some eBPF programs will never halt and deal with the issues in other ways. Just like Chrome's JavaScript engine has to do. I don't really view this as a fundamentally unsolvable issue with the nature of eBPF. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentprevThe claim isn't that eBPF generally prevents kernel crashes. It's that it prevents crashes in the subset of programs it's designed for, in particular for instrumentation, which Crowdstrike is (in this author's conception) an instance of. reply lucianbr 4 hours agorootparentI have quoted the claim verbatim from the article.

I personally tend to get cautious when there is a proposal that x will solve the problem that occurred on y date, especially 3 days after the failure. It may be true, but if we don't do the analysis we could leave ourselves open to blindspots. There may also be plenty of alternative approaches that should be considered and appropriately discarded. I think the part I specifically dispute is the only negative outcome is wasted CPU cycles. That's likely the case for the class of bug, but there are plenty of failure modes where a bad ruleset could badly brick a system and make it hard to recover.

Also your statement is sometimes not true, although I certainly sympathise in the mainline case. In some contexts you really do need to keep on trucking. The first example to spring to mind is \"the guidance computers on an automated Mars lander\"; the round-trip to Earth is simply too long to defer responsibility in that case.

Your function will not load if you don't have boundary checks. Fighting the ebpf validator is a bit like fighting Rust's borrow checker; annoying, at times it's too conservative and rejects perfectly correct code, but it will protect you from panics. Loops will only be accepted if the validator can prove they'll end in time; this means it can be a pain to make the validator to accept a loop. Also, ebpf is a processor-independent byte code, so vectorizing code is not possible (unless the byte code interpreter itself does it). Given all its restrictions, I doubt something complex like a graphics driver would be possible. But then, I know nothing about graphics driver programming. reply umanwizard 3 hours agorootparent> Fighting the ebpf validator is a bit like fighting Rust's borrow checker I think this undersells how annoying it is. There's a bit of an impedance mismatch. Typically you write code in C and compile it with clang to eBPF bytecode, which is then checked by the kernel's eBPF verifier. But in some cases clang is smart enough to optimize away bounds checks, but the eBPF verifier isn't smart enough to realize the bound checks aren't needed. This requires manual hacking to trick clang into not optimizing things in a way that will confuse the verifier, and sometimes you just can't get the C code to work and need to write things in eBPF bytecode by hand using inline assembly. All of these problems are massively compounded if you need to support several different kernel versions.

People wanted to be able to set up complex packet filters. Things like 'udp and src host 192.168.0.3 and udp[4:2]=0x0034 and udp[8:2]=0x0000 and udp[12]=0x01 and udp[18:2]=0x0001 and not src port 3956' So BPF introduced a very limited bytecode, which is complex enough that it can express long filters with lots of and/or/brackets - but which is limited enough it's easy to check the program terminates and is crash-free. It's still quite limited - prior to ~2019, all loops had to be fully unrolled at compile time as the checker didn't support loops. It turned out that, although limited, this worked pretty well for filtering packets - so later, when people wanted a way to filter all system calls they realised they could extend the battle-tested BPF system.

    "originBody": "Parse, don’t validate 2019-11-05 ⦿ functional programming, haskell, types Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t just come to me in a vision—I have an iterative design process that doesn’t require plucking the “right” approach out of thin air—yet I haven’t been very successful in communicating that process to others. However, about a month ago, I was reflecting on Twitter about the differences I experienced parsing JSON in statically- and dynamically-typed languages, and finally, I realized what I was looking for. Now I have a single, snappy slogan that encapsulates what type-driven design means to me, and better yet, it’s only three words long: Parse, don’t validate. The essence of type-driven design Alright, I’ll confess: unless you already know what type-driven design is, my catchy slogan probably doesn’t mean all that much to you. Fortunately, that’s what the remainder of this blog post is for. I’m going to explain precisely what I mean in gory detail—but first, we need to practice a little wishful thinking. The realm of possibility One of the wonderful things about static type systems is that they can make it possible, and sometimes even easy, to answer questions like “is it possible to write this function?” For an extreme example, consider the following Haskell type signature: foo :: Integer -> Void Is it possible to implement foo? Trivially, the answer is no, as Void is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for any function to produce a value of type Void.1 That example is pretty boring, but the question gets much more interesting if we choose a more realistic example: head :: [a] -> a This function returns the first element from a list. Is it possible to implement? It certainly doesn’t sound like it does anything very complicated, but if we attempt to implement it, the compiler won’t be satisfied: head :: [a] -> a head (x:_) = x warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns] Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive In an equation for ‘head’: Patterns not matched: [] This message is helpfully pointing out that our function is partial, which is to say it is not defined for all possible inputs. Specifically, it is not defined when the input is [], the empty list. This makes sense, as it isn’t possible to return the first element of a list if the list is empty—there’s no element to return! So, remarkably, we learn this function isn’t possible to implement, either. Turning partial functions total To someone coming from a dynamically-typed background, this might seem perplexing. If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony. There are two different ways to fix the head function, and we’ll start with the simplest one. Managing expectations As established, head is partial because there is no element to return if the list is empty: we’ve made a promise we cannot possibly fulfill. Fortunately, there’s an easy solution to that dilemma: we can weaken our promise. Since we cannot guarantee the caller an element of the list, we’ll have to practice a little expectation management: we’ll do our best return an element if we can, but we reserve the right to return nothing at all. In Haskell, we express this possibility using the Maybe type: head :: [a] -> Maybe a This buys us the freedom we need to implement head—it allows us to return Nothing when we discover we can’t produce a value of type a after all: head :: [a] -> Maybe a head (x:_) = Just x head [] = Nothing Problem solved, right? For the moment, yes… but this solution has a hidden cost. Returning Maybe is undoubtably convenient when we’re implementing head. However, it becomes significantly less convenient when we want to actually use it! Since head always has the potential to return Nothing, the burden falls upon its callers to handle that possibility, and sometimes that passing of the buck can be incredibly frustrating. To see why, consider the following code: getConfigurationDirectories :: IO [FilePath] getConfigurationDirectories = do configDirsStringinitializeCache cacheDir Nothing -> error \"should never happen; already checked configDirs is non-empty\" When getConfigurationDirectories retrieves a list of file paths from the environment, it proactively checks that the list is non-empty. However, when we use head in main to get the first element of the list, the Maybe FilePath result still requires us to handle a Nothing case that we know will never happen! This is terribly bad for several reasons: First, it’s just annoying. We already checked that the list is non-empty, why do we have to clutter our code with another redundant check? Second, it has a potential performance cost. Although the cost of the redundant check is trivial in this particular example, one could imagine a more complex scenario where the redundant checks could add up, such as if they were happening in a tight loop. Finally, and worst of all, this code is a bug waiting to happen! What if getConfigurationDirectories were modified to stop checking that the list is empty, intentionally or unintentionally? The programmer might not remember to update main, and suddenly the “impossible” error becomes not only possible, but probable. The need for this redundant check has essentially forced us to punch a hole in our type system. If we could statically prove the Nothing case impossible, then a modification to getConfigurationDirectories that stopped checking if the list was empty would invalidate the proof and trigger a compile-time failure. However, as-written, we’re forced to rely on a test suite or manual inspection to catch the bug. Paying it forward Clearly, our modified version of head leaves some things to be desired. Somehow, we’d like it to be smarter: if we already checked that the list was non-empty, head should unconditionally return the first element without forcing us to handle the case we know is impossible. How can we do that? Let’s look at the original (partial) type signature for head again: head :: [a] -> a The previous section illustrated that we can turn that partial type signature into a total one by weakening the promise made in the return type. However, since we don’t want to do that, there’s only one thing left that can be changed: the argument type (in this case, [a]). Instead of weakening the return type, we can strengthen the argument type, eliminating the possibility of head ever being called on an empty list in the first place. To do this, we need a type that represents non-empty lists. Fortunately, the existing NonEmpty type from Data.List.NonEmpty is exactly that. It has the following definition: data NonEmpty a = a :| [a] Note that NonEmpty a is really just a tuple of an a and an ordinary, possibly-empty [a]. This conveniently models a non-empty list by storing the first element of the list separately from the list’s tail: even if the [a] component is [], the a component must always be present. This makes head completely trivial to implement:2 head :: NonEmpty a -> a head (x:|_) = x Unlike before, GHC accepts this definition without complaint—this definition is total, not partial. We can update our program to use the new implementation: getConfigurationDirectories :: IO (NonEmpty FilePath) getConfigurationDirectories = do configDirsStringpure nonEmptyConfigDirsList Nothing -> throwIO $ userError \"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty\" main :: IO () main = do configDirsMaybe (NonEmpty a) The Maybe is still there, but this time, we handle the Nothing case very early in our program: right in the same place we were already doing the input validation. Once that check has passed, we now have a NonEmpty FilePath value, which preserves (in the type system!) the knowledge that the list really is non-empty. Put another way, you can think of a value of type NonEmpty a as being like a value of type [a], plus a proof that the list is non-empty. By strengthening the type of the argument to head instead of weakening the type of its result, we’ve completely eliminated all the problems from the previous section: The code has no redundant checks, so there can’t be any performance overhead. Furthermore, if getConfigurationDirectories changes to stop checking that the list is non-empty, its return type must change, too. Consequently, main will fail to typecheck, alerting us to the problem before we even run the program! What’s more, it’s trivial to recover the old behavior of head from the new one by composing head with nonEmpty: head' :: [a] -> Maybe a head' = fmap head . nonEmpty Note that the inverse is not true: there is no way to obtain the new version of head from the old one. All in all, the second approach is superior on all axes. The power of parsing You may be wondering what the above example has to do with the title of this blog post. After all, we only examined two different ways to validate that a list was non-empty—no parsing in sight. That interpretation isn’t wrong, but I’d like to propose another perspective: in my mind, the difference between validation and parsing lies almost entirely in how information is preserved. Consider the following pair of functions: validateNonEmpty :: [a] -> IO () validateNonEmpty (_:_) = pure () validateNonEmpty [] = throwIO $ userError \"list cannot be empty\" parseNonEmpty :: [a] -> IO (NonEmpty a) parseNonEmpty (x:xs) = pure (x:|xs) parseNonEmpty [] = throwIO $ userError \"list cannot be empty\" These two functions are nearly identical: they check if the provided list is empty, and if it is, they abort the program with an error message. The difference lies entirely in the return type: validateNonEmpty always returns (), the type that contains no information, but parseNonEmpty returns NonEmpty a, a refinement of the input type that preserves the knowledge gained in the type system. Both of these functions check the same thing, but parseNonEmpty gives the caller access to the information it learned, while validateNonEmpty just throws it away. These two functions elegantly illustrate two different perspectives on the role of a static type system: validateNonEmpty obeys the typechecker well enough, but only parseNonEmpty takes full advantage of it. If you see why parseNonEmpty is preferable, you understand what I mean by the mantra “parse, don’t validate.” Still, perhaps you are skeptical of parseNonEmpty’s name. Is it really parsing anything, or is it merely validating its input and returning a result? While the precise definition of what it means to parse or validate something is debatable, I believe parseNonEmpty is a bona-fide parser (albeit a particularly simple one). Consider: what is a parser? Really, a parser is just a function that consumes less-structured input and produces more-structured output. By its very nature, a parser is a partial function—some values in the domain do not correspond to any value in the range—so all parsers must have some notion of failure. Often, the input to a parser is text, but this is by no means a requirement, and parseNonEmpty is a perfectly cromulent parser: it parses lists into non-empty lists, signaling failure by terminating the program with an error message. Under this flexible definition, parsers are an incredibly powerful tool: they allow discharging checks on input up-front, right on the boundary between a program and the outside world, and once those checks have been performed, they never need to be checked again! Haskellers are well-aware of this power, and they use many different types of parsers on a regular basis: The aeson library provides a Parser type that can be used to parse JSON data into domain types. Likewise, optparse-applicative provides a set of parser combinators for parsing command-line arguments. Database libraries like persistent and postgresql-simple have a mechanism for parsing values held in an external data store. The servant ecosystem is built around parsing Haskell datatypes from path components, query parameters, HTTP headers, and more. The common theme between all these libraries is that they sit on the boundary between your Haskell application and the external world. That world doesn’t speak in product and sum types, but in streams of bytes, so there’s no getting around a need to do some parsing. Doing that parsing up front, before acting on the data, can go a long way toward avoiding many classes of bugs, some of which might even be security vulnerabilities. One drawback to this approach of parsing everything up front is that it sometimes requires values be parsed long before they are actually used. In a dynamically-typed language, this can make keeping the parsing and processing logic in sync a little tricky without extensive test coverage, much of which can be laborious to maintain. However, with a static type system, the problem becomes marvelously simple, as demonstrated by the NonEmpty example above: if the parsing and processing logic go out of sync, the program will fail to even compile. The danger of validation Hopefully, by this point, you are at least somewhat sold on the idea that parsing is preferable to validation, but you may have lingering doubts. Is validation really so bad if the type system is going to force you to do the necessary checks eventually anyway? Maybe the error reporting will be a little bit worse, but a bit of redundant checking can’t hurt, right? Unfortunately, it isn’t so simple. Ad-hoc validation leads to a phenomenon that the language-theoretic security field calls shotgun parsing. In the 2016 paper, The Seven Turrets of Babel: A Taxonomy of LangSec Errors and How to Expunge Them, its authors provide the following definition: Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code—throwing a cloud of checks at the input, and hoping, without any systematic justification, that one or another would catch all the “bad” cases. They go on to explain the problems inherent to such validation techniques: Shotgun parsing necessarily deprives the program of the ability to reject invalid input instead of processing it. Late-discovered errors in an input stream will result in some portion of invalid input having been processed, with the consequence that program state is difficult to accurately predict. In other words, a program that does not parse all of its input up front runs the risk of acting upon a valid portion of the input, discovering a different portion is invalid, and suddenly needing to roll back whatever modifications it already executed in order to maintain consistency. Sometimes this is possible—such as rolling back a transaction in an RDBMS—but in general it may not be. It may not be immediately apparent what shotgun parsing has to do with validation—after all, if you do all your validation up front, you mitigate the risk of shotgun parsing. The problem is that validation-based approaches make it extremely difficult or impossible to determine if everything was actually validated up front or if some of those so-called “impossible” cases might actually happen. The entire program must assume that raising an exception anywhere is not only possible, it’s regularly necessary. Parsing avoids this problem by stratifying the program into two phases—parsing and execution—where failure due to invalid input can only happen in the first phase. The set of remaining failure modes during execution is minimal by comparison, and they can be handled with the tender care they require. Parsing, not validating, in practice So far, this blog post has been something of a sales pitch. “You, dear reader, ought to be parsing!” it says, and if I’ve done my job properly, at least some of you are sold. However, even if you understand the “what” and the “why,” you might not feel especially confident about the “how.” My advice: focus on the datatypes. Suppose you are writing a function that accepts a list of tuples representing key-value pairs, and you suddenly realize you aren’t sure what to do if the list has duplicate keys. One solution would be to write a function that asserts there aren’t any duplicates in the list: checkNoDuplicateKeys :: (MonadError AppError m, Eq k) => [(k, v)] -> m () However, this check is fragile: it’s extremely easy to forget. Because its return value is unused, it can always be omitted, and the code that needs it would still typecheck. A better solution is to choose a data structure that disallows duplicate keys by construction, such as a Map. Adjust your function’s type signature to accept a Map instead of a list of tuples, and implement it as you normally would. Once you’ve done that, the call site of your new function will likely fail to typecheck, since it is still being passed a list of tuples. If the caller was given the value via one of its arguments, or if it received it from the result of some other function, you can continue updating the type from list to Map, all the way up the call chain. Eventually, you will either reach the location the value is created, or you’ll find a place where duplicates actually ought to be allowed. At that point, you can insert a call to a modified version of checkNoDuplicateKeys: checkNoDuplicateKeys :: (MonadError AppError m, Eq k) => [(k, v)] -> m (Map k v) Now the check cannot be omitted, since its result is actually necessary for the program to proceed! This hypothetical scenario highlights two simple ideas: Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable. Model your data using the most precise data structure you reasonably can. If ruling out a particular possibility is too hard using the encoding you are currently using, consider alternate encodings that can express the property you care about more easily. Don’t be afraid to refactor. Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further. Get your data into the most precise representation you need as quickly as you can. Ideally, this should happen at the boundary of your system, before any of the data is acted upon.3 If one particular code branch eventually requires a more precise representation of a piece of data, parse the data into the more precise representation as soon as the branch is selected. Use sum types judiciously to allow your datatypes to reflect and adapt to control flow. In other words, write functions on the data representation you wish you had, not the data representation you are given. The design process then becomes an exercise in bridging the gap, often by working from both ends until they meet somewhere in the middle. Don’t be afraid to iteratively adjust parts of the design as you go, since you may learn something new during the refactoring process! Here are a handful of additional points of advice, arranged in no particular order: Let your datatypes inform your code, don’t let your code control your datatypes. Avoid the temptation to just stick a Bool in a record somewhere because it’s needed by the function you’re currently writing. Don’t be afraid to refactor code to use the right data representation—the type system will ensure you’ve covered all the places that need changing, and it will likely save you a headache later. Treat functions that return m () with deep suspicion. Sometimes these are genuinely necessary, as they may perform an imperative effect with no meaningful result, but if the primary purpose of that effect is raising an error, it’s likely there’s a better way. Don’t be afraid to parse data in multiple passes. Avoiding shotgun parsing just means you shouldn’t act on the input data before it’s fully parsed, not that you can’t use some of the input data to decide how to parse other input data. Plenty of useful parsers are context-sensitive. Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it’s mutable. Duplicating the same data in multiple places introduces a trivially representable illegal state: the places getting out of sync. Strive for a single source of truth. Keep denormalized representations of data behind abstraction boundaries. If denormalization is absolutely necessary, use encapsulation to ensure a small, trusted module holds sole responsibility for keeping the representations in sync. Use abstract datatypes to make validators “look like” parsers. Sometimes, making an illegal state truly unrepresentable is just plain impractical given the tools Haskell provides, such as ensuring an integer is in a particular range. In that case, use an abstract newtype with a smart constructor to “fake” a parser from a validator. As always, use your best judgement. It probably isn’t worth breaking out singletons and refactoring your entire application just to get rid of a single error \"impossible\" call somewhere—just make sure to treat those situations like the radioactive substance they are, and handle them with the appropriate care. If all else fails, at least leave a comment to document the invariant for whoever needs to modify the code next. Recap, reflection, and related reading That’s all, really. Hopefully this blog post proves that taking advantage of the Haskell type system doesn’t require a PhD, and it doesn’t even require using the latest and greatest of GHC’s shiny new language extensions—though they can certainly sometimes help! Sometimes the biggest obstacle to using Haskell to its fullest is simply being aware what options are available, and unfortunately, one downside of Haskell’s small community is a relative dearth of resources that document design patterns and techniques that have become tribal knowledge. None of the ideas in this blog post are new. In fact, the core idea—“write total functions”—is conceptually quite simple. Despite that, I find it remarkably challenging to communicate actionable, practicable details about the way I write Haskell code. It’s easy to spend lots of time talking about abstract concepts—many of which are quite valuable!—without communicating anything useful about process. My hope is that this is a small step in that direction. Sadly, I don’t know very many other resources on this particular topic, but I do know of one: I never hesitate to recommend Matt Parson’s fantastic blog post Type Safety Back and Forth. If you want another accessible perspective on these ideas, including another worked example, I’d highly encourage giving it a read. For a significantly more advanced take on many of these ideas, I can also recommend Matt Noonan’s 2018 paper Ghosts of Departed Proofs, which outlines a handful of techniques for capturing more complex invariants in the type system than I have described here. As a closing note, I want to say that doing the kind of refactoring described in this blog post is not always easy. The examples I’ve given are simple, but real life is often much less straightforward. Even for those experienced in type-driven design, it can be genuinely difficult to capture certain invariants in the type system, so do not consider it a personal failing if you cannot solve something the way you’d like! Consider the principles in this blog post ideals to strive for, not strict requirements to meet. All that matters is to try. Technically, in Haskell, this ignores “bottoms,” constructions that can inhabit any value. These aren’t “real” values (unlike null in some other languages)—they’re things like infinite loops or computations that raise exceptions—and in idiomatic Haskell, we usually try to avoid them, so reasoning that pretends they don’t exist still has value. But don’t take my word for it—I’ll let Danielsson et al. convince you that Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct. ↩ In fact, Data.List.NonEmpty already provides a head function with this type, but just for the sake of illustration, we’ll reimplement it ourselves. ↩ Sometimes it is necessary to perform some kind of authorization before parsing user input to avoid denial of service attacks, but that’s okay: authorization should have a relatively small surface area, and it shouldn’t cause any significant modifications to the state of your system. ↩ ← No, dynamic type systems are not inherently more open Empathy and subjective experience in programming languages →",

It comes up on this site now and then because of it. For those who don't necessarily program in statically typed functional languages: The idea transcends paradigms. You'll find very similar notions in 80's/90's OO literature, for example in Design by Contract. I'm sure one can dig deeper and find papers, discussions and specifications that go further back. I think TypeScript is often written in such a way where you refine the types at runtime. I assume Design by Contract has influenced Clojure's spec (Clojure is a dynamic language). Fundamentally this is about assumptions and guarantees (or requiring and providing). Once an assumption is checked and guarantees can be made, then other parts of the program don't need to check overlapping assumptions again. In fact I think one of the most confusing things when you read code is seeing already guaranteed properties being checked again somewhere else. It makes code harder to reason about and improve. reply atoav 10 hours agoparentWhen you have a language with a strong type system, this is one of the practical things that ultimately gives you freedom as your program gets bigger and more complex. But you have to use it. E.g. by having a Class UncheckedEmail, a Class ValidEmail and a Class VerifiedEmail and ensuring that the conversion from one to the other has to involve your email-verification process. That way you never have to guess whether the email adress is unchecked, valid or verified and there is no need for \"is_email_verified\" booleans that you may or may not forget to update/check. If you use the wrong thing in the wrong place your type checker yells at you, while you can focus on actually important stuff. reply mrkeen 9 hours agorootparentBetter yet, skip the Valid* classes and only make classes for valid objects. 'Int' is fine. We don't need ActualInt and IPromiseItsReallyAnInt. reply atoav 7 hours agorootparentThis was of course an example to illustrate the concept. So whatever makes sense in reality will differ depending on the usecase. I assumed there is a typical registration process. Future users of your application input a text in a field that is meant to be a reachable email address. So the first step would be to filter out garbage or typoed text that your mail-sending function would not be able to handle. And because you don't know how long people need to click on a link in their mail you need to store and work with that validated-but-unverified email address till they do. And for this having your own type that cannot be mixed up with the verified email addresses can make sense. Depending on how complex your application is. reply DarkNova6 6 hours agorootparentprevThe idea is take even further in DDD. A core idea is to allow the creation of data-graphs which are always in a valid business state. These so called aggregates can only be created from a factory to avoid bad initialization. This way you never need to make ad hoc validations to be “ really really reallysure”. reply bell-cot 8 hours agorootparentprevInt's are a very poor analogy.

We just let a malicious User object in because we invested extra time, effort and sloc into making both a User and a ValidUser class, disregarding the first \"simple idea\" from the article: >> 1.

The type system stops this. You can't pass, e.g. a User to authenticate because it only accepts a ValidUser. > only make classes for valid objects Using primitives (String, Int, etc.) for unvalidated input, and custom classes for validated input is fine in many cases. However, sometimes you need to represent data that is in the process of being validated (e.g. when validation takes time, like waiting for a user to validate their email address) and then these intermediate classes arrive. reply fiddlerwoaroof 5 hours agorootparentI think, for most cases with partial validation, you should parse the fields first into valid types for those fields and store them in a hashmap or something. When all the fields have been collected, parse the hashmap into your aggregate type. reply szundi 6 hours agorootparentprevBut your colleage just implemented it with User - because he could reply noelwelsh 4 hours agorootparentNo tool can fully protect against user incompetence (pun intended).

It seems silly. You don't often need a VerifiedEmail. But VerifiedUser is more useful from VerifiedEmail. You could get an implicitly verified email without introducing a new type. reply codetrotter 8 hours agorootparent> You don't often need a VerifiedEmail. But VerifiedUser is more useful from VerifiedEmail. You could get an implicitly verified email without introducing a new type. Be careful about how the email is implicitly verified though, and how different login methods and assumptions interact when for example migrating users from one system or platform to another. https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/researchers-weak-securit... > analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options — such “Continue with Google” or “Continue with Apple” — as opposed to the “Continue with email” choice > Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves > since there’s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the ‘create password for your new account’ flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question This kind of mistake makes me think that it’s better to be super explicit about the state of everything when it comes to accounts. So even if it may seem excessive to have VerifiedEmail as a type instead of marking the account as verified or not. I will prefer being explicit. And in medium to big size systems with multiple pieces of user account data that require separately keeping track of verification state it will be necessary anyway. For example even something as simple as having one email and one phone number associated with a user. Or beyond that one user having multiple email addresses or multiple phone numbers etc. reply atoav 7 hours agorootparentThank you for beinging up this excellent display of hidden dangers to my very crude example about why type systems should be used if they are there. My point was specifically about complexity. Using a string for all kind of emails of course works, tying guarantees to other things like VerifiedUser works as well. These implicit guarantees just fail to safe your ass once things get more complex and there is an edge case you didn't think of. reply bvrmn 6 hours agorootparentprevSo in the end users were in state \"not verified\" after migration. Seems email is a secondary property. reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentprevBut you don't want \"implicitly verified\", when there exist any code to which the difference between \"verified\" and \"not verified\" matters in some way. In your own example, if you happen to use e-mail verification as proxy for user verification, then the very code that creates VerifiedUser instances would want to have VerifiedEmail as input! reply bvrmn 6 hours agorootparentYou don't need VerifiedUser in the moment user click verification link. It's a state changing action. You get verified user from db and work with it later. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentFine. It still has merit that the code pulling verified user data from verified users table returns VerifiedUser objects, so the code processing them is clear about its assumptions, and won't accidentally get reused or refactored in UnverifiedUser flows. reply noelwelsh 8 hours agorootparentprevAbstracting the email example, if you have a finite state machine that verifies some fact, you can model each state as a type. Their example goes Email -> ValidEmail -> VerifiedEmail. You could equally go String -> Email -> VerifiedEmail, where String is what the user submits as their email address. If you are verifying emails in the context of verifying users you could go Map -> User -> VerifiedUser, where Map is what you receive from an HTML form submission. Getting hung up on the details of which type you use is missing the overall point. reply atoav 7 hours agorootparentGood point, the names really don't matter and the first type could as well have been a string. I just wanted to illustrate the concept of using the type system to add important information and guarantees to certain variables. Your state machine analogy is a good one, because the conversion between different types is a bit like the transitions between states: you have to make explicit how exactly they are meant to happen (or whether they are actually possible). This is a good thing, having less degrees of freedom may seem like it makes it harder to code, but in fact it allows you to reason better about what the system is doing at any given point in your code. reply bvrmn 6 hours agorootparentprevState machine is always a trivial part. Email verification is stupidly simple task. But User propagation through the system and available actions based on verified email are not. reply sesm 8 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't UncheckedEmail be just string? reply atoav 8 hours agorootparentAll of these are just strings. But if you have a function that requires that string to be of type VerifiedMail, your type checker or compiler will either warn you about the misuse or not even let you compile the code (like in Rust). This is good, because you as the programmer can rely on the fact that wherever you see a string of type VerifiedMail, that it is indeed a string containing a verified email adress, you don't even need to check, because you know the conversion between the different types had be done explicitly. You can of course extend the whole thing and have a OnboardUser with a ValidatedMail and only convert the OnboardUser into an actual User once there is a VerifiedMail etc. You get the idea. Whenever you find yourself wondering if a variable is actually holding the expected information, it is a good idea to leverage the type system to replace wondering with knowing. But you are right: unchecked email could as well just be a string. reply HelloNurse 7 hours agorootparentIn context, there's presumably a form in a web page containing a claimed email address and other personal data that \"evolves\" a bunch of strings into valid Email, Address, Name etc. objects or into a collection of form fields with a list of error messages attached, depending on how validation goes. reply dwattttt 8 hours agorootparentprevIn representation yes.

When that happens, because statistically speaking it will happen, then all the other processes/scripts/pieces of code depending on that \"original\" validating process would be in a very rough place. reply dgb23 6 hours agorootparentI understand where it comes from, but I can't ignore the feeling that this is anxiety driven development. Sure, the farther away from your control and trust circle, the more you're inclined to check assumptions that are already guaranteed. It's a valid reason to do this as you explained, but I think the tradeoff has to be considered: Generally speaking, checking assumptions that are already guaranteed is a _bug_. It violates the DRY principle[0], and will break your program, when those guarantees relax or the assumptions become tighter at one place or another, because they diverge. And again, it can be confusing for maintainers and makes it harder to reason about a program and make sensible changes. The anxiety that drives the checks will leak right into the reader who might be wary of breaking Chesterton's Fence. Now you have someone testing everything in order to figure out if there are code paths that only hit one or the other of the checking code and stuff like that. Needless to say it can also make performance worse, because you're doing more work than needed, especially if the checks require fetching data from disk or the network etc. This type of performance degradation is quite common. [0] The real/actual one, not the one where people factor out superficially repetitive code. reply TeMPOraL 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, and that's what the approach from the article is trying to help with. If you're coding in a statically typed language, the \"already guaranteed properties\" are propagated by types, so they can't just \"disappear\" - there's no way to get from e.g. String to Username without going through a String->Username function that does the checks, so functions accepting Username can rely on it having the relevant properties. Of course, this stops being true when you start hacking around the checks, side-stepping the parsers entirely (say, type-casting String to Username without any check). There's nothing a language can do to stop you when you really want to do this[0] - but then, you're an adult; if you see restrictions and safety interlocks, and put effort to hack around them, then any problem is really on you. This gets more difficult in dynamically typed languages, as you have to rely more on naming conventions and programmers not being idiots, but even without a typechecker, it will be rather obvious when you're doing something that could break the chain of guarantees. -- [0] - Some can try; I've seen a Haskell paper about this idea that does very complex type magic to try and truly ensure that only the parsing function can actually construct the result type. I tried reproducing that in C++ once, but C++ just can't give such guarantees. reply ChrisSD 8 hours agorootparent> Some can try Rust does this with standard types even. \"Parse, don't validate\" is the answer to the question: why does Rust have so many string types? Of course you can hack around this using `unsafe` but, as you say, in that case you have to put visible effort into deliberately subverting the type system. reply kitd 7 hours agorootparentprevAny language that allows private constructors makes this pretty easy, no? reply dgb23 6 hours agorootparentThe constructor doesn't have to be private, it just has to be a constructor. For example take this library: https://github.com/google/uuid It represents UUIDs as `type UUID [16]byte`. It would be trivial to circumvent a constructor: `var uuid UUID`. Go values are zero initialized. (Aside: You might actually have a reason to do this, but often you would rather use https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/uuid#NullUUID). But it's obvious that you would use one of the constructors in the library to get an actual valid UUID. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentIn C++ it's less obvious, so while a private constructor does most of the job, it's still tricky to come up with a way of designing those types so they feel natural, are easy to construct in the right way (via appropriate parsers), impossible to construct the wrong way by accident, and fulfill all the roles people expect, and don't devolve into impenetrable mess of template metaprogramming that can only be debugged by the author of the type definition framework. reply Sakos 10 hours agoparentprevI've been going through the comments on previous posts.

It seems to act as an anchor for a lot of people to the point where they'll argue against things that aren't in the article, just implied by the title (without context).

The pattern works like a charm in modern C# as well, and has nice space-saving effects too by allowing you to omit the explicit variable declaration: if(!Whatever.TryParse(input, out var output)) output = some-sane-default; or: if(!Whatever.TryParse(input, out var output)) throw new ApplicationException($\"Not a valid Thingy: {input}\"); Protip: don't do the latter in your kernel-mode driver. reply zeendo 5 hours agoparentPlease don't do the first.

Explicit > Implicit reply Akronymus 6 hours agoparentprevif(!Whatever.TryParse(input, out var output)) output = some-sane-default; I absolutely hate that. IMO you should handle the error of an invalid input outside of the function to parse. F# makes that easy. type Whatever = static member create input = match input withValidWhatever x -> Some x_ -> None match Whatever.create input withSome x -> //process the parsed dataNone -> //handle it not being parsed well Or you could also use Option.map/Option.bind to build a pipeline to handle chained operations in an ergonomic manner. With this, you can only instantiate any instances through the create method with parses the input. Altough, you probably want to use a result rather than option, but I digress. reply zo1 9 hours agoparentprevProtip: Don't do either. And definitely don't do the first. Explicit is always better than implicit defaults that get used instead when you give it a wrong value that you think is correct. What you should do is throw your hands up early, fail to parse, and have a very clearly defined process and protocol to handle files that couldn't be loaded. It'll force you to ask yourself very difficult questions that aren't covered by either of the two options you posted.

If someone walks into a florist and asks for a coffee, the correct answer is not for them to be handed a rose. They're going to cut their mouth all up when they try and drink it.

If I were were to teach a class about programming in the medium (as opposed to in the small or in the large), I think I'd assign my students an essay comparing and contrasting these suggestions.

For me the slogan is rather \"always validate only in the single constructor\" (or constructor function, doesn't matter). That way, you cannot have invalid objects at all, and there's always a single source of truth. If you want to modify the object, implement it via constructing a new state by calling the same constructor again. reply epolanski 9 hours agoparentNot really the same thing. The point is that validation alone is then lost as information later on. E.g. validating an int to be positive has limited benefits if you don't parse it to be a positive int, because there's no such information at the type level later on, same could apply to a non empty array/list where following consumers would then need to check again if the list is really non empty. This kind of information cannot always be encoded in objects or constructors. reply wormlord 2 hours agoprevThis idea + Domain modeling go together like peanut butter and chocolate. The idea that an invalid state in your Domain is unrepresentable takes so much work off the database and API, and makes programs so easy to test-- since an invalid Domain representation simply will not parse, and can never make it to your API or DB, taking so much logic out of the parts of a software stack that are hardest to test. reply blowski 10 hours agoprevSome good previous discussions on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35053118 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21476261 reply andrewghull 4 hours agoprevHere's the final example in TypeScript if you find that easier to read: type NonEmpty = [T, ...T[]] const head = (list: NonEmpty) => list[0] function getConfigurationDirectories(): NonEmpty { const configDirsString = process.env[\"CONFIG_DIRS\"] const [firstDir, ...restDirs] = configDirsString.split(',') if (firstDir === undefined) throw Error(\"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty\"); return [firstDir, ...restDirs]; } function main() { const configDirs = getConfigurationDirectories(); initializeCache(head(configDirs)) } reply zigzag312 7 hours agoprevIs this opposite to the following opinion? > \"“required” keyword in Protocol Buffers turned out to be a horrible mistake\" https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-require... Having both flexible, unvalidated parsing and validated parsing functions would probably be best IMHO. reply dgb23 6 hours agoparentThe problem here as I understood it is more general and orthogonal to what the Parse, Don't Validate article is talking about. 1. A field being \"required\", is not a property of the field itself, but of the construct holding the field. JSON-Schema does this correctly, by letting you define an array of required fields on the schema of an object instead of it being a property of a specific field. 2. Consumers, not producers should decide what their assumptions are. Producers should decide what their guarantees are. 3. Everyone, including the parts in the middle (here it's a message bus) should only state assumptions that they actually need in order to function. Use different schemas for different assumptions (which is easier to do if the \"required\" assumption is a property of a construct and not a field). The example in the article you mentioned illustrates nicely how these three principles are broken by \"required\" (or maybe how Protocol Buffers are used in general). reply zigzag312 5 hours agorootparent> 2. Consumers, not producers should decide what their assumptions are. Producers should decide what their guarantees are. Issue with schema definition languages is that only one set classes is generated. Forcing consumers to create large amounts of mapping logic to transform input to objects with required assumptions. I like the idea of an array of required fields on the schema of an object. Using arrays of required fields, could be used to generate different set of classes. That would make writing near-duplicate classes of input objects and mapping logic unnecessary. reply lexicality 5 hours agoparentprevNo, the idea is that your application level validation functions take in data, own it and return a validation error or new type that has invalid states removed. In this case you could make a wrapper function that accepts the raw binary data, passes it to Cap'n'Proto, validates the output (this field is actually required etc) and then returns it reply zigzag312 5 hours agorootparentOf course this is the correct way, but doing this manually is a lot of work.

I quite like the idea but I think the initial example is not very good and also the remark about 'shotgun parsing' seems to blut some levels: The key idea seems to be that the border between the periphery/plumbing/deserialization code and the actual business logic should be as strict and direct and isolated as possible. Only pass objects/data/payloads to the business logic that have been fully ingested into the data model of the business logic. And keep the ingestion in one place. From this perspective, the section about \"shotgun parsing\" might give some people the wrong idea and derail some discussions: If it's an actual part of the business requirements that branching and validations need to happen (branching for example over the existence of an optional value), a superficial reading of the article might lead someone to incorrectly identify this as \"shotgun parsing\". reply valenterry 8 hours agoprev> Is it possible to implement foo? Trivially, the answer is no, as Void is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for any function to produce a value of type Void That's actually not really correct. Or rather, it is technically correct but it will confuse the readers who work in languages like Java. While void in languages like Java means that the result of the function cannot be used or has no meaning, it is NOT equivalent to types like the bottom type of Haskell. Because that would mean that the function can never return. Rather, void is similar to the \"unit type\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type) which does have a value. It's like an empty tuple. It contains no information other then \"the function call has finished\". (and of course in languages with exceptions, this means that no exception was thrown) Otherwise, I like the article. More people should read and understand this way of thinking. reply thedataangel 8 hours agoparent`Void` is not equivalent to the unit type. Haskell _has_ a unit type, called `()`.

(I realise that Golang strongly believes zero values are usually valid, but Golang is wrong about this.) reply the_gipsy 5 hours agorootparentThe zero value is valid in many cases: false, 0, \"\", etc. reply Smaug123 5 hours agorootparentThere's no such thing as a \"valid\" value. Values can only be valid in some context. The empty string is valid only in contexts where… it has meaning. (Quite hard to say this without being obviously circular!) Golang has chosen the point of view that \"in most contexts, the zero value is valid\"; it is wrong about this. There are certainly some contexts where for some particular type the zero value is valid, but it is rarely true in general. Booleans are harmful for other reasons, sometimes related to \"parse, don't validate\". Write a discriminated union that makes the true/false distinction meaningful, if you really do have a two-valued data type (\"--dry-run\" is `| DryWet`, not a bool; this mistake is called \"boolean blindness\"). Write a type that actually contains the data you want, if the boolean is supposed to indicate the validity of some other data (`option`, not `string * bool` where `something, false` implicitly means the `something` is meaningless). reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentI agree, it seems I wasn't clear. The values false, zero, or empty string are \"valid\" in most contexts. But in go, using the stdlib json package, it is not possible to distinguish a missing value from the zero value. You can use pointers in some cases, but then everything becomes a full-blown pointer for the lack of an Option type, and it still doesn't fully solve the problem. When parsing \"enums\" in go, which are really just a type alias and some loose constants, again it's not possible to prevent zero values sneaking in with the stdlib json package. E.g. you get a value of the correct type, but it's not one of your consts, but equivalent to a new value `YourType(\"\")`. Thus, a lot of validation is necessary, between parsing and using values. reply kayo_20211030 5 hours agoprevIs Postel's law relevant here? reply sriram_malhar 9 hours agoprevCan someone steeped in type theory explain the following: I never understood why the default for [a] means that the list could be empty. If ... foo: [a] -> a ... foo is supposed to get a list of a's, it should get a list of a's, with at least one a. If the list can be empty, then explicitly annotate it so: foo: [a*] -> a One way or the other one has to deal with the empty list explicitly (in the signature). If you allow empty lists, it will have to return a 'Maybe a'. It seems to me that it just makes processing the result easier in the common case if the input were to be constrained. reply brandonspark 9 hours agoparentThere's no reason this couldn't be done. Indeed, in OCaml (which I am more familiar with), you could easily define: ```ocaml type 'a nonempty = Single of 'aCons of 'a * 'a nonempty ``` This would be the type of lists that contain one or more elements of the type parameter. I think it's just convention that typically, when we talk about lists, we are interested in the empty case as well. Finding \"all X that satisfy P in Y\", as a general computational problem, is _very_ common (consider: filtering a list, querying for a predicate in a collection, finding sequences of moves in a search space), and generally could result in an empty list as a possible output. In a non-practical sense, if you want the type theory, another reason is you can think of `[a]` as the free monoid on the collection of `a`. In other words, strings of elements of `a`, joined via concatenation. This monoid requires a unit, which is the empty list. reply noelwelsh 9 hours agoparentprevThe definition of a list is that it contains zero or more elements. There's nothing deep about it; it's just the way the type is defined (and always has been, back to the early days of Lisp from which functional programming evolved.) reply TeMPOraL 9 hours agorootparentConceptually, I see this as seeing a list as its own thing, independent of its contents. That is, a List is a value in itself, that can exist even if no instance of an Int exists anywhere in the program; it'll just be a List of Int that happens to have zero Ints in it. Probably makes more sense when you come from imperative programming background, where List is a piece of mutable state that you can construct and then fill, in two explicitly separate steps (and then possibly empty it again in yet another step).

The notation [a] could just as easily have meant a non-empty list reply HelloNurse 7 hours agorootparentIt is necessary to represent the empty list whose elements (if it had any) are type A, and its type must be the same as a nonempty list of A, because concatenating the two must be a well-defined and representable operation while concatenating empty lists of different types must be as wrong as concatenating nonempty ones. Moreover, in practice most variables, function parameters and the like should be declared as a possibly empty list of A, without special cases. reply layer8 7 hours agoparentprevThe type of elements and the number of elements are two orthogonal aspects. You might need at least one element, or you might need at least two elements, or you might need an even number of elements, and so on. This is independent from whether you need the elements to be of type a (or some other condition on the element types). Ideally, all these conditions could be expressed in the type system. But the requirement \"all elements must be of type a\" by itself does not imply \"there must be at least one element\", nor does it necessarily imply having to special-case the empty list. reply zeendo 5 hours agoparentprevHaskell has this simply for historical reasons. It's a wart and we wish it weren't so but changing it would break a lot of legacy code (and probably have adverse performance impacts in some cases) so it remains. So as it is today, [a] indeed means it can be empty or not. And a function signature of \"[a] -> a\" is essentially an unsafe partial function. That isn't to say you _have_ to write it this way for new things and there are packages like https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe which provide non-partial/safe versions of the various unsafe base functions (like head, maximum and friends).

    "originLink": "https://ea.rna.nl/2024/05/27/when-chatgpt-summarises-it-actually-does-nothing-of-the-kind/",
    "originBody": "I started looking into the foundations of ChatGPT and Friends a year ago and I’ve been writing and speaking about ChatGPT and Friends for about half a year now, resulting in this collection of explanations and illustrations of what LLMs and other Generative AIs do, and especially attempting to counter the hype and fever with some cool realities. It sometimes feels like trying to convince people that buying tulip bulb options really is less of a certain investment than they think. One of the use cases I thought was reasonable to expect (until now) was summarising. It turns out I was wrong. Because ChatGPT isn’t summarising at all, it only looks like it. What it does is something else and that something else only becomes summarising in very specific circumstances. In hindsight I should have expected this. Here is what happened. Last week, I was asked to create a summary of a 50-page public paper by Netspar, the Network for Studies on Pensions, Aging and Retirement. The (public) paper is called De governance van pensioenfondsen vanaf de stelselwijziging (The governance of pension funds following the system change). Actually, creating the summary was discussed at a meeting with other people present and at that meeting I had promised to try to create the summary somewhere in the week that followed. The next day, a friendly colleague sent me his own summary (or so it seemed), to which my reaction (without reading it) was: “OK, he has already done it, the show-off. I probably don’t need to do it anymore”. But that was a mistake as I had not read the entire mail which stated “I had ChatGPT make a summary, because ‘why not?’. Maybe it is useful for you”. I decided not to read ChatGPT’s summary, but create my own and then compare the two. So, I studied the paper, and created my summary. In short, the paper looks at the context and consequences of the systemic change that is currently going on in the Dutch pension system (we’re currently doing a complex €1.6 trillion transformation in about 6 years, 2 of which have already passed, everything is still preparatory up to now), and it concludes for instance that: the changes will require a different focus of the pension funds (less keeping an eye on fairness as this is no longer something the pension fund has a lot of freedom on, but more keeping a eye on operational excellence with respect to the mechanisms agreed upon) the new situation should come with a stronger governance role by the parties participating in the pension schemes (people saving, people receiving pensions, employers) in the form of an elected College van Belanghebbenden (Council of Stakeholders), mainly because the systemic change moves all of the risks to the (collective of) people participating in a pension fund, whose legal positions are weak. ChatGPT’s summary contained mostly things that can be found in the full text. There was the occasional incorrectness of course. The paper itself, for instance, argues that ‘regulatory strategies’ (rules and compliance) do not really work all that well (e.g. costly, not agile), and that thus an organisational governance structure should be strengthened. I.e. there should be organisational elements with powers to affect one another, such as that council of stakeholders they propose with the power to sack board members. But ChatGPT’s summary of the ‘Summary’ chapter says that such regulations will strengthen governance. (And yep, the paper actually comes with its own summary chapter, so the easiest — but not the best — summary would have been a simple copy-paste operation…) But the main proposal — that Council of Stakeholders — which takes up about 25% of the main text of the paper, is not mentioned in ChatGPT’s summary at all. Instead, that concrete suggestion becomes a few empty sentences. And that was true for a few other essential elements of the paper. In other words: the summary makes a good first impression, though not very concrete in terms of proposals, but reading the summary alone, you will not be aware that the paper actually has a a set of very concrete proposals and options, most of which is missing in ChatGPT’s summary. I wondered why, and — after studying the summary — I think I know: ChatGPT doesn’t summarise if you ask it to. No really: ChatGPT doesn’t summarise. When you ask ChatGPT to summarise this text, it instead shortens the text. And there is a fundamental difference between the two. To summarise, you need to understand what the paper is saying. To shorten text, not so much. To truly summarise, you need to be able to detect that from 40 sentences, 35 are leading up to the 36th, 4 follow it with some additional remarks, but it is that 36th that is essential for the summary and that without that 36th, the content is lost. But that requires a real understanding that is well beyond large prompts (the entire 50-page paper) and hundreds of billions of parameters. Addendum 2024/05/09: I just realised the situation is even worse. If I have 35 sentences of circumstance leading up to a single sentence of conclusion, the LLM mechanism will — simply because of how the attention mechanism works with the volume of those 35 — find the ’35’ less relevant sentences more important than the single key one. So, in a case like that it will actively suppress the key sentence. So, when will shortening the text be good enough for a reliable summary? Probably only when summarising consists of nothing else than turning something unnecessarily repetitive and long-winding into something short, i.e. when volume is a good predictor of importance. That is far less of a use case than people think. In the meantime, the result itself will — errors and all — suggest to readers that it is a true and reliable summary and we’re not going to doubt that, human as we are. It really might take a while until people have experienced enough of this for GPT-fever to pass. After this experience with summarising — something that was on my list as a potential realistic use case — I am less optimistic that there will be reliable enough use cases for LLMs for real business uses. [Addendum 28 May] I tried to find a real English language example to show the effect. I first tried to let ChatGPT one of my key posts (the one about the role convictions play in humans with an addendum about human ‘wetware’). ChatGPT made a total mess of it. What it said had little to do with the original post, and where it did, it said the opposite of what the post said. What seemed to happen is that ChatGPT’s parameters — which have been tuned by its training data — dominate the result. The text to be summarised itself hardly influences the summary. For fun, I asked Gemini as well. Gemini didn’t make a mistake and actually produced something that is a very short summary of the post, but it is extremely short so it leaves most out. So, I asked Gemini to expand a little, but as soon as I did that, it fabricated something that is not in the original article (quite the opposite), i.e.: “It discusses the importance of advisors having strong convictions and being able to communicate them clearly.” Nope. Not there. This attempt did not clearly show the ‘shortening’ effect I had noticed before. Asking for a longer summary did show the parameters starting do dominate over the prompt (the ‘context’, technically), e.g. by producing “The article concludes by recommending that architects focus on building trust with their clients and understanding their clients’ perspectives.”, which is also nowhere in the article summarised. So, what we see here is something that one sees more often. The mechanism of an LLM has two parts influencing the calculation of the generated text: (1) the context (the prompts and answers up until the last generated or user-typed text), and (2) the parameters (based on all the training material). And we’ve seen before that these may ‘pull’ in different directions. E.g. the Crescendo jailbreak (circumventing the safety of LLMs) is based on overcoming the power of the parameters by using the context. To find another ‘shortening is not summarising’ example, I tried letting it summarise Plato’s Protagoras (a favourite), but that was a stupid plan. Plato’s work and commentaries about it are all over the internet and books, so the parameters of the LLM absolutely dominate the result. And given the amount of training material, the result from the parameters is nearing memorisation quality, so pretty good. In the end, another Netspar paper, but an English one: Regulating pensions: Why the European Union matters from 2011 gave me a working example. I had ChatGPT create a 500-word summary from that paper and it produced: Netspar-EN-Example-ChatGPTDownload The key points and proposals in the original paper (mostly in sections 5 and 6, the summary — yes, there is again already a summary in the paper, which ChatGPT completely ignores) on page 45) are: The IORP directive is unclear and leads to a distortion of the market ChatGPT instead — clearly from parameters/training: The IORP Directive establishes a framework for occupational retirement provision across the EU. It ensures that pension funds are well-regulated, secure, and capable of providing adequate benefits to retirees. The directive’s scope and implementation in various member states are critical for a cohesive EU pension system. Separate pensions in economic and non-economic activities and regulate only the economic ones at EU level This is missing from the ChatGPT summary The summary by ChatGPT is pretty often empty waffle. It almost feels like a psychic con (I think I read this analogy somewhere) with its always-true generalisations that do not make an actual point, e.g.: ChatGPT: The constitutional dimension of SGEI within the Treaty framework sets the stage for how pensions are regulated and the legal obligations of member states ChatGPT: The paper concludes that understanding and integrating EU regulations is essential for national pension policymakers. The interplay between national policies and EU law is complex but necessary for the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems across Europe. This is not nonsense. But at the same time, as part of the summary it does not make sense. We cannot do anything with it (and thus, following Uncle Ludwig, it is meaningless) Conclusion about ‘summarising’ by LLM Chatbots ‘Summarising’ by LLM Chatbots seems to be influenced by two key inputs of text generation calculations: The parameters — which come from the training material. If the subject is well-represented by the parameters (there has been lots of it in the training material), the parameters dominate the summary more and the actual text you want to summarise influences the summary less. Hence: LLM Chatbots are pretty bad in making specific summaries of a subject that is widespread; The context — which is the prompts and answers up to this point in the chat, including the text you have given to summarise. If the context is relatively small, it has little influence and the result is dominated by the parameters, so not by the text you are trying to summarise; If the context is large enough and the subject is not well-represented by the parameters (there hasn’t been much about it in the training material), the text you want to summarise dominates the result. But the mechanism you will see is ‘text shortening‘, not true summarising. Having said that, that very short initial summary of Gemini of my post was pretty good (though incomplete). But it for instance left out the entire part in the article about human brains. So I asked it specifically as a follow-up question, and it told me: ‘Likely’? Never mind. But this summary is absolutely not a summary of that part of the story. Pure fabrication coming from the parameter side of the LLM calculations (which it even ‘admits’ by ‘might’). So: Actual text ‘summarising’ by LLMs looks more like ‘text shortening’ and that is not the same By the way: I find asking ChatGPT for a summary of a paper that already has a summary included, and ChatGPT ignoring that summary, actually a pretty effective illustration that there is fundamentally no understanding in LLMs, not even ’emerging’. PS. Gemini says (see above) in a footnote: “Websites reviewed: [ea.rna.nl/2022/10/24/on-the-psychology-…]”. I have not been able to ascertain that this is true, because Gemini also denies it used the website to make a summary (which is weird given the correct summary). So, did it add the content of the web site to the prompt, or was the web site part of the training? Inquiring minds would like to know. PPS. I have been sitting on a post that suggests we should look at LLM outputs as being influenced by three recognisable elements: the parameter volume, the training data, and the context. Each have distinguishable effects, but that is for next time. Maybe. This article is part of the ChatGPT and Friends Collection. In case you found any term or phrase here unclear or confusing (e.g, I can understand that most people do not immediately know that ‘context’ in LLMs is whatever has gone before in human (prompt) and LLM (reply) generated text, before producing the next token), you can probably find a clear explanation there.

The author states his conclusions but doesn't give the reader the information required to examine the problem. - Whether the article to be summarized fits into the tested GPT model's context size - The prompt - The number of attempts - He doesn't always state which information in the summary, specifically, is missing or wrong For example: \"I first tried to let ChatGPT one of my key posts (...). ChatGPT made a total mess of it. What it said had little to do with the original post, and where it did, it said the opposite of what the post said.\" He doesn't say which statements of the original article were reproduced falsely by ChatGPT. My experience is that ChatGPT 4 is good when summarizing articles, and extremely helpful when I need to shorten my own writing. Recently I had to write a grant application with a strict size limit of 10 pages, and ChatGPT 4 helped me a lot by skillfully condensing my chapters into shorter texts. The model's understanding of the (rather niche) topic was very good. I never fed it more than about two pages of text at once. It also adopted my style of writing to a sufficient degree. A hypothetical human who'd have to help on short notice probably would have needed a whole stressful day to do comparable work. reply the_other 20 hours agoparentYou write as if you’ve found a hole in the article’s argument. The lack of evidence is a hole in the reporting, for sure. The tone of your comment suggests you feel that by not publishing all their evidence, the author’s point is wrong (rather than under-justified). However, the example you use to back up your point also backs up the article’s point. The article’s point is that ChatGPT doesn’t summarise, it only shortens. Your example indicates shortening, but not summarising. reply jonplackett 20 hours agorootparentThere’s just so many articles of people whining about how ChatGPT can’t do things, when they clearly havent prompted it very thoughtfully. So I think that’s why you see so many reactions like this. I’ve found chatGPT incredibly good at all sorts of things people say it is bad at, but you need patience and to really figure out the boundaries of the task and keep adding guidance to the prompt to keep it on track. reply merlincorey 16 hours agorootparentThe article makes it clear that there is a semantic difference between shortening and summarizing and that importantly summarizing requires understanding which ChatGPT most certainly does not have. One example in the article is that if you have 35 sentences leading up to a 36th sentence conclusion, ChatGPT is very likely to shorten it to things in the earlier sentences and never actually summarize the important point. reply arisAlexis 11 hours agorootparentwhich chatgpt ? reply jules-jules 10 hours agorootparentprevAt what point does it become easier to just do the task yourself? I’ve pondered this question often and came to the conclusion that it’s not worth at the current level of output for me to tinker with it until I get sensible responses. reply kibbi 20 hours agorootparentprevIn the example I mentioned, ChatGPT 4 did keep all essential statements of my texts when reproducing shorter versions of them. For example, it often wrote one high-level sentence which skillfully summarized a paragraph of the original text. As far as I understand, this is what the author meant by 'summarizing' vs. 'shortening (while missing essential statements)'. I was impressed at those high-level summaries. If I had assigned this task to several humans, I'm not sure how many would have been able to achieve similar results. reply marcinzm 20 hours agoparentprevI agree. For example, looking at the ChatGPT link the author has, the model loaded 5 pages besides the one the author wanted. That clearly is going to cause some issues but the author didn't modify the prompt to prevent it. It was also a misspelled five (?) word prompt. I don't see how you can draw conclusions from a model not reading your mind when you give it basically no instructions. You need to treat models like an new hire you're delegating to and not an omniscient being that reads your intent on it's own. reply gctwnl 20 hours agorootparentWhy, if the author asks it to summarise a single webpage and gives the link should ChatGPT go out and load 5 more (one is the same page again, the others short overview pages, so won't have influenced the result much) And why all this talk about trying to engineer a prompt so that in the end the result is good? Should an actual usable system not just handle \"Please summarise [url/PDF]\"? That is, I suspect, what people expect to be able to do. reply marcinzm 19 hours agorootparentSummarize clearly means something different to the author and the people who think the model results are good. Everyone expects different things. Most people are used to others knowing their preferences and adjusting over time. Models do not unless you tell them. reply spaceship__sun 20 hours agorootparentprevExactly, 'ChatGPT can't do this that' is way too generic. We can't even be sure if GPT-5 is still the LLM architecture anymore. reply spencerchubb 21 hours agoparentprevI also could not find any mention of the methodology. reply sitkack 20 hours agorootparentWithout this detail, the whole body of work is anecdotal. reply benreesman 20 hours agorootparentTo be fair, most of the commentary on both sides of the LLM conversation are pretty anecdotal, which is increasingly looking like a structural problem given that any solid evidence goes in the training set in about an hour. reply gctwnl 20 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely. Otherwise it would have required a lot more than a single blog post. It is an observation, not anything rigorous with a large number of examples, and decent statistics. reply sitkack 14 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t require a whole more. 1) the full transcript of the llm exchange and 2) version numbers for the llm would go a long way. It is basically a long winded way of saying in a bug report, “it doesn’t work”. reply soulofmischief 20 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately this piece seems to be an exercise in confirmation bias and not a legitimate scientific inquiry. reply ADeerAppeared 21 hours agoprevThere's a fundamental problem with all these \"summary\" tasks, and it's obvious from the disclaimer that's on all these AI products: \"AI can be wrong, you must verify this\". A summary for which you must always read the un-summarized text is useless as a summary, this should be obvious to literally everyone, yet AI developers stick their heads in the sand about it because RAG lets them pretend AI is more useful than it actually is. RAG is useless, just fucking let it go and have AI stay in it's lane. reply probably_wrong 21 hours agoparentThe solution is to feed both the text and the summary back to ChatGPT and ask it to identify any inconsistencies.

They aren’t just asking “If I had infinite capital, would that be sufficient to achieve AGI by some method?”. reply moffkalast 8 hours agorootparentprevThat's why you use a local model instead, that way you're out of money after buying the GPUs already and don't have to bother with the implementation taps temple reply slibhb 21 hours agoparentprev> There's a fundamental problem with all these \"summary\" tasks, and it's obvious from the disclaimer that's on all these AI products: \"AI can be wrong, you must verify this\". > A summary for which you must always read the un-summarized text is useless as a summary, this should be obvious to literally everyone Nah, it's still useful if the summary is usually right or mostly right. At the limit, it's not even clear that something can be summarized perfectly. Consider that the alternative to reading the summary often isn't reading the entire text yourself. It's reading nothing. Also, in my experience, these tools often fail when it comes to questions with a definitive answer. E.g. if you pass them a lot of text and ask a detailed question with a very clear answer, they often get it wrong. But when your question is vague like \"summarize the text,\" they're very useful. reply thwarted 20 hours agorootparentit's still useful if the summary is usually right or mostly right. And you'd confirm that by having to read the unsummarized content. Thus useless. Consider that the alternative to reading the summary often isn't reading the entire text yourself. It's reading nothing. Reading an inaccurate summary is actually less useful than reading nothing. It's not like the utility of the summary is to exercise a reading muscle. reply slibhb 20 hours agorootparentYou can just assume it's right or mostly right and move on with your life. We're not talking about designing spaceships here. Being wrong is allowed. > Reading an inaccurate summary is actually less useful than reading nothing. It's not like the utility of the summary is to exercise a reading muscle. No it's not. You're acting like these tools generately wildly inaccurate text. Even when they're wrong, they're mostly accurate. Almost everything people read is a mostly accurate summary, whether it's from some guy's article or wikipedia. We rarely go to the primary source. edit - as a concrete example, I did my taxes this year with help from ChatGPT. It was a big improvement over using Google or reading through the instructions myself. And if it was wrong, well, maybe I'll get a bill or a check in the mail, but that was always a possibility and making a mistake on your taxes isn't illegal. reply layer8 20 hours agorootparent> making a mistake on your taxes isn't illegal.

The advocates of 'almost right is most cases is ok no harm done' are ignoring the (likely) operational and utility context of these tools. reply phil-martin 20 hours agorootparentprevIt’s certainly not perfect, but I would definitely not class it as useless in many circumstances Asking it to do a summary on a paper or meeting notes I’m mot familiar with, yes the utility is very limited exactly the way you’ve pointed out. However, asking it to summarise or shorten a paper or meeting notes I’ve been directly involved in - that has enormous utility for me. It provides me a quick starting point to create summaries, and I get to see if the salient points are addressed, and if not, I get to add them in. I’m no a fast writer, and often experience writers block, so having a fast way to start is enourmously useful to me. reply j-pb 20 hours agorootparentprevYou're ignoring the case where I the author want to create a summary of my own work, to be published along side it. reply ADeerAppeared 19 hours agorootparentprev> Consider that the alternative to reading the summary often isn't reading the entire text yourself.

The hiring process is meant to filter out bad interns. reply worble 20 hours agorootparentIf an intern gets it wrong, then you can sit down with them and teach them the correct process. Hopefully over time they get better, and once the trust is built you then stop being so involved. If they don't get any better, you find someone else to summarize for you. You can't go through this process with an AI, every time it's just a shot in the dark. reply bmicraft 19 hours agorootparentWith a specific model (just like with an intern), you only need to evaluate their work a certain amount of times to decide whether they're doing their job good enough to leave them alone and continue without further supervision reply ADeerAppeared 19 hours agorootparentprev> If you ask an intern to summarize some text, you trust them to do a half decent job Yes.

Medical records are not my bar though, nor would I be comfortable giving my medical records to 99% of the human race. The bar these tools need to meet for me is far more innocuous (code and apparently summarizing fluff articles) and two things can happen at the same time: 1. Models, and not to be understated, the engineering around them can improve until they pass the point we are comfortable using them in high stakes situations like medical records. 2. People's expectations come down until we settle on the agreed upon tasks where LLMs provide real value. My perspective is 1 will happen in the long term and 2 is what we should be focusing on right now to provide real immediate value with an eye on 1 so we reap the continued improvements. For 2 calibrating people's expectations are going to be messy and people rarely estimate the utility of something correctly in the early days, either over or under which is the reason for the mess. LLMs have been in the works for almost a decade (building on research that's been around since at least the 70s), but their utility has only been apparent for about two years. We're still super early days for that settling period. reply Closi 20 hours agorootparentprevThe failure rate that is “sufficient” will obviously change based on the use case. No, I might not want AI summarising my medical records right now, but I might be quite happy for it to summarise a blog post for me. reply nostrademons 21 hours agoparentprevInteresting. I read through the ChatGPT summary first, it seemed very plausible, then I read the original and I kinda see the author's point. The ChatGPT summary basically did gloss over every important detail in the original - but then, the details weren't important for generating a summary. I think that one of the author's key premises is false: > To summarise, you need to understand what the paper is saying. A summary is not about the author or about the summarizer, it's about the reader. It's about picking up on the portions of the original work that will matter to the reader's estimation of whether it's important to read the full work. And that actually depends much more on context and how the work relates to other works than it does about the specific details contained in the work. For example, Betteridge's Law of Headlines [1] basically provides a summary of any article whose title ends in a question, that summary is just \"No\", and it does so by making an observation about the authors rather than the content of the articles (about which it's completely agnostic). It reminds me of the problems that plague AI sentiment analysis. Machine learning is actually very good at that task, but you top out at about 70% precision because humans top out at 70% precision on sentiment analysis. At best, people only agree with each other ~70% of the time when judging the sentiment of a piece. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headline... reply Animats 20 hours agorootparentWhat this sounds like is this: - The author is pushing a specific proposal (a \"council of stakeholders\") in the pension space. - To support that, he wrote a long paper with much supporting information. - The ChatGPT summary system didn't pick up on his proposal being the important thing. - The author doesn't like that. reply sebastiennight 21 hours agorootparentprev- You're assuming that the goal of a summary is to decide whether one needs to read the full work. That's certainly one niche usage of a summary, but is definitely not the only one and is likely a minority of usage. Most summaries I've needed, from school to my career, were about not having to read the full work. - I would say Betteridge's Law of Headlines does not provide \"No\" as a summary to all of these articles. The accurate summary would be \"[Title]? No.\", since it seems fairly obvious that the word \"No\" is very light in information conveyed. On a personal note, I have to say I can't see the point in this current craze about summarizing everything. I never saw the point of those subscription programs which promise you'll \"read\" a book a week/a month because they'll send you a 5-min audio about the book. I think you're better off choosing one really awesome book a year and actually reading that. So I can't see how a (flawed or not) ChatGPT summary will provide any epiphany on the level you'd get from consuming fewer works, thoroughly. reply Swizec 21 hours agoparentprev> I would suggest a less strong but more plausible claim that GPT4o has trouble summarizing for longer form content outside the bounds of it's context window or something like a lossier attention mechanism is being used as a compromise for resource usage. This extends to your human readers. One of the more useful AI tools I’ve built for myself is a little thingy that looks at a piece of writing and answers ”What point is this article making?”. If the AI gets it wrong, I know my readers will also misunderstand what I’m saying. Back to the drawing board. The problem with making a subtle point that hinges on 1 detail in a vast sea of text is that 80% of humans will also miss that 1 detail. reply timeon 20 hours agorootparentHow do you know that most readers will also miss it?

I don't think people should spend much time trying to write a prompt to find a working solution because they could just do that. In the author's case, if he used the summary provided by ChatGPT, I doubt that anyone would have realized it's wrong, but that doesn't mean it's good either. The problem with LLMs is the lack of reliability and coherence. If it gives you a wrong answer and you ask it if it's sure, in most cases it will show another wrong answer and you need to go through multiple of these hops to get something fine. reply rplnt 21 hours agorootparentThis \"sorry, I was wrong, here's another wrong answer\" is basically my only experience with llm.

AI is also different in the sense that it has already gone through several hype cycles, each followed by an \"AI winter\" of broken dreams.

A straight summary wasn't very good, the \"summary of summaries\" approach as implemented by LangChain was garbage and didn't produce a summary at all, even a wrong one. The algorithm that actually worked: 1. Take the documents, chunk them up on paragraph then sentence then word boundaries using spaCy. 2. Generate embeddings for each chunk and cluster them using the silhouette score to estimate the number of clusters. 3. Take the top 3 documents closest to the centroid of each cluster, expand the context before and after so it's 9 chunks in 3 groups. 4. For each cluster ask the LLM to extract the key points as direct quotes from the document. 5. Take those quotes and match them up to the real document to make sure it didn't just make stuff up. 6. Then put all the quotes together and ask the LLM not to summarize, but to write the information presented in paragraph form. 7. Then because LLMs just can't seem to shut up about their answer make them return JSON {\"summary\": \"\", \"commentary\": \"\"} and discard the commentary. The LLM performs much better (to human reviewers) at keyphrase extraction than TextRank so I think there's genuinely some value there and obviously nothing else can really compose english like these models but I think we perhaps expect too much out of the \"raw\" model. reply __loam 20 hours agorootparentIt's cool to hear about something substantial that isn't just an api call to the \"God\" machine.

It probably is, but the odd random skips could also be explained by copy paste fails. Would be a better comparison if it was just provided in plain text. It's also all long context models getting pages of data, which even for these flagship ones is certainly just RoPE or similar which is a cheap hack but isn't super accurate [0]. 4o is best and still showing haystack benchmark accuracies below 80% and Gemini is just completely blind.

As it happens, I've just been using it this weekend to write code for me. Two things: (1) it's not business critical code, it's a side project that I want to get done but otherwise wouldn't have energy for. Especially not in this heatwave in a century old building that has no air-con. (2) my experiments are a weird mix of ChatGPT wildly messing things up and it managing to get basically everything done to an acceptable result (not quality of code, quality of output). Sometimes I have the same experience as you, that it's just aggravating in its non-comprehension, sometimes it's magical. I don't know if it can be magical more often if I was \"better at prompting\". But I do know that I also get aggravated (less often) by other humans not understanding me, and those are much harder to roll back to a previous point in the conversation, edit the prompt, and have them try again :P As for code quality… well, sure. Stuff I'm asking ChatGPT for is python and JavaScript, and I'm an iOS dev. I can't tell when it's doing something non-idiomatic, or using an obsolete library or archaic pattern in those languages. reply glenndebacker 21 hours agorootparentprevIt helps me to code (or helped me with mathematical concepts that I find difficult to implement or would take me a lot of time) but then again I use it for generating mainly graphics related code in Blender or as part of a grasshopper script so the code doesn't that much as the correct output. That being said, I often come in a situation that its not the code that is bad but the solution. Where I need to tell the LLM that it's not logical to do it in a certain way leveraging on my own knowledge. reply Bumblonono 21 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of people understand that LLM is not AI. Nonethless, try looking more left and right. There are really good opensource solutions which can surfe the web for you like stormai, Or you can use anythingllm and give it all your local files. You can write your tips and tricks, start commands, upgrade procedures etc. in Markdown and reference it through your local LLM.

Nonetheless, googles internal code review tool is already suggesting things which are getting accepted by more than 50%. Thats a lot and will only get better.

Nobody is surprised and none of this is suppressed because it's so obvious. What's delusional is the amount of criticism around the performance. The denial that AI is more and more matching human intelligence. Of course it's not there yet, but LLMs made a giant leap and bridged a huge gap. AI is no match for humanity now, that much is obvious. I think the delusion lies in the fact that many people are trying to deny the trendline... the obvious future and trajectory of what progress has been pointing too. Milestones are getting surpassed at a frightening pace. AI is now running circles around the turing test and I can now ride a car with no driver and it's normal in SF.

Waymo is a completely different technology than generative AI. Talking about how over a decade and billions of dollars in R&d in self driving is finally bearing fruit has nothing to do with the performance of LLMs. It is true that LLMs appear to be an exciting technology, but it's also delusional to assume they're following a positive trendline. Performance between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was like a 25% improvement that took 2500% more resources to train. It's clear that there's diminishing returns to bigger and bigger models, and the trend we've been seeing in the industry is actually smaller models trained for longer periods in an effort to bring down inference costs while maintaining current performance. More intelligent models may require new techniques and technologies that we don't have yet. I'm sure it will get better but the path to improving isn't as obvious as you're making it sound.

The fundamental assumption for humans is that when summarizing we will pay more attention to important bits, and sort of only give a passing mention to others if needed. For any model, the context is the only universe where it can assign importance based on previous learning (instruction tuning examples) and the prompt. For many, shortening of the text is equivalent to summarizing (when the text is not as long as a fifty page paper*). Output depends on the instruction training dataset, and seems like unless a model is trained on longer documents, it would not produce those kind of expected outputs. In a chain of thought reasoning scenario, it probably will. With Gemini, they definitely tested out long context and tuned the outputs for it to work well as it was their value prep - shown in I/O no less. I have been working on summarizing new papers using Gemini for the same purpose. I don't ask for summary though, i ask for the story the paper is trying to tell (with different sections) and get great output. Not sharing the links here, because it would be self promotion. reply glenndebacker 21 hours agoprevI've noticed that when using a language model for rephrasing text it also sometimes seem to miss important details because it clearly has no real understanding of the text. It's not a problem when you are aware of it and with some follow up input you can get it mitigated, but often I see that people tend to take the first output of these systems at face value. People should be a bit more critical in that regards. reply Bumblonono 21 hours agoparentI really don't wanna be nitpicky, but what do you mean by 'no real understanding of the text'? How do you benchmark something or someone understanding text?

The illusion is shattered after a few prompts. To use your comparison with humans: if any human said such naive and utterly wrong things we’d assume they were either heavily intoxicated or just had no understanding of what they’re talking about and are simply bluffing. I guess at best you can say these models have an ‘understanding’ of language, but their ability to waffle endlessly and eruditely about any well-known topic you can throw at it is just further evidence of this — not that it understands the content. reply Bumblonono 6 hours agorootparentSo we officially accept that certain voting people, irrational people are constantly heavily intoxicated or had no understanding?

LLMs are interestingly enough somewere inbetween. reply FeepingCreature 18 hours agorootparentprevCan you post examples? reply xanderlewis 6 hours agorootparentSure. Something I tried the other day was asking questions about modular arithmetic — specifically, phrased in terms of quotient groups of the integers. Things like ‘how many homomorphisms are there between Z/12Z and Z/6Z?’. I was able to trip it up very easily with these sorts of questions, especially when it tries to ‘explain’ its answers and it says ridiculous (but superficially and momentarily plausible-looking) things like ‘the only solutions to the equation 12x = 0 (mod 12) in Z/12Z are {[0], [3], [6], [9]}, therefore…’. You can also just quiz it on certain basic definitions. Ask it for examples of objects that don’t exist (graphs or categories with certain properties, etc.). Sometimes it’ll be adamant that its stated example works, but usually it will quickly apologise and admit to being wrong only to give almost exactly the same (broken) argument again. Another thing you can try is concocting some question that isn’t even syntactically well-formed (i.e. fails even a type check) like ‘is it true that cyclic integer lattices are uniformly bounded below in the Riemann topology?’. I imagine that one is too far out to work, but when I’ve played around I’ve found many such absurd questions ChatGPT was only too happy to answer — with utter nonsense, of course. It’s interesting (and, I think, quite telling) that such systems are seemingly almost completely unable to decline to answer a question. And the reason is that there’s no difference between hallucination and non-hallucination. Internally, it’s exactly the same process. It either knows or doesn’t know — but it doesn’t know that it knows (or doesn’t). LLMs basically only work on questions that are very similar to, or identical to, questions that have already been widely asked and answered online or in books… hence their lack of utility in mathematical research, or even in calculating one’s taxes, or whatever. I could provide some more literal examples, but I’d have to go and try some and pick the ones that work, and even then they might not work on your end because of the pseudorandomness and the fact that the model keeps getting updated and patched. It’s better to just play around on your own based on the ideas I’ve given. The moral is to use LLMs as a powerful way of finding information, but don’t trust anything it says. Use it to find better sources more quickly than you’d be able to via a search engine. reply simonw 21 hours agoprevSomething I find frustrating about summarization is that while it's one of the most common uses of LLMs I've actually found very little useful material investigating ways of implementing it.

At what point should you attempt more advanced tricks, like having one prompt extract key ideas and a second prompt summarize those? reply impure 20 hours agoparentMost LLMs behave very similarly IMO, the biggest difference is the formatting. Although in my language learning app I found Gemini Flash a bit better at explaining things. 'provide a summary of this text' will give you very generic responses usually in bullet points.

You know how when you try to talk to someone about a subject they're unfamiliar with, and it goes from one ear out the other? That's how LLMs are when they ask them to pick out the divergent ideas from documents. Products like ChatGPT are rewarded in their fine tuning for doing happy sounding cheerleading of whatever bland unsophisticated corpo docs you throw at it. Consumer products like this simply aren't designed for novelty, although there's plenty of AIs that are. For example, AlphaFold is something that's designed to search through an information space and discover novel stuff that's good. ChatGPT is something that's designed to ingratiate itself with emotional individuals using a flawed language that precludes rational thinking. That's the problem with the English language. It's the lowest common demonstrator. Any specialized field like programming, the natural sciences, etc. that wants to make genuine progress, has always done so historically by inventing a new language, e.g. jargon, programming languages. The only time normal language is able to communicate divergent ideas is when the speaker has high social status. When someone who doesn't have high social status communicates something novel, we call it crazy. LLMs, being robots, have very low social status. That's why they're trained to act the way they do. reply djbusby 21 hours agoprevOne thing I've used GPT and Gemini for is to summarize HN threads. It does OK finding top level points but in the conversation (thread) there are (generally) some one-off points I find key but neither AI can identify these \"key topics at the leaf\" (I don't know what else to call them). What prompt am I missing?

This is what I use: Give a report on the key insights from the following comment section. Do not include a title and do not discuss the name of the post or the name of the site, we already know that. Your report should be structured using paragraphs and it should discuss the points covered. In addition to the main points be sure to include insightful niche points that may not be as popular or ignored by other commenters. For each point discuss any notable arguments, counter arguments, or anecdotes.Comment section:$commentSection It's still a bit experimental. Hacker News comment sections are very large (100k+) characters so it probably won't find everything. It also adds a summary section at the end which is annoying but not too bad. And it will literally say 'these are niche points'. I find it a bit funny but there's no reason to fix it. I'm using Gemini Flash. reply aspenmayer 21 hours agoparentprevI think this is perhaps unanswerable without additional context, such as upvote/downvote/flag history, as there's an implicit assumption in your request that you be presented with a summary of points relevant to you and without that added context, the AI has no way of knowing your expectations regarding relevance. reply lopuhin 21 hours agoprevCurious which model was used? Sorry if I missed that. Looks like an important detail to mention when doing an evaluation. reply lyu07282 20 hours agoparentI wouldn't call that an evaluation. They are expressing subjective opinions and feelings, text summarization is an active area of research, there are many benchmark datasets and evaluation measures that make progress quantifiable. Which makes rants like this seem rather pointless and uninformed. Here is an example for something less subjective: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04269 reply impure 20 hours agoprevMy RSS reader automatically generates AI summaries for Hacker News posts and it works pretty well. Sometimes when I comment on a post I have to double check the summary is correct and it always does a really good job. I even had it generate comment summaries. It needs a bit of prompting to highlight individual arguments but it also does well here. I am very skeptical of the author's claims. Perhaps the parts of the articles being summarized are not actually important so the LLMs did not include them. Or perhaps the article does an exceptionally bad job of explaining why the argument is important. Also there's a difference between the API and free web interface. I think the web version has a bunch more system prompting to be helpful which may make a summary harder to do. reply kingkongjaffa 20 hours agoprevA big reason for 'content drift' is that LLM's are like a sliding context window of the input text plus the prompt, and for each new token generated, the next token prediction is using the previously LLM generated tokens as well. Giving a LLM too much context causes the same effect, as the sliding window moves on from the earliest tokens. It's also why summarization is bad. It's not exactly linear though according to the text from start to finish, bit's of context get lost from throughout the input text at random and will be different each time the same input is run. A good way to mitigate this is to break up the text and execute in smaller chunks, even with models boasting large context, results drop off significantly with large inputs so using several smaller prompts is better. reply KTibow 21 hours agoprev> did it add the content of the web site to the prompt, or was the web site part of the training? Likely it added the content to the prompt, but the content didn't stay in the prompt for the next prompt. The next prompt likely only had general web results as context. reply andix 21 hours agoprevI had a similar experience with ChatGPT and larger documents. Even basic RAG tasks don't work well (RAG = Retrieval-augmented generation). The most basic Langchain RAG examples performs much better. The usual approach is to split up the document into pages and then smaller text fragments (a few hundred characters). Only those smaller fragments are then processed by the LLM. In this case I would take a similar approach, split the document into multiple smaller (and overlapping) fragments, let a LLM summarize each one of those into key findings, and in a next step merge those key findings to a summary. I have not a lot experience though, if this would provide better results. reply _def 20 hours agoprev> The article discusses the author's experience and observations regarding the use of language model-based tools like ChatGPT for summarizing texts, specifically highlighting their limitations. The author initially believed summarizing was a viable application for such models but found through practical application that these tools often fail to produce accurate summaries. Instead of summarizing, they tend to merely shorten texts, sometimes omitting crucial details or inaccurately representing the original content. This is attributed to the way language models prioritize information, often influenced more by the vast amount of data they've been trained on rather than the specific content they are summarizing. The author concludes that these tools are less reliable for producing meaningful and accurate summaries, especially when the text is complex or detailed. The experimentation with summaries on different subjects further demonstrated that these models often produce generalized content that lacks specific, actionable insights from the original texts. reply arisAlexis 11 hours agoprevI have worked with these kind of documents and one of the main problems is that they are so vague and generic and repetitive that not even humans can comprehend and summarize them correctly because they are produced as bureaucracy artefacts to present to management to get fund to make more papers reply tkgally 21 hours agoprevAre there any objective benchmarks for rating and comparing the summarization performance of LLMs? I've had mixed results when using the latest versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to summarize texts that I know well (books I have read, papers I wrote, transcripts of online meetings I attended). Often their summaries are as good as or maybe even better than what I could prepare myself, but sometimes they omit key points or entire sections. Other than failures clearly due to context length limitations, it's hard to judge which LLM is a better summarizer overall or whether a new LLM version is better than the previous one. reply throw156754228 20 hours agoprevIt's even worse than the author writes.

Of course, it obvious in hindsight that to create a useful summary requires reasoning over the content, and given that reasoning is one of the major weaknesses of LLMs, it should have been obvious that their efforts to summarize would be surface level \"shortening\" rather than something deeper that grokked the full text and summarized the key points. reply spencerchubb 21 hours agoprevWas this with GPT 3.5 or 4?

Most of the enabling tech here is months old, and there's still tons of unaddressed markets and use cases.

The new legislation shifts towards more complete pension contracts and emphasizes operational execution, necessitating changes in pension fund governance. The authors propose strengthening pension funds' internal organization, improving accountability to participants, and enhancing the powers of participant representation bodies. Key recommendations include establishing a recognizable governance structure with clear responsibilities, creating a College of Stakeholders (CvB) to replace existing accountability bodies, and granting the CvB more authority, including appointment and dismissal powers. The proposals aim to balance the interests of social partners, pension funds, and participants while ensuring transparency and effective oversight. The article emphasizes principles such as transparency, trust, loyalty, and prudence in shaping governance reforms. It also discusses the impact of digitalization (DORA), the need for pension funds to demonstrate value, and the potential for further consolidation in the sector. International perspectives, including insights from the World Bank, inform the proposed governance improvements. These changes are designed to help pension funds adapt to the new system, manage risks effectively, and maintain their \"license to operate\" in a changing landscape. ``` Similarly, the second article's summary also captures the key points that the author points out (emphasis mine). ``` The article \"Regulating pensions: Why the European Union matters\" explores the growing influence of EU law on pension regulation. While Member States retain primary responsibility for pension provision, the authors argue that EU law significantly impacts national pension systems through both direct and indirect means. The paper begins by examining the EU's institutional framework regarding pensions, focusing on the principles of subsidiarity and the division of powers between the EU and Member States. It emphasizes that the EU can regulate pension matters when the Internal Market's functioning is at stake, despite lacking specific regulatory competencies for pensions. The authors note that the subsidiarity principle has not proven to be an obstacle for EU action in this area. The article then delves into EU substantive law and its impact on pensions, concentrating on the concept of Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) and its role in classifying pension fund activities as economic or non-economic. The authors discuss the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), highlighting its importance in determining when pension schemes fall within the scope of EU competition law. They emphasize that the CJEU's approach is based on the degree of solidarity in the scheme and the extent of state control. ** The paper examines the IORP Directive, outlining its current scope and limitations. The authors argue that the directive is unclear and leads to distortions in the internal market, particularly regarding the treatment of pay-as-you-go schemes and book reserves. They propose a new regulatory framework that distinguishes between economic and non-economic pension activities. For non-economic activities, the authors suggest a soft law approach using a non-binding code or communication from the European Commission. This would outline the basic features of pension schemes based on solidarity and the conditions for exemption from EU competition rules. For economic activities, they propose a hard law approach following the Lamfalussy technique, which would provide detailed regulations similar to the Solvency II regime but tailored to the specifics of IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision). ** The authors conclude that it's impossible to categorically state whether pensions are a national or EU competence, as decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. They emphasize the importance of considering EU law when drafting national pension legislation and highlight the need for clarity in the division of powers between the EU and Member States regarding pensions. Overall, the paper underscores the complex interplay between EU law and national pension systems, calling for a more nuanced understanding of the EU's role in pension regulation and a clearer regulatory framework that respects both EU and national competencies. ``` I'd bet that the author used GPT 3.5-turbo (aka the free version of ChatGPT) and did not give any particular prompting help.

I've been having a surprisingly good time in my 'discussions' with the free online chatgpt, which has a cutoff date of 2022. What really impresses me is the results of persistence on my part when the replies are too canned, which can be astonishing. In one discussion, I asked it to generate random sequences of 4 digits, 0000-9999, until a specific given number occurred. It would, as if pleased with its work, give the number within 10 tries. I suppose this is due to computational limitations that I don't understand. However, when with great effort, I criticized its method and results enough, I got it to double the efforts before it lazily 'found' an occurrence of the given number. It claimed it was doing what i asked. It surely wasn't. But it seemed oblivious. I'm interested to understand this. I'm sure I'll get some contempt fo my ignorance here, but I asked to analyze pi to some unremembered placeholder until it found a Fibonacci sequence. It couldn't. Maybe one doesn't exist. As obvious as this might be to smarter primates here, I don't understand. I was mostly entertaining myself with various off the hat things. What I did realize, is what by my standards, is fierce potential. This has me wanting to, if even possible, acquire my version with, perhaps, the possibility of real time/internet interaction. Is this possible without advanced coding ability? Is it possible at all? What would be a starting point and some helpful pointers along the way.

The airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, has in recent years launched a series of legal actions against third-party booking platforms that resell its tickets without permission. It says the companies, which use screen-scraping software to find and resell tickets, add additional charges and make it difficult for the airline to contact passengers. A jury in the District Court of Delaware unanimously found that Booking.com violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse act and that it had induced a third party to access parts of Ryanair's website without authorisation \"with an intent to defraud,\" the verdict said. The court also rejected counterclaims by Booking.com that Ryanair had defamed the booking platform and that the airline was engaged in unfair competition. In a statement, Booking.com said it was disappointed with the decision, with which its disagrees. \"We maintain that allowing customers to access and compare fares across the travel industry promotes consumer choice, and plan to appeal,\" it added. \"We expect that this ruling will end the internet piracy and overcharging perpetrated on both airlines and other travel companies and consumers by the unlawful activity of OTA (online travel agent) Pirates,\" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said. He said he hoped the ruling would force consumer agencies across Britain and Europe to take action to outlaw illegal screen scraping and overcharging of consumers for flights and ancillary services. Ryanair has in recent months signed deals with a number of online travel agents for the authorised resale of the airline's tickets.

This lawsuit is not about ryanair's pricing model, so that the company engages in bad practices is irrelevant to the court decision. What matters is that booking.com wants to earn money on selling ryanair tickets while evading using reseller agreements by using the site as if they were a private customer (likely also against the terms of service), with supposedly some bad side-effects like ryanair being unable to communicate with the customer (which could be bad if they wanted to e.g. give you a notice about the flight during the sales process). You will have to sue ryanair specifically about their pricing to get a decision on that, which of course first requires ensuring that it is unlawful or unfair business conduct within your jurisdiction (which it might not be). > bookingcom acts as a user agent in my service so why should Ryanair have any legal basis on preventing bookingcom from doing so?! They are not your useragent, they are acting as a reseller: You buy a product from them which they acquire elsewhere, taking a profit in the process. If they were in fact entirely transparent in the process, merely allowing you to purchase the product at the best available price directly (e.g., a plugin to find deals/discounts, VPN to get it from the cheapest region, etc.), then the case would have been hard or impossible for ryanair to make. reply wodenokoto 5 hours agorootparentI think parents point is: It’s only because of Ryan Airs business model of upselling via dark patterns that they care. And because of these dark patterns, parent as a consumer is willing to pay someone else to go through the booking process and avoid the dark pattern on their behalf. And the point is good: if company A is annoying to interact with, why can’t you pay company B to do it for you? reply SkyBelow 3 hours agorootparentIsn't the issue that you can do that, but Company A can also add in a clause that you can only do business with us (or with this specific product/website/etc. we offer) if you agree to be buying the tickets for yourself and not for someone else. In which case, if Company B says they are, they are lying. I think one interesting question from this is what happens when you put an AI in there instead. If Company B sells an AI that Person can use to interact with Company A, at what point does it count as Person's interaction and at what point does it count as Company A's interaction. Obviously Person is allowed to use technology to interact on behalf of them. They are using Chrome, or IE, or Firefox, etc. This doesn't count as Google/Microsoft/Mozilla interacting with Company A. So on a continuum (likely multi dimensional) from internet browsers to what Booking.com did in this case, including AI somewhere in the continuum space, where is the legal limit? reply mschuster91 3 hours agorootparentprev> They are not your useragent, they are acting as a reseller: You buy a product from them which they acquire elsewhere, taking a profit in the process. Yeah so what? Why should anyone, be it a private person or a commercial entity, be restricted from buying something and then re-selling it to another person or entity? The only thing I'm willing to accept as a restriction for any kind of legal transaction is a reasonable price cap (i.e. no sale above face value of tickets + 5% fees) to get scalpers under control and for security reasons (e.g. name-bound tickets for sports events to prevent hooligans from attending or flight tickets to prevent terrorists from boarding). But neither applies in this case - flight tickets usually are not a scarce commodity that attracts scalpers and the airline has the full set of PNR data. reply WillPostForFood 2 hours agorootparentflight tickets usually are not a scarce commodity that attracts scalpers If airline ticket resale was as easy as concert tickets, you'd probably see a predatory scalping market develop. Airplane tickets are scarce in that there is limited ability to adjust supply, especially in the short term.

This is the first opinion on the case from 2021 which denied Booking Holdings Inc request to dismiss: [1] https://www.ded.uscourts.gov/sites/ded/files/opinions/20-cv-... Ryanair (Irish company) makes one claim against Delaware corporation Booking Holdings Inc (including subsidiaries Kayak Software Corporation and Priceline LLC as Delaware corporations and Agoda as a Singaporean company) citing 18 USC 1030(a)(2)(C), (a)(4) and (a)(5)(A)-(C)[2]. Amongst reasons to seek dismissal of the case, Booking Holdings Inc name drops Etraveli, Mystifly and Travelfusion as the three companies which were used by Booking Holdings Inc to scrape airline websites including Ryanair's website. It's hard from just this opinion to figure out what exactly Booking Holdings Inc, Etraveli, Mystifly and/or Travelfusion may have been found to do wrong. It sounds most likely that Ryanair may have successfully argued their public website is a \"protected computer\" because there is a \"By clicking search you agree to the Website Terms of Use\" button on their main website search form, and the ToS is the form of \"protection\". Looking behind the scenes, it's a fairly simple \"anonymous token\" API request without any secrets being required to ask the API to respond. Deleting the HTML elements from the DOM that provide the \"By clicking search you agree..\" and the associated checkbox doesn't prevent the form from being submitted and results returned successfully.

The airline said the change would have been free if they could do it themselves, but the request had to originate from booking.com, who not only charged nearly €200 but also took so long about it (a week) they were almost too late.

That is of course until you add all the additional charges. reply surfingdino 9 hours agoparentYou can fly for not a lot of money on Ryanair, their fee structure, website, and app are similar to all other budget airlines. Those extra fees are for handling your luggage (extra manpower and fuel). If you want to complain about Ryanair's fees, get hold of the Fees Schedule for the airport you fly from and to. You will learn how much airports charge for landing, parking, hangarage, handling, fuel, etc. It's an eye-opening read. reply rsynnott 9 hours agoparentprevRyanair's claim was that Booking.com etc was reselling its seats, adding its own charges on top, and providing false passenger details. It's in Ryanair's interest to portray this as basically a screen scraping case (because Ryanair don't like screen scraping in general), but there does seem to be more to it than just that. reply ta1243 9 hours agorootparentRyanair relies on dark patterns and brainwashing as part of the checkout process to sell you hotels, insurance, car hire, etc. Those feed into their income stream. If you bypass that process they don't make their profit. reply Toutouxc 7 hours agorootparentI still don't understand, I flew with them last year, and just now I dry-ran booking a flight from Prague to Bologna. The entire thing feels quite streamlined and straightforward. Pick two dates, you're offered flights on or around the dates, you pick the flights, then you pick the \"package\" (basic, regular, plus, flexi plus) and it shows a HUGE matrix with big fat check marks for stuff you get and no check marks for stuff you DON'T GET (reserved seats, cabin luggage, checked luggage, free check-in at the airport). Honestly, if someone can't navigate the process as it is today, I'd be worried about them traveling to a foreign country. Any additional offers (hotels, insurance, cars) you can safely ignore. reply switch007 4 hours agorootparentYes, in their defense, that matrix is an improvement. Though it's not perfect and still intended to fool people: you would expect as you go up the tiers that everything from the previous tier is included but that's not the case: \"Plus\" doesn't include a carry-on/priority boarding from the \"Regular\" fare. And the most expensive option \"Flexi Plus\" doesn't include a checked bag (easy to miss when all other options are included) reply 2rsf 7 hours agorootparentprevI am not sure what \"dark patterns and brainwashing\" are you referring to, I booked flights through Norwegian- a calm scandinavian low cost company, and had to say no many times to car and hotel offers. The same when renting cars from big companies. reply ta1243 6 hours agorootparentLets say 20% of people booking through ryanair and paying £30 for a flight go for their \"upselling\" (which is deliberatly designed to get more people to add it). That makes ryanair £50 each. That pushes the revenue per customer upto £40. Lets say the cost is £35, and thus ryanair makes £5 profit per passenger. Now lets say someone else comes along as sells the ryanair flight for £30 and has their own \"upselling\": \"Click here to not avoid missing out on our great protection package\" etc. Ryanair now is making a £5 loss on each ticket sold, and the reseller is making it instead. reply Havoc 5 hours agoprevHow does the fraud part come in here? Not seeing it reply Oras 9 hours agoprevI always thought booking sites had partnerships with airlines and using an API! reply michaelt 7 hours agoparentMost airlines have partnerships with booking sites, provide an API, pay the booking site a commission, and have a pricing structure that lets them profitably sell tickets at the advertised prices. Ryanair doesn't pay a commission to booking sites, and their pricing model is to advertise $15 flights but making booking an obstacle course so plenty of passengers find themselves paying $60 instead. They therefore don't provide an API for the booking sites to use. reply lifestyleguru 9 hours agoprevSimultaneously being hostile towards users with upselling dark patterns and towards web scappers where everyone is a suspect, that's what most of the web has become. reply rob74 9 hours agoparentMind you, Booking.com is no stranger to using dark patterns itself... reply 2rsf 7 hours agorootparentEven more than Ryanair, they are on the verge of cheating in the search and order process while Ryanair \"merely\" shows aggressive offers. reply lifestyleguru 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm avoiding them at all cost, unfortunately I'm unable to avoid airline reservation websites and apps reply b800h 7 hours agoprevSo this was a criminal offence.

Depends where you are, really. In Europe, where Ryanair does virtually all their business, courts have generally been reluctant to take the \"haha, you clicked on the website, you've magically agreed to the license\" thing as being particularly meaningful, and recent regulations have cut down the usefulness of EULAs even further. That said, Ryanair prices aren't login-walled anyway. reply codetrotter 9 hours agorootparentprev [–] This case is about more than that: > It says the companies, which use screen-scraping software to find and resell tickets, add additional charges and make it difficult for the airline to contact passengers. reply benj111 9 hours agorootparent [–] What it's 'about' (according to one side) and the law involved are 2 separate things. When I buy something from the supermarket, they add charges and make it difficult for the manufacturer to contact me directly, so that isn't illegal. Many things with bad outcomes are legal. Breaking the terms of service of the site may be illegal, and if you're mis representing yourself to log in, even more so.

I read less about the culture of the poor and working-class because I experienced it firsthand. I’m familiar. Subscribe But occasionally I do read about it. One insightful book is Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage by Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas. In their book, Edin, a sociology professor at Princeton, and Kefalas, a sociology professor at St. Joseph’s University, explore why low-income women are disproportionately likely to be unmarried and uninvolved with the father of their children. A common answer from the chattering class is money. The conventional view is that a lack of money leads to out-of-wedlock births. But broken homes are a fairly recent phenomenon. In 1960, across social classes, the vast majority of children were raised by both of their birth parents. By 2005, there was a massive divergence. Rob Henderson @robkhenderson Children living with both biological parents Affluent families in 1960: 95% Working class families in 1960: 95% Affluent families in 2005: 85% Working class families in 2005: 30% goodreads.com/book/show/1203… 2:09 PM ∙ Sep 29, 2019 1,877Likes839Retweets What happened? Today, one in six American men between the ages of 25 and 54 are unemployed or out of the workforce altogether: about 10 million men. This number has more than doubled since the 1970s. Over the past half-century, the number of men per capita behind bars has more than quadrupled. Among white American males in the bottom 30 percent of socioeconomic status, the number of prison inmates per capita has quintupled since 1975. For those in the top 20 percent of socioeconomic status, the rate has remained virtually unchanged. Source: Coming Apart (2012) From Edin and Kefalas: “Most social scientists who study poor families assume financial troubles are the cause of these breakups. After all, these young people grow up in a context of extreme disadvantage, at least by American standards, and they come of age with little education, few skills, and not many future prospects. Lack of money is certainly a contributing cause, as we will see, but rarely the only factor. It is usually the young father’s criminal behavior, the spells of incarceration that so often follow, a pattern of intimate violence, his chronic infidelity, and an inability to leave drugs and alcohol alone that cause relationships to falter and die.” Poor behavior from young males is an important and often overlooked reason why rates of fatherless homes have increased. More from the book: “Money is seldom the primary reason mothers give to explain why they and their children’s fathers are no longer together. Although a lazy or spendthrift boyfriend is certainly an aggravation…the mother usually points to far more serious offenses as the prime forces that pull young families apart. It is the drug and alcohol abuse, the criminal behavior and subsequent incarceration, the repeated infidelity…” The authors continue: “Conflicts over money do not usually erupt simply because the man cannot find a job or because he doesn’t earn as much as someone with better skills or more education. Money usually becomes an issue because he seems unwilling to keep at a job for any length of time, usually because of issues related to respect. Some of the jobs he can get don’t pay enough to give him the self-respect he feels he needs, and others require him to get along with unpleasant customers and coworkers, and to maintain a submissive attitude toward the boss.” It used to be high-status to hold a job and take care of your family. Not so much anymore. Those who sit at or near the apex of the social ladder (who decide what behaviors are prestigious) have decided that family stability is unimportant. In a fascinating article, Patrick Parkinson, a law professor at the University of Queensland, recounted his experiences at an international expert group gathered to discuss family policy at the UN headquarters in New York. At the event, Parkinson stressed the importance of stability and two-parent families for children. Many members of the group, comprised of academic elites, took exception. But privately, some of them whispered agreement. Parkinson writes: “I was surprised then, when one of the members of the Expert Group who was most insistent that two-parent families were just an ideal, said to me quietly, as we were packing up, that she agreed that family stability mattered. She described the strict and ordered regime in her own home (one with two biological, albeit unmarried parents). Her young children had routine, and clear boundaries. She restricted their television usage. It was a reward, not a staple of their entertainment diet. Yes, she agreed, stability does matter to children; but having made that enormous concession to my point of view, she suggested jokingly that I had better leave now. It was not a concession she would make openly, and nor could she have articulated it in the course of the meeting. In her public professional world, marriage is most unfashionable, and stability is not important if that is somehow to be contrasted with adults’ pursuit of their own happiness.” This highly educated and affluent person prioritized stability for her own children. But refused to publicly endorse this value so that less fortunate children could also benefit from family stability. If you come from poverty and chaos, you are up against 3 enemies: 1. Dysfunction and deprivation 2. Yourself, as a result of what that environment does to you 3. The upper class, who wants to keep you mired in it The people with the most money and education—the class most responsible for shaping politics and culture and customs—ensure that their children are raised in stable homes. But actively undermine the norm for everyone else. Returning to Promises to Keep, Edin and Kefalas observe that the “middle-class” (referring to those who hold college degrees) determines norms around relationships: “Poor unmarried couples try hard to keep it together for the baby. Yet they borrow their notions of commitment from the broader culture, and most middle-class couples who are still in the dating phase, even those who cohabit, believe that as long as they are not married, it is acceptable for either partner to walk away at any time, and for virtually any reason. Of course, middle-class couples who date or cohabit only rarely have children together.” And they go on: “Unmarried parents borrow from the norms most close-at-hand. On the one hand, they adopt expectations of financial responsibility and, as we shall see, sexual fidelity, as couples in marriage do. But on the other, walking away from a nonmarital union is not viewed as a betrayal of a vow, and it is more or less okay to hold oneself open to a better option, should one come along.” The educated class decides cohabiting partnerships are just as valid and important as marriage. And they also believe it’s okay to walk away at a moment’s notice from a cohabiting relationship. Poor and working-class people follow suit. To the detriment of themselves and their children. They are more likely to have children out of wedlock. And then enter into a string of relationships with various partners. They spend time investing in new relationships, diverting attention away from their children. Among new parents who are unmarried—usually poor or working-class—half enter a new relationship by the time their children are five years old. At a time when their children need attentive care, these parents are then engaged in the intense emotional work of building a new romantic relationship. This is an overlooked reason why kids in low-income families are more likely to experience neglect. Luxury beliefs are ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while often inflicting costs on the lower classes. Edin and Kefalas describe the behavior of young males in low-income neighborhoods: “Chanel, a white thirty-three-year-old with three children, ages fifteen, nine, and three, broke up with her youngest child’s father just after we met her for the first time. When we ask about him later, she says dismissively, ‘He’s not around no more. I got rid of him…He was only here to sleep—didn’t want to pay no bills, didn’t want to do nothing. When he was here all he did was fight and argue and drink. I had to get rid of [him].’ She purses her lips in disgust as she tells us such men are unworthy of the children they father.” More: “Young mothers regularly rail against young fathers who squander too much of their earnings on alcohol, marijuana, new stereo components, computer accessories, expensive footwear, or new clothing, while the needs of the family are, in their view, not adequately met. Amy, a white thirty-year-old mother of three, ages six, five, and three, had a boyfriend who worked steadily but insisted on spending on selfish pursuits. This is what eventually broke the young couple up. ‘He wouldn’t spend money for the kids’ food. I had to send my kids across the street to my mom’s to feed them and stuff. That’s what I got fed up with. I shouldn’t have to live like that…I said it’s time for him to support these kids instead of [me] being on [assistance], and he didn’t like it.’” Absent fathers and broken family units are major factors for many social ills. It’s obvious but no one wants to talk about it. I am well aware of the behavior genetics research, twin studies, and so on indicating little effect of home environment on personality, propensity for crime, addiction, and so on. These studies are inapplicable for kids living in extreme dysfunction. Behavior geneticists investigate the relative role of genetic and environmental variation within the sampled population. Behavioral genetics studies report findings from within the environmental variation in their samples, not in all conceivable environments. For example, there are many studies on identical twins separated at birth who are adopted by different families. Researchers find little difference between these twins when they are adults. Their personalities, IQ, preferences, and so on are very similar. But twins are usually adopted by intact middle-class families. They are typically taken in by married parents with the means to jump through the hoops to qualify for adoption. Additionally, adoptive parents are the kind of people who would adopt, which introduces another layer of similarity. I’ve yet to see any twin studies with one set of identical twins raised in extremely bad environments and another in good ones. The intelligence researcher Russell T. Warne has written: “A problem with heritability study samples is that they tend to consist of more middle and upper-class individuals than a representative sample would have…results of behavioral genetics studies will indicate genes are important—if a person already lives in an industrialized nation in a home where basic needs are met...it is not clear how well these results apply to individuals in highly unfavorable environments.” In a chapter titled Genes and the Mind, the psychologist David Lykken states: “If twins were separated as infants and placed, one with a middle-class Minnesota family and the other with an 18-year-old unmarried mother living on AFDC in the South Bronx, the twins will surely differ 30 years later.” Yes, genes are responsible for human traits and behavior. But these traits are responsive to social norms and other environmental factors too. Height is 90 percent heritable. But it is still malleable by the environment. Before Korea was divided, Northerners were taller than Southerners. Today, North Koreans are 6 inches shorter, on average, than South Koreans. Did their genes change? No. Their environments did. Obesity is highly heritable (40-70%) but the percentage of Americans who are obese has tripled since 1982. Access to food made people change their behavior by eating more. Tobacco use is highly heritable (60-80%) but the percentage of Americans who smoke has dropped by half since 1982. Strong norms against smoking made people change their behavior by smoking less. Norms were loosened around being an absentee father. So more men took the option. But nobody wants to admit it because it upsets people. Instead, we retreat to discussions of poverty and economics because talking about family and parenting makes people feel weird and judgmental. But young men will only do what’s expected of them. And a lot did use to be expected. There were social norms to work hard, provide, take care of loved ones, and so on. Today, these norms have largely dissolved. Young men have responded accordingly. In a fascinating 2012 paper titled Sexual Economics, Culture, Men, and Modern Sexual Trends, the psychologists Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs wrote: “Although this may be considered an unflattering characterization…we have found no evidence to contradict the basic general principle that men will do whatever is required in order to obtain sex, and perhaps not a great deal more. (One of us characterized this in a previous work as, ‘If women would stop sleeping with jerks, men would stop being jerks.’) If in order to obtain sex men must become pillars of the community, or lie, or amass riches by fair means or foul, or be romantic or funny, then many men will do precisely that.” They are speaking specifically about sexual rewards. But this can be applied more broadly to social rewards in general. People think that if a young guy comes from a disorderly or deprived environment, he should be held to low standards. This is misguided. He should be held to high standards. Otherwise, he will sink to the level of his environment. In contrast, a young male from a stable and affluent background is less in need of external pressure. His options are abundant. And he has fewer harmful distractions. You put a guy in chaotic and impoverished circumstances. And then you decide not to expect anything out of him. How can anyone possibly believe this will lead to anything other than disaster? Of my five closest friends in high school, none went to college. Two went to prison. Subscribe Young men will only do what’s expected of them.

This concentration of wealth in the hands of a cohort that is less diverse, and has less diverse interests, than the general public concentrates investment and bids up the prices of common necessities while leaving nascent demand for other goods and services to languish, often unborn. This diverse set of would-be goods and services are the ones that would have employed many of the \"shiftless\" young men described (myself included). Instead, there are no ventures available with which to employ our skills, or the things we could have become skillful in; we're forced to compete with elite practitioners in the fields rich old people care to invest in or purchase from. As TFA details, this is actually to the advantage of the aforementioned cohort - whatever particular shape a family takes (and it can be successful with queer parents, or one parent, or grandparents), its instability is useful when fighting advocacy for labor, community investment, and such. The energy expended in keeping things together at home can't be redirected against elite interests. That's why they take exception, not because one-dad-one-mom-one-boy-one-girl is the only way to successfully do-the-family. reply jjk166 2 hours agoprevThis whole article is talking about absentee fathers, but every example is listing why the mother left or kicked out the father. Nowhere in the article is mentioned the obvious common denominator - women are no longer utterly dependent on their husbands. People didn't stay together more often in the 50s because the couples were better, or because people were held to higher standards, it was because getting out of a terrible marriage was incredibly difficult if not impossible, and even if successful would cause immense hardship. The article also simply takes for granted that it's a bad thing that these nuclear families do not stay together. While it's true that just directly comparing the children of single mothers to those raised by two parents the former tend to be worse off by a number of metrics, this disadvantage disappears once you normalize for the socioeconomic conditions of the mother, and indeed they are actually slightly better off. People aren't irrationally making their lives harder, they take actions they feel will be beneficial, and it's unsurprising that they have a good idea of what would be personally beneficial. While the exact mechanism is up for debate, the leading theory is that in underprivileged communities where people tend to have children at a young age a heavy reliance on multi-generation family is more beneficial than the nuclear structure (or in other words, when you have a kid at 18, your 40 year old mother can probably provide a lot more resources and experience than a 19 year old guy). You can't simply say that men aren't stepping up; the world has changed, mostly for the better, and as a consequence family structures are going to look different now from what they once did. reply blackbear_ 2 hours agoparent> this disadvantage disappears once you normalize for the socioeconomic conditions of the mother Link? reply jjk166 2 hours agorootparenthttps://theconversation.com/having-a-single-parent-doesnt-de... reply RandomThoughts3 1 hour agoparentprev> This whole article is talking about absentee fathers, but every example is listing why the mother left or kicked out the father.

No, the article goes much further that that. It points out that upper-class and middle-class people like to pretend and promote that the nuclear family doesn't matter while themselves acting like it does. The main thesis of the article is that modern culture is actually undermining the poor while being mostly posturing. > You can't simply say that men aren't stepping up It's a good thing that it's not what the article is saying then. reply lazyeye 36 minutes agoparentprevIm guessing you're one of these people described in the article that had a stable, family upbringing? reply tech_ken 2 hours agoprevMan I hate when people use the phrase “broken home” unironically.

Society ain't changing on any meaningful timeline (based on all available evidence), \"the purpose of the system is what it does,\" so attack the root cause in earnest. It is a choice to not actively solve for the suffering, so find an inexpensive point of leverage to attempt to solve for it. Folks seeking this healthcare are being marginalized by the system at great cost realized as externalities, and therefore require empowerment (with strong positive second order effects). Like vaccinations, prevention is far cheaper than the alternatives. Tangentially, it's kind of wild to think that the global population boom, billions of people, over the last ~100 years was because of women not being empowered [1], broadly speaking. Because as soon as women are empowered [2], educated, and have robust access to contraceptives, boom, fertility rate plummets off a cliff. Turns out, society (economic pyramid schemes leading to pearl clutching about rapidly declining populations) and men [3] [4] want more children than women do. Ergo, we must empower the human, because all available evidence demonstrates the system is built and operated to subjugate rather than empower (from a first principles systems analysis).

There are a multitude of laws surrounding divorce and child support, which originated in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, that encourage single motherhood and make it extremely difficult for working fathers to raise children.

All of these major central corporations are completely dependent on illegal labor, and if they hadn't been able to pay lower wages, their takeovers couldn't have occurred at the speed or scale they did. My relation talked about this issue in the DoA and many senior officials pushed back and said that since addressing this issue of illegal labor in the beef industry would cause a rise in beef prices, threatening the availability of the migrant labor base is a no-go. (Biden admin, not that it matters--I'm sure the answer would have been the same under any admin through at least GWB). That's where we are now, in US agriculture, residential construction, etc..

The supporting citation does not actually support it, though it hints at how institutional housing ownership has contributed to housing price inflation. To wit: it explains how innovations during the GFC turned direct investment into an appealing proposition for investors. These investors helped to backstop housing values that would have fallen even further than they already had. In other words, the much-needed correction to the pre-GFC bubble that the GFC represented was disrupted and reversed. The actual solution to housing price inflation is a full correction that wipes out the inflated value of housing in this country, cutting each property's worth back down to its intrinsic value. Affordability and use would reset to what the real market actually can sustain, as when the income tax forced wealthy property owners to divest of and demolish or convert their grand mansions into apartments for people to actually live in. There is no housing shortage (Zillow has an obvious conflict-of-interest). There is no need to load even more money into the system by providing cheap money to builders (a naked corporate giveaway that will surely represent yet another wealth transfer from taxpayers to business-owners). Pop the bubble. Planning considerations can follow, once land and property values actually reflect their intrinsic worth.

Buying an existing home, so long as it's rented out is yes technically providing housing supply, but it is unhelpful rent seeking. That big investors would rather buy up existing homes rather than invest in building new ones is a pretty clear sign that the housing system is dysfunctional and requires work on the taxation/regulation side that would encourage more productive use of investor dollars. reply notaustinpowers 4 hours agorootparentprevHomeownership is one of the main ways that Americans transfer wealth, as it's usually the only asset that adults nowadays have that can be transferred outside of whatever's in their bank accounts. When homeownership becomes restricted due to PE firms and Investment firms buying up entire communities to turn into rentals, the wealth transfer is hampered. Well-off adults are still having to rent and are now directly competing with younger Americans who are still growing in their careers and pay scale. This puts older Americans in a tough spot of not being able to generate wealth or equity that can be transferred to their children. And this puts their children and younger Americans in a spot where they cannot afford to live where they work, and cannot afford to save enough to begin the journey to homeownership.

The sociopathic villager who went to the village's communal trees, and took way more apples than they can ever eat, while others don't have enough apples to eat, should be tossed into the lake. But the sociopathic villager tells stories in the village square, of how those villagers who are starving are lazy, and trying to eat apples without working to gather them. A village elder starts to say they saw the sociopath going and taking the apples under the cover of darkness, and that's why some people are starving. But the sociopath quietly welcomes the elder into the fold of those who have cellars full of more apples than they can eat. Then apple hoarding is suddenly the noble way of the ancestors, according to the elder. And, hey, look over there, at those lazy people over there trying to eat apples while working only a half day! Hate those greedy freeloaders, over there! The housing crisis is one example, but I'm not talking about which parties have literally 100 houses in real society (nor want to get diverted with \"just let developers make more money, by building more, and stop looking at any other factors of the problem\"). I'm talking about essentials, greed, and corruption more generally. reply philwelch 2 hours agorootparentI have a better analogy. It’s the analogy of a guy who got up every morning to plant apple trees in his orchard. When the time came for harvest, he picked all of the apples and sold them to market. With his proceeds, he bought some more land from his neighbor and planted even more apple trees. The next year there were too many apples for him to pick by himself so he hired a few people to help out, and used the proceeds to expand his orchard. There was another man in the village who never planted a tree or picked an apple. Instead he sat in his house filled with envy and resentment at the apple farmer, and made up a bunch of ridiculous stories about how the apple farmer was stealing from everyone else. And so he found all of the other villagers he could sway, and inspired envy in their hearts. And the envy and resentment and hatred grew and grew until one night, they went to the orchard and burned down all the apple trees and the man’s house while he and his family slept inside. And then they all celebrated their crime. Of course, when no one else in the village ever planted an apple orchard ever again, there were murmurs of complaint. The town baker couldn’t bake his famous apple pies the next fall, but he knew better to complain because he didn’t want the envious mob showing up at his bakery in the middle of the night. So he kept quiet. The housing crisis is one example, but I’m not talking about which parties have obstructed the creation of wealth in real society. I’m talking about essentials, envy and corruption more generally. reply neilv 1 hour agorootparentAs you adapt my quote, for contrast, you substitute \"envy\" for \"greed\", which seems meaningful. So is the gist of your analogy that, in reality, the problem of what might appear to be greed, is actually strictly envy, by the people who don't merit the wealth? And when you made the envious people outright psychotically homicidal, was that for a bit of levity? Or do you feel that strongly that irrational envy underlies real world complaints that people might have about inequity? reply philwelch 2 hours agorootparentprevHow do you imagine villages actually worked?

There’s enough room on the planet - you can give everyone on earth a big house with a yard and we’ll all fit into a single Canadian province, or into Texas. We can generate 100% of our power needs with solar, nuclear, and batteries. And as we get richer, there are more and more people with the time and ability to make greener choices.

Scott, author of Seeing Like a State, has died (poast.org)197 points by FreakLegion 20 hours agohidepastfavorite39 comments sameoldtune 18 hours agoThe concepts in Seeing Like A State are very relevant to programmers and to anyone trying to “change the world” with technology. One of the main points is that for a state to manage many people it tends to use power (hard and soft) to homogenize the populace. My belief is that tech necessarily does the same thing. Everyone in your app has permissions defined by some enum, a limited number of actions available, content moderation machinery. This has effects that are inescapable, especially in the fields of medicine, mental health, education, social engagement. Tech makes our levers to move the Earth more efficient, but at the cost of a lack of diversity of thought, lifestyle, and value. reply strken 16 hours agoparentDepends which tech.

The only systems without the “rails” to keep the user on-track and out of danger zones are those that provide the user with the ability to program it themselves. Must it be this way? Can we provide the complexity of flexibility while protecting our users’ finances and other important information? I don’t know if we can, but our track record isn’t good. reply sameoldtune 17 hours agorootparentIn the context of my comment you’re thinking very small. Yes, providing more options for users can make an application less secure. But that force to make it secure is the very force I’m describing which locks down people’s options, their ability to self-express, and their options to create personal and societal value out of their actions. Every choice a programmer makes about how to model the world is a choice that is forced upon every user of their application. Many programmers lean left politically, but the same type of “fascistic” qualities they complain about in political leaders seems to go unquestioned when making a program, which dispassionately divides the world into rigid categories. reply FreakLegion 17 hours agorootparentTechnological homogeneity also creates single points of failure, as we saw this week with CrowdStrike. Heterogeneity, on the other hand, can (not will, but can) improve security outcomes. I remember making a comment years ago about opening PDFs in PDF.js instead of Acrobat (12 years, it turns out [1] -- PDF.js had just started shipping in Firefox). At the time, Acrobat was the standard and widely exploited, but obviously none of those exploits did anything in the browser. Still, homogeneity isn't always bad.

Yes. You see how it applies. The initial attack was uncalled for. reply polynox 16 hours agorootparentprevIt is not the \"dispassionate dividing of the world into rigid categories\" necessary in order to implement software that is morally or ethically problematic, it is the imposition of those rigid categories upon society at large, perhaps by itself or perhaps merely just the conflation of the separation between the categories that gets incorporated into the design as a subconscious or even conscious choice to reify the categorical differences that is the problem. It is not the knowledge itself that is the problem, it is how that knowledge gets incorporated into an overly simplistic and heavy-handed approach to act. Indeed that is the very thesis of the Seeing like a State book. To take the first example of scientific forestry that replaced the local control over the land in which the categories were the species of plants as an example, it was not the factual knowledge about the species of plants, which is an observation about the true nature of reality, it was the decision to use that fact about the distinction between the plants and decide to separate the plants geographically to uniform monoculture plots rather than allowing them to be mixed together (and, in the process, in fact destroying things that they did not understand, the ecosystem) that is argued to have been the cause of the scientific forestry failure. The plots were just fine before and after the knowledge about what plants were where and what the different types of plants there were became known; it was the act of separating the plants into the monoculture plots. The knowledge was a necessary prerequisite to do so, but it was not sufficient, and I don't know if I could believe that accurate knowledge of actual pre-existing categories that correspond to the actual universe could by itself be wrong. Certain plants really are different than other plants, species actually exist. What you decide to do with that information is up to you, but I don't know if I could support the suppression of the acquisition of knowledge merely because it might (but also might not) be used in ways we disagree. If they had merely studied the plants, that would not have been wrong. If they had created a map of where the plants were, that also would not have been wrong in my view. It was when they decided to change reality that the moral implications attach, in my view. They could have mapped out the plants and divided the map into categories: \"there are oak trees here and not here\", or \"there are strawberry bushes here, and not here\", and that is \"dividing the world into categories\" (namely: presence or absence of certain plants in certain locations), but that is merely the true expression of factual reality. It was how they decided as a separate step, \"let's make all the strawberry bushes be in the same location\" which incorporated many smaller actions like \"let's move this strawberry bush from here to here\" or \"let's remove all the plants we have not specifically identified, as we (falsely) believe that they are not essential\" in which reality was actually changed, and thus the moral or ethical implication attaches in my view. Those who act have a duty to act responsibly, to do no harm, and so on, and the duty scales with the scope of the action, and perhaps there is a scope of action which by itself is too large, the standard or duty of care too impossible to satisfy due to the sheer complexity, for any one person or collection of people to rightfully possess what would be obligatory in my view to have the permission to act. I would also not view the mere publication of software as action per se either. In your example, it is the utilization of the marketing channels to push the software onto users with or without their knowledge, to exercise editorial control over what software may or may not be used on one's supposedly own device, and so on that the duty applies. If someone publishes a program that divides the world into categories, but no one uses the program, it doesn't matter how wrong the program is. The program can have a field for skin color that is literally black and white for the purpose of calibrating an algorithm that divides pixels into skin-or-not-skin, for example to cut out the background, and yet if no one actually uses, much less is forced to use the program then the mechanism of distinguishing between skin-and-not-skin being incorrect and not for example a scalar or some other model does not harm anyone. It's just an overly simplistic program, a piece of text, an incomplete idea, a reflection of a categorical distinction that does not exist in reality but only in the mind of the programmer and in the software, but if no one ever uses the software let alone is forced to use it, who possibly can be harmed by it? reply sho 14 hours agorootparentThe \"scientific management\" was just one example out of many, and I disagree its lessons form the thesis of the book. The thesis as I understood it was that states seek legibility of domains under their jurisdiction, and the example of the forests was demonstrating the bad outcomes arising from seeking that legibility through misguided means. While unfortunate, that was an implementation error that could - and indeed was - corrected. I'd say a much better illustrative example from the book was the introduction of last names. In that case, faced with the illegible identity of the people under its rule, a whole new construct was invented, imposed and pertains to this day. This one really opened my eyes. The whole reason we have last names at all is because our society just sort of invented them, hundreds of years ago, for its own convenience, and it was so successful we all just accept it as the way things are. Now that is seeing - and acting - like a state! reply MichaelZuo 11 hours agorootparentThe real truth is that all 8 billion+ people plus all the world's organizations, governments, and so on, are constantly interpenetrating and co-modifying each other, every second of the day.

The state wants a homogeneous population because it make it easier to obtain desired election outcomes and desired amount of power if people can be manipulated as large groups towards a limited subset of parties/options. The politician who promises \"I will lower tax for the middle class by 1%\" won't stand a chance if their opponent promises \"I will completely abolish all taxes for the middle class.\" Corporations want a homogeneous population because it makes it easier to meet consumer needs if consumers all want the same things. Also, in terms of marketing, it's easier/more effective to target people based on their social groups; then let people expend the effort required to bring themselves into alignment with the group identity... As opposed to trying to target campaigns based on complex individual needs... When trying to create campaigns which cater to many unique individuals, there may be no clear, repeatable patterns that can drive predictable consumer behaviors. If the consumer can be tricked into adapting their own personal preferences to more closely match their group's preference... and if that group happens to be a large group, it creates predictable consumer behavior, at scale, at no cost. E.g. Identity = \"I'm a creative individual\" -> Sales pitch = \"Here, buy this Apple computer\" Identity = \"I'm a moral person\" -> Sales pitch = \"Here, buy this book about DEI and corporate responsibility\" Identity = \"I'm a libertarian\" -> Sales pitch = \"Here, buy some Bitcoin\" Identity = \"I'm a highly educated and caring person\" -> Sales pitch = \"Here, buy this vaccine to protect your loved ones\" reply crabmusket 9 hours agorootparentAs Ellul put it in Propaganda, > Mass production requires mass consumption, but there cannot be mass consumption without widespread identical views as to what the necessities of life are.

It really changed my mental model of the dynamics of early states and \"barbarians\", and how agriculture interplayed with the story of how it all unfolded.

In order to document the state, it is necessary to at least partially exist inside the state. In order to critique the state, you depend on the state to provide the means of production of that critique. If not one state, then another. And so in like terms, your critique will be co-opted for somebody else's benefit. Thats the nature of states. Scott was not Ayn Rand.

    "originBody": "eza A modern replacement for ls. eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just one single binary. By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of ls. eza features not in exa (non-exhaustive): Fixes “The Grid Bug” introduced in exa 2021. Hyperlink support. Mount point details. Selinux context output. Git repo status output. Human readable relative dates. Several security fixes. Support for bright terminal colours. Many smaller bug fixes/changes! ...and like, so much more that it became exhausting to update this all the time. Like seriously, we have a lot of good stuff. Try it! Nix ❄ If you already have Nix setup with flake support, you can try out eza with the nix run command: nix run github:eza-community/eza Nix will build eza and run it. If you want to pass arguments this way, use e.g. nix run github:eza-community/eza -- -ol. Installation eza is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Platform and distribution specific installation instructions can be found in INSTALL.md. Command-line options eza’s options are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike ls’s. Quick overview: Display options Click to expand Filtering options Click to expand Long view options Click to expand See the man pages for further documentation of usage. They are available online in the repo in your terminal via man eza, as of version [0.18.13] - 2024-04-25 Hacking on eza If you wanna contribute to eza, firstly, you're expected to follow our code of conduct. After having understood the code of conduct, you can have a look at our CONTRIBUTING.md for more info about actual hacking.",

I want the dates and times. That goes for forums like HN. Show me the date/time and also \"7 hours ago\" or whatever if you have to. I've never understood taking that information away.

Exa was unmaintained for about a year before it was marked officially deprecated by the only person with write permissions on the repository.

I see you are not the only one to comment on this, so I think it's time to update the phrasing. reply elashri 2 hours agoparentprevNo the maintained here means it is a maintained (replacment) with reference that it is a fork of exa which was a ls replacment that is not maintained anymore.

Only one of those two properties need to hold for the entire label to fit. reply elashri 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree with you that their usage of language is ambiguous and should be clear. I was just explaining the situation not defending the description. reply ehutch79 2 hours agorootparentprevSide note: the English language is a dumpster fire, and it’s easy for these issues to happen. reply kazinator 1 hour agorootparentI strongly suspect the title could be translated into numerous languages verbatim, without losing the unintended interpretation. It is so for a few languages I know. You can try it with translation tools. The problem is semantic: in any language whatsoever (I suspect) if we express the idea that X is a replacement for Y, and in the same sentence mention some attributes of X, it means that those attributes are relevant to qualifying X as a replacement, which implies that those attributes are lacking or inadequately present in Y. Without heaps of prior context, it is an impossible interpretation that the X attributes are not actually lacking in Y, but in a previously attempted replacement Z. reply crazygringo 53 minutes agorootparentprevAbsolutely nothing in the confusion here is specific to English. I don't know why you would try to take this opportunity to criticize English when this misunderstanding could be present in literally every other language. Because there is nothing whatsoever here that is a case of linguistic confusion or vagueness -- it is a conceptual issue of comparing two items, applying an adjective to one, and leaving the reader to wonder what that implies about the other item. And no, English is not a \"dumpster fire\". Every language has its pros and cons. But there is no language on Earth that is a \"dumpster fire\". There is absolutely nothing productive or good that can come out of blanket, utterly unfounded statements like that. reply phlip9 24 minutes agoprevCan definitely recommend eza (prev. exa).

If never had to interact with the hidden config it would be one thing, but I very often do and I don't want extra friction in getting to them. reply creshal 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're completely missing the point. ~/.programname is an unorganized mess, where someone stuff their dirty laundry, their trash, their food and their passport into the same closet. It doesn't matter if the closet is open or not, nobody but the mentally ill hoarder who created the mess can navigate it. ~/.(local|share|cache) means people put their food in the fridge, their trash into the bin and their sensitive documents in a fire proof safe. Which means other people can take care of basic tasks like taking out the trash and creating backups of their sensitive documents. reply Too 20 minutes agorootparent~/.(local|share|whatever) means I have to search both the basement, the attic and the garage. For stuff i rarely need to touch so I forget every time where it was placed. If it was only one place it would be great. If it was truly separated by config vs cache it would be great. The reality know though is that you have at least three locations where important config are stored, not counting those from package managers that have their own idea of this concept. Still, this mess is preferable to the even worse mess of hundred plumbing files spread on the living room floor. reply bbarnett 29 minutes agorootparentprevBut that's disorganized! I have a real filing cabinet. In it, I have folders. I don't keep my backup car dongle in one folder, my car invoice in another, my warranty and info from dealer all in different folders.

It is much more disorganized to have a folder for manuals and put them all there. I have to find the one I want out of 50 such manuals. And if it is a warranty thing, then I need the invoice, and other papers. Why would I want to keep associated things in different folders?! You think it's a mess, but really it's not. It's organized for humans to find related things. Before, I'd uninstall a program and delete its single dotdir. Done. Now I have to hunt in a maze of madness to \"get it all\". You cite some programs that didn't properly keep their data in a single dotdir, and use that as a reason why a single dotdir was bad?! reply chippiewill 2 hours agorootparentprevThe one thing I despise about local|share|config is I never know which one they're using or what kind of nested hierarchy they're using that means I might have to search for the company name first.

I don't see how it could work with one shortcut. Another thing is `ls -l` that's important when I need to understand file sizes and especially how symlinks are set up. Yet another is `ls -ld` which explains details about directories. All these cases could be made more ergonomic, and maybe partly merged. But I don't see how I could compress them into one type of output that fits all purposes. (My current fancy version of `ls` is `lsd`, but I still use the built-in `ls` a lot.) reply whartung 2 hours agorootparentTo this end I made a simple script, `latest`, which is, essentially, `ls -lt $@head`. So, `latest *.log`, etc. Other than that, simple autocomplete does a lot of my ls work for me. reply jmholla 2 hours agorootparentI know you're showing a rough example, but others might want to throw a `-d` in there so that folders don't get expanded. And put `$@` in quotations so spaced file names don't get interpreted as separate arguments. i.e.: ls -ltd \"$@\"head edit: `-d` may be a bad choice.

I use a terminal background which is easy on my eyes, and those color schemes always include colors which clash with the background or makes them hard to see in other ways. In short - I don't want colors in my 'ls' or 'ls' equivalent output. I'm fine with what ls with '-AFC' gives me. reply eddyg 8 hours agoparentIf tooling would simply use the Base16 Framework[0] instead of arbitrary colors from “256 color” or “RGB” color modes, this would be much less of a problem: the output would always be displayed with (presumably) readable colors defined by your terminal. [0] https://github.com/chriskempson/base16 [1] https://tinted-theming.github.io/base16-gallery/ reply MatthiasPortzel 3 hours agorootparent> the output would always be displayed with (presumably) readable colors There are several obstacles that make this not the case in practice, unfortunately. Black on white and white on black (whatever hex colors those actually are) will look fine. But different applications will use the accent colors differently. For example, some might use black text on a colored background, and others may use colored text on a black background. Some tools even use “bright” colored text on a different colored background. This is masked in most cases by iTerm2’s “Minimum contrast” setting, but when I tried to design a color palette with good contrast with that setting off, I found it to be very difficult. reply brabel 7 hours agorootparentprevAs a CLI tool author, I don't understand how I can use base16 to \"theme\" my tool's output. Can you point to some resources? reply z2h-a6n 5 hours agorootparentI'm not sure if eddyg had a different idea, but I think the following sums it up: - base16 is a specification of how different UI elements map to colors [1], and also some tooling, configuration files, etc. to automate setting this up for many different applications. - For a user to be able to use base16 with a tool, either: - Allow the user to set their preferred colors for UI elements at a semantic level, preferrably in a config file, and even more preferrably in a separate file that can be included into the main config file so that it's easier to automate (i.e. I have a separate `colors.sh` that is loaded in my `.zshrc`). - Let the user set their shell colors however they want (presumably using [2]), and use the ANSI shell colors (and a few more) according to the base16 style guide [1]. Some translation between shell colors and base16 colors will be necessary, e.g. base16 says that a language keyword should use the color base0E, which in [2] corresponds to ANSI shell color 13. My impression is that the base16 specification is not sufficiently general for most tools to implement it in a totally unbambiguous way, but if users can set their own colorschemes with a config file, it's not hard for a user to come up with a base16-approximating colorscheme template file, from which other users can generate a config file that sets a specific base16 colorscheme.

Konsole has it built in and i bet Gnome Terminal too. reply kibwen 7 hours agorootparentPet peeve, Solarized makes no sense as a terminal color scheme, because it maps brgreen, brblue, bryellow, and brcyan to barely-distinguishable shades of gray. It just doesn't have enough colors in its palette to cover the range of colors that the authors of CLI tools expect your terminal to be able to display. Also, Solarized's whole trick is that its colors are perceptually uniform in terms of lightness, and I think the results speak for themselves why we don't do this in practice. If you want a yellow that actually looks yellow and not a shade of puke brown, it needs to be brighter than the other colors (especially red, which needs to be darker than the other colors if you don't want it to look pink). reply sshine 7 hours agorootparentI’ve used solarised-light in my terminal for a few years. I really enjoy the colours, but you’re absolutely right, it is not actually terminal friendly. Many programs just write invisible text. reply fwip 1 hour agorootparentIt also makes the baffling decision to make \"bright black\" darker than \"black.\" Pretty much every other terminal colorscheme renders brightblack as a dark gray.

Btw, ls beats them both easily (in my single-directory test). So features would be my main criteria, I guess. At least eza doesn't have that annoying bug I linked :). Short comparison: - Eza doesn't have the lsd's piping bug - Eza has more different output from ls than I would like (by default) - Both have git support - Eza --hyperlink doesn't have \"auto\" mode so if I alias ls to it, lssed hacks will likely behave unexpectedly if I enable it: https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/703 and this also seems like an instance of it: https://github.com/eza-community/eza/issues/693 - Eza is slower to write than lsd :) - Eza has more options to change its behaviour than lsd Overall I think the hyperlink issue is more severe than lsd's piping one, so I think I'll just keep using lsd for the time being. reply srid 3 hours agoparentprevI've used both, but settled on using `lsd`.

This is thousands of lines of rust with emphasis on community building and ongoing development. There seems to be a disconnect between engineering effort and product here which doesn't totally make sense to me. I think I'll stay with ls. reply creshal 5 hours agoparenteza's scope is much larger than ls's, and has tons of additional features. And IMO, that's sensible: ls is primarily an interactive tool (basically all uses of it in shell scripts are wrong), so adding more features that help users to better/more easily make sense of their directory listings is a net benefit, even if it makes the tool somewhat slower. Folder icons in the terminal may sound silly, but eza uses them to indicate empty folders, among others. Colour-coded file age/size columns make parsing a directory list faster. Git columns saved my many trips through gitignore / git status. And so on. And even through not particularly fast fuse-over-network connections it's still faster than I can type, which is more than good enough for an interactive CLI tool. reply hibbelig 6 hours agoparentprevChallenge: which of the letters a to z and A to Z are NOT switches that modify the behavior of ls?

It's almost all of them. The startup world is just a massive pump and dump scheme, and so it moves from field to field finding the next hotness. Self-driving cars, VR, EVs, AI, and so on. People soon realize that you can't just take a bunch of hipster tech employees and suddenly create non-solutions that need to have problems created for them to even be solutions, much less choosing extremely hard and ill-defined non-solutions. I truly wonder how much of the U.S. economy has slowed down because of all this wasted effort. Is it really a good idea for every company to try and reinvent what a company is? Every startup I've been spends a non-zero amount on just re-figuring out how to be organized, how to manage people and projects, and even just figuring out the logistics and tech needed to run a company. It's a lot of wasted effort, time, and money. My time at startups has been the least effective portions of my career. Real work actually moves quite slowly at startups, in my experience. reply JumpCrisscross 58 minutes agoparent> startup world is just a massive pump and dump scheme, and so it moves from field to field finding the next hotness But we retain the solutions that work.

From my perspective, the once-startups that are now big companies are the ones who focused ONLY on solving a real and immediate problem with happy, motivated employees. Every industry has inefficiencies to improve upon. Most employees want normal hours, a 401K, some benefits, and clear performance reviews. There's still a ton of work to do at cool-but-not-the-absolute-cutting-edge startups. reply gumby 6 minutes agoparentprev> It's not just AI startups. It's almost all of them. The reality is that a very tiny percentage of new companies get institutional financing at all (and the majority of those that do aren't technical and aren't startups in the sense that they aren't intended to be high growth at a high margin). The loud press that makes it sound otherwise is just survivorship bias. reply ertgbnm 37 minutes agoparentprevPrivate equity has mastered this formula in the last decade. Throw as many unrelated businesses that you can buy for pennies on the dollar into a basket. Claim it is now diversified. Decrease expenses by allowing all of your good employees to run for the hills screaming while not replacing them. Post one year of record profits by sacrificing quality in the name of quantity. Re-capitalize in order to generate a massive return. And then rinse and repeat on your next victims, I mean ventures. reply BobbyJo 30 minutes agoparentprevThis is simply not true. Most startup founders are genuinely trying to build something that has value to the economy, and therefore society. Most fail early, most of what's left fails later, but some go on to be real, profitable, businesses. That's how it works outside of the startup world too. Most restaurants, clothing stores, car repair shops, etc. go out of business after just a few years, while a few move on to become large chains and the like. reply iancmceachern 10 minutes agorootparentYour last paragraph paints a dual vision of the world that just isn't accurate.

More of this please reply godelski 6 minutes agoparentprev> I truly wonder how much of the U.S. economy has slowed down because of all this wasted effort. I wonder how frequently startups and hype KILL technologies. A technology starts to show progress, everyone gets excited about that progress, tons of money gets dumped in, everyone rushes to put that technology into production, technology flops, funding for technology dries up. Meanwhile, a lot of people got very rich, so we repeat the cycle. But there was an important step missed here if we want a technology to actually succeed. Research. The hype train only seems to gear up for technologies that are still in their infancies. This of course makes sense, because how else do you raise money? Chicken and the egg. But the problem here is that you're not using that money to solve the problems with the tech and get it to the point where it could then be effectively used in things, but instead rush to hamfist it into everything you can. Sometimes you gotta slow down first, and prep for the sprint. Google seems to be the worst at this, routinely killing projects that 5-10 years later are then sold as high status items. A company with that much capital doesn't need to rush to market, you can strategize and take your time. The problem is that the details always matter and they can be a huge make it or break it for a technology. You can generate all the safe miles you want, but if you run through a red light anytime there's a child holding a green balloon a bit too high, you failed. You can build fancy games, but if you promise a holodeck and deliver a hollowdeck, people are reasonably upset. Hype is a double edged sword. You need some to get people on board, but too much and you overpromise. You can build crazy and legitimately helpful tools, but if you're (or others) are promising 10x what you can, then when they get their hands on it they have every right to be upset. Even if the thing is still useful to them and betters their lives. They are rightfully upset, but they'll unrightfully dismiss what you made. So the people who benefit from the hype cycles are the grifters. The ones willing to jump from one thing to the next. Which is why I'm always very confused why we prop up people who have \"expertise\" in all the last hype bubbles as if it is credentializing why they are experts in the new hype bubble.

[0] https://spencerburleigh.com/blog/2022/12/21/shutdown/ reply retrocryptid 1 hour agoprevOne thing I noticed from the Sili Valley startups I've been involved with in the last 20 years: exec management's parents went to school w/ the funds managers. I have this theory that there's institutional money burning a hole in various institution's collective pockets. Those funds' managers are under pressure to invest a percentage in risky, high reward opportunities. So they have money that has to be invested. You would look pretty stupid if you missed out on investing in the next Facebook or Google. So you get some valley VC firms managed by guys who went to MIT, UCB or Stanford in the 80s and made their cash founding 90s era startups. Now these guys' college room-mates have kids in MIT, UCB and Stanford who are about to graduate. So they (the VC's old room mates) channel some dosh into the VC's funds. In return, the VC's fund startups started by their room-mate's kids. For the parent, it's great. They avoid estate taxes and if there's a profit, they only pay capital gains rates. The kids receive their pay in perfectly laundered equity which at the next liquidity event can be reified outside the IRS' jurisdiction, so they wind up paying 12% corporate tax in Panama instead of the on-shored 26% cap gains rate. All that's really required is a greater fool to take the series A shares off your hands when you do a series B. My take on SiliValley is it's turned into a tax avoidant generational wealth transfer system for the financier class. Nice work if you can get it. Academia supports the system with hype-filled pronouncements about how future tech (AI, RISC-V, Battery Tech, WISC, etc.) will completely revolutionize the world. Analysts who should have been taught skepticism when corporate leaders imply their startup will have a market value in excess of western Europe's GDP, jump on board to avoid looking like idiots on the off chance the firms they cover do take off. Tech investing isn't a scam, there are definitely corners that are producing solid tech. But they're few and far between and very often not involved in the VC economy. reply bjt 1 hour agoparent> I have this theory that there's institutional money burning a hole in various institution's collective pockets. That was very much the case before the Fed started raising interest rates. The term \"zero interest rate phenomenon\" was created to describe it.

Somewhere at a fast food place, I got asked if I was eating in or taking out. I asked what the difference was—it seemed incongruous to ask on such an item when that’s the entirety of the order. My curiosity was rewarded: apparently there was an extra tax in that city on one or the other; so I did whichever was cheaper (and honestly, either drinking it inside, or sitting on my trike). I even came across taxes that were only present in half a city, even—one side of a road but not the other, that kind of thing. reply fencepost 39 minutes agorootparentThat's probably not uncommon since municipality borders don't follow county borders. reply turnsout 1 hour agorootparentprevIt can even vary within the city—in Chicago there's an extra tax on the F&B industry to support Navy Pier, with very specific boundaries. reply nanidin 55 minutes agorootparentprevIt can even vary within a city, and within a zip code - see TID's, NID's, and CID's. reply TechDebtDevin 3 hours agorootparentprevI miss the good ole days when Boomer politicians didn't realize you could buy things on the internet (or that it even existed) and everything was without sales tax. reply FabHK 1 hour agorootparentSo, let's look at what actually happened. Boomer Bill Clinton signed the Internet Tax Freedom Act into law in 1998, prohibiting taxation of internet sales to support the growth of commerce on the internet (which itself was invented by Boomers and even older generations).

It's neat that the new license is using “plain English” language, but were there any specific problems with BSL that prompted this change? reply hnbad 8 hours agorootparentThe short answer is that FSL was designed as an evolution of BSL that doesn't allow for as much variance in what the license means in practice, i.e. it got rid of the \"additional grants\" and mandates a shorter, fixed expiration date. As I understand it, nothing FSL does couldn't be expressed in a modified BSL but having it as its own license makes it less ambiguous by not allowing for much variation beyond which specific license it converts to upon expiration. reply ezekg 4 hours agorootparentTo add: the problem with the BUSL was that every variation of the BUSL was effectively its own license. The FSL reins that in so that a company's legal department could approve FSL full-scale, allowing all FSL projects to be used. The same full-scale approval could never happen for the BUSL due to the variances. reply inktype 4 hours agoparentprevThanks. My initial reaction upon reading the submitted title was dismissive because I dislike when companies mimic the prestige of open source by saying \"source available\" while having a practically proprietary license. This is the first time I've seen FSL and it is quite nice. Surely \"source available\" is the wrong term to label the license with. reply swyx 2 hours agorootparent> mimic the prestige of open source by saying \"source available\" no, its just the correct term, we literally ask people who use the wrong license to change their terminology to \"source available\", lets not punish people who do it right from the get go reply inktype 55 minutes agorootparentYou misunderstood my comment; we probably agree. If something isn't open source, it shouldn't be labeled as open source.

Got an answer to my question about updates there in the FAQ: > How exactly does the two years work? > The two year timeframe applies to each software version that is made available. Methods of making software available include pushing a Git commit, publishing a package to a repository, or mailing out a CD in a tin. For example, one could clone a repo, run git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before=\"2 years ago\" master`, and—if LICENSE.md is FSL—use that version under MIT or Apache 2.0. reply phkahler 6 hours agorootparentSo the key is to download the source for each version you use and record the date and the current license text. Also, use the oldest version you're comfortable with since it converts the soonest. I'm thinking for down the road when new releases are under a different (even commercial) license and the pull the source for old versions. Then cost starts to go up a lot. Not saying it will, but I hope the software is successful but that sometimes leads to bad things for customers. reply ezekg 3 hours agorootparentOr just use git: git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before='2 years ago' master` and if the license is FSL, you're g2g. reply yayoohooyahoo 8 hours agoprevI'm not sure I understand what this does compared to Stripe?

If you still need Stripe anyway you may as well use their features directly rather than go through an indirection layer? reply canadiantim 6 hours agorootparentIt’s actually better to use a buffer layer so your own payment logic is platform independent, eg if stripe bans you accidentally you can easily use another payment provider reply yayoohooyahoo 6 hours agorootparentI agree it would be great in this situation but currently it only supports Stripe, and they don't mention plans of supporting any other payment platform. reply datavirtue 4 hours agorootparentprevThat being said, this does not look to be targeted at small businesses and that problem is one that is only faced by small businesses.

I’ve made software for the childcare industry, where the data concerns are greater than most other industries. Nobody had any problem with AWS, or really any non-EU vendor, as long as they lived up to the GRPR agreements and could provide the usual agreements. Only in Germany would you run into requirements to either host in Germany (at worst) or at least within EU (at best). Additionally, there’s a lot of German specific laws on top, that simply aren’t in the other EU countries, and the general population is also much more concerned about data privacy and residency than any other EU country. It was a world of difference, and honestly enough for me that I would not enter the German market again if it meant needing to comply with any additional effort than the rest of the EU market. A bit more of a rant: The hosting solutions in Germany are also quite atrocious once you get to a certain scale. Lack of proper managed services, tons of instability, insane maintenance policies, poor security support (eg no 2FA for many). Once you’ve gotten used to how AWS/GCP/Azure handles things, it’s hard to go back to that world.

    "originBody": "And companies can't make them come into the office. Really. Credit: HP Dell had it all figured out. The venerable computer company wouldn’t force people back into the office. Instead, it would just insist that all staffers show up at the office for at least three days a week. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t be laid off — they just wouldn’t be promoted. (Unspoken was that this new policy would serve as a way of “thinning the herd.”) Given a choice between not getting promoted or continuing to work at home, half of the employees have elected to stay home, thank you very much. I’m sorry, Dell. This is 2024, not 2014. Now that people have gotten a taste of working from home, they’re not going back to the office. You’d think that would be clear by now — now just at Dell, but almost everywhere. Why? Let me count the reasons: No commute on crowded highways; A better life/work balance; Cost savings; Flexibility to choose where to live (and work). More control over your workplace. I’ve been working from home for decades, which makes me something of an exception compared to a lot of workers. But my experience holds for people who got their work-from-home start during the Covid-19 pandemic. I used to work out of a Manhattan office, but I lived in New Carrollton, Maryland. How did I do it? I took Amtrak to work on Monday and returned home on Friday. I’d joke that I walked to work — first to my local train station and then from Penn Station to the office. There were just a few hours in the middle when I’d work from the dining car. More often than not, though, I’d just work from home. When I decided to move to Asheville, NC, in 2001, my bosses agreed to let me move because, as I told them then, I could always catch a same-day flight if they really needed me in the office. But, as I told them, I doubted there would be any reason I’d need to be there. I was right. While I still fly to New York City occasionally for work, I never had to be there for the job. Better still. I had more time to be home — and I saved money to boot. It’s cheaper to make a sandwich in my kitchen than to get lunch at a deli near the office in midtown Manhattan. Finally, I love living in mountainous and green Asheville rather than the flat and asphalt-covered area inside the Washington, DC beltway. In short, I’m happy working at home and have been for more than two decades. Most people who work from home feel the same. Companies might want people’s rumps back in office chairs, but according to a recent Gartner report, 48% of employees say their company’s mandates prioritize what leaders want rather than what employees need to do good work. Yes, that’s right. At far too many companies, the desire for control trumps what people really need to do their best work. In particular, Caitlin Duffy, the Gartner HR practice director, said: “High-performing employees are more easily able to pursue opportunities at organizations that offer hybrid or fully remote policies.” If they don’t get those work-from-home opportunities, they’ll leave. That, in turn, “means losing high-performers to attrition, costs organizations in terms of productivity, [can cause] difficulty in backfilling the role, and the overall loss of high-quality talent available to fill critical positions,” Duffy said. Ding! Ding! Ding! Here’s another piece of evidence that people are not, in capital letters, returning to the office. According to the latest Moody’s commercial real estate analysis, office vacancy rates have never been higher. Just over one in five offices is now vacant. (The only reason that percentage isn’t higher is that companies have yet to be able to get out of long-term leases.) Might I note that once that lease has ended, companies won’t have to pay for that office space. It’s a win-win —unless your business is commercial real estate. Put it all together, and what do you get? You get the new work culture of the early-mid-21st century and beyond. It’s all work from home from here on out, folks. Deal with it. And enjoy it.

    "commentBody": "The workers have spoken: They're staying home (computerworld.com)158 points by CrankyBear 1 hour agohidepastfavorite144 comments bunderbunder 1 hour agoI think that companies might have more success getting people back to the office if they had not also spent the past decade or two systematically updating offices to be beautiful to look at in CAD renderings but awful to actually occupy and try to work in. This move toward not giving permanent desk assignments to people who are required to be in the office also makes it worse. Open plan offices are a bit of a productivity hit on a good day, but they're extra awful when every day it's a new set of voices to learn to tune out, and another half hour spent packing and unpacking all your shit, adjusting computer monitors to minimize glare from the overhead fluorescent lights, etc. And, if you want to actually take advantage of the co-location, 15-30 minutes spent figuring out where all your collaborators are sitting today, and scrambling for meeting rooms and huddle spaces, which are now in high demand since collaborators can no longer sit together in any sort of stable way and must instead fight for huddle space if they want to do any in-person collaboration. Alternatively you spend the entire day with headphones on (uncomfortable!) because you decide not to do that, and instead spend the whole day on team meetings because it's easier. And even headphones when you're not actively in meetings because everyone around you makes the same decision. A couple years ago, I was eager for a return to office. That died pretty quickly after return to office happened, because the reality is that we're not returning to anything. Office life post-COVID is an entirely new thing that's worse than what office life was like pre-COVID in almost every way. And so the mandatory in-office days are, in practice, just the days that fully remote team members need to cut the hybrid members some slack for not being able to get anything done. reply JohnFen 7 minutes agoparentWell said. During the span of my career, the office went from being a perfectly fine place to get work done; then degraded to a cube farm environment which was worse, but you you could work around it and get stuff done anyway; then to an open office environment which was hellish enough that it got me to quite my job and vow to never work in such an environment again. Commute is certainly an important aspect, too, but when I worked in the place that adopted an open office layout, I lived a literal 10 minute walk away. Having such a trivial (and pleasant) commute in no way made up for having to work in those conditions. reply ghaff 52 minutes agoparentprevSo much relates to commute. I'd probably meander in for a halfway decent office arrangement if it were less than a 30 minute walk and there were actually people I worked with there. But that hasn't been the case so I don't. reply agentultra 43 minutes agorootparentSame. I’m glad I work in a fully remote org. We actually have an office. It’s over an hour commute away from me. And I have school-aged children that I have to prepare and drop off in the mornings. None of my co-workers work there. So I basically never go. At my last job I did have an office that was within walking distance. My children were much younger. I had a dedicated desk and office. And I managed to make it in every day. Commutes are a big factor in the decision. For a lot of reasons. Climate, expense, convenience, etc. reply Leynos 21 minutes agorootparentprevSame. For me, the office is door to door 35 minutes, 20 of those walking, the other 15 on light railway. Any longer than that and I would really struggle. As it is, this arrangement works well for me. I tend to WFH one day out of ten, or if I have a reason to be at home such as a delivery or a tradesperson visiting. reply vidarh 33 minutes agorootparentprevI used to work for a company where we were in at least one day a week. In practice that mean arriving around 10.30 and leaving around 4 on wednesday, spending half of the time on meetings or whiteboard sessions, and the rest was pretty socialising for several of us. I didn't mind that - it was 30 minutes on the train and a short walk for me, and it broke up the week. Any more than that, and it'll take significantly more money to get me in. reply RcouF1uZ4gsC 3 minutes agorootparentprevBut commute can change. For example, if you lived in Mountain View in walking distance of Google, would you turn down an offer from Facebook because your home in Mountain View is no longer walking distance to Facebook HQ? Also, life situations. If your partner has a job at a school or hospital that requires physical presence whose commute do you prioritize? Making jobs that can be remote, remote gives workers massive flexibility in work arrangements with partners as well as being able to change jobs. reply wnc3141 32 minutes agorootparentprevI wonder what WFH arrangements in Copenhagen or Amsterdam look like. reply giobox 26 minutes agorootparentObviously I can't speak for everyone, but the few folks I know in Copenhagen do WFH as hybrid - none of them are fully remote, coming into an easily commutable office 2-3 days a week or some variation of this. reply ghaff 26 minutes agorootparentprevProbably somewhat depends if you actually live in the city. When I worked in or went into Boston for customer meetings, I actually lived quite convenient to public transit (commuter rail/subway/walk), but it was still 90-120 minutes each way. reply mistrial9 33 minutes agorootparentprevtraditional urban planning in the USA includes extensive field research that shows .. just what you are saying.. there is a demographic curve about time to commute and who is willing to do it, and how often.. behavior on a large scale across industries, show curves like that reply bunderbunder 8 minutes agorootparentI suspect that traditional urban planning in the USA also assumed that relatively few people would be trying to pack into city centers to work. Because modern office parks hadn't been invented yet, and modern curtain wall skyscrapers hadn't been invented yet, and consolidating many industries into a relatively small number of massive tech companies hadn't happened yet, and the two-income family (which doubles the potential number of commuters per dwelling unit) hadn't become such a thing yet, etc. There's a part of me that wonders if part of what's going on here is a cadre of genxers who are so wealthy as to necessarily be out-of-touch don't realize that typical millennials' and zoomers' socioeconomic reality is not, and cannot reasonably be forced to be, similar to that of boomers and the greatest generation. reply 6LLvveMx2koXfwn 53 minutes agoparentprev'And so the mandatory in-office days are, in practice, just the days that fully remote team members need to cut the hybrid members some slack for not being able to get anything done.' - can I have a Slack status message this long? reply toomuchtodo 18 minutes agorootparent\"Holding Court, Responses Delayed :upside down face emoji:\" reply whyenot 7 minutes agoparentprevOne of the very nice things about working in academia is that I now have a private office.

Having a low stress reverse commute on 280, one of the bay area's most scenic highways, probably also helps. reply rqtwteye 56 minutes agoparentprevThat’s the thing. If the office was actually a place where people could feel comfortable and collaborate, I would consider going there. But going to an open space noisy office talking on Teams to people all over the world doesn’t make much sense. reply elric 9 minutes agorootparentI once had to take a 4 hour trip to France to go on site to debug a customer's problem. As soon as I got there, my contact walked me into a meeting room, and promptly started a Teams meeting with a team in Paris.

My employer mandated a minimum number of days in-office per week and then implemented the flex desk system with all of the drawbacks that you outlined. In my company's case it's a little worse: There are, in fact, often no available open desks in my workgroup. Furthermore there's no enforcement or discipline with respect to day-of desk reservations. So this means that about half a dozen employees have permanently camped out at a \"flex\" desk, essentially claiming them for their own. Everyone I guess \"knows\" that those aren't real flex desks in practice, or at least nobody wants to stand out as the asshole who kicks Richard off his de-facto personal desk. For the desks that aren't permanently camped nobody bothers to use the online tool to actually reserve them. They just show up at some point during the day, and if there's no jacket on the chair or backpack under the desk or something, they just sit down at it and start using it. If you reserve the desk in the tool before coming into the office often you'll arrive to find someone sitting there who hasn't bothered to use the tool to reserve it. So then you don't have a desk at all and need to camp out in a common area on your laptop, surrounded by 3 or 4 other people blabbing away on Zoom calls. If you confront them to kick them off the desk they'll usually move, but that's a really uncomfortable thing to do and makes you look a little like a bully to everyone around. \"Dude, you snooze you lose. Dick got there first. Why don't you just go to the common area where all the other late-coming slackers have to go?\" It's a productivity hellscape that I do everything in my power to avoid. I've resorted to dropping by the office a few times a week just to badge in and grab a bite to eat from the microkitchen so that I show up in the query that management runs once a quarter to make sure everyone's badging in often enough. I also make it a point to walk prominently by several other desks and saying \"hi\" to people to give the illusion that I'm \"in the office\" on a semi-regular basis. The first time management tries to turn the screws to deal with my behavior I'm triggering my plan to move on to a role in another company that's fully remote. reply Justsignedup 16 minutes agorootparentMixed bag for me. My office is pretty decent but we have a bigger office than we currently need. My last job, at the office it was so loud (no dedicated conference rooms) that I was better off being at home, but unfortunately they also had zero respect for calendars, so getting in touch with people was... pretty much horrible no matter what way. In-office was less bad. I had offices with desks so small and shitty I just wished for working from home at a normal desk. I once had a boss that saw my desk and started complaining to HR that it was too big, and if we can split this desk into 2 to save on office space. TL;DR - works sucks.

A lot of tech worker primadonnas who have not seen the ugly politics of downsizing, right sizing, and outsourcing are going to have a tough time, as companies won't be bending over to hire folks anymore. The possibility of being unemployed not by choice, for a few weeks, until a phone call is made and a new job awaits, but as a reality for months. The attitude that \"I QUIT if I have to the office\", might encounter \"Good, we need to reduce headcount anyway\". The tech worker primadonnas vastly overestimats their own value to the company.

Some of them had to use their own computers to connect to their machine at work through a vpn, and had a lot of trouble getting that to work. Some had noisy roommates, some of them had problems \"turning off\" at the end of the day. Some of them had to call students back and didn't have a private place to have those conversations. There were some that enjoyed it, of course. Also, most everyone in the office loved using Teams to stay connected and it's still used for everything even after we've been back in office for years at this point.

The angry internet comment section solution is to fire everyone in group #2 (people who can't work from home), but that group was large enough that no amount of firing or intensive coaching was going to turn the ship around. The problem isn't as simple as you read about on internet comment sections. In my experience, it's good to have some remote employees but the WFH dynamic collapses when you try to let everyone do it.

Most of the push for back to the office is being pushed by extroverted people that miss being about to chat with people and not because of any results driven data. reply tegiddrone 8 minutes agorootparentAt least in my experience, while I am good at text/email communication: my co workers were not. I feel like being a full remote company crippled us in terms of engineering quality. We have more of a license to be left alone and that sucks when we actually do need to coordinate with our coworkers. Easier to just not coordinate and tune out the notifications. All said, maybe it is a larger issue and working from the office is just addressing symptoms that are more apparent when going remote. Are we really missing out on those water cooler talks or is there a missing information/management role. I think of how I've had the conversations with other teams around the occasional virtual water cooler \"oh, you're building a microservice to do that... so are we.... why are we building the same microservice?\" reply lifeisstillgood 26 minutes agorootparentprevDon’t think I am a hale and hearty sales lead. I crave quiet me time as much as the next. But the most productive times in a long and varied career have almost always involved a room with 3-5 other focused people. (That and being on my lonesome doing my own thing - which is great but less team work). As for focusing on results - no thanks. Unless those in the hierarchy get to be judged on those same openly published metrics - no way. reply ImPostingOnHN 15 minutes agoparentprev> My problem is that I quite like working with other people. It’s really hard to build relationships with other human beings when not in the same physical location- sharing jokes, lunches, walks and just shouting across the room about the weird code change I am a remote worker, and I quite like working with other people, too, which is why I do it. Walking and shouting don't really factor into it, but we do share plenty of jokes. That is why I totally understand and agree with all of what you said, except for the part where you're shouting in a room, especially one in which others are trying to work, or worse, speak in an online meeting from their desk with shouting in the background. That seems pretty disruptive and inappropriate when you could just walk over, or better yet, send a message. To me, that behavior is tantamount to asserting that what you have to say is more important than everything everyone else is doing. If there's a fire, maybe it is. To be sure, my coworkers and I are friends, but I have many more outside of work, and deeper friendships besides. Are you describing your conditions for amicably and effectively working with coworkers, or are you describing your conditions for making coworkers into your friends? Sometimes folks desire deeper work friendships as a substitute for friendships outside of work. reply phone8675309 48 minutes agoparentprevI'm the opposite from you. I would rather light my hair on fire than do anything in person with anyone on my team. I was no less productive working from home during the pandemic, a metric I can back up with completed user stores and completed projects. If you want to go back into the office then please, by all means, as that's clearly the place that you work better in, but don't force people who are less efficient in the office to come into the office. reply nashashmi 51 minutes agoprevI know how to get the workers back.

I live in a MCOL city with all the modern amenities and on $150k can be a comfortably upper-middle class sole income earner, buy the average house, and send 2 kids to private school if needed. A 2-3x pay differential is a fairly accurate COL difference for a family moving to NY or SF, maybe even on the low end if comparing to a rural area. reply mikestew 8 minutes agorootparentI’m not debating the accuracy of GP’s statement, but rather the level of success one might have with that negotiation tactic.

We believe we can act on our own behalf against our employer on equal footing. We start to believe in the myth of meritocracy. Remember the \"Day in the Life\" vidoes? When was the last time you saw someone showing their amazing workspace, the free food, the amentities and all that? A few years ago they were everywhere. Now? Nowhere. We are now in permanent layoff culture. Some of us still believe this is companies trimming the fat. It is not. It is wage suppression. If you get rid of 5% of your staff and just make the remaining 95% do what the 5% were doing then you've saved money. Even better, the reamining 95% won't be asking for or demanding raises. After all, aren't you luck to have your job? But severance packages cost money. You know what's cheaper? Return to office mandates. A certain percentage of people will quit. That's a cheap layoff. Now some of you think your WFH status is safe. You may even take a pay cut to continue WFH (even though it's objectively cheaper to employ people remotely). Trust me when I tell you that the flood waters are rising. You're just temporarily on the high ground. Your remote status won't last. For a handful it might but for the vast majority, you will be faced with the choice of losing your job or going back to the office. This is more wage suppression. It is employers forcing their will on you so they can walk around the cubicle farm and see what you're doing. It's the compliance of having you there regardless of whether you need to be or not. As a tech worker, you are just like any other worker. You are not immune. The only effective counter is to act collectively with your fellow employees. Unfortunately we've spent the last 50+ years completely dismantling any kind of collectivism. reply chasil 0 minutes agoparent> Now some of you think your WFH status is safe.

With savings comes extra cash. And extra cash can only sit on the sidelines for so long. Until company’s are lured once again in to making bigger, larger, scalable bets. You need engineers to explore new hypotheses, to drive growth, to explore these new possible markets. Greed always returns. Idle money, stagnant growth helps no one. You don’t scale a company with savings. You scale up by spending. reply jmyeet 15 minutes agorootparentThis is what I call Blind Faith in the Free Market. First, there's no such thing as a \"free\" market. Any robust market requires strong regulation and thus a strong government. So for a labor market, you need things like workers rights for the entire thing to work, even for the companies. Second, companies collude to dilute labor power. Years ago in tech it was the Steve Jobs anti-poaching collusion case [1]. Now, every company is in permanent layoff mode. Notice how pretty much every company decided to start doing that at about the same time? You ever wonder why? Tech companies have basically adopted the Corporate America model of \"up or out\" culture. It's incredibly toxic. It even goes against Google's findings that the most important aspect to team productivity is psychological safety [2]. Lastly, it has long been observed that the tendency is for profits to decrease over time [3]. The only way to counter this is by cutting costs, raising prices or growing a market. The last one is incredibly difficult. The first two are incredibly easy, at least in the short term. It is cheaper to constantly churn 5% of your employees if that suppresses the cost of the other 95%. [1]: https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/11/technology/silicon-valley-p...

UIdaho used one as a file server for the rest of the labs (home dirs were //snake/home/$user iirc, with snake = dn10k) and it was also available for use as a speedy workstation. Spaceball + 40bpp graphics made for some fun early forays into graphics programming. Was also where I happened to hit ctrl-enter after the admin had neglected to flip it back into normal mode. During the middle of a class day. Chaos. reply 2sk21 12 minutes agoprevI worked summers in a lab in the 1980s that had Silicon Graphics, Apollo and Sun workstations. The Sun was the easiest to program by far so it got the most use. reply ggm 15 hours agoprevHad the dubious joy of managing Domain/OS Unix children inside the Apollo virtualisation method of the day. Along with Nixdorf, these systems were all through Civil Engineering and NMR facilities at the university campus. And, just like Nixdorf they came with multiple open CVE (didn't exist as a term of art at the time, but lets ignore the anachronism) such as the games user, well known passwords, root sendmail, you-name-it. Nice enough CPU and memory. Not a very nice Unix experience, analogous to HP-UX it was complex, and a bugger to configure C code on if you came from BSD land (Ultrix, SunOS/Solaris) Sockets felt like a badly coded bolt-on. They really wanted to pretend the internet protocol stack wasn't there. reply neilv 7 hours agoparent> Not a very nice Unix experience, analogous to HP-UX it was complex, and a bugger to configure C code on if you came from BSD land (Ultrix, SunOS/Solaris) Apollo DomainOS (Aegis) was technically better than Unix. At some point (before my time), marketing must've decided they needed to be more Unix-compatible, and they did some clever things to also give it multiple Unix personalities (both SysV and BSD), while still keeping their original better personality. One place you'd feel pain around then, on most any Unix platform, is in downloading \"portable\" code off the Internet. Even for code already made portable in some sense, you'd probably have at least modify the Makefile, if not at least one C file, to select what portability you wanted, or to work around flaws in their portability. (SunOS 4 was my favorite for awhile, and at least half the reason was that code I'd grab from an FTP site was usually easy to get running, because it was probably developed on either SunOS or at least another BSD. Ultrix was also OK.) As a teen, I managed a porting lab, so I got to sysadmin and own-time develop on all of them. Writing portable C code for the different Unix workstations, I'd have to do it in a subset of K&R C, plus a portability mechanism that I built as I went (for architecture differences, library differences, C compiler differences). I do recall the Apollos being one of the more annoying Unix workstation platforms for C. I think they preferred safer languages for systems programming (again, they were ahead of their time), and maybe they didn't go all-in on developer ergonomics for C. Also, I guess the compiler probably predated ANSI C. reply Pet_Ant 4 hours agorootparentI've seen the term in passing, but what are \"Unix personalities\"? Is it just different optional command line arguments to the common utilities? TAR vs Gnu TAR? reply Zach_the_Lizard 4 hours agorootparentIt's a bunch of small things: command line flags, whether a command line tool is even present at all, compiler built-ins / differences in behavior, headers possibly being in different places, compiler support for various language standards and more. Even to this day, it's not uncommon to find libraries that won't compile with one of GCC, clang, etc. or even the same compiler but Linux vs MacOS. It was even worse in ye olde times before package managers, I'm assuming. EDIT: I forgot to mention that System V and BSD are two of the major families. Both influenced Unix-like OSes far and wide, such as SysV style init scripts in certain Linux distros, MacOS being derived partly from BSD, Solaris being a continuation of SysV IIRC, and more. There was a rough standardization in where certain things could be found, command line flags, etc. reply sillywalk 1 hour agorootparentFrom an Apollo Domain OS Design document[0]: \"In order to provide maximum portability of software from Domain/ as to other Berkeley or System V UNIX systems, Apollo provides two complete and separate UNIX environments, rather than a hybrid of the two. Any workstation can have one or both UNIX environments installed, and users can select which environment to use on a per-process basis. Two key mechanisms support this facility. First, every program can have a stamp applied that says what UNIX environment it should run in. The default value for this stamp is the environment in which it was compiled. When the program is loaded, the system sets an internal run-time switch to either berkeley or att, depending on the value of the stamp. Some of the UNIX system calls use this run-time switch to resolve conflicts when the same system call has different semantics in the two environments. The other mechanism is a modification of the pathname resolution process, such that pathname text contains environment variable ex- pansions. [...] When UNIX software is installed on a node, the standard trees (/bin, /usr) are installed under directories called bsd4.3 and sysS.3. The names /bin and /usr are actually symbolic links dependent on the value of an environment variable named SYSTYPE. That is, /bin is a symbolic link to /$(SYSTYPE)/bin. When the program loader loads a stamped program, it sets the value of SYSTYPE to either bsd4.3 or sys3.3, according to the value of the program stamp. Therefore, a program that refers to a name in one of the standard directories will access the correct version for its environment.\" [0] https://bitsavers.org/pdf/apollo/014962-A00_Domain_OS_Design... reply Lutzb 2 hours agoprevJust a quick heads up.

I just can't help it. There should be a word for [mindlessly] reporting the results of a calculation to arbitrary precision when only one significant digit of precision is warranted. There probably is such a word in German. reply kstrauser 13 hours agorootparentYou and me both! When I see something like \"a blue whale can be nearly 100 feet (30.48m) long\", I want to throw a math book at the author. \"Nearly 100 feet\" is \"nearly 30 meters\". \"About $250K\" is \"about $660K today\" at best. reply masfuerte 4 hours agorootparentMy favourite is \"average July temperatures have increased by 2°C (35.6°F)\". reply pjdesno 10 minutes agorootparentMy favorite is 98.6F - your whole perspective changes when you realize that it's actually 37C. reply hanche 10 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention the number of times you see geographical locations specified to nanometer precision. reply genpfault 2 hours agorootparenthttps://xkcd.com/2170/ reply fecal_henge 1 hour agorootparentprevShould be 1/4 M$, 2/3 M$. reply billforsternz 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, my comment implied \"about $700K\" since I said one significant digit, but I have no problem at all with \"about \"$660K\" especially when you add \"at best\" as you did :-). In general I think these inflation estimators are inherently very imprecise across multi decade timespans because the societal changes that occur over long periods of time mean you inevitably are comparing apples to oranges. reply flemhans 13 hours agorootparentprevÜberpräzisionsberichterstattung reply fch42 4 hours agorootparentAs a German, I won't say \"doesn't exist\" because it's possible of course. At best, people would think it some term from legalese. The opposite thing though, \"really roughly approximately (and couldn't care less how precise)\" (you get what I mean) is often colloquially used in German, under the term \"Pi times Thumb\" (Pi mal Daumen). So yes you can say \"250tsd anno 1988 sind pi mal daumen 600tsd heutzutage\". reply carstenhag 8 hours agorootparentprevWould be possible but seems overcomplicated. Why not just \"Überpräzisierung\"?

We joyfully smash words together to make new words, like a linguistic particle accelerator. :-) reply HPsquared 10 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Translate accepts it, so I guess it's a word. Only one Google result though (this page). reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentGoogle Translate just understands how German allows \"on the fly\" compound words. E.g. it knows \"Überpräzisionsberichterstattunghundhund\" is \" \"Over-precision reporting dog dog\" not because it's anymore a word than other nonsense but just because it's what it would mean if you made it up. reply bagful 13 hours agorootparentprevTo provide figures in this manner is to report with \"false precision\", but we could workshop that phrase into something pithier. reply Beijinger 9 hours agorootparentprevExtremzufallsgenauigkeitsangabe? reply formerly_proven 12 hours agorootparentprevAnother issue is that computer prices are really hard to compare across time, especially for systems targeted at businesses. Do you just use the CPI? Why is that meaningful? Do you use the one for IT? (Then it would be like, \"$250,000 in 1989 ($1,400 today)\") Something in-between? How do you capture the notion that workstations of this era were basically the first generation that allowed businesses to computer-aid stuff they used to do on paper, bringing a massive productivity boost? reply 486sx33 8 hours agorootparentprevSchadenfreude reply johnklos 14 hours agoparentprevTrue, but there were wonderful exceptions. For instance, the Mac SE/30 (1989) could take up to 128 megs, and the Amiga 3000 (1990) was designed to allow for even more (although only 16 megs on the motherboard, but 256 meg Zorro III cards were available in 1993). Later, some m68k Macs like the Quadra 605 allowed for 128 meg SIMMs, and the PCI Power Macs really took things to a new level. The Power Mac 9500 could take up to 1.5 gigs of memory in 1995. It's a shame that no computers really distinguish themselves like that any more, aside from high end server systems. reply mciancia 2 hours agorootparent> The Power Mac 9500 could take up to 1.5 gigs of memory in 1995. > It's a shame that no computers really distinguish themselves like that any more, aside from high end server systems. Well, intel mac pro from 2019 could take up to 1.5TB of ram while I would guess standard back then for PCs was 16-32GB at most. So should be comparable (1.5GB vs 16-32MB of ram in 1995)? reply mjg59 11 hours agorootparentprevEh to be fair I think the main reason Zorro III RAM cards didn't appear until way after the first Zorro III machine is that Zorro III wasn't coupled to CPU speed so sticking RAM there wasn't great from a performance perspective - you really needed to use the CPU slot to extend beyond 18MB (remember the 2MB of Chip in addition to the 16MB of Fast) in a useful way reply ChainOfFools 7 hours agorootparentThe studio I worked at during that time actually did have a CPU slot based memory extension that can handle I believe up to 256 Mb, this would have been around 92 or 93, but I'm not sure how early it was offered on the market that's just when I started there and it was already in the shop. I don't recall the name of it though but I remember that it was a peculiar PCB design, with part of it resembling a breadboard. I think the name started with Ex, like Excelsior or Excalibur or something like that. reply the-rc 3 hours agorootparentYou didn't mention what machine this was on. Since you mention a breadboard, are you sure it wasn't an addon to an existing CPU card? Perhaps the X-Calibur, that plugged into the Commodore A3640? That's a bit later, though. reply userbinator 17 hours agoparentprevDual (50% overclocked) Celerons on a BP6 was a relatively common enthusiast setup in the early 2000s. 128M of RAM was also not a huge amount then. reply sitkack 2 hours agorootparentMy friends and I all built BP6 machines. Such a wonderful workstation machine. I donated mine to the PC recycler when I moved in 2005. It still is my favorite beige box unix workstation. reply garciasn 16 hours agorootparentprevI bought one in 1998 or 1999 with dual 366s OCd to 700 each; anything over 700 was too unstable for my setup.

And from 2k-2k1, even under Unix at home too (something unthinkable by 1988) with some nice GNU/Linux distro :D. The technology change from 1988 to 1998 was really huge, much more compared to what you could get since 2010 until today. reply supportengineer 5 hours agorootparentYou should look up “Commodore Amiga”, it was way more powerful than PC reply TheAmazingRace 3 hours agorootparentAlthough the Amiga was quite a neat piece of kit when it first came out in 1985, I disagree with your comment unfortunately. The custom chipset sorta \"froze\" the Amiga design to a particular level and it was very hard to make meaningful upgrades, unlike PCs, where you could slap a new CPU into the CPU socket, or a new video accelerator, sound card, etc, into the ISA or PCI busses. Yes I realize there were accelerator cards for Amigas later on, like the BlizzardPPC, but they weren't an officially supported option by Commodore (most accelerators came out after Commodore was pronounced dead in 1994) and were more like kludges. reply icedchai 2 hours agorootparentI was a Amiga fan until the mid 90's, and you're spot on. The Amiga was too difficult to iterate on. Chip set upgrades like AGA were far too little, too late. (And forget about ECS, which barely added anything a normal user would care about.) By the time AGA was out, 386 systems with SVGA, Soundblaster, etc were cheap and common. reply TheAmazingRace 1 hour agorootparentAs a collector, this is why I prefer Atari ST family systems over Amigas. Because they are simpler from the jump, they are easier to work on and less finnicky - floppies being a prime example of this... as Commodore liked using aggressive GCR encoding instead of IBM PC standards for formatting diskettes. For everything else, PC based hardware is just more familiar and flexible for me, since that's what I grew up with. reply icedchai 21 minutes agorootparentThe Amiga was definitely the more exotic platform! I learned a ton from Amiga OS though. It was my first exposure to a \"real\" operating system with libraries, multitasking, IPC, etc. Once I got a Linux box though, I never looked back. kingo55 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, I remember getting my Tualatin Celeron in 2003 with 256mb RAM.

Things moved rapidly back then. reply rasz 3 hours agorootparent500 was released in February 99. 550 4 months later, 700 five more months later. $700 worth of CPU performance from February 1999 could be had in a low end March 2000 system with $130 CPU. In 2001 500MHz system was already obsolete. reply cellularmitosis 1 hour agorootparentYeah. My first PC build was in 98: PII 300MHz / 128MB RAM. No way a P3 500 was available at the time. reply rasz 3 hours agorootparentprevNo Pentium 2 could be overclocked much above ~500MHz due to the way they were all manufactured. 10% is not really much higher. reply supportengineer 16 hours agoparentprevThe FAA command center had rooms full of them. reply bee_rider 16 hours agoparentprevAnd those 10 years were the 90’s, advancement was crazy back then. reply jeffbee 16 hours agorootparentSo true. A year or two after this machine, you could have bought an AT&T StarServer \"E\" with 4x i486 CPUs and 2GiB total memory, for dramatically less money. reply wmf 15 hours agorootparentI assume a 486 was dramatically slower than the Apollo PRISM (which looks reasonably well-designed by today's standards). reply jandrese 14 hours agorootparentIt was probably not dramatic if it was slower at all, there is a reason so many of those workstation processors died out in the 90s. reply actionfromafar 11 hours agorootparentI at first thought a 486 was probably faster, but that Apollo CPU has 64 bit data path apparently. It might have been a beast. I didn't even know Apollo used anything but Motorola 68k CPUs. reply bee_rider 6 hours agorootparentI wonder if it might have been a beast at some tasks, but not others? I imagine these chips might have been optimized for throughput on well-suited and carefully tuned programs, where the compilers could be convinced to put out good code (since it was apparently something like a VLIW). reply lmm 14 hours agoparentprevI used to have an Alpha server from that vintage with I think 512MB of RAM.

Does anyone remember what that was called? Edit: Domain/OS! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain/OS reply neilv 6 hours agoparentI worked with developers who really knew their way around the Apollo Display Manager (DM), and apparently it was a power-user platform if you knew how to use it. (Maybe a bit like how Emacs is a power user platform, but if you stuck it in front of someone who only knew NOTEPAD.EXE mouse editing and File->Save, they'd be unaware of the Emacs power, and fixate on why the most basic things don't quite work how they thought everything works.) There were some hints at the sophistication, like you could see that the windows with the command line shells in them were designed to support this. (Rather than the windows being emulators of character-cell terminals, like the command line windows we're still using almost everywhere else 40 years later.) And you could see the special function keys on the keyboard, and the strange bar at bottom of screen, and the indicator icons that appear in the titles of windows, though it'd take awhile to learn what they all they can do or mean. And you might be aware of how smoothly integrated the networking is, compared to everything else you'd seen. reply neilv 15 hours agoprevWe had at least a few Apollo DN10k pedestals as servers at HQ, for purposes like SCM and what today would be called CI. Even though by the time I arrived we were mostly buying Sun, HP-PA, and Windows NT, the company started as an Apollo shop. And so SCM at HQ was based on Apollo DSEE (\"dizzy\"), which they liked, hence, DN10k servers scattered around. https://bitsavers.org/pdf/apollo/008788-A01_Getting_Started_... reply richardman 9 hours agoprevI worked at LTX as my first job out of college, and they were re-architecting their test systems based on the Apollo 68K based DN systems. Domain/OS was weird and even those expensive boxes still had trace wires soldered on the motherboards.

What is a 80186 clone group (a division at AMD designing 80186 clone CPUs, or a hobby group of 80186 PC enthusiasts?) But these machines are from 1988, wouldn't one be designing 386 or even 486 clones at that time? reply stevenwoo 4 hours agorootparentCo-op is a term used by some universities for alternating a work semester at a company with school semester in class in the USA for 2nd/3rd/4th year students. We were paid something like 10-15 an hour which was much better than most non professional work jobs. The group I was in was making money off of refinements and continual production of AMD 80186 chips for drop in replacements for Intel 80186 at a lower cost. The group adjacent to mine was working on reverse engineering 386 clone design from a black box approach (using only public info like the Intel handbook on 386 which I remember they were all reading like it was the bible) and was at a pretty early stage, every one on that team was very senior and IIRC most had PhDs in Electrical Engineering so I was of course very underqualified for that. reply rasz 3 hours agorootparentWhy tho? AMD had full license and even AM386 shipped with 1:1 copy of Intel microcode ripped directly from reverse engineered die shots. reply stevenwoo 50 minutes agorootparentOff the top of my head without looking at reference materials - there were a lot of legal issues going on at the time involving AMD/Intel disputes and AMD was on the ropes back then. The 386 project was highly contentious with Intel, I think they started the project as a worse case scenario in the licensing deal - if Intel forbade 386 from the initial contract, AMD could show proof of work on an entirely ground up project to replicate the 386 - the guys on the team were up against a rock and a hard place and were determined but not always optimistic. Also, there was some grumbling when I started because shortly before I started they had some layoffs. AMD was on the brink. This is off of my memory from 25 years ago and I was a pretty lowly coop and only heard this from meals and shared open workspace with the other project. edit: I looked it up and there was a dispute if the license applied until 1991 for the 386. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am386 reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentprevA co-op is more or less a fancier/better/longer term internship. reply jerrysievert 16 hours agoprevI managed to get an Apollo on auction while working at ncd in the early-mid 90’s, mine had a very high res black and white monitor and a very weird Unix implementation that appeared to let you choose between bsd and AT&T environments at boot.

Casually, I have never seen it mentioned. My very brief Domain experience was that it had a very similar shell style UX, with cryptic, Unix style commands (i.e. ld vs ls) making very “tounge tying” for someone comfortable with Unix. We had a very early Apollo with some CASE software that nobody was particularly interested in, so it pretty well just sat there.

These brochures are something special in themselves. A big part of it is merely nostalgia, but another part is that they put a sizable effort behind these things. They were more than happy to highlight the unique qualities and capabilities of the computer and put more than a few days effort into the promotional material.

Looks like an early loser in the RISC wars that was recycled into later PA-RISC and Itanium. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_PRISM reply justsomehnguy 16 hours agoparent> In some respects, the VLIW design can be thought of as \"super-RISCy\", as it offloads the instruction selection process to the compiler as well. In the VLIW design, the compiler examines the code and selects instructions that are known to be \"safe\", and then packages them into longer instruction words. For instance, for a CPU with two functional units, like the PRISM, the compiler would find pairs of safe instructions and stuff them into a single larger word. Inside the CPU, the instructions are simply split apart again, and fed into the selected units. Wait a second. So while this is all fancy and gives a better performance (with a mature compiler chuckles in Itanium)... but it's totally incompatible with virtualisation (as we know it on x86 systems)? Cache trashing is surely always a way to throw out the performance, but this design would make it times worse, AFAIU? reply Taniwha 13 hours agorootparentI've built VLIW hardware, virtualisation is not an issue, cache usage is not different than other CPUs - in fact modern superscalar, out-of-order CPUs effectively do what the compiler for VLIWs do dynamically on the fly. The big issue about VLIW hardware is that it tends to address a particular performance point - usually lets you squeeze out the last bit of performance without having to go to the complexity of dynamic instruction scheduling (and doubling the CPU size) - the problem comes when you want to do your next chip and the trade off ends up being different, you can't keep the same instruction set and so making an ARCHITECTURE is hard reply zik 15 hours agorootparentprevI don't think VLIW is incompatible with virtualisation. The amount of CPU state you need to load and save on context switches is a little higher than other architectures so it has a minor effect on the efficiency of virtualisation. But other than that there's no reason VLIW can't be virtualised. Not that the Apollos actually had hardware support for virtualisation features such as nested page tables. These machines were from the days before virtualisation was popular. Only IBM mainframes had it back then AFAIK. reply pinewurst 15 hours agorootparentprevNobody cared about virtualization when those systems were designed, other than IBM (and compatible) mainframe designers.

    "originBody": "Security 53 CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor also linked to Linux kernel panics and crashes 53 Rapid restore tool being tested as Microsoft estimates 8.5M machines went down Simon Sharwood Sun 21 Jul 2024 // 23:51 UTC CrowdStrike's now-infamous Falcon Sensor software, which last week led to widespread outages of Windows-powered computers, has also caused crashes of Linux machines. Red Hat in June warned its customers of a problem it described as \"Kernel panic observed after booting 5.14.0-427.13.1.el9_4.x86_64 by falcon-sensor process\" that impacted some users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 after (as the warning suggests) booting on kernel version 5.14.0-427.13.1.el9_4.x86_64. A second issue titled \"System crashed at cshook_network_ops_inet6_sockraw_release+0x171a9\" advised users \"for assistance with troubleshooting potential issues with the falcon_lsm_serviceable kernel module provided from the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor/Agent security software suite.\" Red Hat also advised that \"disabling the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor/Agent software suite … will mitigate the crashes and provide temporary stability to the system in question while the issue is investigated.\" The issue was \"Observed but not limited to release 6 and 7.\" We've also spotted reports of CrowdStrike being suspected of causing problems in Debian and Rocky Linux. Linux Kernel panics and Windows Blue Screens of Death are broadly comparable. The occurrence of kernel panics mere weeks before CrowdStrike broke many Windows implementations therefore hints at wider issues at the security vendor. The Register has asked CrowdStrike to comment on the issues identified by Red Hat, and will update this story if we receive substantial information. CrowdStrike's CEO oversaw very similar McAfee meltdown In 2010, PCs around the world crashed after antivirus vendor McAfee pushed a bad update that left PCs in an endless reboot cycle. At the time, McAfee's chief technology officer was George Kurtz – who now serves as CEO of CrowdStrike. Kurtz therefore has the possibly unique and almost-certainly-unwanted distinction of having presided over two major global outage events caused by bad software updates. Rapid restore tool on the way CrowdStrike on Sunday teased a rapid recovery tool for the mess it made. \"Together with customers, we tested a new technique to accelerate impacted system remediation,\" the security vendor stated on LinkedIn, adding \"We're in the process of operationalizing an opt-in to this technique. We're making progress by the minute.\" That progress will likely be of great interest, as Microsoft veep for enterprise and OS security David Weston on Saturday estimated that 8.5 million Windows machines had been laid low by the problem. That's less than one percent of all Windows devices in operation, though a lot of the ones affected obviously were in critical environments. Microsoft also created a repair tool that runs from a bootable USB storage device and can be found here, along with instructions for use. Those instructions were modified on Sunday to require a full wipe of the USB device \"so it doesn't error out when used in the recovery process.\" CrowdStrike published technical details of the incident. It has also offered guidance on how to recover Windows machines encrypted with BitLocker. Former Microsoft operating system developer David Plummer has shared his dissection of the flawed CrowdStrike update here. CrowdStrike shares sink as global IT outage savages systems worldwide Cybercriminals quickly exploit CrowdStrike chaos Angry admins share the CrowdStrike outage experience Life, interrupted: How CrowdStrike's patch failure is messing up the world Up in the air The extent of disruption caused by CrowdStrike remains uncertain, but we've read accounts of over 6,800 flights cancelled last Friday alone, and of some airlines only restoring systems on Sunday evening. The British Medical Association has warned that \"normal service cannot be resumed immediately\" by UK doctors, at least, due to the backlog caused by the outage. Australia's home affairs minister Claire O'Neill has warned that remediation could take weeks.

    "commentBody": "CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor also linked to Linux kernel panics and crashes (theregister.com)154 points by kenjackson 16 hours agohidepastfavorite141 comments roblabla 11 hours agoThis is some very poor journalism. The linux issues are so, so very different from the windows BSOD issue. The redhat kernel panics were caused by a bug in the kernel ebpf implementation, likely a regression introduced by a rhel-specific patch. Blaming crowdstrike for this is stupid (just like blaming microsoft for the crowdstrike bsod is stupid). For background, I also work on a product using eBPFs, and had kernel updates cause kernel panics in my eBPF probes. In my case, the panic happened because the kernel decided to change an LSM hook interface, adding a new argument in front of the others. When the probe gets loaded, the kernel doesn’t typecheck the arguments, and so doesn’t realise the probe isn’t compatible with the new kernel. When the probe runs, shit happens and you end up with a kernel panic. eBPF probes causing kernel panics are almost always indication of a kernel bug, not a bug in the ebpf vendor. There are exceptions of course (such as an ebpf denying access to a resource causing pid1 to crash). But they’re very few. reply xyzzy123 4 hours agoparentIt's not clear to me they are so different but maybe I am not \"sufficiently smart\". To me this feels like a complicated question - both Linux and Windows organisations are quite good at kernel reliability engineering even though quite different organisational structures and engineering approaches are involved. Yes \"the wrong people were trusted\" but I don't see how we can completely solve this with engineering. reply josefx 10 hours agoparentprev> likely a regression introduced by a rhel-specific patch. Blaming crowdstrike for this is stupid (just like blaming microsoft for the crowdstrike bsod is stupid). Yeah, it isn't as if crowdstrike was specifically advertising certified support for RedHat Linux and related products. https://www.crowdstrike.com/partners/falcon-for-red-hat/ reply dtx1 10 hours agorootparentBut being certified for RedHat Linux doesn't protect you from Bugs in the RedHat Kernel. That's on RedHat. reply michaelt 10 hours agorootparentBack in The Good Old Days, an OS vendor would release a beta version and software vendors would test against it and fix problems before the stable OS version was released. Obviously OS updates come out a lot more often these days than they used to - but we're also better at test automation than ever before, and beta software is easier to get than ever. It sure would be nice if companies that decide to produce kernel modules and to support certain OSes could test those kernel modules against those OSes at the beta stage. reply roblabla 9 hours agorootparent1.An eBPF probe is not a kernel module. An eBPF probe should never cause kernel panics. 2. RHEL didn't provide beta kernels before very recently, as far as I can tell. 3. Even if you caught an error then, you're still at the mercy of RHEL to fix it. If RHEL breaks a feature, you report it to them, and they decide to ship anyways... well, your product will still kpanic. I'm not talking hypotheticals: I haven't seen RHEL do that, but I've seen other distros do it. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentEmphasis added: > An eBPF probe should never cause kernel panics. Should, but did. This is the point at which to learn and adapt. Also, kernels are software just like nearly everything else, and software is buggy. It's a balance obviously, but some basic defensive development can be a real savior for your users. I don't know the details about this CrowdStrike incident, but I would also be surprised if you couldn't write an automated test (even a \"smoke test\") to quickly test out these new kernels before they hit your customers. Given what happened, it seems like negligence not to do that. reply roblabla 3 hours agorootparentIt's possible CS can do better, of course. But it's just wrong to blame them for the Linux crashes - they're not the ones that introduced buggy code and broke their users. RHEL/Linux did. reply _flux 8 hours agorootparentprev> and they decide to ship anyways... well, your product will still kpanic But then you are in position to share your customers that this will happen before it actually does and they can choose their way of proceeding. One such way would be being careful with the update and then exercising their own support contracts with RH. reply roblabla 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, and? They probably do test their software on RHEL. But how are they supposed to prevent a bug in a newly released kernel update? You can't test your software on future updates that aren't out yet. If RHEL breaks some core functionality you depend on, in a newly released update, you can't really do much to prevent breakage, even with the best QA in the world. At best, they could have caught it as soon as RHEL published the new kernel... but by then it's already too late, all your currently-deployed probes now have a ticking time bomb, and need to be updated before the RHEL kernel update is applied, lest you kernel panic. reply hsbauauvhabzb 9 hours agorootparentMaybe by not loading the module into unknown kernels in the first place? If say you support a distro, you can’t turn around and complain that supporting the newest version is hard, no matter who caused the problem. Plenty of products say ‘this works on $x but it’s not officially supported’. reply roblabla 7 hours agorootparentAgain: this is not a kernel module. eBPF probes are meant to be Compile Once, Run Everywhere, that's their whole point! https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf... If you expect software to be future-bug-proof, well, I guess you live in a far better world than I do. If you advertise your software to be compatible with RHEL, but a glibc bug gets in and causes your sw to crash for a couple of days, before RHEL realises the problem and fixes it, does that mean your software should instantly no longer be advertised as RHEL compatible? That'd make things a lot more confusing, if you ask me. reply linuxftw 6 hours agorootparentNot all eBPF programs are compile once, run everywhere. RHEL 'updates' can mean different things. A patch release won't change kernel ABI. A minor release will. Writing a non-CORE eBPF program for, say RHEL 8.6, might break on RHEL 8.7. It's not advisable to update across minor releases without lots of testing. Most of the time, things 'just work' but RHEL is a very complex product with a specific support cycle, and laziness of users and 3rd party vendors is not their fault. reply freedomben 4 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe by not loading the module into unknown kernels in the first place? Then you better tell your customers not to `dnf update` until you've had a chance to whitelist the new kernel and ship it in your own stream. Otherwise everyone who updates before you do ends up broken. If a vendor told me that, I would laugh, realize they were serious, thank them for their time but let them know that we will be going a different direction. reply broknbottle 8 hours agorootparentprevThis was their newer eBPF falcon sensor that was trying to load a bpf program in the kernel and triggered kernel panic. This shouldn’t have happened and was definitely a bug in the kernel. For the kernel mode, their software will flag an unknown kernel as unsupported and go into a reduced functionality mode (rfm). The idiots didn’t know that RH E4S was a thing for like 3+ years.. I’m still baffled by how clueless most of the security people and vendors are when it comes to backporting and different streams / channels that are offered by multiple Linux OS vendors. https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7001909 reply mbesto 10 hours agoparentprev> just like blaming microsoft for the crowdstrike bsod is stupid Wait, how is this stupid? Unless I'm missing something, wasn't the patch part of a Microsoft payload that included an update to Crowdstrike? Surely Crowdstrike is culpable, but that doesn't completely absolve Microsoft of any responsibility, as its their payload. reply sschueller 9 hours agorootparentMicrosoft should revoke the CrowdStrike driver signature and should do an internal check as to why CrowdStrike's driver was approved when it can execute arbitrary code on the kernel level without any checks. If your \"driver\" requires this feature MS should require CrowdStrike to submit the entire source and they should have to pay MS to do a review of the code. What is the point of driver signing if a vendor can basically build in a back door and Microsoft doesn't validate that this back door is at least somewhat reasonable reply _flux 8 hours agorootparentDo you think Microsoft customers using CrowdStrike would then be happier, being unable to run the software at all, due to an action Microsoft took? Backdoors of all kinds can be installed to most any operating system without vendor co-operation. That is the nature of general-purpose operating systems. reply sigseg1v 6 hours agorootparentI'm a customer that is forced to use CrowdStrike via IT policies and I would be giddy with delight if something came along and caused the removal of it from my systems. I don't need programs sitting on my computer preventing me from installing code that I've literally just compiled, preventing me from deleting or modifying folders on my machine, and causing extreme lag for many basic system operations even when it does work. At this point, the time in lost productivity (via normal operation) and downtime (via their recent bug) has easily exceeded a thousand times over the aggregate sum of all benefits that CrowdStrike will ever have provided from threat detection and prevention. It's time to remove the malware. reply _flux 5 hours agorootparentYou are not the customer, though, your employer is the customer. Perhaps you should push this change up in the food chain, then, and if the company is good the request will be taken seriously. As I understand it, while CrowdStrike is the biggest name in EDR, it's far from the only one, if that's what your company requires to pass some checkboxes in certifications. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentVendors are competing with one and another to win contracts. CIO/CISO don't select vendors lightly. There seems to be a typical/classical Engineer's mindset of \"make a claim first, ask later\" around the subject lately. \"My boss plays golf with Sales Rep\" might need more proof because if they selected the lesser capable vendors and they got hit with ransomware, bet my ass your boss will no longer play Golf with any Sales Rep ever. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentprevSounds like your IT (sec team, specifically) doesn't setup the software correctly. I've worked for a company that installs Falcon on all its fleet and I never run into issues like yours. reply mbreese 6 hours agorootparentprevAt this point… yes. It would be one thing Microsoft could do to focus 100% of the attention/blame away from Windows and onto CloudStrike. And customers will want their pound of flesh from somewhere. Really, this should serve as a wake up call w/in Microsoft to start to harden the kernel against such vulnerabilities. Was the crash the fault of Windows? No. But did a Windows design decision make this possible? yes. I’m sure the design decision made sense at the time (at least business sense). Keeping the kernel more open for others to add drivers to makes it easier to write/add drivers, but makes the system more vulnerable. This a good opportunity within Microsoft to get support for changing that. reply _flux 5 hours agorootparentUltimately this would have been almost a non-issue if there had been better deployment strategies in place for also the data file updates. If by changing the system you mean adding some kind of in-kernel isolation to it, then I don't think it would be worth the effort to make that kind of major change to the way operating systems work just to give arguably a minor risk reduction to systems—in particular if CrowdStrike and other vendors take some learnings from this event. Microsoft might improve their system rollback mechanism to also include files that are not strictly integrated to the system, merely used by the parts that are (the channel files loaded by the driver). Actually I think we can just be happy that the incident was a mistake, not an attack. Had this kind of \"first ever\" situation been an attack, it could be extremely difficult to recover from it. I wonder how well EDRs deal with \"attacks from within\".. CrowdStrike pulled off the update within 1.5 hours. I wonder if they actually use Falcon themselves? But then somehow missed the problem? Doesn't seem like they eat their own dog food :). (Or at least their own channel files.) reply roblabla 4 hours agorootparentThere's a simple thing microsoft could do to avoid this, that doesn't require anything too crazy. EDRs work in kernel-land because that's the only place you can place yourself to block certain things, like process creation, driver loading, etc... macOS has a userland API for this, called EndpointSecurity, which allows doing all the things an EDR needs, without ever touching kernelland. Microsoft could introduce a similar API, and EDRs would no longer need a driver. reply mbreese 3 hours agorootparentThis is exactly what I’d advocate for. There are many things that run in kernel space that don’t need to. The Mac model with user-land hooks is one model. EBPF from Linux (and Windows?) is another. I’m sure the reason why Apple migrated was because of all of the bugs/crashes security companies kept introducing into the kernel with kexts. Apple had the ability to change their architecture on a whim because of they aren’t quite a beholden to backwards compatibility as Windows. Microsoft could take this as an opportunity to make some major changes that would be more readily accepted by the market. reply _flux 4 hours agorootparentprevI suppose that's what CrowdStrike's system on Mac uses as well, then. Apparently on Linux they use EBPF and Microsoft is researching that for Windows as well: https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows . So maybe that's actually the solution they'll go with? It would certainly help solving this particular problem, even if not the kernel-integration in general. reply mbreese 4 hours agorootparentprevIf many things had gone differently, this could have been avoided. But I’m looking at this from the Microsoft perspective. No matter how much people scream high and loud that it was a CloudStrike issue and not Microsoft’s fault, Microsoft is still getting blamed. It’s a Windows BSOD. I talked to my dad (retired enterprise operations/IT) this weekend and he was telling me that the next computer he buys will probably be a Mac, largely because he doesn’t want to deal with the possibility of a crash like this. Does he run CloudStrike? Not at all. Does he know who they are? Nope. (He’s been retired for a while) What he does know (well, thinks) is that Windows now has an unstable kernel. And Microsoft has no control over distribution policies for other vendors. How those vendors distribute updates is up to them. Even if a sane deployment strategy could have avoided the larger global problems, Microsoft can’t control that. So, if you have Microsoft dealing with negative publicity and public sentiment, with no way to control errors like this in the future, what can you do? To me, the best they can do is kneecap CloudStrike, put the full blame on them, and use this as an excuse to change the kernel/driver model to one where they can have more control over the stability of the OS. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentThey will kneecap Security industry and open up another can of worm: Windows insecure back on the menu. reply mbreese 3 hours agorootparentThere are other vendors. Microsoft could even reinstate CloudStrike at some point, but only after an extensive review process. And then probably require similar process reviews/checks for any other vendor that requires the same kernel access. Or just remove the need for kernel access at all and migrate to a better driver architecture at the sacrifice of backwards compatibility. Security software doesn’t need to run in kernel space… there are other ways. reply hello_moto 3 hours agorootparentThat could potentially be a lawsuit against MSFT since their own MSFT Defender is in this space and potentially doing the same thing or else they have way less potency of catching attacks no? reply CaptainZapp 5 hours agorootparentprev> Backdoors of all kinds can be installed to most any operating system without vendor co-operation Not on Kernel level. Not without active support by the vendor. reply _flux 5 hours agorootparentHow much does it really help you if your complete user-space can still be messed up by an offending Windows SYSTEM process? As I understand it, they are able to hurt the system e.g. by killing processes, uninstalling applications, replacing binaries, allocating memory, starting too many processes, .. Actually I could easily see a buggy remote system management update could just decide to uninstall everything and nuke the system, because it thinks it's stolen. And it would be designed functionality for it. reply roblabla 7 hours agorootparentprevUnless you have a source, you should really avoid spreading misinfo here. CrowdStrike doesn't have kernel-level ACE. It has a buggy configuration parser, and they pushed a corrupted config that triggered those buggy codepath in the parser. reply dathinab 6 hours agorootparentthere are some places claiming that this \"config\" language is so flexible that it's basically a interpreted scripting language but AFIK no sources I trust have yet claimed it but it's probably where the idea comes from reply sschueller 7 hours agorootparentprevMy source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAzEJxOo1ts From my understanding the CS driver lives in the kernel space and parses configs/applications downloaded in the user space.

Hence the system even does a BSOD. That's my understanding as well, but not quite the same as > execute arbitrary code on the kernel level without any checks At least for me, when we talk about kernel-level ACE, it's something like libcapcom[0], which allowed executing arbitrary unsigned code in the kernel. Here, the driver can only execute the code present within itself, which was signed by Microsoft. The configuration itself isn't signed by microsoft, but the config isn't code (at least, as far as I can tell - I see some people claiming the CS-0000.sys files are essentially bytecode, but have yet to see conclusive proof of this). Now, we could argue that it's weird that Microsoft signed a buggy driver, and MS should do better qualification of third-party drivers. But in practice, MS doesn't really vet driver quality. From what I can tell, the driver signing is mostly there so they can easily attribute provenance of drivers, and revoke the certs if it ends up in the hands of malicious actors. [0]: https://github.com/notscimmy/libcapcom reply SoftTalker 4 hours agorootparentprevI never assumed that driver signing was any kind of indicator of quality. It simply says \"this is the Crowdstrike driver, it has not been modified\" Maybe I'm wrong and Microsoft does some QA on drivers before they are signed? reply AshamedCaptain 7 hours agorootparentprev> when it can execute arbitrary code on the kernel level without any checks That would be grounds for blacklisting indeed (out of experience). However, that's not the case here, no matter how you put it. reply cookiengineer 6 hours agorootparentprev> What is the point of driver signing if a vendor can basically build in a back door and Microsoft doesn't validate that Before you downvote that comment, I'd like to remind everyone that this was already happening. Realtek's driver cert was leaked, and a lot of malware used this cert to sign their drivers for _a decade_ until anything happened about it. Microsoft's driver signing workflow is utterly pointless and it doesn't mean anything. Any vendor that takes their security serious should never trust those driver signatures. reply rramadass 4 hours agorootparentprevFinally! You hit the nail right on the head! reply angulardragon03 9 hours agorootparentprevYou’re missing something. The Crowdstrike issue was caused by a channel update (basically a definitions update) that they pushed that broke their own sensor. Microsoft wasn’t involved in the delivery of that update. reply roblabla 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a source for this? It's the first time I hear of this. From what I've understood (perhaps wrongly), the error came from the CrowdStrike driver (csagent.sys) having bugs in their configuration parser that could cause it to BSOD. CrowdStrike pushed a corrupted configuration (the CS-000whatever.sys we're told to delete) that hit that bug. I'm not sure how Microsoft fits in this story. reply mbesto 9 hours agorootparentJust read more into it. You're correct. I think it would be dumb to solely blame MS, but I don't think you can completely absolve them. this comment right here sums it up: > Sure, but Windows shares some portion of the blame for allowing third-party security vendors to “shit in the kernel”. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41006176 reply roblabla 7 hours agorootparentYeah, the fact that Windows requires kernel-level access to be able to do EDR stuff is really unfortunate. MacOS has been very successful with their userspace EndpointSecurity Framework for this purpose. On the other hand, Linux is similarly crippled: eBPF LSM are fairly recent and don't work everywhere (I'm looking at you Ubuntu[0]), and the only real alternative if you want to be able to block processes is a kernel module. Which comes with the same dangers as Windows. [0]: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2054810 reply sgift 6 hours agorootparentWell, Microsoft says that's because of the EU commission: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41029590 I have my doubts, but that's at least what they give as the reason for the kernel-level access of EDR tools. reply beAbU 8 hours agorootparentprevCrowdstrike pushed out a world-wide update to their client software, which auto-updated itself. This update was buggy and it caused the host machine to go into a BSOD boot loop. The fact that the host machine happened to be running Windows has very little to nothing to do with it. It's like blaming a pothole for your car going exploding. Yes there was a pothole, yes it shouldn't have been there, yes it could have been avoided, but the fact that your car self immolated because of mere pothole points to possibly other underlying issues with your car. reply PedroBatista 8 hours agorootparentprevThe \"only\" thing Microsoft should be blame is for signing a driver updates itself by taking \"configurations ( code )\" from userspace and turning a blind eye to all these loopholes because they also know it's not practical for them to sign all the driver code that goes into the kernel. Maybe most of these \"drivers\" shouldn't be in Ring0 to begin with? This is a general problem and the norm, Windows is just another OS that allows this this way. reply dathinab 5 hours agorootparentit's not that simple user-land drivers are a thing, heck they are the standard for modern micro kernel architectures and even with hybrid kernels pushing part of the code out of the kernel into something like \"user land co-processes\" is more then doable, now it's now trivial to retrofit in a performant way and flexible way but possible Mac has somewhat done that (but I don't know the details). On Linux it's also possible, through with BPF a bit of a in-between hybrid (leaving some parts of the drivers in kernel, but as BPF programs which are much less likely to cause such issues compared to \"normal\" drivers). A good example for that is how graphic drivers have developed on Linux, with most code now being in a) the user-land part of the driver and b) on the GPU itself leaving the in kernel part to be mostly just memory management. And the thing is Windows has not enforced such direction, or even pushed hard for it AFIK, and that is something you can very well blame then for. You in general should not have a complicated config file parser in a kernel driver, that's just a terrible idea, some would say negligent and Windows shouldn't have certified drivers like that. (But then given that CrowdStrike insists that it _must_ be loaded on start (outside of recovery mode) I guess it would still have hung all systems even if the parsing would have been outsourced because it can't start if it can't parse it's config). reply traject_ 4 hours agorootparent> And the thing is Windows has not enforced such direction, or even pushed hard for it AFIK, and that is something you can very well blame then for.

Totally not Microsoft's fault, CrowdStrike messed with the kernel, the only thing we can blame Microsoft on is to allow such a software to exist.

Missing a check (or precondition, or validation) is squarely on Microsoft. > always indication of a kernel bug and before but: > blaming microsoft for the crowdstrike bsod is stupid and who owns the kernel in windows land? Microsoft. how is it stupid to blame Microsoft for not making kernel safe? reply mebeim 8 hours agorootparentLet me give you an analogy: Volvo is known to manufacture very safe cars. Now let's say I drive a Volvo car with a box of dynamite on the passenger seat. I stop at a red light but hit the brake a bit too hard and the box of dynamite falls and causes an explosion, disintegrating everything in a 20-foot radius. So whose fault was it? Volvo? > Missing a check (or precondition, or validation) is squarely on Microsoft. Missing a check for presence of dynamite before allowing me to start the car is squarely on Volvo! You see how silly that sounds? Now, back to being serious: MS cannot possibly control and validate everything you decide to install and run on your system, specially if the things you install are kernel drivers. It is simply impossible. If you install a kernel driver developed by a 3rd party company, and that driver crashes your system because the devs at that company forgot to perform proper validation of data, well... that's on them. Even if MS wanted, they wouldn't be able to verify the soundness of any piece of code that is installed as a driver and runs with kernel level privileges. That'd require solving the halting problem. reply Diggsey 8 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft don't own the kernel in that sense: anyone can write kernel drivers for windows... While there are some things that the kernel can do to protect against a bad driver, it's not a security boundary, so ultimately bad code can cause crashes. AIUI, Microsoft actually has good tooling for validating drivers before they are deployed, but it requires that you actually run the validation... reply roblabla 7 hours agorootparentprev@watt there's a big difference here. eBPF is a bytecode that is interpreted in the kernel, with the explicit goal to allow writing code that executes at the kernel-level in a safe way. Any kernel panic (again, short of pid1 kills) is considered a bug, and could even potentially be exploited to gain capabilities in some cases. Here, the kernel explicitly says \"this is safe\", so any problem within is a bug in the kernel. In contrast, a kernel module/driver is just some third-party code that is loaded in the kernel. Here, all bets are off: it is up to the third-party to do their job properly and make sure their code is correct. In this case, CrowdStrike explicitly opted into writing a kernel module, and then failed to, as you say, \"handle their null check\". The segfault wasn't in Windows code, it was in CrowdStrike code that lives in the kernel. Crowdstrike should have handled their nullcheck, failed, and that will lead to a BSOD. To be clear: the only way microsoft could make the kernel safer here is by disallowing kernel modules entirely. While there is an argument to be made that this could be a good idea, it is a bit beside the point. reply yftsui 11 hours agoprevNot surprising at all.

MacOS has the same problem as soon as they're deployed in large corporations. I had a company issued MacBook where a bad printer driver cut the battery life in half for a month or so. reply acdha 7 hours agorootparent> MacOS has the same problem as soon as they're deployed in large corporations. Except where Apple does not allow vendors loose in key places like the kernel. One of the interesting questions here is whether Microsoft could possibly do that: Windows users would be better if the kernel was restricted to first-party code, things like AV used the same kind of interface which macOS has, and third-party code was forced into more moderated channels (malware uses many of the same techniques) – but there’s a security industry with revenue measured in tens of billions of dollars annually who would be running to the regulators if there was anything which could remotely be seen as favoring Defender over their products. I still think it’d be possible but hard enough that I’m not surprised they’ve slowly been letting awareness of the downsides build, especially on the enterprise IT side.

Sometimes you need a huge blowup to remove support for the status quo. reply WorldMaker 4 hours agorootparent> I was wondering whether this debacle might push them to have a roadmap for restricting kernel drivers in favor of the Windows eBPF implementation which has been approaching production grade. Though as this article and its Red Hat respondents admit eBPF isn't a perfect solution either because it is still a somewhat Turing Complete scripting language and bad vendors will find ways to get kernel panics out of eBPF scripts no matter how hardened the eBPF driver gets. Microsoft is probably in a good position to use this debacle to push more vendors to Windows' implementation of eBPF.

I don't even know what their product is supposed to do. As far as I can see, kernel level protection could only help prevent someone bypassing the firewall and trigger an exploit in nginx. But if Crowdstrike knows about such exploits, everyone does, and the firewall or nginx gets patched. What am I missing? Edit: I know it is supposed to implement \"EDR\", but it's always explained in the vaguest of terms. reply Khaine 12 hours agorootparentIt is primarily aimed at workstations, although it does run and is run on servers. The idea is to be able to identify malware based on behaviour, rather than rely on signatures. EDR solutions hook into the kernel to log, and block system calls. They use this information to try and generically identify malware. For example you could detect ransomware by identifying a process that is enumerating a large number of files, reading from those files, and then saving those files. For a SOC, you can also use an EDR to identify files, hashes, connections to given IPs across your fleet of servers. This can allow you to see what devices have been compromised. The EDR can then isolate them, by blocking network syscalls and allow only the SOC to access to investigate and remediate. This is the value they provide (or at least claim to) to a cyber team reply weberer 7 hours agorootparentprevBasically it monitors activity on your computer (process spawning, file changes, etc) and logs them as \"Events\". Then it sends those to their ML models for \"Detection\". And if malware behavior is detected, then they perform a \"Response\" whatever that may be. Probably notifying the user and IT department. reply jabroni_salad 12 hours agorootparentprev> But if Crowdstrike knows about such exploits, everyone does This is actually the most important thing happening with EDR as a concept, it handles novel cases that have never been seen before, with a human review very quickly.

It is super rote and boring. reply p_l 12 hours agorootparentprevThe whole point of those systems is catching actual behaviours, not patching/firewalling per se (though they do some level of permission management on some platforms). For example, patching nginx is not going to help if your user gets phished of an suth token that was explicitly supposed to let them run code on the server - bit catching that the code started browsing files elsewhere and sending data out will help you notice the breach. reply skywhopper 5 hours agorootparentprevIn the ideal case, it logs everything your computer does, every process that's running, every system call they make, every Internet connection made, website visited, etc, and reports it all back to a central data repository that's constantly being scanned for suspicious behavior. But more importantly, when a hack does occur, the security team can go back to that data lake and figure out exactly what happened. In reality, that's way too much data for anyone to make sense of, but giant companies spend tens of millions of dollars per year to deploy all the things so they can say they're doing it. On the other hand, funny things can happen. I got called out by the security team at one job because the EDR agent on my workstation registered that I had put a file on disk that had a malware signature. Well, it turns out that I had checked out the security team's git repo containing malware signatures... But I did get called out in about 20 minutes by a random security engineer I'd never met who told me the exact path on my PC where the file was. Is that a good thing?

If the crypto miner wasn't something very dumb, it would not be detected. And I can scan a network using nmap with an XML or grepable output format options. CrowdStrike doesn't remove threats.

A particularly extreme example, to the point that it almost read as parody; when the door plug blew out of that 737, there was a certain amount of fixation by the weirdos on Twitter on how the pilot was a woman.

It's new because, 10-20 years ago in America at least, it finally became extremely unfashionable to utter blatantly racist stuff in public, to the point where it cost you your friends and maybe your job, depending on who heard it.

You don't see people blaming Microsoft's cock-ups on Indians who are not DEI hires but would be a valid target for racists. I think blaming DEI hires for problems is mostly people who don't like the idea of hiring based on race/gender/etc. and who also realize that if you do that hard enough, you're bound to get inferior people because you're limiting your hiring pool. Of course companies that pay low salaries are also limiting their hiring pool and also bound to get inferior people.

In cybersecurity, the talent pool is so small you can't even pick and choose like that even if you wanted to. reply notepad0x90 2 hours agorootparentprevI disagree, it is 100% racism. See, you're talking about DEI and it's merits instead of how in this context there is no reason to even bring up DEI. The point of me mentioning this is for people like you who think they just disagree with DEI, that isn't the case. The far right is using \"DEI\" to mean n-word just like they did with the whole \"woke\" thing. Look at Kamala Harris, and how they're calling her a DEI VP/nominee or the USSS chief being a woman and them saying it's because of \"DEI\", and look at the post history of the people that are saying this and then tell me they are not racists substituting n-word or any other \"you know what I really mean\" slurs with \"DEI\". Imagine if any minority or woman was involved in any crowdstrike team that had anything to do with this outage and consider how the DEI debate is being raised in that context. If those people are hired, does it make them a DEI hire by default? of course not! that is silly, that's not even what DEI is. It is a slur in this context, nothing short of it. I wouldn't be saying this if DEI was in any way relevant to the topic at hand, then we can discuss how DEI was to blame. Honestly, I don't even agree with the corporate approach of DEI, but bringing it up in this context would indeed be racism. Imagine making a mistake and someone say \"this is what you get for allowing white privilege\" is that fair? is that not racism? that's what's happening here.

Even if Crowdstrike wrote their drivers as an interpreter and the data update files were actually programs in some p-code, Microsoft would have definitely known of it and its inherent vulnerabilities.

I would have thought they would sync such an action with other measures for maximum impact. > You have to take a all-in-all broader view. That is always wise. Can you tell us more? In particular could you spell out how the Kaspersky ban factors in here in your opinion? > As for your opening statement \"Some part of a company already aware of an issue but different part still ships is a pretty common tale\" is not applicable here since this code runs in kernel mode (in both OSes) and thus would be subject to far far greater scrutiny and testing than an ordinary app. Are you saying that this scrutiny is somehow enough to overcome companies natural tendency to be disparate and unorganised? reply rramadass 8 hours agorootparent> But i just don’t see how those state actors would benefit from this. You should never stop at obvious/superficial explanations but look at all scenarios (i.e. Game Theory probabilities) including \"false flag\" operations. Eg. a) What might have happened elsewhere when the world's attention was focused on this one incident? Did we miss something of greater importance? b) Was this a dry run/false flag to get businesses to tighten their cyber defences because somebody knows something about what might be forthcoming? c) The Russia/Ukraine war seems to be entering a critical phase with increasing incidents across NATO countries; see https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-... etc. etc. At the minimum there has already been billions in damage and counting; one Australian report - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YedowOtznNo > how the Kaspersky ban factors in here in your opinion? Because this is very recent news; see https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-div... Is somebody flexing their attack capabilities just to demonstrate they can do it without Kaspersky? Also the US govt. has specifically banned \"updating of malware signatures\" in Kaspersky software which was exactly the vector used with Crowdstrike. > Are you saying that this scrutiny is somehow enough to overcome companies natural tendency to be disparate and unorganised? Yes. Companies do not treat kernel mode code with the same laissez-faire attitude that they might take with user mode apps. In particular, Microsoft has the most experience with this given their long history/evolution/problems and sheer number of installations. That they would allow some third-party software to bypass their testing/certifications is unbelievable to me. I am sure they would have also done some formal verifications on this as well. Remember Crowdstrike was meant to help prevent zero-day vulnerabilities and hence they would have looked at it closely. When certain things happen at a global scale, you have to take a global view, factor in parameters like Geopolitical tensions, Economic advantages/disadvantages, Propaganda, etc. and simulate all possible scenarios one by one w.r.t. all parameters. Remember Clausewitz, “War is not merely a political act but a real political instrument, a continuation of political intercourse, a carrying out of the same by other means”. Also Sun Tzu, “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.” Finally, you might find the classic Deception - The Invisible War Between the KGB and the CIA by Edward Jay Epstein very relevant here - https://archive.org/details/Deception-TheInvisibleWarBetween... \"Deception\" is the foundation for everything and \"Asymmetric Warfare (Cyber and others)\" is the name of the game today. reply logicchains 12 hours agorootparentprev>After all, who exactly would benefit from such a nefarious scheme to crash windows computers? Russia or China would certainly benefit from the ability to do this at a time of their choosing, and it's possible they could have an agent inside Crowdstrike, especially given China's history of industrial espionage. reply tgv 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] Wrt trying to get something out of the crash: https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/19/cyber_criminals_quick.... The conspiracy-minded could be suspicious of the quick response to this outage. \"They must have known in advance!\" Or they could suspect an overeager account manager at Crowdstrike, who wanted to show how important the product is. But indeed, this really sounds like it was an internal error. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
