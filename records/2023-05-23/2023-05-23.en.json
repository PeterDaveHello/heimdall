    "hn_content": "A conversation on a Hacker News post regarding memory allocation and coalescing recalls a bug with Delphi 7's memory allocator and how it caused cryptic errors due to Windows locking the entire allocation's VAD entry and an out-of-memory error in the kernel, resulting in bizarre errors further up in the stack trace. It took roughly a day, with a VM and kernel debugger attached to track down the cause of the issue. The conversation also discusses debugging with KDNET and connects to a virtual machine via named pipes. A discussion on how Microsoft Windows handled messages further adds additional context.The article discusses memory allocation in operating systems, particularly in Windows. It covers topics such as buddy allocators, slab allocators, and thread-local storage, as well as the handling of memory allocation in Win16 and Win32. The article argues that Windows, particularly in its earlier versions, was more like an actor system than a process-oriented system, with windows acting as actors. The article also touches on the complexities of memory ownership and management in cross-language FFI API calls. The author is praised for their clear and concise writing style and the interactive format they use to present information.The post discusses memory allocation and ownership concepts, with contributors sharing helpful advice on how to optimize memory allocation and deal with memory leaks. The post presents several interactive diagrams to help readers visualize the allocation process and ownership concepts. Contributors suggest using arena allocators for speedier and efficient memory allocation, and techniques like reference counting to manage ownership. There is also discussion regarding the benefits of short-lived programs that do not free up memory. While the latter approach can work for certain types of applications like web servers, it still requires some allocation and deallocation of memory, in some form, to manage program and channel memory.The article discusses memory allocation and how it works with malloc/free in C, with an interactive playground for readers to fiddle with malloc implementations. The article warns about ambiguities, as memory mapping is optional and malloc/free implementations vary. The post does not seek to tell readers exactly how malloc/free works on any given system. The article has illustrations to help understand further and gives examples of how allocating blocks can lead to inefficiencies. The article also explains the principles behind garbage collection. A commenter suggested highlighting specific malloc calls in the interactive playground to make it clearer. Finally, the article proposes using custom memory allocation for applications like game engines, robotics, embedded systems, AI/Deep learning/Reinforcement Learning/PyTorch, and CUDA/GPGPU.A post on memory allocation techniques in C programming, using interactive visuals to explain concepts such as first-fit and best-fit allocation algorithms. The post, which is written in a user-friendly style, offers insights into malloc implementations like phkmalloc and tcmalloc, and provides readers with a solid understanding of how to effectively allocate and manage memory in C programs. Suggestions are made by a reader for further posts on related topics such as garbage collection or stack allocation.",

    "content": "Engineers Need Art ProjectsSame Stop21 May 2023I retired a year and a half ago after having worked for twenty-six years as a programmer for Apple. I\u2019m not sure which would have been more surprising: if I had continued programming in my spare time after I had retired or if I never programmed again.I suppose most people would not be surprised by, perhaps might expect the latter to be the case \u2014 might expect that I would hang up the keyboard after I retire in the same way we expect that a retired doctor probably stops performing surgeries and begins to spend more time on the golf course.In fact right after retirement there was a sense of relief that I would never again have to step through code trying to determine why a dispatch to a background thread never completed. No longer would I have to worry about completely screwing up the project repo because of my misadventures with git.The respite from programming though lasted maybe about four months after retiring. I started a small project , in part to learn Python, in part to play with e-ink displays. I was back programming (back abusing git) but of course the pressure was off. It both was and wasn\u2019t like the day job I had left behind.I should mention though that before my twenty-six years at Apple, I had originally been writing shareware games for fun and, a few years after that, a few commercial games for a living. Since programming had initially been a kind of hobby to me it is probably less surprising then that I would eventually return to writing code.I am not sure though if this is still the case for software engineers. Are there younger engineers, new to the career, for whom programming is not merely a job but something they can imagine doing in their spare time? I think I met a few as I was winding down my career. I do feel though that back around 1988 or so when I started getting serious into programming that all fellow programmers I met were also doing it with a kind of passion. How is it you can love a machine?I dabbled with writing a game in Javascript after my Python foray. And then roughly a year after I retired I went back to Python to write an application this time.But this year, 2023, I find myself suddenly on a kind of tear. Though I eventually began programming again, in the first fourteen months of retirement I did all manner of other things in my spare time as well. I kept also-busy with woodworking projects, experiments learning Blender and 3D printing, bike riding \u2014 just to name a few. But somehow this year I have found myself tipping head-long back into full-time programming. It is distinctly reminding me of my sleepless days spent writing shareware games for the Macintosh thirty-five years ago.I\u2019m not sure if that is a good thing. I am back to coding late into the night, and back at it after coffee and an English muffin the following morning (thankfully though I quit the cigarettes decades ago). Programming is beginning again to be to the exclusion of all else in my life. (The table saw sits slowly rusting. The bike hangs on the wall in the garage.)And just to further complete the circle, it's not Javascript or Python (or Swift) that is calling to me, but my old nemesis C. And further, I have this desire to revisit/rewrite some of the shareware games that I wrote over three decades ago.What am I trying to say? I have a programming addiction? (Maybe.)From here I could go into detail on any number of things: working for Apple in the 90\u2019s vs. working for Apple post-iPhone, why something that others would consider a job (programming) some do for fun, why game authoring appeals to both sides of the brain.I guess at this moment though I am simply marveling at having hopped off the career train only to find I have come full circle \u2014 somehow got off at the same stop where I got on. Perhaps I can talk about some of those other things in the future.Laughably, I\u2019m reminded of the last MST3K episode where Mike and the \u2018bots finally get back to Earth only to plop down in front of a TV to watch \u201cThe Crawling Eye\u201d, one of the first films they riffed a decade earlier.Or maybe I\u2019m just an old guy looking back and romanticizing the early days. I\u2019m back to coding in C again, writing little inconsequential games to amuse myself. Or maybe there was something a little magical then. Simpler times?Lets be clear, I\u2019m not back coding on a Mac Plus with a floppy drive, habitually hitting command-S to save my progress every few minutes \u2014 no dial-up modem (ha ha, no land line). I comb through StackOverflow like everyone else trying to figure out why toggling fullscreen mode trashes the SDL_Textures I marked as targetable. (Right?)But there is something becoming more familiar to me as I go back to the wild west of C programming (where very little happens behind the scenes I might point out - no garbage collection here!). And so why not rewrite some familiar little games as well?",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News thread discusses the difficulty of finding flow state as a software developer, particularly as one gets older and life becomes more complex. One commenter notes their inability to focus when life outside of work is not orderly, while another suggests that burnout and stress can be addressed through mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga. Others speculate on how changing demands on the job may make prolonged focus less feasible compared to past decades in tech. Commenters also offer advice on finding new hobbies or seeking out inspiration to revitalize focus.Developers discuss the pros and cons of moving into managerial positions, with some expressing a preference for coding while others find satisfaction in managing people. Some argue that a good manager should have a messy personal life, while others find that having a life outside of work makes them better managers. Many agree that programming can be addictive and that they would rather spend their time creating software than doing other things, but others feel that balance is important. Some express frustration with managers who offer unhelpful technical advice, but acknowledge the importance of good managers.The post discusses the importance of good management in software engineering scenarios. It presents an example of a bad manager who fails to understand the required context and leads to wasted time and missed opportunities. In contrast, a good manager aligns with leadership and ensures that engineers understand the goals and work to achieve them effectively. The discussion also includes anecdotes relevant to the topic, including the rarity of good leadership and technical leads, the importance of enjoying programming as a hobby, and the difficulties faced by programmers moving into management roles. Lastly, the post suggests that, in some cases, freelancing can avoid the pressures of moving into a management role.An article on Hacker News discusses the decision for experienced software developers to remain in an individual contributor (IC) role, rather than pursuing management positions. Some argue that as a real freelancer, being in multiple short gigs at the same time already involves half of a management position. However, as a contractor, one can usually avoid management duties to some extent and focus on coding. Some people refuse to share their experience with others and prefer to sit alone writing code. However, senior engineers can provide guidance for teams to stay focused on what is important, meaning the fastest and easiest code to maintain is code that does not have to be written in the first place. In some companies, there is pressure on employees to always move upward, and those who don't are \"managed out.\"A discussion on the role of performance reviews in the workplace and how they can be influenced by personal feelings rather than objective work output. It is suggested that a lighthearted joke from a director can be power-talk that implies more than intended and that appearing tired or unkempt in the office can be a big no-no. Some individuals express a preference for programming as a hobby rather than a profession, finding modern development to be too far removed from the machine and lacking in emphasis on performance optimization. However, there is a renaissance in Rust where many people are drawn to the efficiency and lack of a garbage collector.The post discusses the shift towards high-level programming and has a debate on whether low-level programming is still useful or not. There is a discussion on the importance of understanding how floats are stored in memory and its implications. Some argue that high-level programming is more satisfying and efficient, while others advocate for low-level programming as a necessary skill for debugging and mastering the machine. The post also touches upon the dynamic of software development, with some being concerned about the growing reliance on packages and dependencies. Overall, there is a sense of nostalgia for the time when programming was more focused on writing low-level code and understanding the machine.People in the programming industry enter because of a passion for solving logical problems and the sense of satisfaction from building something. Some people enter the industry purely for monetary reasons. Younger generations still view programming as a fun activity, and people can enjoy it as a hobby outside of their professional work. Programming changes in a professional context, where the purpose is dictated by larger societal patterns of supply, demand, and organizational structures. People who still love programming after many years in the industry are treasured. Slack and other tools can be distracting, but it is up to the individual to control their own level of focus.The post is a series of comments discussing the passion for programming in the current industry compared to the past, retirement, and working for companies with like-minded colleagues. Some believe that passionate programmers are becoming rarer in the industry, while others argue that the programming passion wanes with age and other interests. There is a suggestion for retired programmers to get into the maker world and enjoy embedded programming. Niche languages can filter for passionate programmers, and startups are the place to be for those who want to code a lot. The sentiment that work does not have to be one's passion is gaining acceptance among millennials. Smaller companies are often where passionate programmers thrive, while large corporations can be less inspiring in terms of software work.Software engineers discuss their passion for programming and frustrations with corporate environments. LeetCode and other coding challenges are praised for their pure problem-solving aspect, but the interview process is criticized for valuing algorithmic skills over other important qualities in a candidate. Some engineers who only program at work feel perfectly satisfied, while others prefer to pursue programming as a hobby as well. Many express a desire to work with people who are passionate about programming and constantly improving their skills. The use of formal methods in engineering is debated, as some believe it could benefit some code but others feel that forcing every engineer to learn the necessary math would be problematic. The stability and longevity of a career in software engineering is discussed, with some expressing concerns about its potential for degrowth and uncertainty.Many programmers view programming as a career rather than just a starting job and may develop a clock-in/clock-out mentality. The high salaries and portrayal of a luxurious \"software dev lifestyle\" have led many people to pursue programming as a profession when it may not be their true passion. While some do enjoy programming as a hobby and a career, others see programming as a boring, repetitive job, especially if they are not working on projects that interest them. There are many other roles within the software industry, such as quality assurance and management, that do not involve programming. People should not feel pressured to turn their programming hobby into a career if it is not something they truly enjoy. The love of machines and the code that runs on them is a unique passion that not everyone shares.A thread on Hacker News discusses the relationship between passion and productivity in software development. Some argue that treating programming as a job rather than a passion can lead to effective and efficient solutions. Others lament the loss of enthusiasm that comes from turning a hobby into work, and blame external factors like management and the tech industry's obsession with growth for driving away passionate programmers. Regardless of which side of the argument they take, many commenters express disillusionment with the tech industry's current state, questioning its impact on society and wondering what there is to enjoy about software development anymore.",

    "hn_content": "Meta has been fined $1.3 billion for transferring data to the US, violating EU data protection laws. Many argue that this action is long overdue and that tech regulation needs to happen. The EU is setting a new standard for data protection and privacy laws that other nations may have to follow if they want to do business in the EU. However, some comments suggest that this case highlights a more fundamental issue: how to govern global issues without a global government. The US law allowing the government to force companies to disclose private data is the central problem. Data processing should not be limited by geographical boundaries, and there needs to be a verifiable processing package that ensures data can be processed wherever and still meet regulations. The EU has strong privacy protections, but privacy is taken seriously in many countries, although these countries are not as vocal as the EU.The article discusses how regulations enforcing the EU's privacy concerns can overly burden small businesses in different countries, even beyond the EU. Commentators express both support and cynicism towards the enforcement of privacy regulations on Meta and Google. The conversation leads to musings about potential global governance.The text contains a conversation thread on topics such as global governance, data privacy, and international laws. Some comments were laced with sarcasm, while others discussed legal technicalities. Overall, the text provides a glimpse of ongoing discussions and debates in the tech industry. The most significant point to take away from this is that people should be aware of the complexities surrounding data management and international laws. It is essential to emphasize that there is no one right solution, and each situation requires nuanced consideration. As such, people should stay informed and participate in the conversation to help shape policies that impact their lives.Meta's potential shutdown of its Irish subsidiary to avoid the \u20ac1.3 billion fine imposed by the Irish data protection authority could be complicated as it handles its EU business through the subsidiary. The cost and effort to re-architect the system and set up additional data centers in Europe to comply with EU regulations far outweigh the proposed fine. The EU and the US are expected to ratify a new data framework within a year that could make EU-US transfers possible again under new guidelines, but this may still be struck down. Meanwhile, preventing data from contaminating or coming into contact with both US and European operations is unrealistic as there will always be some point of contact. Facebook has previously faced concerns about privacy from the public, with critics pointing to the need for greater data privacy regulations to avoid abuse.The post features a discussion on data privacy and how it affects online platforms and users. There are differing opinions on the length and complexity of terms and conditions and pop-up notifications seeking consent. There is a concern about misinformation about these issues. The EU has stricter regulations on data privacy, and there is a discussion about the potential impact of TikTok and other social media and tech platforms on EU citizens. There is also a mention of the possibility of trade wars between the US and EU. Finally, there is a debate about the level of defense spending by NATO countries and the role of the US as a military ally.A discussion on the \"both sides the same\" rhetoric in American politics discouraging action, with the implication that certain people benefit from inaction. \n\nA comment that voting history shows that \"both sides are OBJECTIVELY not the same,\" which is important for people to keep in mind. \n\nDebate about various voting laws that have an impact on voters in different areas compared to others, which is a different topic than the previous \"both sides the same\" point. \n\nArgument for using direct democracy at the state level to replace single-member FPTP systems with proportional systems to create multiparty democracy. \n\nA conversation about the EU's regulation of Meta/Facebook in relation to privacy laws and business practices. \n\nExplanation of how GDPR laws similar to the EU's are becoming popular in other countries. \n\nDiscussion of what types of data Facebook collects about users beyond what is shared on their profiles.The European Union imposed a \u20ac150 million ($170 million) fine on Facebook's parent company, Meta, for violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The fine stems from Facebook's practices of sharing European user data with the US, where data protection laws are weaker than those in the EU. The GDPR can impose fines of up to 4% of a company's global revenue, but this fine amounts to just 1.1% of Meta's $116 billion annual income. The low fine has drawn criticism, with some saying that it is much lower than what would be imposed on individual citizens and sends the wrong message to companies who can afford to pay the fines as a \u2018cost of business\u2019.Social media giant Meta has been fined \u20ac400m by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for breach of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has been accused of not providing enough transparency around the collection and use of user data, including targeted advertising practices. The fine comes amid growing concerns about big technology companies' handling of data, privacy and user trust. The fine is 4% of Meta's annual revenue from the previous year, the maximum penalty allowed under GDPR, and marks the largest fine ever imposed under GDPR. Despite the hefty fine, some critics argue that the cost is just an additional expense for doing business and that the signal to other corporations is that they can continue to misuse user privacy and data as long as they conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis.",

    "hn_content": "Meta AI, a research team from Facebook, has announced the release of a multilingual model for speech recognition and natural language processing that can cover 1000+ languages. The model is compatible with languages from various language families, and is touted to be a promising aspect towards achieving universal understanding. Speech recognition, text-to-speech and translation models are available for download. Visualizations of the distribution of languages and translations are available through GitHub. It is still not a literal Babel fish since the model does not perform speaker-specific fine-tuning. While buying a dedicated GPU to experiment withe would be viable, they could also rent GPUs on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Vast.Facebook AI released a new multilingual speech recognition model called the Universal Speech Model (USM) that can recognize speech in 80 languages. However, the raw text comments accompanying the post on Hacker News primarily focused on discussions around storing data in databases versus files, best GPUs for AI models, and frustrations with reading PDFs on mobile devices. Many commenters highlighted the need for more accessible documentation and demos to showcase the capabilities of these models, rather than just providing downloads with additional dependencies.Facebook AI Research has released its massively multilingual speech recognition model (MMS) built on top of wav2vec 2.0, the leading speech recognition model. The MMS can recognize 4,000 languages with minimal tweaking and requires a fraction of the data corpus used by other models. Facebook used Christian religious texts for languages with little existing data in more extensive corpora. Although there has been some criticism regarding its efficacy on the English language, FacebookMeta has released a new text-to-speech (TTS) model, called Multilingual Melodic Speech (MMS) on GitHub. MMS can read out loud in up to 60 languages, including some of the lesser-known ones like Klingon and Esperanto. The code is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. However, there is a debate in the comments about whether the models are copyrightable or patentable. Additionally, there are questions about the hardware required to run MMS and whether it is possible to fine-tune the models for specific use cases. There is also some criticism of OpenAI's recent move toward closed-source software and calls for more public funding for open-source technology. The post also includes a few random comments about layoffs at Meta, translating movies, and using Esperanto for programming.Meta's MMS does not support American Sign Language (ASE) as it lacks a written code, so a written version must be developed. SignWriting offers a solution as it is already in the Unicode standard, but Meta has limited textual encoding data to work with as SignWriting is experimental and lacks a corpus to train on. Most hard-of-hearing individuals prefer other communication methods to SignWriting, which requires further research and development for MMS to support ASE. It's important to be mindful of appropriate language and terminology when referring to individuals with hearing impairments.",

    "hn_content": "HP Instant Ink users who cancel their subscriptions or whose subscriptions expire cannot use the ink, according to a post on  Hacker News. The printers will become unable to print if there have been subscription changes. An important point of controversy is that HP Instant Ink's terms mean users  lease  ink, rather than owning it. This restricts alternatives, including non-HP ink cartridges. One response to the forum post suggested that allowing users to continue to use ink would enable workarounds such as subscribing for one month at a time to refill a cartridge before cancelling. HP also rejects third-party cartridges, which had commenters asking why this should be legal.HP's 'Instant Ink' subscription service has received criticism for the company's refusal to allow continued use of partially full ink cartridges after the subscription has ended. Customers pay a monthly fee based on their printing needs, but following the end of a subscription, HP will remotely lock ink cartridges, preventing their use. This has led to accusations of wastefulness, with one comment on a discussion thread arguing that \"if the business doesn\u2019t work without trashing perfectly good ink it shouldn\u2019t be a business.\" Some have also criticised HP's rejection of third-party cartridges, though this has been defended by others who note the complexity of ink chemistry, as well as some positive aspects of the Instant Ink deal, including shipping and recycling.HP's Instant Ink subscription service charges users based on the number of pages they print, rather than the amount of ink they use. While some users find it convenient, others feel it's a way for HP to force them to buy more ink and is a scummy practice. One user's experience with the subscription service resulted in HP remotely disabling their printer after running out of subscription pages, despite having physical ink cartridges left in the machine. Many users recommend Brother's laser printer as a more reliable and cost-effective option, and some have been using their Brother printers for over a decade with little to no issues.HP's Instant Ink subscription service bills per page and includes a certain number of pages in the monthly cost. Consumers are given the option to buy cartridges outright without limits but many appear to appreciate the service. However, there is ambiguity in the marketing, as it is called an \"ink subscription\" when it is really a printed page subscription. Cancelling a subscription shortly after receiving a new cartridge can result in a dilemma of returning the cartridge, being charged for the rest of the cartridge as a cancellation fee, or preventing the user from using the cartridge. HP should label the subscription as a \"Print Subscription\" instead and make sure consumers understand they are subscribing to a printing plan based on detailed pages. The cost-per-page is competitively priced but the issue of clients receiving full cartridges but only using half of the ink compounds the existing problem of ink drying in cartridges.HP's Instant Ink service provides a subscription-based plan where users explicitly pay per page and not for ink. Users of the service receive benefits in exchange for their payment, but those benefits end if the subscription is cancelled. The pricing for printing subscriptions can vary based on the number of pages. This service is comparable to a Netflix-style plan where users pay for unlimited cartridges while subscribed. HP Instant Ink is transparent about its pricing per page and users are advised that it won't be a conventional ink cartridge subscription service. The subscription is more affordable for people with low printing volumes. Users are also advised to purchase store-bought cartridges once their subscription is over.Customers are upset with HP's Instant Ink program because the company remotely disabled their printers after the subscription ended, rendering them useless despite owning the printer. Customers are arguing that this practice is deceptive, and that HP should clearly advertise that printers are leased and will become bricks if people ever sign up for the Instant Ink service and then cancel. Customers are advising one another to purchase EcoTank or similar printers that do not require leasing or subscription fees. Several commenters recommended laser printers, as they tend to be cheaper on a per-page basis than inkjet printers and are less prone to clogging issues.The conversation revolves around the issues of inkjet printers, specifically those that use tanks that can be filled up and cheaper per page. These printers still face the same issue of dried print heads and hard-coded limits on the number of pages one can print. The cost-per-page for a personal printer is higher than most people estimate; print services can offer better quality and specialized printing. Users should be wary of subscription-based printers, which require internet connection and Original HP Ink Cartridges. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the idea that home printing may not be as valuable as one might think.Discussion on HN about HP's ink subscription program Instant Ink, and whether or not it's a good deal. Some argue that buying a printer is unnecessary when there are plenty of places to print documents and photos, while others defend the convenience of having a printer at home. The topic of printer manufacturers' practices and whether they engage in anti-consumer behavior also arises. Some users recommend Brother printers because of their reliability, while others caution against making purchasing decisions based solely on consumer awareness campaigns. Overall, there is debate on the merits of subscription models and whether or not they are advantageous for the consumer.- A debate about whether it should be legal to prevent subscription customers from using ink cartridges after they stop paying for the service.\n- The concern about environmental impact is one factor in the argument, but not the only one.\n- The distinction between paying for ink and paying for printed pages must be understood - customers never owned the ink cartridges, only rented them.\n- No significant new tech developments or releases discussed in this post.\n- YC Summer 2023 applications are currently open.",

The proposed law would require tech companies to scan their platforms, including users\u2019 private messages, to find illegal material. However, the proposal from Ylva Johansson, the EU commissioner in charge of home affairs, has drawn ire from cryptographers, technologists, and privacy advocates for its potential impact on end-to-end encryption.For years, EU states have debated whether end-to-end encrypted communication platforms, such as WhatsApp and Signal, should be protected as a way for Europeans to exercise a fundamental right to privacy\u2014or weakened to keep criminals from being able to communicate outside the reach of law enforcement. Experts who reviewed the document at WIRED\u2019s request say it provides important insight into which EU countries plan to support a proposal that threatens to reshape encryption and the future of online privacy.Of the 20 EU countries represented in the document leaked to WIRED, the majority said they are in favor of some form of scanning of encrypted messages, with Spain\u2019s position emerging as the most extreme. \u201cIdeally, in our view, it would be desirable to legislatively prevent EU-based service providers from implementing end-to-end encryption,\u201d Spanish representatives said in the document.The source of the document declined to comment and requested anonymity because they were not authorized to share it.\u201cIt is shocking to me to see Spain state outright that there should be legislation prohibiting EU-based service providers from implementing end-to-end encryption,\u201d says Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at Stanford University\u2019s Internet Observatory in California who reviewed the document at WIRED\u2019s request. \u201cThis document has many of the hallmarks of the eternal debate over encryption.\u201dEnd-to-end encryption is designed so only the sender and receiver of communications like messages can see their contents. This boxes out all other parties, from scammers to police and even the company providing the digital platform. Law enforcement advocates often propose creating technical mechanisms through which end-to-end encryption can be bypassed for investigations, but cryptographers and other technologists have long argued that this would introduce weaknesses that inherently undermine end-to-end encryption, putting users\u2019 privacy at risk. Furthermore, they have repeatedly concluded that this expanded exposure would ultimately hurt the digital safety and security of vulnerable groups, including children, rather than defend them.\"Breaking end-to-end encryption for everyone would not only be disproportionate, it would be ineffective of achieving the goal to protect children,\u201d says Iverna McGowan, the secretary general of the European branch of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, a digital rights nonprofit organization, who reviewed the document at WIRED\u2019s request.MOST POPULARBUSINESSTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Is Teetering on the Glass CliffVITTORIA ELLIOTTGEARThe Best Nintendo Switch Games for Every Kind of PlayerWIRED STAFFCULTUREThe 15 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowJENNIFER M.

Dated April 12, 2023, the document contains 20 countries\u2019 views on a series of questions, including whether they see end-to-end encryption as a hindrance to their work dealing with child sexual abuse and whether they would favor adding wording to the law to stipulate that encryption shouldn\u2019t be weakened. The questions were first posed in January.WIRED asked all 20 member states whose views are included in the document for comment. None denied its veracity, and Estonia confirmed that its position was compiled by experts working within related fields and at various ministries.The document reveals strong support for Johansson\u2019s proposal to scan private end-to-end encrypted communications for illegal content. Of the 20 countries included in the document, 15 expressed support for the idea of scanning end-to-end encrypted communications for CSAM. Many framed this type of scanning as a vital tool that would enable authorities to win the fight against child abuse.\u201cIt is of utmost importance to provide clear wording in the CSA Regulation that end-to-end encryption is not a reason not to report CSA material,\u201d Croatia\u2019s representatives said in the document. \u201cDetection orders must necessarily also apply to encrypted networks,\u201d Slovenia said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want E2EE encryption to become a \u2018safe haven\u2019 for malicious actors,\u201d Romania added.Denmark and Ireland expressed support for scanning encrypted messengers for child sexual abuse material while also endorsing the inclusion of wording in the law that protects end-to-end encryption from being weakened. The ability to do this would rely on the invention of technology that can scan encrypted messages for illegal content without altering or breaking the security features offered by encryption\u2014a feat cryptographers and cybersecurity experts have said is technically impossible.The Netherlands, however, stated that this would be possible through \u201con-device\u201d scanning before the illegal material is encrypted and sent to its recipient. \u201cThere are \u2026 technologies which may allow for automatic detection of CSAM while at the same time leaving end-to-end encryption intact,\u201d the country\u2019s representatives stated in the document.\u201cThey want to keep the security of encryption whilst being able to circumvent it,\u201d says Ella Jakubowska, a senior policy advisor at European Digital Rights (EDRI). Jakubowska says she is \u201cunsurprised but nevertheless shocked\u201d to see that European countries have a \u201creally shallow understanding\u201d of encryption. \u201cThey want privacy but they also want to indiscriminately scan encrypted communications,\u201d Jakubowska says.In its response, Spain said it is \u201cimperative that we have access to the data\u201d and suggests that it should be possible for encrypted communications to be decrypted. Spain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, has been outspoken about what he considers the threat posted by encryption. When reached for comment about the leaked document, Daniel Campos de Diego, a spokesperson for Spain\u2019s Ministry of Interior, says the country\u2019s position on this matter is widely known and has been publicly disseminated on several occasions. Edging close to Spain, Poland advocated in the leaked document for mechanisms through which encryption could be lifted by court order and for parents to have the power to decrypt children\u2019s communications.MOST POPULARBUSINESSTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Is Teetering on the Glass CliffVITTORIA ELLIOTTGEARThe Best Nintendo Switch Games for Every Kind of PlayerWIRED STAFFCULTUREThe 15 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowJENNIFER M. WOODGEARTake Your Ultrawide Monitors Everywhere With an AR LaptopBRENDA STOLYARJakubowska, who reviewed the document, says that several countries appear to say they would give police access to people\u2019s encrypted messages and communications. Comments from Cyprus, for example, say it is \u201cnecessary\u201d that law enforcement authorities have the ability to access encrypted communications to investigate online sexual abuse crimes and that the \u201cimpact of this regulation is significant because it will set a precedent for other sectors in the future.\u201d Similarly, officials in Hungary say \u201cnew methods of data interception and access are needed\u201d to help law enforcement.\u201cCyprus, Hungary, and Spain very clearly see this law as their opportunity to get inside encryption to undermine encrypted communications, and that to me is huge,\u201d Jakubowska says. \u201cThey are seeing this law is going far beyond what DG home is claiming that it\u2019s there for.\u201dOfficials in Belgium said in the document that they believe in the motto \u201csecurity through encryption and despite encryption.\u201d When approached by WIRED, a spokesperson from Belgium\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs initially shared a statement from the country\u2019s federal police saying its position has evolved since it submitted comments for the document and that Belgium is adopting a position, alongside other \u201clike-minded states,\u201d that it wants encryption weakened. However, half an hour later, the spokesperson attempted to retract the statement, saying the country declined to comment.Security experts have long said that any potential backdoors into encrypted communications or ways to decrypt services would undermine the overall security of the encryption. If law enforcement officials have a way to decipher messages, criminal hackers or those working on behalf of governments could exploit the same capabilities.Despite the potential attack on encryption from some countries, many nations also appeared to strongly support end-to-end encryption and the protections it provides. Italy described the proposal for a new system as disproportionate. \u201cIt would represent a generalized control on all the encrypted correspondence sent through the web,\u201d the country\u2019s representatives said. Estonia cautioned that if the EU mandates the scanning of end-to-end encrypted messages, companies are likely to either redesign their systems so they can decrypt data or shut down in the EU. Triin Oppi, a spokesperson for Estonia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, says the country\u2019s position had not changed.Finland urged the EU Commission to provide more information about the technologies that can fight child sexual abuse without jeopardizing online security and warned that the proposal could conflict with the Finnish constitution.Representatives from Germany\u2014a country that has staunchly opposed the proposal\u2014said the draft law needs to explicitly state that no technologies will be used that disrupt, circumvent, or modify encryption. \u201cThis means that the draft text must be revised before Germany can accept it,\u201d the country said. Member states need to agree on the text for the draft bill before the negotiations can move forward.\u201cThe responses from countries such as Finland, Estonia, and Germany demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the stakes in the CSA regulation discussions,\u201d Stanford\u2019s Pfefferkorn says. \u201cThe regulation will not only affect criminal investigations for a specific set of offenses; it affects governments\u2019 own data security, national security, and the privacy and data protection rights of their citizens, as well as innovation and economic development.\u201dMOST POPULARBUSINESSTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino Is Teetering on the Glass CliffVITTORIA ELLIOTTGEARThe Best Nintendo Switch Games for Every Kind of PlayerWIRED STAFFCULTUREThe 15 Best Shows on HBO Max Right NowJENNIFER M.

    "hn_content": "Spain is reportedly planning to ban end-to-end encryption, according to a leaked government document. The discussion in the Hacker News thread focuses on the contentious topic of politicians' corruption and the need for transparency and privacy. Participants argue that while the corrupt behavior of politicians is a problem, fully removing privacy rights is not the solution. Meanwhile, arguments for one-party consent laws for recording conversations, as well as a focus on government officials' lack of privacy, are also debated. However, without more information on Spain's policy and reasoning behind the proposal, the thread remains speculative.The post discusses the issue of one-party consent in recording conversations and the potential implications for privacy. Supporters of one-party consent argue that it can defend against false allegations, but opponents raise concerns about privacy, authenticity, speech weaponization, limited utility, accountability, harassment, and third-party recording. Some states permit one-party consent, while others may require two-party consent or impose restrictions on recording. The discussion also touches on the topic of politicians' privacy and transparency, with some advocating for more openness and others emphasizing the need for confidentiality in specific situations. However, the debate around privacy and transparency is subject to changing cultural and political norms and may reflect broader societal trends, such as the current focus on LGBTQ rights and religious freedom.The discussion revolves around the topic of banning books in schools in the US and its potential impact on free speech and education. Participants argue for and against the banning of books, with some suggesting that students should have access to all literature while others suggest that certain materials may be inappropriate given their age or that of other students. Some participants also question whether banning books is a sign of a strong or weak society, and whether parents have the right to decide what their children are exposed to in a public school setting. The discussion also touches on other topics such as the separation of church and state, LGBTQ issues, and the politics of book banning.The conversation began with a comment about censorship of books with LGBTQ content in schools. The list of the most challenged books in 2022 was shared, and the discussion revolved around whether this content should be banned. The conversation then shifted to a discussion about encryption and a potential ban on it. Some argued that encryption is necessary for individual privacy and to prevent abuse by those in power, while others argued that it can be used to hide nefarious activities. The conversation also touched on the limitations of judges' knowledge of technology and how laws can be used to justify the actions of those in power in authoritarian regimes.Spain's government proposal to ban end-to-end encryption endangers privacy rights, and critics argue it violates the constitution, while tech giants warn against the consequences of weakening valuable security measures. A ban may result in big tech companies refusing to comply with Spanish law, which could hurt online communications within the country. Furthermore, criminal elements will still utilize E2EE, rendering the proposed ban an ineffective strategy. Lastly, while governments and corporations are supposed to protect people, it is becoming increasingly clear that ordinary citizens need these corporations to protect them from the government's data exploitation and privacy infringements.Many EU countries want to scan people's messages for illegal content, which has caused concern about government overreach. There is a lack of evidence that banning encryption would effectively reduce crime or terrorism, and there is a prevalent fear that any attempt to add restrictions would inevitably be abused by the government to target individuals. This problem is not new, as laws that were passed to \"stop terrorism\" have been used to catch people not picking up dog poop or not paying TV licensing. Encryption is a fundamental component of the internet that cannot be fully banned without catastrophic consequences such as the loss of email, banks, and business software sales. It is crucial to find a middle ground for regulating decryption access to people's data. Furthermore, many experts argue that end-to-end encryption is a basic right for privacy, meaning that limiting access to it could be a violation of privacy.- Governments are interested in banning end-to-end (E2E) encryption but many know it's not feasible.\n- There is speculation that some governments are worried about their own security or issues in their country such as Catalonia.\n- France previously made toy ciphers illegal to use for encryption until 1996.\n- A community discussion on the coming war on E2E encryption provides a global context.\n- Germany opposes a draft law that disrupts, circumvents, or modifies encryption.\n- There are concerns that government surveillance and control is being masked under the guise of child safety measures.",

This shows that outgoing CEO Katherine Maher was paid a severance package of US$623,286 in 2021 \u2013 slightly more than one-and-a-half times her base compensation in her last full year at the Wikimedia Foundation. So Maher \u2013 who left Wikimedia at the end of April 2021 to join the Atlantic Council and currently serves on the US Department of State's Foreign Affairs Policy Board \u2013 earned a total of US$798,632 in the 2021 calendar year.Janeen Uzzell received US$324,748 in severance pay, having worked less than two-and-a-half years for the Wikimedia FoundationCOO Janeen Uzzell, who was hired by the Wikimedia Foundation in late January 2019 and left at the end of June 2021 to become the CEO of the National Society of Black Engineers on 7 July 2021 (see also the profile in this issue's In the media section), received a severance package of US$324,748 in 2021. This is roughly equivalent to her last full annual salary; she earned a total of US$515,553 from the Wikimedia Foundation in 2021.The severance payments made in 2021 set a new record for the Foundation. The highest previous severance payment was US$262,500. Paid to outgoing CEO Lila Tretikov in 2016, this was about 75% of her last full year's salary.The Foundation noted in its post on the Wikimedia-l mailing list that it would in future use a new, standardised severance policy for staff at all levels, described in a Diff post published last month.The new policy sets a cap on severance pay of one month's salary for each year worked at the WMF, up to a maximum of nine months (unless local law dictates otherwise). Under this scheme both Maher and Uzzell, who spent less than two-and-a-half years at the WMF, would have qualified for much smaller severance payments. But even the new scheme allows for \"exceptions\":The guidelines have also provided an opportunity to better align our processes globally when staff leave the Foundation. This includes a new standardized severance policy for staff at all levels of one month of severance pay for every year of their employment, up to nine months (unless local laws require otherwise) \u2013 any exceptions require a joint recommendation by the Head of Talent & Culture and the General Counsel, with final approval from the CEO.So it seems by no means assured that the new policy will prevent the recurrence of such large severance payments \u2013 which are ultimately paid from global Wikipedia donations.Discussions during the 18 May conversation with the WMF TrusteesFormer WMF Board of Trustees Chair Florence Devouard asked some further questions about the new severance policy on the mailing list, which she then also submitted as discussion topics for the Conversation with Trustees that took place on 18 May 2023 and is available on YouTube.The discussions related to executive pay took up about 15 minutes of the 80-minute meeting, beginning here at time code 23:42 and ending at time code 38:36. First, WMF trustee Nataliia Tymkiv took the following question:\"I would like to know the trustees' characterisation of the growth of executive compensation and whether they think reducing it to historical levels is preferable to layoffs.\"Nataliia said that while US compensation may seem high to someone from Europe, it was data-based rather than based on fundraising success and always reflected local salary levels, adding that going back to past compensation levels was not feasible:\"There is also no way of returning back to historical, unless we actually start hiring people who are really rich, and they can just allow to be philanthropic, and you know, not receiving salaries, but I think that's also not sustainable to just expect that rich people who don't need to care for their bread in the morning can just come and work for us.\"Florence's questionsThe Wikimedia Foundation's Form 990 for 2021. Information on executive compensation can be found on pp. 8\u20139 and 49\u201350Next came some of the questions about the severance policy that Florence had submitted before the meeting:Is the one month of severance pay entirely based on the last month's salary, the last year or previous years?Will this policy affect severances for executives?For staff that are \"exceptions\", are there particular staff members that are able to negotiate exceptions when they join the Foundation, do they negotiate their exception when they depart, or is it something that can be discussed during their tenure?How many staff are considered \"exceptions\" and will there be a maximum number of exceptions?These questions were partially answered (time code 28:47) by CEO Maryana Iskander. Maryana explained at length that the new severance policy was part of an effort to harmonise the Foundation's approach as much as possible across different countries, including for executives, but allowed that there would always be exceptions for various reasons. The policy might also need adjusting in the light of experience. However, she confirmed that the policy will take the last month of paid salary as the basis for calculating the severance.This is an important point, as there have already been cases of Wikimedia executives being awarded steep pay rises towards the end of their tenure with the Foundation (see Wikimedia Foundation salaries on Meta-Wiki). Indeed, according to the Form 990, Katherine Maher was paid US$164,567 in base compensation for four months' work in 2021. This would appear to be equivalent to an annual base compensation of US$493,701, considerably more than her US$404,053 base compensation in 2020. Questions submitted by Florence that remained unanswered in the meeting were:When severance packages would be negotiated or re-negotiatedWhether the WMF would report the numbers or percentages of staff qualifying for an \"exception\"Whether there were plans for a maximum severance for those in the exception segment (for example, at most x months per year of employment)Whether anything is being done to better address the serious escalation of severance packages of the high-level executivesNext, Maryana answered a question on whether there was an incentive system in place to invite Foundation staff to make donations to the Foundation or other Wikimedia entities. She said there was no such system in place, but some staff did voluntarily make such monetary contributions; many of course also volunteered on the projects.Who approved these severance packages?The next question was about who approved the above severance packages. Nataliia explained that the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees approved them (with input from the Talent and Culture Committee), but that severance agreements and related Board votes and resolutions were confidential and not made available to the public.The last question in this section of the meeting concerned Maryana Iskander's and Selena Deckelmann's compensation. While their salaries were not yet reflected in the 2021 Form 990 (both only joined in 2022, and the 2022 data will only need to be reported in 2024), they were proactively disclosed a few weeks ago on Meta: Iskander's base compensation is currently US$453,000 and that of Selena Deckelmann, Chief Product and Technology Officer, is US$420,000. When asked if it was planned to make this kind of proactive disclosure of current executive compensation a regular practice, Iskander gave a non-committal answer:\"It's not clear that this type of disclosure will be necessary \u2013 now that it has been disclosed \u2013 in future years. But the intent certainly is to continue to use the Annual Plan as a place to increase visibility, transparency and accountability of information from the Foundation, I think with the intentionality that we, I hope, demonstrated this year.\"For a summary of other topics discussed at the meeting see the notes on Meta-Wiki. \u2013 AKProposed amendment of arbitration policyThere is an ongoing referendum on a proposed amendment to the arbitration policy.

Thank you! Tony (talk) 11:48, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]I'm unsure of what \"local salary levels\" is supposed to mean for a company that is now fully distributed. Even if the CEO were required to work in San Francisco, where I live myself, I feel some kind of way about donating my labor while folks at the top get these kinds of salaries. Funcrunch (talk) 15:45, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]I asked some related questions at [1]. I got in before the deadline so hopefully they will be answered. Sandizer (talk) 15:57, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]Clearly an unpopular opinion in these discussions, but I have a difficult time bringing myself to care about stuff like this. I feel like maybe I should care, but I just don't. ThadeusOfNazereth(he/him)Talk to Me! 15:49, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]It's wild that these people get hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, plus nice benefits, while my own work compensation is miserable, and I'm paying for camera equipment, books, and article access in order to contribute here. \u0271 (talk) 17:22, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]@\u2c6e In theory, there are WMF-run grants for some of that. In practice, they are IMHO way red-tapish, sadly. But that's a different problem. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 02:49, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]The \"rapid\" fund is for \"projects\" from $500-5000. Neither the occasional book wish nor article/document scan requests cost $500. Perhaps photography equipment could, but I am not sure it would be eligible anyhow? \u0271 (talk) 02:53, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]This book grant project would be great if still active, and where I live... \u0271 (talk) 02:58, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]@\u2c6e Considering that most editors need only a tiny amount of funds for stuff you mention, this does seem like a major oversight. Perhaps consistent with the other issue raised here: someone who earns six digits a year likely forgets some folks may have needs that for them are \"petty cash\". In other words, the distance between decision-makers at WMF and grassroots (us here) is growing larger and larger. Since we are talking about grants, this is well illustrated by those \"big\" grants, which I occasionally review even, and which increasingly have nothing to do with us here. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 04:11, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]These executives are far too often out of touch with the actual activities of the projects, yet somehow are worthy of such extreme salaries. IMHO the salaries ought to be more like $250,000/year -- perhaps even enforced upon the current executive staff -- & if they whine about such a sum being \"insufficient\", they should have the fact we volunteers work for free drummed into their skulls, with no serious hope of receiving more than a tee shirt or two for our labor. (And yes, I am unhappy about this imbalance of compensation.) -- llywrch (talk) 06:49, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]Yes, thanks for researching and reporting on this. DanCherek (talk) 17:38, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]Now we know, only extremely rich people can expect less than 500.000 dollars for leaving a job. Shameful.

Thebiguglyalien (talk) 00:45, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]@Thebiguglyalien Or for suppporting their families? Who probably need basic resources (food, shelter) more than WMF staffers need another luxury item that comes with 6-digits saleries. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 02:50, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]I wanna see the WMF do another donation drive. I double dog dare them. Because if they can burn so much money in severance packages, then there's no damn way they need any more of us regular people's money. LilianaUwU (talk / contribs) 01:03, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]Thing is they were presumably in a position where if they didn't burn that amount they couldn't get rid of the people in question. And in theory at least they are at least trying to avoid being in that situation in future.\u00a9Geni (talk) 06:54, 23 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]Heads up that this got to the front page of Hacker Newshttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36029115 \u2015Justin (koavf)\u2764T\u262eC\u263aM\u262f 10:44, 22 May 2023 (UTC)[reply]THE SIGNPOST IS WRITTEN BY EDITORS LIKE YOU \u2014 JOIN IN!HomeAboutArchivesNewsroomSubscribeSuggestionsCategories: Wikipedia Signpost archives 2023-05Wikipedia Signpost RSS feedThis page was last edited on 22 May 2023, at 11:48 (UTC).Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0; additional terms may apply.

    "hn_content": "Critics are slamming Wikimedia Foundation for paying high salaries and severance packages to top executives, despite the company having net assets ten times what they were a decade ago. The non-profit is accused of \"begging\" for donations despite having the resources to maintain the site several times over. Wikimedia says severance payments were made in light of the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, and it's important to compensate non-profit employees near to the market rate and retain the best talent. Critics argue non-profit C-level executives should be fundraisers with big severance packages questionable given Wikimedia is a non-profit that relies on donations. Wikimedia Foundation's entire annual plan is public, and infrastructure is the focus of its engineering with most of their employees are outside the US.- Wikimedia has too many employees relative to their core goal\n- Some exploratory projects, like the New Editor Experience, were ultimately unsuccessful\n- Compensation for non-profit employees should be fair but executive pay doesn't need to follow market rate dynamics\n- It may be more difficult to contribute to Wikipedia than it was in the past due to bots and overzealous editors controlling changes\n- WMF's budget has increased significantly without much added value\n- Wikipedia's prominent editors have become increasingly biased in their reporting of events.A discussion on bias in Wikipedia articles, particularly the heavily editorialized article on the \"alt-right pipeline\". The conversation includes reflections on the neutrality of Wikipedia editors and their involvement with the Wikimedia Foundation. Some readers express concerns about the foundation's budget, while others praise the organization for creating a neutral platform where unpaid volunteers can curate content.Wikipedia is prone to bias due to the rules and regulations imposed on primary sources, which results in some right-wing publications being banned. Political articles on the platform are often hijacked by activists, and editors are hired to represent certain causes, creating a hive of political activity. While Wikipedia permits breaking rules, Wikipedia's rules are often arbitrary. Additionally, a man disappears, an article is written reporting his death, and the source is banned, the page cannot be edited until a new article comes out retracting the death. The absolute worst bias is when news sites have an active interest in reporting one-sidedly, which creates a cycle of false reporting. Politically neutral means not taking a stance on political matters and dealing in facts, not editorializing. No meaningful content related to technology or tech news found in the text.The CEO of Wikimedia Foundation received a half-million dollar severance payment after leaving her position, with some questioning the need for such a payout. Some argue that executive compensation packages differ from those of typical employees, with bonuses making up a large portion of payment, and that in this case, the CEO managed the Foundation through a difficult time. Others argue that the money should be better spent elsewhere, or question the need for executives in a non-profit organization like Wikimedia. Despite this, many believe that the work of the Foundation and its engineers is necessary and beneficial, and that they are operating efficiently with a relatively low budget.The discussion revolves around the compensation and severance packages for executives at the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that operates Wikipedia. Some users express frustration with the use of donation money for high salaries and severance packages for executives, while others argue that it's not inherently bad for non-profits to compensate employees well. There are also comments discussing development costs, updates to Wikipedia, and the work done by Wikimedia Foundation staff. No new or exciting tech news or releases are mentioned.",

    "content": "code-for-a-livingMAY 22, 2023Modern work requires attention. Constant alerts steal itAttention\u2014the time and freedom to focus\u2014is your team\u2019s most valuable resource.Ryan DonovanIn tough economic times, everyone looks for ways to lower costs without impacting productivity (heck, if we\u2019re doing wish lists, let\u2019s improve productivity, too). And this is one of those times, with many companies making the hard decision to lay off workers and worrying about the impact of new AI technologies.Productivity is definitely top of mind, but whether productivity can be measured is an open question. Many organizations, however, have been measuring how fast their teams ship fixes and features to your customer, which is usually called development velocity. Google devised the DORA metrics to put concrete numbers to this abstract concept. There are a lot of factors that affect development velocity: CI/CD pipelines, code quality, developer experience, and more. In this article, I want to discuss that last one, as real velocity means solving the problems that haven\u2019t yet been solved. Hard problems need focused, sustained attention from developers. This attention\u2014the time and freedom to focus\u2014is your team\u2019s most valuable resource.We often describe working with focused attention as a flow state. As described in the book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a flow state allows one to become fully engaged and focused on the task at hand. It leads to better results and greater happiness. But it can only happen when you have the attention to focus fully on whatever it is that lies before you. Why can\u2019t we focus at work?The contemporary workspace, whether in-person or remote, is full of demands on your attention. We have chat programs, email inboxes, and project management apps all throwing notifications our way. In offices, you have other people tapping you on the shoulder and creating general noise (and woe betide those in open offices). Working remotely avoids some of these, but places the entire communication burden on chat and email applications with their little red notifications. These apps promise asynchronous communications, but that doesn\u2019t always happen in practice.On top of that, we regularly juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. Our attention is pulled in multiple directions, regardless of whether you live an inbox zero life or not. Flow states require sustained attention over time, and our days get chopped into pieces by interruptions and meetings. Researchers at UC Irvine found that on average, office workers switched tasks or were interrupted about every three minutes. Recovering from those interruptions could take workers up to 20 minutes to get back to where they were. In fact, these interruptions could cost individuals up to six hours every day. When we have multiple demands on our attention, we try multitasking\u2014splitting our spotlight or shifting it rapidly to focus on the many tasks that come our way. The truth is, we\u2019re bad at multitasking. There\u2019s a mental cost to switching tasks, and that cost translates to up to 40% more time to complete the tasks. Small errors of inattention slip in\u2014typos, missed cues, and quickly forgotten details. Even trying to do only two things at once can mean you do both badly. All these interruptions can lead to greater stress and anxiety. Depending on the task, productivity may not suffer, but interruptions may cause us to work faster, which leads to greater time pressure, frustration, and stress. It takes more effort to complete the same amount of work with interruptions in the mix. In the longer-term, enduring regular interruptions\u2014up to 85 per day\u2014can cause decreased job satisfaction and burnout. Stress and anxiety form a feedback loop. Both can cause attentional problems, like difficulty concentrating. Without the ability to pay attention to what you\u2019re working on, you may forget steps or not remember solutions that you\u2019ve found. Anxiety has been linked to memory lapses, and if you are constantly forgetting information you\u2019ve received from those chat messages that interrupt people, you may end up interrupting your coworkers over and over. It turns out that those coworkers you interrupt are usually the most senior employees at a company. They\u2019ve been there the longest, they have the most historical knowledge about processes and tools. And they suffer the greatest number of interruptions from their coworkers. There are no notifications in heavenLet\u2019s back up. It\u2019s pretty easy to complain about what\u2019s terrible, but harder to imagine what the better world looks like. In Flow, Csikszentmihalyi talks about optimal experience as one in which the individual has control over their moment-to-moment experience, bringing their consciousness into a state of order. What makes us miserable about our current state of constant interruptions is that it destroys our control. Our attention is not under our command; instead, it ends up being at the mercy of notification on top of notification, multiple applications chiming for attention. Wrangling them under your control seems to be the root of the solution. To do good work during your day, you need some time where you aren\u2019t doing work. Downtime is essential to reducing stress, avoiding burnout, and maintaining a healthy brain. But as we\u2019re all working from home more, work creeps into our home life. Our phones are filled with the same notifications as our work computers except that they can reach us at any hour. You can\u2014and probably should\u2014mute and ignore these notifications after hours; some chat programs set working hours during which notifications will be sent. Our always-on work culture doesn\u2019t always let us ignore notifications, even if it isn\u2019t your turn to monitor incident alerts. Many governments have started passing right-to-disconnect legislation to allow employees to ignore any work-related communications that come after working hours. At the very least, we can have control over what we do in our free time. But what about within the workday? There are ways to recover some measure of control over the attention of your day. You can use \u201ctimeboxing,\u201d where you place a meeting on your calendar that is just for you, a time where everyone understands that you will not respond to notifications. You can be disciplined about statuses and notification settings, indicating when you are available and when you are not. But these techniques only try to manage notifications; what if you could reduce them?In the end, we may want to rethink why we have notifications in the first place, same as some companies are doing with meetings. Every email, every chat notification is an invitation to collaborate and share information. This is great! Collaboration is a force multiplier that increases employee effectiveness. But notifications are synchronous; they demand attention right now. Better collaboration lets all stakeholders come to the table when they are ready, either scheduled so they can plan around it or asynchronous so they can address it when they have the attention to give it. A quieter, more focused workspaceWe needed to stay productive by working in the ways that add value instead of reacting to pings, dings, and shoulder taps. That\u2019s mostly writing code, supporting infrastructure, collaborating on solutions, and sharing our hard-won knowledge. One of the reasons that chat apps (and email, to a lesser extent) drain so much of our attention in modern workplaces is that they have become the central application in our workflow, especially for those last two items. Chat apps are immediate; they want your attention right now.Changing workflows is hard; I\u2019ve seen how developers work in the absence of processes and it\u2019s all in the chat channels. Implementing a new process is hard; the chat workflow works, albeit in a way that isn\u2019t great for some of our other work. We\u2019ve seen the impact that the Stack Overflow community has had on programmers around the world, and have tried to replicate that for organizations with Stack Overflow for Teams. Of course, we have integrations with many of the major chat programs; think of it as using the Strangler Fig pattern to change workflows. There are plenty of other productivity applications that are looking to move the relevant workflows into spaces that are less attention hungry. They have integrations to your favorite chat app too. Of course, the risk here is that your app becomes absorbed in the chat app workflow instead of moving you away from it. Ultimately, the problems of attention drain have cultural solutions. You can get the right tools to support that culture, but there\u2019s two questions that an organization needs to answer: (a) How do you collaborate? and (b) How do you share knowledge? So long as the answers to these involve some analogue or digital version of tapping a coworker on the shoulder to get their attention, we\u2019ll remain distracted and constantly trying to get back to the context we had before our interruptions.Tags: Flow State, productivity",

    "hn_content": "A post on Stack Overflow Blog discusses how modern work can be distracting due to increasingly complex tech stacks, leading to more handovers and less focus on actual work; collaboration is not a force multiplier, as the ideal workflow involves a clear and detailed work package being handed over to the worker who is then left alone to complete it. However, there is a need for some collaboration to align goals. The purpose of a company is to make money, not to ship emails, chat, status updates, approvals, and documents. There is an existential crisis in the tech industry due to the pursuit of profit, and there needs to be a transition to more efficient and equitable ways of operation. Agile was developed to empower engineers to make decisions about their own work and keep management looped in with the minimum viable numbers of meetings. Chat existed in the 1990s and was popular, but was also distracting.The article discusses different organizational philosophies around communication and specialization. The comments touch on the impact of notifications and distractions on productivity, and give tips on how to manage them. Many users express their struggle with social media and HN's addictive nature, and some offer suggestions for meditating or limiting notifications to optimize focus. Some users criticize the constant stream of stimuli from smart watches and other devices that exacerbate these distractions.Several commenters discuss the distractions caused by technology, with some suggesting solutions such as turning off notifications or using focus time. Others debate the value of interrupting work for business needs, emphasizing the importance of balancing productivity and stress levels. The article and comments express frustration with several common tech-related issues, such as excessive notifications and pop-ups, and offer potential solutions to alleviate the problem. Despite the negative aspects of technology, commenters generally acknowledge its usefulness when managed effectively.The article and its comments discuss the impact of modern technology on attention span and productivity. Many people suggest disabling notifications or establishing \"office hours\" to improve focus and reduce cognitive overload. Some commenters share personal experiences or suggest alternative approaches, such as going grayscale on your phone or using \"Do Not Disturb\" mode. The article concludes by arguing that attention is the most valuable resource in the modern economy.The post discusses tips for working remotely and maximizing productivity, including scheduling all work, silencing notifications, being strategic about meetings, working asynchronously, and utilizing documentation and workflow tools. The post argues that multitasking should be avoided, and time should be tracked to measure toil vs feature work. The author suggests that some of these tips may seem crazy, but they have been successfully employed in open-source development for over 20 years. The post highlights that the main difference in work now versus 15 years ago is the increase in remote work and the lack of education on how to properly work remotely.",

    "summary": "- CloudGuard Spectral discovered several malicious extensions on the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) marketplace, with these extensions allowing for theft of personally identifiable information (PII) and enabling of remote shell access to users' machines. The extensions have been downloaded more than 45,000 times.\n- The malicious extensions include 'Prettiest java', 'Theme Darcula dark', and 'python-vscode', which were disguised as useful tools or themes but contained harmful code aimed at stealing user data or injecting malicious scripts.\n- After discovering these extensions, CloudGuard Spectral alerted the VSCode team, leading to the extensions being removed from the marketplace. The event underscores the need for careful verification of all open-source components to avoid security risks.",

    "hn_content": "Checkpoint.com has discovered two malicious VSCode extensions, one with 250 downloads and another with over 45k installs, but it turns out the latter was only sending telemetry. VS team's automated tools are effective at catching most similar issues. A principle of least privilege is essential, and capabilities-based security can help prevent supply chain attacks. There are several tools available to Linux users from Nix to AppArmor and SELinux, but they require a lot of work. Snap and Flatpak can help solve some of these issues. Some extensions may require binaries such as language servers, which require OS support or containerization. Modern security models should grant apps access to certain privileges, while poor users may have to build containers to revoke them.The article discusses the problem of malicious VS Code extensions, as exemplified by three extensions that were discovered to be stealing data or collecting telemetry. There is debate in the comments of the article about whether developers or users should be responsible for preventing malicious extensions, as well as discussions about the limitations of permission systems on various platforms. Some commenters suggest solutions such as mock permissions or better user education. There are concerns raised about the difficulty of enforcing the principle of least privilege for developers who use a lot of third-party code, and some propose solutions such as running code in sandboxes or only using plugins from trusted authors.A discussion on the security risks related to the use of extensions in Visual Studio Code and other platforms like browsers, Gimp, Inkscape, and DAWs. Some commenters suggest using trusted repositories, while others propose implementing a web permission model similar to that of browsers. There are also calls for conducting security checks on the package manager and dependency approval, but the feasibility of this option is highly debated. A user offers a possible solution in the form of a tool to bridge the security gap in VSCode extensions. Despite warnings, some express their confidence in their ability to check code \"sophisticatedly\" using intuition and hunch.Security concerns arise for Visual Studio Code extensions after researchers find three malicious extensions in the official marketplace\n- Researchers at Israeli firm JFrog found three malicious Visual Studio Code extensions in the official marketplace, including one with 45k downloads, that steal data and distributed malicious code for completing ad fraud.\n- The study highlights the need for verifying every open-source component, even if it has been listed in the official marketplace.\n- The lack of a proper sandbox or TCB for plugins makes the platform highly vulnerable, emphasizing the need for more secure frameworks such as wasi/wasm.\n- Recommendations for staying safe include checking if the extensions are from verified publishers, adding more explicit opt-in/opt-out for extensions telemetry and monitoring apps for suspicious activities.- VSCode dev tools lack a security model baked in, leaving plug-ins susceptible to social engineering and potential hacking.\n- Social signals such as verified publisher, number of downloads, rating, reviews, and project details may not be reliable security indicators for VSCode plug-ins.\n- VSCode sends telemetry by default, making it potentially malicious in the eyes of the article.\n- Some users suggest that VSCode should ask for permissions before a plug-in is allowed to talk to the internet or access other resources on the device.\n- VSCode extensions do not have direct access to internal code but have access to standard JS that could be misused if developers lack knowledge.\n- Alternative to VSCode, VSCodium provides an opt-out option for telemetry.\n- There are two approaches to enable plug-ins: a locked-down, secure environment with clear API boundaries, or full access that allows plug-in authors to do what they want but with security risks.",

However, another Buddhist monk and computer scientist, rg111, cautions readers to take Bhikkhu's authority with a grain of salt, given his relatively junior rank within the community, and suggests that the site may be better titled as a \"library\" than a \"university\". Esbeeb, another Buddhist community member, notes that regardless of rank, teaching and publishing dhama is not against the rules of the religion, and asks why the quality of site content is not more central to the discussion. Despite these critiques, several commenters on the article praise the site, particularly its content QA, easy cookie opt-out, zero latency search, and granular RSS feeds.-The Open Buddhist University is an unaccredited, digital resource based on a personal library on Google Drive shared by Khemarato Bhikkhu.\n-Khemarato Bhikkhu is a former software engineer from Silicon Valley.\n-The website provides free, direct downloads of lectures and course materials.\n-Content on the website is based on the Pali Canon, the oldest school of Buddhism.\n-The website also hosts the Pali Wordle, a fun tool for those who understand Pali.\n-The creator of the website is an ordained Bhikku who was formerly a software engineer.",
