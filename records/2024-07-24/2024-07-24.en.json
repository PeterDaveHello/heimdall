FACEBOOK On Tuesday, tourists clad in bucket hats and Converse sneakers were traipsing along the boardwalk in Biscuit Basin when a pool of hot water bubbling up from below the surface of the earth began rising up into the air. Some people stopped and started taking videos on their phones as the black cloud rose. Then, rocks started falling from the sky. Onlookers took the advice shouted by Vlada March, who recorded the scene. A large explosion at Black Diamond Pool at Biscuit Basin in Yellowstone National Park sent tourists scrambling along the boardwalks to escape the debris.

This has no bearing on the greater Yellowstone Caldera (supervolcano) which spans nearly 30miles by 40miles. In my time there I never saw anything like this. If you're ever in a situation similar to this, run as fast and as far as you can. The interesting thing about geysers and pools is how relatively predictable they are... until they are not. A mathematical and statistical person would have a lot of fun building prediction models for all the different geysers. reply advantager 4 minutes agoparentI am a groundwater modeler (hydrogeologist) and often work in fractured rock (mainly for mining clients). No experience with modeling for hydrothermal projects though. While the physics of modeling fluid flow in these environments is possible (e.g. discrete fracture networks), mapping and having confidence in the distribution and actual inter-connectivity of the fractures (i.e. preferential flow pathways) is incredibly difficult. reply 0xdde 21 hours agoparentprev> A mathematical and statistical person would have a lot of fun building prediction models for all the different geysers. It's so popular that one of the datasets immediately available in base R is the set of waiting times between eruptions for a Yellowstone geyser [1]. [1] https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.... reply verandaguy 2 hours agorootparentIn fairness, the geyser in question is Old Faithful, among the best-known geysers in the world, renowned for its regularity. I’m not sure that it’s particularly more regular than most other geysers, but that’s what is known for. reply burtonator 1 hour agoparentprev> If you're ever in a situation similar to this, run as fast and as far as you can. I really really want to underscore this point. You're literally standing on top of ground and under that is boiling water. If that breaks and you fall in you're going to be in boiling water with no way to get out and you will die screaming. Also NEVER walk on ground that has no vegetation. If you look around a geyser you will see that the ground is white and has no vegetation. That's because the temperature is too high and it has water under it that's heating the ground. Walk on that and there's a chance you will fall in. In the back country there are no fences so you can fall right through the crust. reply sandworm101 1 hour agorootparent>> Also NEVER walk on ground that has no vegetation. There are also places on this planet where toxicity issues preclude vegetation. If there are fumes coming through the soil so powerful that grass doesn't grow, take the hint. reply sqeaky 39 minutes agorootparentThey mean never in the context of fleeing from these explosions. My sidewalk has no vegetation, but that is because I weedwhacked on Tuesday not because a geyser 10 meters away is flash boiling water in a pressure vessel made of stone and glass shrapnel-to-be. reply malingo 15 hours agoparentprevJust this morning when I couldn't sleep I was reading the Wikipedia E-M algorithm page with its illustration of clustering the bimodal eruption distribution of Old Faithful: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximiza... reply firewolf34 11 hours agorootparentIf ya can't sleep, ya might as well learn something.

As in its a load-bearing pressure test-run on a random set of connection in stone. Meaning the rock fracks itself, and only the valve to above ground allows for repeated runs? Or do they fix fractures with minerals? reply pfdietz 7 hours agorootparentThere's nothing about a geyser that requires rock to be fractured during an eruption. Geysers occur due to positive feedback as liquid water is removed, reducing the pressure on underlying heated water, allowing it to boil. reply sqeaky 37 minutes agorootparentSort of a temporary equilibrium of boiling temperatures as long as water keeps coming out? but because water supply is finite that will only be a few second or ms? reply billsmithaustin 5 hours agoparentprevJust playing back what you said because it's surprising. You're saying that explosion was not caused by water that was superheated by the supervolcano below the greater Yellowstone Caldera? It was heated by some other source? Interested because I was there a few weeks ago. reply mapt 4 hours agorootparentA defined hydrothermal basin like this is heated by a very local pocket of magma or more properly magma-that-has-mostly-solidified-into-hot-rock, only a kilometer or so deep in this case, that has leaked up from multiple layers of deeper basins creeping up through faultlines, and which is being gradually cooled by water seepage in a dynamically stable way. Depending on the area, there may or may not be an intermediary superheated brine functioning as a heat transport mechanism, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_areas_of_Yellowston... Local explosions like this are not very indicative of movements in the county-sized reservoir of magma ten times deeper down that underlies the entire caldera.

This eruption appears to be larger though -- typically the rocks and debris do not make it to the boardwalk. reply glennon 17 hours agorootparentA geyser gazer friend of mine shared the following image pair: a \"before\" Google Earth image and a USGS overhead image captured today after the event.

The USGS statement references a few examples of similar events including one from 2009 in this same basin, one from 1989 in the Norris basin, and another (small) event in the Norris basin earlier this year. reply Aeroi 16 hours agoparentprevA great followup for someone looking to dive into the statistical side of this would be the Steamboat Geyser in Yellowstone. [1] (Worlds tallest active geyser) It has a pretty irregular major eruption pattern. What people often forget, is that geysers don't wait for the day time, so many events occur at night when nobody is around to witness the beauty. When a geyser like this only erupts a handful of times a year and for approximately 3 minutes, you have to get very very very lucky to witness it. Especially when you take into account how enormous YNP is. [1] https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/steamboat-geyser.htm#:.... reply animal531 9 hours agoparentprevAnother tip, if you're running away from rocks falling out of the sky (or extremely big hailstones) then at least put an arm over your head. It might just save your life. reply toss1 3 hours agorootparentAnother tip for falling objects (although this applies only on the descent phase, so more for objects falling from cliffs or building above you): If when looking up, the object has an apparent motion (left/right/back), it won't hit you, and certainly don't move in the direction it appears to be moving. If it appears stationary in the sky, it WILL hit you or very close, so move fast. Best default strategy with limited time & options is to hug the rock face, especially under an overhang. reply staplung 2 hours agorootparentIt's not just for falling objects. In ship navigation this is known as Constant Bearing, Decreasing Range. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_bearing,_decreasing_r... reply toss1 1 hour agorootparentYup! Also applies to cars on intersecting roads especially at odd angles; if it's staying in the same spot in the windshield/side window, one of you needs to change speeds or you'll have an unscheduled rapid disassembly at the intersection. It's also a real problem for certain intersection angles where vehicles or bicycles with unfortunate timing will be obscured behind the A-Pillar until nearly too late. There was an article (iirc) on HN years ago about just such an intersection repeatedly injuring/killing bicyclists. I once had to seriously threshold brake at an off-angle intersection to avoid a fire truck running a red light, when the timing/speed/distance/angle all lined up to hide the entire truck behind the A-Pillar for a few seconds approaching the intersection. reply syngrog66 2 hours agorootparentprev> and certainly don't move in the direction it appears to be moving. I hereby dub this the Ridley Scott's Prometheus Rule reply ethbr1 17 hours agoparentprevnext [7 more] > If you're ever in a situation similar to this, run as fast and as far as you can.

Am I in danger? If I run, will I look like a fool?\" So you're standing there and looking for other people's reactions before making your own.

There'll be so many more historical events caught on video... but it's now so much more likely that it'll be a vertical video. :( reply tamimio 17 hours agorootparentTo be fair, the vertical recording here fits the context. Also, the fact that the recorder held the camera steady and kept the content within the frame is great by itself. A lot of times, you end up with shaky, useless footage. reply usefulcat 15 hours agorootparent> To be fair, the vertical recording here fits the context. Briefly, near the beginning. But not for the rest of the video. If you're watching a video on a phone, it's trivial to rotate the phone 90 degrees. On a TV or computer, not so much, so you end up with a ridiculous amount of wasted screen real estate and objectively inferior image resolution. reply xvector 14 hours agorootparentThe primary modality through which most people experience media today is their phones, so vertical video is just fine. reply YurgenJurgensen 10 hours agorootparentRotating a phone 90 degrees is trivial and takes a fraction of a second. Rotating a computer monitor 90 degrees is a pain at the best of times. Rotating a laptop 90 degrees makes it unusable. Rotating a television 90 degrees probably requires a toolkit and an assistant. Which of these adaptations seems more reasonable? reply KronisLV 6 hours agorootparentFor people who don’t use computers and TVs much, no adaptation probably makes the most sense. There’s a surprising amount of people out there who are mostly just on their phones nowadays, plus I’m pretty much sure large platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts and such also pander to that format. reply archerx 12 hours agorootparentprevVertical video is never fine. reply voidUpdate 6 hours agorootparentVertical video and picture is fine when the thing you're capturing is vertical, eg a person or something shooting into the air reply baq 8 hours agorootparentprevVertical video is perfectly fine if the device on which it is played back on has a vertical screen. Never is very out of place here. reply immibis 5 hours agorootparentAnd that's the vast majority of devices that are used to watch videos. \"Vertical video is never fine\" stems from the good old days of PCs with monitors. In these phone days, according to the same logic, horizontal video is never fine. reply ryankrage77 5 hours agorootparentBut the phone can easily be rotated to landscape, so landscape has wider compatability. reply shadowgovt 1 hour agorootparentFor something you want to capture immediately, the amount of time it takes for the phone's accelerometer to decide you have rotated it is already too long. reply falcolas 4 hours agorootparentprevIf, and only if, the application supports it. Frustratingly, not all do, so you're stuck with the biggest black bars framing a microscopic landscape video. Contrast with a monitor, where it will at least be viewable vertically, even if it too only fills a portion of the monitor horizontally. reply ddalex 10 hours agorootparentprevIsn't this a technological choice though? Cameras are sufficiently advanced nowadays so it's possible to take horizontal video while keeping the phone vertical, so it's just a software feature away (at the expense of horizontal resolution), or hw feature away (at the expense of a device internal gimbal) reply rhplus 9 hours agorootparentYou’d need square sensors, not an internal moving gimbal, so manufacturers would be left with a choice: should the square fit the circle or the circle fit the square? The first would lower quality and the second would increase costs and add wasted pixels (vignette). reply ddalex 9 hours agorootparentAren't all sensors square already (well 4:3, or 3:2) , and fitting the circle ? reply rhplus 6 hours agorootparentNo, 4:3 is not a square. I found a discussion on the topic here[*]. The consensus seems to be that “wasted” sensor area outside the circle would not be marketable. https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/109452/is-there-an... reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a technological choice, at least not at the level of camera design. It's trivial to record videos the right way; people just can't be arsed. Suppose you implement horizontal recording while the phone is vertical; this would mean the video preview is now scaled and takes only a fraction of the screen (the same way watching horizontal video on YouTube while in \"portrait mode\"), which people would find annoying. Alternatively, you could not scale the video; now the video preview displays only a vertical slice of the frame. It looks OK, but people would soon discover the actual video a screen's worth of image on each side of the preview, leading to anxiety and worry - people would have pay extra attention to not capture things that weren't intended to be on the video; they'd soon look for a way to turn this off. The unfortunate reality is, it's a social problem partially caused by a technological one. Vertical videos are driven by the phone form-factor and because portraits and selfies actually need to be vertical, and people being people, shooting photos of themselves and other is what they care about the most. reply ddalex 5 hours agorootparentSo this comment and the sibling mentioning square sensors raise some good points. Let me rephrase the technological challenge: Make all phone screens square. All phones are now squares. Use Generative AI to fill in the sides of non-square screens. Problem solved. I think I need to make this an AI photo startup. reply esskay 10 hours agorootparentprevFor amateur footage it's absolutely fine, especially in this instance where it's actually a benefit. Nobodys advocating for vertical movies or tv shows.

I personally have started to prefer the vertical format for certain kinds of videos, especially when viewing them on my phone… so I’ve also started taking more vertical videos with my phone. reply avz 14 hours agorootparentPhones can easily be oriented either way, unlike most laptop and workstation screens. Majority of views certainly come from people whose eyes are horizontally next to each other and therefore whose field of view has a greater extent in the horizontal rather than vertical direction. Admittedly I don't understand where the vertical recording fad comes from. Personally I take pictures and photos that are almost exclusively horizontal except in rare cases like taking a picture of a very tall building. reply jaza 12 hours agorootparentI assume that the vertical recording fad primarily comes from: 1. the people doing the recording being too lazy to rotate their phones, and/or the people doing the recording catering to the lowest common denominator of expecting viewers to be too lazy to rotate their phones; 2. so many \"influencer\" and related videos these days consisting solely of the narrator's face being right in front of the camera, which makes for vertical being the optimal orientation, due to the human face being taller than it is wide (hence the term \"portrait orientation\"!). I also hate it, and I also still shoot almost all my photos and videos in horizontal / landscape orientation. I guess that makes me old. reply floating-io 11 hours agorootparentIMO, it's also because vertical orientation is effectively the default on a phone. Nobody expects to have to turn their video camera sideways to capture in the \"correct\" orientation... but you must on a phone. reply lynx23 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, I used to want to do photos/videos in landscape mode. Until I learnt the hard way that orientation detection is not very reliable on (at least the older) iPhones. Had my share of \"come on, turn 90 degrees you useless thing\" moments, until I gave up completely on wanting to reorient my phone. Since then, it has stayed in portray mode forever. reply wruza 7 hours agorootparentprevI can't easily re-orient my phone when I'm laying (my main use circumstance) because then I have to hold it above my stomach awkwardly. Gets worse when it's charging. Can't put it because I'm fat enough for screen to \"dive\" and become obstructed. Vertical mode has no such issue. When I'm sitting, holding vertical feels natural, holding horizontal feels awkward again. I can put my hand on a lap and basically rest in vertical. High risk of dropping it in horizontal (and while rotating). Same for walking. I don't really see how you can do it \"easily\" apart from purely geometric considerations. I can rotate my PC display more easily cause it's arm-mounted (which is one of the PC life changers). where the vertical recording fad comes from Most popular content today is \"person focus\". People are vertical. reply bregma 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen you're taking a self-portrait it's easier to hold a phone vertically one-handed, your self image fits the screen better, and your followers are going to view it in portrait mode on TikTok anyway. When you go yo take a selfie of something other than your face, you just keep the habit. reply basil-rash 13 hours agorootparentprevOr… a geyser? Kinda the one thing absolutely known for going up and down. reply xinayder 10 hours agorootparentprevFor social media, vertical pictures and videos is preferred. Instagram adds some borders around your media if it's in landscape mode, same with TikTok, so the idea is to use vertical recording to not have added black bars around your media. reply notachatbot1234 11 hours agorootparentprevWatching videos on phones, which \"natively\" have a vertical orientation, is pretty popular. I expect the majority of videos watched this way. reply JaggedJax 13 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, a geyser is one of the better situations to film in vertical. reply cbm-vic-20 7 hours agorootparentprevPSA: Vertical Video Syndrome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechvhb0Meo reply VeejayRampay 7 hours agorootparentprevit's really sad that videos are recorded in the exact format that fits the medium used to read them :( reply metadat 15 hours agorootparentprevBeing \"saddened\" by the dimensions of a recording of a potentially life changing scenario comes across as excessively pendantic.

An eruption currently may damage part of the park from low basaltic flows and part of the park would be shut down. Should that happen it may impact the park's tourist revenue but the governor is working on diversifying the states income.

It's a glorious place, even with all the geological activity. reply sliken 13 hours agoparentprevA fair bit of the rich soil in the mid west, west, and north west are from previous volcanic eruptions. Substantial areas have 1 meter or more of high quality soil, which we are squandering by over watering, overly intense agriculture, not preventing erosion, and using too much fertilizer. Not only is fertilizer very energy intensive to produce, it also contributes to de-oxygenation of lakes, rivers, and the ocean. It's no exaggeration that this might well end civilization on earth. If we lose the oceans (which are already becoming oxygen depleted) it's going to be that much harder to feed everyone. So I'd consider volcanic ash a pro, not a con. Sure we might lose a single growing season, but could help us for centuries, if properly managed. reply rocqua 11 hours agorootparentFertilizer isn't just energy intensive, the phosphorus part of it is non renewable. We get it from mining, there are limited deposits, the process of building the deposits happens on geological timescales. My hope is that the running out will be a slow process that comes with a slow price increase so people are eventually incentivized to find alternatives. Also, the mining process leaves very toxic tailings, but that is true for most mining. reply pfdietz 7 hours agorootparentEventually we'll be mining average crustal rock for phosphorus, at 0.1% concentration, as well as recycling phosphate-containing wastes back to soils. It could be the mineral that sets the minimum global annual mined volume after fossil fuels are done (those currently dominate, ignoring such things as gravel and ground water.) On the positive side, I believe most phosphate fertilizer is not immediately absorbed by plants, but instead goes into forming relatively insoluble phosphates in the soil (phosphate fertilizer is formed by solubilizing phosphate minerals by treatment with large amounts of acid). This forms a phosphate bank in the soil. Over time, if I understand correctly the residual solubility of these minerals (especially under the influence of organic acids secreted by plant roots) will reduce the need for additional phosphate additions, assuming the soil doesn't erode away. reply kmbfjr 7 hours agorootparentprevVolcanic ash is extremely acidic, you will lose more than just a single growing season.

Even if a previously unseen phenomenon started to rapidly fill those, rapidly on a geological scale is still measured in thousands of years. Also, similar things like \"the Big One is due in the Northwest\" are just sensational headlines. The Cascadia Subduction Zone indeed produces earthquakes every 3-500 years and the last one was in 1700 but that doesn't mean there's an equivalent of a hourglass. It just means there's a historical average of that. And it's the concern of FEMA to act after something like this happens, not a matter of national security.

Don’t gently jog while constantly checking over your shoulder. Turn. And run. I’m not saying panic. I’m not saying trample anyone in front of you. But get to a safe distance with alacrity. You have no idea if the situation will rapidly escalate, and you may only have one opportunity to put enough distance between you and the unfolding situation. Assume the worst until you know better. In this scenario, falling rocks are a concern. Superheated steam is a concern. Poisonous gases could have been a concern. Corrosive liquids could have been a concern. Lava could have been a concern. Further eruptions could have been a concern. For all of these your odds are improved with distance.

Quite often, I'd say. Disruptions in the stability of geological processes frequently have a compounding domino effect... a volcanic eruption is often preceded by the opening of smaller vents, small landslides can trigger large landslides, small sinkholes can suddenly develop large ones, a trickle over a levee can turn into a total breach, most M>7.0 earthquakes have foreshocks... You can't tell where the peak severity will be in a cluster of geological events except in hindsight after the entire cluster is passed. reply y-c-o-m-b 19 hours agorootparentprevThree simple facts here: 1) This is obviously abnormal enough for the people in the video to flee 2) the aftermath - (1:15+) - clearly demonstrates it was unsafe to be there and 3) there is no way to predict if the next eruption would be equally abnormal or worse unless one were trained in this field There is no arguing those facts, it's 100% clear from that video you linked. Am I going to stay away from the park the rest of the day? I don't know, maybe. It really depends on the circumstances. I am not a volcanologist. I'm not even a scientist. I don't understand the specifics involved here. If it were me, and I can clearly see something abnormal happened, I would NOT risk going back unless I can somehow verify it was safe to do so. That's common sense. It might involve finding a park ranger to speak with or calling the ranger station to get more information. I've been to the geyser at Iceland where they have signs that explicitly tell you about the unpredictable nature of it and how people have been badly burned. This is not a no-risk situation, especially when the situation is not the norm. I've been to the big island of Hawaii during volcanic activity and they explicitly tell you to stay away from it due to the gasses, rocks, lava, etc. Maybe that elevates my skepticism over the safety here, but it seems that's for good reason.

It is also important to consider the context of the park itself. Roughly half of the world's known geysers are in Yellowstone. One of the primary reasons to go there is to see all the hydrothermal features. It is easy to watch this video from your laptop and know it is dangerous, but if you saw this explosion an hour after seeing this[1], the danger would likely be much less obvious.

It must be safe as long as you observe the signs, because it's an institutionalized park, right?

People are just generally bad at perceiving or respecting abstract danger. reply krisoft 11 hours agorootparentBut that also adds to the same effect! Their moral is to stay on the boardwalk and don’t stray off from it. Their morale is to look out for your kids and pets that they do the same. Which equates boardwalks with safety.

But then something like this happens which undermines the assumptions under that approximation and if you are still using it as a heuristics you can be in trouble. > People are just generally bad at perceiving or respecting abstract danger. Maybe? But also, all the yellowstones hydrothermal features look like the gods have cursed the land. If you were just galavanting through the forest and you come up seeing that without any prior knowledge or park rangers to assure you you would say “oh, hell no” and you would turn around.

As I said, individual humans are terrible at judging danger. There was an article posted a few days back about collapses while trenching for construction, and the difficulties of getting people to take that risk seriously until it actually happens. So at the state you're envisioning, I'd say it's more like others in your tribe telling you to stay away from those weird holes in the ground, because some tribe members had already been killed by them.

I remember a story of a father and daughter in Acadia National Park who had wandered out onto some exposed rocks (with about 40 other people) to watch these huge waves crash just below them. Eventually one wave was larger than the others and it knocked all 40 people onto their asses, while dragging the father and daughter (who were right on the edge) into the ocean. The father drowned. All I could think was how colossally dumb you had to be to assume the waves just going to sit there crashing below you. It was clearly a huge storm surge. And then how horribly tragic and preventable the outcome was. Some people, man. EDIT: Misremembered it. Three people were swept out, and it was the 7-year-old daughter who died.

I was oblivious to this until the 3rd or so incident that caught my attention, then on a hunch poked around with Google search enough to realize (after over 15 years living in the Bay Area) it's actually a regular occurrence. It happens on some stretches more than others, and its more likely in the winter, but it's not confined to \"dangerous\" beaches and can happen at any time. For some reason it hasn't captured the public's (or media's) attention to become a \"thing\"--a known hazard that people keep in mind. Every incident tends to be reported in isolation, notwithstanding any blurbs about recent incidents if they happened to occur close enough in time and locality. It's natural to qualify and rate tragic events by degree of perceived \"innocence\". Families swept off quiet beaches to their doom without warning is about as innocently tragic as you can get. That said, some incidents are arguably less innocent then others, such as fishermen venturing onto narrower stretches of beach at low tide during winter, when Pacific surf is stronger and more varied. But even then usually it seems people aren't doing anything that onlookers would consider inviting tragedy, and quite often it happens on well trafficked beaches and during times of the year that people wouldn't consider risky. Fortunately I grew up along the Gulf Coast so Pacific surf has always felt ominous to me. OTOH, I have a higher risk tolerance than many others, especially of younger generations, so maybe it's a wash for me. reply FireBeyond 20 hours agorootparentI had one in Oregon with my then 8 or 9 year old step daughter. We were on rocks WELL above the wave line (like 6+ feet, dry rock leading the surf maybe 20 feet away). And (this is where I screwed up) we were about 50-100 yards out on this outcrop (so rapid scramble not possible). Then, sneaker wave. I basically had her jump up \"into my arms\" so to speak, wrap arms around my neck, legs around my waist, while I situated myself as best I could, and grabbed onto rock with both hands. The water came up to my waist. That was a genuinely terrifying experience. reply prewett 17 hours agorootparentprevHaving been there recently, it definitely would not have been immediately clear to me that there would be a problem. The boardwalk is next to the pools but clearly not in structural danger. The videos show the eruption being basically vertical, so if you aren't directly next to it, it isn't obvious that the ejecta will spread out a little, and that doesn't happen for a couple of seconds. So if you aren't right next to it, it initially doesn't seem unsafe. Also, you are likely to visit this area before Old Faithful, so the most you will have seen is some steam going up. My visit was the first time I'd ever seen a geyser, so I would have had no idea what to expect, and presumably the boardwalk is in a safe location. If it were unsafe, they wouldn't have built the boardwalk there, right? (And it doesn't seem like anyone was injured, so...) reply xeromal 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's not that. I was on a plane where a guy tried to break open the door to the outside mid flight and it takes a good 30-60 seconds for people to comprehend reality and make a decision. It's easy to judge from a screen but when an actual disaster hits, the brain does weird things reply pixl97 21 hours agorootparentIt typically takes much longer for people to process and make 'intelligent' decisions on novel information than we realize. Again, typically the brain will skip these checks and go into fight or flight mode where you punch or run without knowing what you are doing. I'd like to think we break a lot of this response in the modern world by not being around a lot of spontaneous dangerous stuff, which leaves us gawking at times. reply yongjik 21 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, you cannot really open a door of an airplane mid-flight (due to pressure difference), so passengers were in fact in much less danger than they perceived. reply Reason077 20 hours agorootparentThis is true when the aircraft is at altitude, but there have been cases of passengers opening doors in flight at low altitude, where there is little or no pressure differential: https://news.sky.com/story/amp/passenger-arrested-after-plan... reply K0balt 21 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the door opens in before it cams over to opening out (or can be thrown out onto the wing in some cases), so it’s being held in place by about 3000 kilos of force at typical cabin pressures. Good luck trying to pull it open. Now, near the ground before the aircraft is pressurised, it could be dangerous mostly because it could pose a risk to the aircraft structure or systems if it tears off and impacts the aircraft in flight. Other than that, a jetliner can fly perfectly well with a door open at low altitude. (Not sure about special large cargo doors though) reply ordu 21 hours agorootparentprevIf you run in a panic when normal geyser erupts, it would be embarrassing, right? Now, what is a normal geyser eruption and what is not normal? If you never tried to research this, you do not know. So we come to an uncertainty. This seems pretty big, and probably is not normal, isn't it? Or it is? So you are not sure, should you shake off social norms of behavior (being calm, not shouting, acting like a grown adult) and to switch to a survival behavior (running away, shouting commands \"run\" to others, dragging people with you by their limbs, or doing whatever you think is the adequate behavior for such a situation). Looking at the video carefully, people in a few seconds come to a conclusion that this is dangerous and start moving away, but they didn't get away from norms of everyday behavior. These two different priorities (to act normal or go to the survival mode) are still there, and they are still fighting in minds of people for a dominance. Their response was \"gently jog while constantly checking over your shoulder\", because they decided it is dangerous and you need at least jog away, but they are feel that they may be underestimating (or overestimating) the danger, and they keep themself aware of the events to be able to change their behavior accordingly to them. The very situation prompts for rapid change from a normal mode of existence to a survival mode, and there is no clear unambiguous signal that it is the case. The geyser erupts? Didn't we come here to watch geysers? Wouldn't it be embarrassing to run from the geyser? There are a lot of questions, and System 2 is a slow one. People are educated to keep System 1 in a check and to think things through. They are educated to know some dangerous situations and they can react to them immediately, but this is something unusual, they are not trained for it, and their minds become overwhelmed by a massive visual stimulus and by all the thoughts and ideas that may be relevant, but only System 2 could decide and to prioritize them properly. When I was watching the video I instantly saw that it is dangerous, but I was prompted about it by the article, so I was ready to see something impressive AND dangerous. Therefore I'm not sure would I be better in that situation if I was watching it in real life without any prompting. > they have lived such safe and sheltered lives that they cannot identify real danger. I wrote about it above, but I want to stress it out: 1. we are conditioned to think before acting, 2. most of us have no experience with geysers and we cannot access the hazard level of a geyser at the first glance, and we know that we can't, so... goto 1. reply creer 19 hours agorootparentThere is also the imperative to get the video. Which for once was well done. reply beejiu 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's not necessarily psychology, it could be an involuntary stress response called freezing behaviour. It's where you stop, become hyper alert and observant of your surroundings to make a conscious decision about how to act. It's basically the conscious alternative to fight or flight. reply Murky3515 21 hours agorootparentI'm talking about the people in the video who saw what happened, then very casually and slowly turned and strolled away. reply dmurray 21 hours agorootparentWho? Everyone in the video is running by 6 seconds in, and it reasonably takes 2-3 seconds to be clear that this isn't just a normal geyser eruption. Some of the runners are shambling or in a very light jog, but that looks like it's down to form or fitness rather than being blasé. I don't see anyone \"strolling\". reply Murky3515 21 hours agorootparentThe woman in the white shirt, tan shorts only started running because the people behind her started running. She was strolling away from the explosion. Same with green shorts in the foreground. We don't actually see him run, just walking away. These people have no sense of urgency around danger, or they cannot recognize danger. reply JoshTriplett 20 hours agorootparentprev> It's like they think that appearing overly concerned about something potentially dangerous is more embarrassing than being killed by something actually dangerous. This is a real psychological phenomenon. Most people don't want to be the first person to yell \"fire!\", or to appear to take a situation more seriously than it warrants, because they might be wrong and they'd stand out as being wrong and feel embarrassed. That feeling can \"stick\" shockingly long after you'd think the situation was obvious. We have not socially normalized and trained the concept that it's better for people to occasionally be understandably wrong than to delay reacting to problems. The right reaction to quick reactions that turn out to be incorrect should be \"Thanks for calling attention to what might have been a problem!\", not an array of signals that all convey \"what a weirdo\". reply highcountess 21 hours agorootparentprevIt is a combination of those factors along with what I call TV-Brain, a subconscious assumption that it’s not real, it’s just like when I see it in the rectangle. Remember, most people in the western and especially American world, simply do not experience real world risks and dangers, everything is so sanitized and cleaned and protected and safe, that they simply do not connect reality with their own demise or even a risk to it. On a related note, it is alway why I believe there are so many and increasing numbers of injurious contacts with bisons, moose, elk, bears, etc in Yellowstone, because they think they’re cuddly animals that they saw in wildlife documentaries and know from cartoons and tv stories of the child that is friends with the talking bear, etc. most people are simply so detached from reality that they simply have no reference for what they are doing that is extremely dangerous to their continued state of being alive. reply lanstin 21 hours agorootparentThe first time I visited the Everglades there was a family that had been at Disney for some time and the kids would not believe the many enourmous alligators laying around were real.

I was getting a Bloody Mary when it happened, so I left my drink on the bar, went to the table where my family was, and said \"let's go\". Other than the sound of the alarm, you wouldn't know anything was happening. People were still getting food from the buffet, sitting at their tables, like nothing was going on. A minute after we left the area, everyone else came out - not all willingly, it seems. Fortunately, the fire turned out to be nothing (flare up in the kitchen, I heard) and we were let back into the club after a bit. I learned quite a bit about human nature that day. reply AmericanChopper 8 hours agorootparentA life time of fire drills teaches everybody that a fire alarm is just some box tickers way of pointlessly interrupting your day to confirm that nobody has forgotten how to walk out of a fire exit.

I was here last year and alot of these geysers erupt like clock work(see Old Faithful). Yellowstone pulls in many tourists from Asia and Europe and and also urban areas of the US and there is nothing like what is there where they come from. Also you have many a placard saying geyers erupt on a regular basis around that area, and also there is a well defined boardwalk around them (for your saftey and to not disturb the area around you) that was vetted by geologists and park rangers.

The number of people in the stands who just remained standing and gawking with no self preservation instinct (duck!) was eerie. reply saurik 21 hours agoparentprevI honestly can't tell which part you think wasn't normal. Other people have kind of poked back at what you are saying, but I feel without really questioning which part of this you don't like, as it kind of sounds as if you are just saying \"don't hang around near geysers... and, thereby, don't go to visit Yellowstone\". If you saw this same video but without the black color, would you have run? Because that would feel a bit silly to me: these kinds of explosions are happening all around you the entire time you are there. Some are even larger than this one, and you don't just stay as they happen: you sit on a bench and wait for an hour or two hoping to see it while you are there, and there are giant clocks trying to estimate when the next eruption will be. Now like, what if the color were grey and there was mud? Some of the geysers have mud. Most of these are not a concern. What was a concern here was the black color... but as someone who has spent a bunch of time filming these geysers I found the black color so confusing that it really took me a moment to go \"oh shit those are rocks\". I could easily see myself having that pause we see from the other people before they all start running. But, again: I don't feel like you are saying \"these people should know rocks are dangerous\" or \"this was obviously different and you should be informed and on your toes ready to run\"... you seem to be saying that, if you were standing somewhere and the ground suddenly exploded that you'd of course run; and, maybe that would be the absolute safest thing you could do, but then... why are you even there in the first place, if not to see an explosion of superheated steam? Also, remember that the entire region seriously smells like sulfur and other strange gases... this is an area of terrain that people have long ago artistically (maybe even mythologically) described as the doorway to hell, between the smells, the color, the explosions, and the regions of trees that are either scorched, petrified, or merely poisoned. It honestly does make sense to question why people visit such an area in the first place, but once you decide to be there... well, it seems strange to question why you don't see everyone panicking about the explosion. reply voisin 21 hours agoparentprevThe same could be said of how many people barely reacted to the shooting in the Trump assassination attempt.

There is a hot-ish spring on our property, in that it stays snow free through the winter. That said, if there was a bunch of heat near the surface presumably our well water would be hot. It isn't. reply dredmorbius 20 hours agoparentprev [–] I've made this suggestion myself in the past. Via a flagged comment, a counterargument is deep geothermal, accessed via boreholes, and not strictly limited to extant surface geothermal fields:Thomas Homer-Dixon is also an advocate that I'm aware of:I'm not sold on this (deep geothermal pilots such as the Geothermal Habanero project in Australia have proved expensive busts, and the productive lifespan of a given borehole is limited to a few decades). But it's worth consideration. I've written on Habanero previously. The project consistently overran time and cost estimates, and delivered far less power than initially planned. That's not to say that the concept is fatally flawed, but it's also not the panacea first projected. By contrast, surface geothermal fields have been and are developed at commercial scale worldwide, and have been for years: The Geysers in California, in Iceland, Japan, the Philippines, New Zealand, and elsewhere. In fact most viable fields have already been tapped, with the largely untapped resources now existing in the African Rift Valley (largely within Kenya, where it could hugely bolster the country's fairly anemic generating capacity), and of course Yellowstone in the US, where there are significant environmental and political barriers. A USGS survey getting on two decades ago of US geothermal resources conspicuously excludes Yellowstone from any consideration at all. From 2007:See: \"Habanero Geothermal Project Field Development Plan\". A largely sober summary of the project, noting that it's been concluded rather than expanded.My own 2014 summary:reply OutOfHere 19 hours agorootparent [–] In Yellowstone, if I am not mistaken, the energy is extractable at its land surface, or quite close to it. Drilling 4 km does not seem necessary at Yellowstone. Is this incorrect? Secondly, there exist efficiencies of scale that come with drilling at ten or a hundred sites rather than just one or a few. reply dredmorbius 8 hours agorootparentEfficiencies of scale from multiple drilling operations likely pale in comparison to the costs of each well. Keep in mind that some factors, such as well casings, drilling mud, drill bits, labour, and support costs remain high on a per-well basis. A 10% savings evaporates quickly if 100 wells are required to match the energy return of 1 or 10. Well depth and diameter are major determinants of drilling costs in both petroleum and geothermal operations. The ability to achieve a high, long-term return on relatively shallow drilling operations probably trumps any learning-curve efficiency improvements in drilling itself. Sites such as Yellowstone (based on some former research I'd made) contribute significantly to US baseload electrical generation, should the US choose to exploit them. It's also worth noting that there already is considerable expertise in drilling generally, with over 160 years of experience over millions of individual wells, and that the efficiency / improvement curve is likely fairly ... well ... exploited. \"Geothermal Drilling Costs\" (2006)\"Cost analysis of oil, gas, and geothermal well drilling\" (2014)reply zamadatix 19 hours agorootparentprevThe top of the magma chamber starts ~5-17 km from the surface with another magma chamber ~20-50 km from the surface. Heat starts and goes well above that of course but if your goal is to meaningfully hook into and extract the heat of the chamber itself it's quite deep. Put from another perspective: if a significant amount of the energy of the chamber were imminently near the surface it would already fizzle itself out over thousands of years without the need of digging short holes to do it in a few. Geothermal in Yellowstone is no better or more useful than geothermal at many other less important places. It isn't even the place with the most surface level geothermal energy in the first place. Overall geothermal technology advancement makes a lot of sense but starting said advancement via sandbagging for an outcome 1000 years after developing one of the best national parks to do so does not make sense. Regardless of all of that, there are significantly more than the two possibilities of either starting drilling today or having catastrophe in an eruption. reply dredmorbius 11 hours agorootparentAFAIU the \"last mile\" (or last 5--17 km) transfer largely occurs through ground-water migration. Yellowstone combines extensive geothermal energy with ample surface water flow (e.g., Lake Yellowstone, which is itself a major geothermal zone).

I am not convinced that drilling 5 km is necessary at Yellowstone. I suspect the energy is ripe for the taking much closer to the surface due to this water migration. reply OutOfHere 17 hours agorootparentprevThe reason why I noted a thousand year period is because Yellowstone is said to have a lot more energy than we can use right now. Regarding the investment, if a 5 km well is dug, I don't expect it to exhaust its energy without a significant payback. reply dredmorbius 16 hours agorootparentprev [–] AFAIU yes, absolutely. Yellowstone has accessible thermal gradients. Even if a remote approach is made, say, outside the National Park boundaries and intended to minimise surface impacts, necessary drilling should be minimal, and a small number of wells should provide far more energy return than a large number of deep boreholes.

In particular, on MMLU, the pretrained version achieves an accuracy of 84.0%, and sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models. Code & Reasoning Following our experience with Codestral 22B and Codestral Mamba, we trained Mistral Large 2 on a very large proportion of code. Mistral Large 2 vastly outperforms the previous Mistral Large, and performs on par with leading models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3 405B. A significant effort was also devoted to enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities. One of the key focus areas during training was to minimize the model’s tendency to “hallucinate” or generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or irrelevant information. This was achieved by fine-tuning the model to be more cautious and discerning in its responses, ensuring that it provides reliable and accurate outputs. Additionally, the new Mistral Large 2 is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer. This commitment to accuracy is reflected in the improved model performance on popular mathematical benchmarks, demonstrating its enhanced reasoning and problem-solving skills: Performance accuracy on code generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline) Performance accuracy on MultiPL-E (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline, except for the \"paper\" row) Performance accuracy on GSM8K (8-shot) and MATH (0-shot, no CoT) generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline) Instruction following & Alignment We drastically improved the instruction-following and conversational capabilities of Mistral Large 2. The new Mistral Large 2 is particularly better at following precise instructions and handling long multi-turn conversations. Below we report the performance on MT-Bench, Wild Bench, and Arena Hard benchmarks: Performance on general alignment benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evalutation pipeline) On some benchmarks, generating lengthy responses tends to improve the scores. However, in many business applications, conciseness is paramount – short model generations facilitate quicker interactions and are more cost-effective for inference. This is why we spent a lot of effort to ensure that generations remain succinct and to the point whenever possible. The graph below reports the average length of generations of different models on questions from the MT Bench benchmark: Language diversity A large fraction of business use cases today involve working with multilingual documents. While the majority of models are English-centric, the new Mistral Large 2 was trained on a large proportion of multilingual data. In particular, it excels in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi. Below are the performance results of Mistral Large 2 on the multilingual MMLU benchmark, compared to the previous Mistral Large, Llama 3.1 models, and to Cohere’s Command R+. Performance on Multilingual MMLU (measured on the base pretrained model) Tool Use & Function Calling Mistral Large 2 is equipped with enhanced function calling and retrieval skills and has undergone training to proficiently execute both parallel and sequential function calls, enabling it to serve as the power engine of complex business applications.

With all the training data I'm surprised none of them fixed this yet. reply m2024 3 minutes agorootparentDoes anyone have input on the feasibility of running an LLM locally and providing an interface to some language runtime and storage space, possibly via a virtual machine or container? No idea if there's any sense to this, but an LLM could be instructed to formulate and continually test mathematical assumptions by writing / running code and fine-tuning accordingly. reply generalizations 1 hour agorootparentprevTesting models on their tokenization has always struck me as kinda odd. Like, that has nothing to do with their intelligence. reply SirMaster 21 minutes agorootparentHow is a layman supposed to even know that it's testing on that? All they know is it's a large language model. It's not unreasonable they should expect it to be good at things having to do with language, like how many letters are in a word. Seems to me like a legit question for a young child to answer or even ask. reply psb217 14 minutes agorootparentprevHow can I know whether any particular question will test a model on its tokenization? If a model makes a boneheaded error, how can I know whether it was due to lack of intelligence or due to tokenization? I think finding places where models are surprisingly dumb is often more informative than finding particular instances where they seem clever. It's also funny, since this strawberry question is one where a model that's seriously good at predicting the next character/token/whatever quanta of information would get it right. It requires no reasoning, and is unlikely to have any contradicting text in the training corpus. reply meroes 20 minutes agorootparentprevI hear this a lot but there are vast sums of money thrown at where a model fails the strawberry cases. Think about math and logic. If a single symbol is off, it’s no good. Like a prompt where we can generate a single tokenization error at my work, by my very rough estimates, generates 2 man hours of work. (We search for incorrect model responses, get them to correct themselves, and if they can’t after trying, we tell them the right answer, and edit it for perfection). Yes even for counting occurrences of characters. Think about how applicable that is. Finding the next term in a sequence, analyzing strings, etc. reply wruza 40 minutes agorootparentprevIt doesn’t test “on tokenization” though. What happens when an answer is generated is few abstraction levels deeper than tokens. A “thinking” “slice” of an llm is completely unaware of tokens as an immediate part of its reasoning. The question just shows lack of systemic knowledge about strawberry as a word (which isn’t surprising, tbh). reply qeternity 20 minutes agorootparentIt is. Strawberry is one token in many tokenziers. The model doesn't have a concept that there are letters there. reply guywhocodes 0 minutes agorootparentThis is pretty much equivalent to the statement \"multicharacter tokens are a dead end for understanding text\". Which I agree with. VincentEvans 11 minutes agorootparentprevI don’t know anything about LLMs beyond using ChatGPT and Copilot… but unless because of this lack of knowledge I am misinterpreting your reply - it sounds as if you are excusing the model giving a completely wrong answer to a question that anyone intelligent enough to learn alphabet can answer correctly. reply baq 15 minutes agorootparentprevCall me when models understand when to convert the token into actual letters and count them. Can’t claim they’re more than word calculators before that. reply probably_wrong 30 minutes agorootparentprevI would counterargue with \"that's the model's problem, not mine\". Here's a thought experiment: if I gave you 5 boxes and told you \"how many balls are there in all of this boxes?\" and you answered \"I don't know because they are inside boxes\", that's a fail. A truly intelligent individual would open them and look inside. A truly intelligent model would (say) retokenize the word into its individual letters (which I'm optimistic they can) and then would count those. The fact that models cannot do this is proof that they lack some basic building blocks for intelligence. Model designers don't get to argue \"we are human-like except in the tasks where we are not\". reply pegasus 23 minutes agorootparentOf course they lack building blocks for full intelligence. They are good at certain tasks, and counting letters is emphatically not one of them. They should be tested and compared on the kind of tasks they're fit for, and so the kind of tasks they will be used in solving, not tasks for which they would be misemployed to begin with. reply probably_wrong 7 minutes agorootparentI agree with you, but that's not what the post claims. From the article: \"A significant effort was also devoted to enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities. (...) the new Mistral Large 2 is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer.\" Words like \"reasoning capabilities\" and \"acknowledge when it does not have enough information\" have meanings. If Mistral doesn't add footnotes to those assertions then, IMO, they don't get to backtrack when simple examples show the opposite. reply swatcoder 59 minutes agorootparentprevSurfacing and underscoring obvious failure cases for general \"helpful chatbot\" use is always going to be valuable because it highlights how the \"helpful chatbot\" product is not really intuitively robust. Meanwhile, it helps make sure engineers and product designers who want to build a more targeted product around LLM technology know that it's not suited to tasks that may trigger those kinds of failures. This may be obvious to you as an engaged enthusiast or cutting edge engineer or whatever you are, but it's always going to be new information to somebody as the field grows. reply Kuinox 2 hours agorootparentprevTokenization make it hard for it to count the letters, that's also why if you ask it to do maths, writing the number in letters will yield better results. for strawberry, it see it as [496, 675, 15717], which is str aw berry. If you insert characters to breaks the tokens down, it find the correct result: how many r's are in \"s\"t\"r\"a\"w\"b\"e\"r\"r\"y\" ? > There are 3 'r's in \"s\"t\"r\"a\"w\"b\"e\"r\"r\"y\". reply GenerWork 1 hour agorootparent>If you insert characters to breaks the tokens down, it find the correct result: how many r's are in \"s\"t\"r\"a\"w\"b\"e\"r\"r\"y\" ? The issue is that humans don't talk like this. I don't ask someone how many r's there are in strawberry by spelling out strawberry, I just say the word. reply est31 1 hour agorootparentHumans also constantly make mistakes that are due to proximity in their internal representation. \"Could of\"/\"Should of\" comes to mind: the letters \"of\" have a large edit distance from \"'ve\", but their pronunciation is very similar. Especially native speakers are prone to the mistake as they grew up learning english as illiterate children, from sounds only, compared to how most people learning english as second language do it, together with the textual representation. Psychologists use this trick as well to figure out internal representations, for example the rorschach test. And probably, if you asked random people in the street how many p's there is in \"Philippines\", you'd also get lots of wrong answers. It's tricky due to the double p and the initial p being part of an f sound. The demonym uses \"F\" as the first letter, and in many languages, say Spanish, also the country name uses an F. reply rahimnathwani 59 minutes agorootparentUntil I was ~12, I thought 'a lot' was a single word. reply itishappy 39 minutes agorootparenthttps://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-bette... reply observationist 1 hour agorootparentprevCount the number of occurrences of the letter e in the word \"enterprise\". Problems can exist as instances of a class of problems. If you can't solve a problem, it's useful to know if it's a one off, or if it belongs to a larger class of problems, and which class it belongs to. In this case, the strawberry problem belongs to the much larger class of tokenization problems - if you think you've solved the tokenization problem class, you can test a model on the strawberry problem, with a few other examples from the class at large, and be confident that you've solved the class generally. It's not about embodied human constraints or how humans do things; it's about what AI can and can't do. Right now, because of tokenization, things like understanding the number of Es in strawberry are outside the implicit model of the word in the LLM, with downstream effects on tasks it can complete. This affects moderation, parsing, generating prose, and all sorts of unexpected tasks. Having a workaround like forcing the model to insert spaces and operate on explicitly delimited text is useful when affected tasks appear. reply coder543 59 minutes agorootparentprev> I don't ask someone how many r's there are in strawberry by spelling out strawberry, I just say the word. No, I would actually be pretty confident you don’t ask people that question… at all. When is the last time you asked a human that question? I can’t remember ever having anyone in real life ask me how many r’s are in strawberry. A lot of humans would probably refuse to answer such an off-the-wall and useless question, thus “failing” the test entirely. A useless benchmark is useless. In real life, people overwhelmingly do not need LLMs to count occurrences of a certain letter in a word. reply Zambyte 1 hour agorootparentprevHumans also would probably be very likely to guess 2 r's if they had never seen any written words or had the word spelled out to them as individual letters before, which is kind of close to how lanugage models treat it, despite being a textual interface. reply bhelkey 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's not a human. I imagine if you have a use case where counting characters is critical, it would be trivial to programmatically transform prompts into lists of letters. A token is roughly four letters [1], so, among other probable regressions, this would significantly reduce the effective context window.

There's definitely tons of weaknesses with LLMs for sure, but i continue to be impressed at what they do right - not upset at what they do wrong. reply mattnewton 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can always find something to be unimpressed by I suppose, but the fact that this was fixable with plain english is impressive enough to me. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentThe technology is frustrating because (a) you never know what may require fixing, and (b) you never know if it is fixable by further instructions, and if so, by which ones. You also mostly* cannot teach it any fixes (as an end user). Using it is just exhausting. *) that is, except sometimes by making adjustments to the system prompt reply mattnewton 31 minutes agorootparentI think this particular example, of counting letters, is obviously going to be hard when you know how tokenization works. It's totally possible to develop an intuition for other times things will work or won't work, but like all ML powered tools, you can't hope for 100% accuracy. The best you can do is have good metrics and track performance on test sets. I actually think the craziest part of LLMs is that how, as a developer or SME, just how much you can fix with plain english prompting once you have that intuition. Of course some things aren't fixable that way, but the mere fact that many cases are fixable simply by explaining the task to the model better in plain english is a wildly different paradigm! Jury is still out but I think it's worth being excited about, I think that's very powerful since there are a lot more people with good language skills than there are python programmers or ML experts. reply psb217 12 minutes agorootparentprevWell, the answer is probably between 1 and 10, so if you try enough prompts I'm sure you'll find one that \"works\"... reply ThrowawayTestr 2 hours agorootparentprevCompared to chat bots of even 5 years ago the answer of two is still mind-blowing. reply petesergeant 1 hour agorootparentprev> In a park people come across a man playing chess against a dog.

Them: Why are you asking me this? reply SirMaster 29 minutes agorootparentTry asking a young child... reply Spivak 2 hours agorootparentprevTo me it's just a limitation based on the world as seen by these models. They know there's a letter called 'r', they even know that some words start with 'r' or have r's in them, and they know what the spelling of some words is. But they've never actually seen one in as their world is made up entirely of tokens. The word 'red' isn't r-e-d but is instead like a pictogram to them. But they know the spelling of strawberry and can identify an 'r' when it's on its own and count those despite not being able to see the r's in the word itself. reply emmelaich 19 minutes agorootparentI think it's more that the question is not unlike \"is there a double r in strawberry?' or 'is the r in strawberry doubled?' Even some people will make this association, it's no surprise that LLMs do. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentprevThe great-parent demonstrates that they are nevertheless capable of doing so, but not without special instructions. Your elaboration doesn’t explain why the special instructions are needed. reply asadm 2 hours agorootparentprevthis can be automated. reply grumbel 1 hour agorootparentGPT4o already does that, for problems involving math it will write small Python programs to handle the calculations instead of doing it with the LLM itself. reply skyde 10 minutes agorootparentIt “work” but the LLM having to use the calculator mean the LLM doesn’t understand arithmetic enough and doesn’t know how to use an follow a set of step (algorithm ) natively to find the answer for bug numbers.

Basically feed it with a bunch of heuristics that will help it better understand the thing you tell it. Maybe the various chat interfaces already do this behind the scenes? reply joshstrange 2 hours agorootparentprevLots of replies mention tokens as the root cause and I’m not well versed in this stuff at the low level but to me the answer is simple: When this question is asked (from what the models trained on) the question is NOT “count the number of times r appears in the word strawberry” but instead (effectively) “I’ve written ‘strawbe’, now how many r’s are in strawberry again? Is it 1 or 2?”. I think most humans would probably answer “there are 2” if we saw someone was writing and they asked that question, even without seeing what they have written down. Especially if someone said “does strawberry have 1 or 2 r’s in it?”. You could be a jerk and say “it actually has 3” or answer the question they are actually asking. It’s an answer that is _technically_ incorrect but the answer people want in reality. reply medmunds 17 minutes agorootparentprevHow much do threads like this provide the training data to convince future generations that—despite all appearances to the contrary—strawberry is in fact spelled with only two R's? I just researched \"how many r's are in strawberry?\" in a search engine, and based solely on the results it found, I would have to conclude there is substantial disagreement on whether the correct answer is two or three. reply fluoridation 12 minutes agorootparentSpeaking as a 100% human, my vote goes to the compromise position that \"strawberry\" has in fact four Rs. reply eschneider 9 minutes agorootparentprevThe models are text generators. They don't \"understand\" the question. reply Tepix 2 hours agorootparentprevLLMs think in tokens, not letters. It's like asking someone who is dyslexic about spelling. Not their strong suit. In practice, it doesn't matter much, does it? reply recursive 2 hours agorootparentSometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It is evidence that LLMs aren't appropriate for everything, and that there could exist something that works better for some tasks. reply Zambyte 44 minutes agorootparentLanguage models are best treated like consciousness. Our consciousness does a lot less than people like to attribute to it. It is mostly a function of introspection and making connections, rather than being the part of the brain where higher level reasoning and the functions of the brain that tell your body how to stay alive (like beating your heart). By allowing a language model to do function calling, you are essentially allowing it to do specialized \"subconscious\" thought. The language model becomes a natural language interface to the capabilities of its \"subconsciousness\". A specific human analogy could be: I tell you to pick up a pen off of the table, and then you do it. Most of your mental activity would be subconscious, orienting your arm and hand properly to pick up the pen, actually grabbing the pen, and picking it up. The linguistic representation of the action would exist in your concious mind (pick up the pen), but not much else. A language model could very easily call out to a text processing function to correctly do things like count the number of r's in the word strawberry. That is a job that your concious mind can dispatch to your subconciousness. reply imtringued 2 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't make any sense. The LLM knows the token to letter associations if you ask it. Once it has split the token into letters, it can answer the question anyway. This tells us that the model is unaware of its own limitations, otherwise it would have figured that this tasks needs it to split the letters first. reply wruza 16 minutes agorootparentDoes it? It knows how a word in some context represented by tokens split into letters. It may know or not know the table. I wouldn’t trust what it tells about word/token correspondence more than in general. reply staticman2 1 hour agorootparentprevWell splitting into letters doesn't help with Mistral Large 2. I tried this with Mistral 2: [Question: How many r's in strawberry? First split the word into letters, one letter on each line then answer the question.] [Answer: Let's split the word \"strawberry\" into letters: s t r a w b e r r y Now, let's count the number of 'r's: There are 2 'r's in the word \"strawberry\".] [Question: Did you count the number of r's?] [answer: Yes, I did. Here's the count: r r So, there are 2 'r's in the word \"strawberry\".] I suspect the issue is these models have to be trained to accomplish tasks, and this is not a task it makes sense to train a model to perform. You might train it to do this with function calling one day, calling a python library to count the r's in a string, but actually manually counting r's just doesn't play to an LLM's strengths. reply vorticalbox 40 minutes agorootparentprevI just tried llama 3.1 8 b this is its reply.

The hedonic treadmill runs deep. reply bugglebeetle 3 hours agorootparentGPT-4 was probably as good as Claude Sonnet 3.5 at its outset, but OpenAI ran it into the ground with whatever they’re doing to save on inference costs, otherwise scale, align it, or add dumb product features. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentIndeed, it used to output all the code I needed but now it only outputs a draft of the code with prompts telling me to fill in the rest.

It seems almost desperate to generate vast chunks of boilerplate code that are only tangentially related to the question. That's my perception, anyway. reply throwadobe 57 minutes agorootparentThis is also my perception using it daily for the last year or so. Sometimes it also responds with exactly what I provided it with and does not make any changes. It's also bad at following instructions. GPT-4 was great until it became \"lazy\" and filled the code with lots of `// Draw the rest of the fucking owl` type comments. Then GPT-4o was released and it's addicted to \"Here's what I'm going to do: 1. ... 2. ... 3. ...\" and lots of frivolous, boilerplate output. I wish I could go back to some version of GPT-4 that worked well but with a bigger context window. That was like the golden era... reply cloverich 47 minutes agorootparentprevThis is also my experience. Previously it got good at giving me only relevant code which, as an experienced coder, is what i want. my favorites were the one line responses. Now it often falls back to generating full examples, explanations, restating the question and its approach. I suspect this is by design as (presumably) less experienced folks want or need all that. For me, i wish i could consistently turn it into one of those way too terse devs that replies with the bare minimum example, and expects you to infer the rest. Usually that is all i want or need, and i can ask for elaboration when not the case.

It seems increasingly apparent that we are reaching the limits of throwing more data at more GPUs; that an ARC prize level breakthrough is needed to move the needle any farther at this point. reply lolinder 2 hours agoparent> It seems increasingly apparent that we are reaching the limits of throwing more data at more GPUs Yes. This is exactly why I'm skeptical of AI doomerism/saviorism. Too many people have been looking at the pace of LLM development over the last two (2) years, modeled it as an exponential growth function, and come to the conclusion that AGI is inevitable in the next ${1-5} years and we're headed for ${(dys|u)topia}. But all that assumes that we can extrapolate a pattern of long-term exponential growth from less than two years of data. It's simply not possible to project in that way, and we're already seeing that OpenAI has pivoted from improving on GPT-4's benchmarks to reducing cost, while competitors (including free ones) catch up. All the evidence suggests we've been slowing the rate of growth in capabilities of SOTA LLMs for at least the past year, which means predictions based on exponential growth all need to be reevaluated. reply cjalmeida 2 hours agorootparentIndeed.All exponential growth curves are sigmoids in disguise. reply ToValueFunfetti 46 minutes agorootparentThis is something that is definitionally true in a finite universe, but doesn't carry a lot of useful predictive value in practice unless you can identify when the flattening will occur. If you have a machine that converts mass into energy and then uses that energy to increase the rate at which it operates, you could rightfully say that it will level off well before consuming all of the mass in the universe.

Its easy to sell dollars for $0.75 but you can only do that for so long. reply RicoElectrico 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't think we are approaching limits, if you take off the English-centric glasses. You can query LLMs about pretty basic questions about Polish language or literature and it's gonna either bullshit or say it doesn't know the answer.

Jest to skrót od nazwy \"ekspres do kawy\", czyli urządzenia służącego do szybkiego przygotowania kawy. The correct answer is that \"ekspres\" is a zipper in Łódź dialect. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparentWhat this means is just that Polish support (and probably most other languages besides English) in the models is behind SOTA. We can gradually get those languages closer to SOTA, but that doesn't bring us closer to AGI. reply nprateem 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's just same same but different, not a step change towards significant cognitive ability. reply andrepd 1 hour agorootparentprevTbf, you can ask it basic questions in English and it will also bullshit you. reply happyhardcore 3 hours agoparentprevI suspect this is why OpenAI is going more in the direction of optimising for price / latency / whatever with 4o-mini and whatnot.

The same world where we know for a fact that multiple GenAI demos by multiple companies were just completely faked. It's weird.

That if they had simply doubled the parameters on Llama 405b it would score way better on benchmarks and become the new state-of-the-art by a long mile? I mean, going by their own model evals on various benchmarks (https://llama.meta.com/), Llama 405b scores anywhere from a few points to almost 10 points more than than Llama 70b even though the former has ~5.5x more params. As far as scale in concerned, the relationship isn't even linear. Which in most cases makes sense, you obviously can't get a 200% on these benchmarks, so if the smaller model is already at ~95% or whatever then there isn't much room for improvement. There is, however, the GPQA benchmark. Whereas Llama 70b scores ~47%, Llama 405b only scores ~51%. That's not a huge improvement despite the significant difference in size. Most likely, we're going to see improvements in small model performance by way of better data. Otherwise though, I fail to see how we're supposed to get significantly better model performance by way of scale when the relationship between model size and benchmark scores is nowhere near linear. I really wish someone who's team \"scale is all you need\" could help me see what I'm missing. And of course we might find some breakthrough that enables actual reasoning in models or whatever, but I find that purely speculative at this point, anything but inevitable. reply nathanasmith 2 hours agorootparentprevThey also said in the paper that 405B was only trained to \"compute-optimal\" unlike the smaller models that were trained well past that point indicating the larger model still had some runway so had they continued it would have kept getting stronger. reply moffkalast 2 hours agorootparentMakes sense right? Otherwise why make a model so large that nobody can conceivably run it if not to optimize for performance on a limited dataset/compute?

The problem with this strategy is that it's really tough to compete with open models in this space over the long run. If you look at OpenAI's homepage right now they're trying to promote \"ChatGPT on your desktop\", so it's clear even they realize that most people are looking for a local product. But once again this is a problem for them because open models run locally are always going to offer more in terms of privacy and features. In order for proprietary models served through an API to compete long term they need to offer significant performance improvements over open/local offerings, but that gap has been perpetually shrinking. On an M3 macbook pro you can run open models easily for free that perform close enough to OpenAI that I can use them as my primary LLM for effectively free with complete privacy and lots of room for improvement if I want to dive into the details. Ollama today is pretty much easier to install than just logging into ChatGPT and the performance feels a bit more responsive for most tasks. If I'm doing a serious LLM project I most certainly won't use proprietary models because the control I have over the model is too limited. At this point I have completely stopped using proprietary LLMs despite working with LLMs everyday. Honestly can't understand any serious software engineer who wouldn't use open models (again the control and tooling provided is just so much better), and for less technical users it's getting easier and easier to just run open models locally. reply pzo 1 hour agorootparentIn the long run maybe but it's going to take probably 5 years or more before laptops such as Macbook M3 with 64 GB RAM will be mainstream. Also it's going going to take a while before such models with 70B params will be bundled in Windows and Mac with system update. Even more time before you will have such models inside your smartphone. OpenAI did a good move with making GPTo mini so dirty cheap that it's faster and cheaper to run than LLama 3.1 70B. Most consumers will interact with LLM via some apps using LLM API, Web Panel on desktop or native mobile app for the same reason most people use GMail etc. instead of native email client.

It remains surprising how transparent many of these companies are about new approaches that push the SoTa forward, and I suspect we're going to see a change. That companies won't reveal the secret sauce so readily. e.g. Almost the entire market relies upon Attention Is All You Need paper detailing transformers, and it would be an entirely different market if Google had held that as a trade secret. reply talldayo 3 hours agorootparentGiven how absolutely pitiful the proprietary advancements in AI have been, I would posit we have little to worry about. reply jsheard 2 hours agorootparentOTOH the companies who are sharing their breakthroughs openly aren't yet making any money, so something has to give. Their research is currently being bankrolled by investors who assume there will be returns eventually, and eventually can only be kicked down the road for so long. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentSort of yes, sort of no. Of course, I agree that Stability AI made Stable Diffusion freely available and they're worth orders of magnitude less than OpenAI. To the point they're struggling to keep the lights on. But it doesn't necessarily make that much difference whether you openly share the inner technical details. When you've got a motivated and well financed competitor, merely demonstrating a given feature is possible, showing the output and performance and price, might be enough. If OpenAI adds a feature, who's to say Google and Facebook can't match it even though they can't access the code? reply thruway516 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, that's because the potential reward from picking the right horse is MASSIVE and the cost of potentially missing out is lifelong regret. Investors are driven by FOMO more than anything else. They know most of these will be duds but one of these duds could turn out to be life changing. So they will keep bankrolling as long as they have the money. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparentprevEventually can be (and has been) bankrolled by Nvidia. They did a lot of ground-floor research on GANs and training optimization, which only makes sense to release as public research. Similarly, Meta and Google are both well-incentivized to share their research through Pytorch and Tensorflow respectively.

Given how large these models are getting, this is an important thing to do before making performance better again. reply skybrian 2 hours agoparentprevI think it’s impressive that they’re doing it on a single (large) node. Costs matter. Efficiency improvements like this will probably increase capabilities eventually. I’m also optimistic about building better (rather than bigger) datasets to train on. reply m3kw9 2 hours agoparentprevThere is different directions AI have lots to improve: multi modal which branch into robotics, single modal like image, video, and sound generation and understanding. Also would check back when openAI releases 5 reply lossolo 2 hours agoparentprevFor some time, we have been at a plateau because everyone has caught up, which essentially means that everyone now has good training datasets and uses similar tweaks to the architecture. It seems that, besides new modalities, transformers might be a dead end as an architecture. Better scores on benchmarks result from better training data and fine-tuning. The so-called 'agents' and 'function calling' also boil down to training data and fine-tuning. reply speed_spread 3 hours agoparentprevBenchmarks scores aren't good because they apply to previous generations of LLMs. That 2.23% uptick can actually represent a world of difference in subjective tests and definitely be worth the investment. Progress is not slowing down but it gets harder to quantify. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agoparentprevThis is already what the chinchilla paper surmised, it's no wonder that their prediction now comes to fruition. It is like an accelerated version of Moore's Law, because software development itself is more accelerated than hardware development. reply chipdart 3 hours agoparentprev> It seems increasingly apparent that we are reaching the limits of throwing more data at more GPUs; I think you're just seeing the \"make it work\" stage of the combo \"first make it work, then make it fast\". Time to market is critical, as you can attest by the fact you framed the situation as \"on par with GPT-4o and Claude Opus\".

This is similar to the early days of the search engine wars, the browser wars, and other categories where a user can easily adopt, switch between and use multiple.

    "originBody": "Taking my diabetes treatment into my own hands 2024-07-23 First of all, this blogpost is kinda long. Let me prove to you reading it will actually have some payoff: OK, now that you’ll stay, let’s start from the beginning… I’m a Type 1 diabetic. This means my pancreas doesn’t produce insulin (which allows cells to use blood glucose for energy) and I have to provide it externally. This is a finnicky process, because you need to balance your glucose in the right “zone” - not too high (hyperglycemia, >10 mmol/l, is a long-term danger to your body) and not too low (hypoglycemia,Int -> List OutputRow simulate input days = ... mySchedule : Input mySchedule = { basalInsulin = Intake BasalInsulin (22 * 60) 32 , bolusInsulins = [ Intake BolusInsulin (10 * 60) 18 , Intake BolusInsulin (13 * 60) 22 , Intake BolusInsulin (19 * 60) 21 ] , carbs = [ Intake Carbs (10 * 60) 24 , Intake Carbs (13 * 60) 60 , Intake Carbs (19 * 60) 60 , Intake Carbs (22 * 60) 24 ] } myPrediction : List OutputRow myPrediction = simulate mySchedule 3 Never have I copied the resulting CSV into Google Sheets so fast. Tada: Oh, wait, that’s not it. Cool piece of accidental art though! Now let me use the correct column for the X axis. Well hot damn. The graph actually makes sense! Granted, it’s not me in the graph but I can simulate someone now! Let’s stash away “I need to actually simulate me, you know” as a TODO for future Martin and continue. Next I made a Windows Forms application with an OxyPlot chart so that I don’t need to write a CSV to a file and manually copy it to Google Sheets. Aside: what do you .NET folks use nowadays? MAUI? WPF? Xamarin Forms? It’s kinda confusing for an outsider. This took me a while to figure out (I’m not a C# guy; honestly I’ve thought about rewriting this into F# instead the moment I had to start learning about event handlers and delegates), but I succeeded: There’s one little issue with seeing just the first day of the simulation though, and that’s the fact that I inject my basal (long-acting) insulin at 22:00. So for the majority of the first day the glucose will just be higher because I haven’t injected the long-acting insulin yet. So let’s simulate more days just to see what happens. Oh wow, it gets periodic by day 3! Cool! As you can see I’ve also added the hypo- and hyperglycemic ranges so that it’s clearer where the “Goldilocks zone” lies. As it turns out, my insulin dosage is absolutely inappropriate for the person simulated by SmartCGMS right now. Hitting such severe hypoglycemia, they’d probably be dead by now (or their liver has to work overtime on dosing that emergency glucose). OK, well then, now it’s just a small step from simulating a hardcoded mySchedule : Input mySchedule = { basalInsulin = Intake BasalInsulin (22 * 60) 32 , bolusInsulins = [ Intake BolusInsulin (10 * 60) 18 , Intake BolusInsulin (13 * 60) 22 , Intake BolusInsulin (19 * 60) 21 ] , carbs = [ Intake Carbs (10 * 60) 24 , Intake Carbs (13 * 60) 60 , Intake Carbs (19 * 60) 60 , Intake Carbs (22 * 60) 24 ] } to automatically finding a more optimal dosage! I’ve opened the NuGet package manager, wrote genetic and installed the most popular package: GeneticSharp. Turns out it’s really solid. It needed me to provide the usual stuff: chromosomes, crossover, selection, population size, termination criteria… and the fitness function. The fitness function actually deserves a fuller description. It looks like this: fitness : Input -> Float fitness input = let output : List OutputRow output = simulate input 3 longtermHypos = output |> List.takeLast (24*60) |> List.count (\\row -> row.bloodGlucoseList.takeLast (24*60) |> List.count (\\row -> row.bloodGlucose >= 10) ... longtermHyposNormalized = longtermHypos / List.length output longtermHypersNormalized = longtermHypers / List.length output ... longtermHyposWeight = 15 longtermHypersWeight = 12 ... weightSum = longtermHyposWeight + longtermHypersWeight + ... in ( longtermHyposNormalized * longtermHyposWeight + longtermHypersNormalized * longtermHypersWeight + ... ) / weightSum (Yes I know stuff is computed needlessly here; in the real C# code I’m doing all the intermediate result reuse you wish I did here, but I’m optimizing for understanding instead here.) Turns out I care about many things. The following list evolved gradually but I’m only giving you the final version: minimize # of hypoglycemic readings in the (stabilized) last day minimize # of hyperglycemic readings in the last day as small amplitude between min and max glucose reading as possible in the last day minimize the sum of bolus insulin dosages minimize the basal insulin dosage minimize # of hypoglycemic readings in the stabilization phase (first 2 days) minimize # of hyperglycemic readings in the stabilization phase Note that I don’t care about all of those equally. I’ve actually sorted the above list by priority: long-term hypos are the most urgent, the temporary hypers while the system settles I care about the least. I’m encoding that via the weights. Each of the normalized measurements is a number 0..1, which then gets multiplied by the weight. I’m not quite sure whether this is the right way to encode multiple concerns into a single number, but it’s the best I could come up with without consulting math books, and it seems to work well. At least I couldn’t find a case where an input with lower (better) fitness was less preferable to me (according to my brain’s fuzzy intuition) than another input with higher (worse) fitness. If I was able to construct all the values and sort them, I’d probably do something like allCombinations |> List.sortBy (\\output -> [ longtermHypos output , longtermHypers output , amplitude output , ... ] ) (that is, I can order outputs pairwise), but that’s not how the genetic programming libraries work. I believe explicitly not going through the whole space is one of their very top priorities :) Aside: how many inputs are there? This to me looks like permutations with repetitions (order does matter), n^r , so in my case injectionPossibilities ^ injectionCount, and for my specific example schedule, 51^4 (assuming I can inject 0..50 units of insulin). That’s around 6.7 million. So this could be bruteforceable. But I have to run the whole simulation inside the fitness function, and it takes around a second or two. At least it’s parallelizable then! (And believe me, I’m making use of my 16 cores.) Given it’s a pure function (basically… the results vary around the 10th decimal digit - negligible), I can memoize the fitness function for the input of four ints. The genetic algorithm ends up repeating some guesses quite a lot near the end of the simulation, so this actually saves a lot of time. Writing a memoization function in C# was a breath of fresh air, coming from the pure FP world of Elm: private Dictionary, double> fitnessCache = new(new IntakesSameAmount()); // ... if (fitnessCache.TryGetValue(amounts, out var cachedFitness)) return cachedFitness; // ... var fitness = Fitness(newInput); fitnessCache.Add(amounts, fitness); return fitness; Amazing what you can do with a bit of mutation. Yeah I’ll go return my Elm badge now. So, with this fitness function created, I can now run the genetic algorithm. Let’s add a button and some more info to the UI, and start it off! WELL HOT DAMN. It has optimized the insulin intakes and the patient (again, sadly not me) is now stable inside the 4-10 mmol/l range. That’s really magical. I feel like I’ve solved diabetes. Of course it’s not as simple. There will always be unexpected things and changes you need to react to. You’ll have hypers, you’ll have hypos and it’s OK. But still. It managed to squeeze the blood glucose into the correct range. So, what do I need to make this useful to me? I feel like interactivity would go a long way. Being able to add injections or meals, move them up and down, left and right, and seeing the graph change based on that, would give the diabetic much better understanding than the “OK I’m gonna inject more before lunch today and see what happens two hours from now” feedback loop, or even worse, the “consult a doctor every three months” one. Did I mention I’m a big fan of short feedback loops? Of course, it needs to simulate me instead of somebody else. I can’t use these optimized dosages because my body reacts differently. I need to consult this with the SmartCGMS folks, but the process will likely involve me downloading my historical blood glucose data off my Freestyle Libre sensor and somebody somewhere fitting the model parameters to that data. The math escapes me but it can be done. Another issue is that the algorithm is optimized for pumps, and my basal (long-acting) insulin will need to be tracked into the model a bit differently. Right now it’s as if I was injecting 1/24-th of the dosage every hour, instead of the full dosage once a day. But once the specific insulin brand and its behaviour is tracked in the software, I will be able to call .ScheduleInsulinBasal(double units) and all should be well (and more precise), hopefully. So, there’s a bunch of stuff yet to be done and collaborate with the SmartCGMS folks on, but I’m really excited by this, and feel empowered taking care of my diabetes better than I thought I could. WE’VE GOT THE TECHNOLOGY! Genetic algorithms and Markov Chains, baby! What’s that? I didn’t mention Markov Chains once in the article? Oh yeah, well, I experimented with a bunch of stuff. To end off the blogpost, here’s a stupid random walk arriving at a value iteratively. (Change each intake by a random value -2..+2, and if the fitness of that tweaked input is better, keep the change, otherwise rollback.) < Previous Post Notes from Elm Camp 2024 Archive Twitter Github",

Metformin, and Trulicity. Although Trulicty has been hard to find recently, so I'm doing without and working harder on my management practices, which is working well. I am not a doctor and I don't know you. Interesting range of comments. I think that whatever you do to manage your diabetes, logging data (meds, food, glucose, weight and bp for me) makes it more effective. I've found that managing my diabetes and weight is better when I log. Just a text file. It keeps me honest with myself, and keeps my management practices front-of-mind. It's encouraging when I'm doing well, even very slightly exciting. And since I've learned not to beat myself up, it's gently self-corrective. Going off logging, I slide out of control. Anyway, that works for me, so it should work for anyone. Right? :-) reply supertofu 4 hours agoprevI'm prediabetic with two T2 parents and a T2 grandparent and my primary care doctor is entirely unconcerned about it. My lowish tech solution to delay (and hopefully prevent!) the onset of T2 is to use a glucose monitor every 2 hours, every day, and create a database of foods with my postprandial blood sugar reaponse at 1.5 and 2 hours. I also keep track of how exercise affects my blood sugar. Over the last couple years, I have gotten great data on the foods which spike me and the foods which are neutral to my blood glucose. A lot of foods doctors/the internet tout as \"diabetic friendly\" (like beans, lentils, corn in any form, brown rice, buckwheat groats, non-granny-smith apples) spike me like crazy. Other foods are totally fine (bananas, snap peas, nuts, steel cut oatmeal, fermented dairy, fish). Having an autoimmune disorder on top of the prediabetes, I've learned that the only one who cares about my health and longevity is me. My doctors care about my inflammatory markers and nothing else. reply beauzero 1 hour agoparentJust anecdotal. Was T2 and getting kidney stones every two or three months (cause not related but treatment was). Cut out oxalates which restricted diet. Monitored sugar 3-5 times daily. Switched to carnivore diet + onions and mushrooms and went on Metformin. All at the same time. Did this for 2.5 months with no additional exercise. This dropped me down below T2 level. Went off Metformin and am maintaining with same daily testing. Off carnivore for paleo minus anything with oxalates after the 2.5 months strict carnivore. Strict carnivore for me was steak, hamburger, stew meat fried in butter, mushrooms and onions in butter, bacon, and very sharp cheddar (only on burgers or raw). Eat every bit of gristle and fat. It is very hard to get enough fat. Brain fog lasted for 10-11 days. Felt fantastic after that. To keep your carnivore costs down I would recommend stew meat from Costco fried with onions and mushrooms when you can't stand steak or plain burgers. This has worked for me for the last 6 months. I have no idea what it will be long term. Maybe someone will find something useful in it. reply thrwwyfrobvrsns 3 minutes agorootparentSumo wrestlers kind of fascinate me in this regard. It's very rare to find a professional who is diabetic, even though they eat one big carb-heavy meal a day and are morbidly obese. IIRC, this is explained by their low visceral fat levels, which are driven by high adiponectin levels that are themselves driven by their intense workouts and consistent sleep habits. Their high subcutaneous fat proportion is actually thought to be protective. T2D catches up to them after they retire and stop exercising and sleeping well. Their experience touches on 3 factors: >Exercise volume (which, according to newer research, should be spread out over the course of the day) >Diet (which should be focused not just on maintaining steady, low blood sugar levels, but on dietary factors that encourage subcutaneous rather than visceral fat deposition) >Sleep quality The last, I think, is extremely undervalued. My father developed T2 in his 30s, and it progressed consistently until he was diagnosed with sleep apnea and received treatment. Around the same time, his work schedule finally became more reasonable after a career of early mornings and late nights. This is someone who had to pass annual physical fitness exams for his job, cooked and ate relatively healthily, etc. I'm convinced it was the years of poor sleep that set him up for insulin resistance. reply nextos 36 minutes agorootparentprevCheck the work of David Unwin from NHS, who has reversed T2D in many patients using dietary interventions: https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2015/08/dr-david-unwin-publi... This publication is a good starting point to his approach.

I think that children are generally raised to not believe there is \"risk\" associated with listening to experts. This means specialists like Doctors but also politicians and military officials. The idea that there could be a grift set up to take advantage of people in the medical space, for instance, which is highly regulated and supposed to be for the benefit of people first and for generating capital second, is not intuitive to children. In fact a wide array of industries and services in the United States, and the world (to not be political, as some commenter said) are set up to take advantage of children or naive young adults. Secondary education and student loans is a glaring example of this. > The default state is for none of these services and protections to exist whatsoever In all of human history this is mostly untrue. Humans have always formed societies, and those societies have always provided services for their people. In fact, before capitalism, most of these services were provided in-kind as a right of being a part of the tribe. This idea that every person is born as an individual and nothing is granted to them belongs to a certain political ideology that is designed to make sure people feel entitled to nothing, and keep things in the private industry, and keep government small. But I digress. Of course someone has to provide the service, and collect the materials for the service. And that person deserves to be compensated for that work. But the idea that the default state of a human is to be alone with nature and subject to pure individualism is simply not true, and never has been the norm, until that idea was used to justify not providing people with anything. > Everything beyond nothing is an imperfect and unstable solution held together with duct-tape This idea is also untrue.

The first thing I wanted to touch on is the idea of grift. Just because some has their interests ahead of yours doesn't mean they are a grifter. I think the childish view is the expectation that other people put your interests above their own, like the selflessness of a loving parent. A doctor doesnt put your individual wellbeing above their own, but that doesnt make them a grifter or a bad person. Expecting that kind of selflessness is entirely unrealistic, and is what causes cognitive dissonance when it clashes with reality. Thats not to say that grifters dont exist, who actively manipulate and deceive, but simply having unrealistic expectations for something does not make it a grift. One example would when a doctor doesn't provide the depth of care an consideration the patient would expect from a selfless caregiver. Most people come to the realization that they need to provide the drive and motivation for their own care, and doctors are just hired experts to help with things you cant do. You have to manage them and tell them what you want them to do, and if you dont, they will do very little indeed. >Humans have always formed societies, and those societies have always provided services for their people.

I mean that these things are not guaranteed entitlements, but conditional on human relations, standing, and mutual exchange. That is to say, they took work to maintain and were subject to constant scrutiny and mutual consent. Even in a tribe, goods and services were not provided unconditionally as some human birthright associated with tribal membership. Instead, they were conditional on good standing and mutual consent. >This idea is also untrue. We've had a lot of time to perfect these things.

Skipping over the capitalistic and legal issues, which people more or less expect, I'd like to zoom in on your item #3. The fact that doctors are (often) clueless for complex diagnostics (not talking about a broken arm, etc.) is shocking to many people. I think the two main factors driving this outcome are: 1. Due to the complexity of the problems they face and the quick diagnosis expected from them, medical professionals are taught to think in an expert system-like if-then statements. Some of these are rules of thumb, some may no longer apply due to latest research, and some may not be applicable to you. 2. Metabolisms may differ in important ways. A new doctor is trying to make a decision in a highly complicated high dimensional space with the few data points that you provide. This is OK, but they get too confident with their diagnosis. reply xeromal 3 hours agoparentprevThere's a time in every human's life where the rose tinted glasses wear off and the reality of human living hits you. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentagreed.

Reasons why should be obvious, but listening to podcasts, or reading pop-science books, connecting the dots and thinking you’re qualified to give, again, life-threatening advice, does not mean you’re actually qualified or you have an idea of how deep the rabbit hole goes (as we are learning, nobody really does). Unfortunately, in my experience I encounter a lot of people who haven’t opened up an intro to biology book since their teenager days let alone an undergraduate biochem book, but they listen to podcasts and think they have it figured out and have the audacity to speak with confidence. I’ve been in situations where the practitioners are wincing but are too polite to call people out - it’s easier to let them just yap out what the podcast said and then change the topic.

Managing the condition isn't too difficult after 30 years of it, but dealing with the politics of NHS diabetes care is astronomically more difficult than it was in any decade previously. In my experience, if you are not pregnant, or you aren't at risk of passing out in the next 15 minutes, they don't care. Whatever long term consequences you experience are another department's responsibility. A trend I've seen is that younger diabetes nurses and doctors are extremely dependant on tech (CGMs, insulin pumps), but don't comprehend how they work or what the data means. They don't know what patterns to look for beyond a 24hr window and generally seem to think everything is a bolus ratio or basal problem, overlooking other settings such as correction factor, duration, etc. Because they are tech illiterate, vendor lock-in is becoming an issue, as no health tech companies want you using another tool except the one they get paid for. So I find myself being swapped from platform to platform as they change my devices every year or so, each one being less workable than the last.

Ask yourself - what caused the NHS to get into this situation? Certainly reversing those causes would be a good first step to improving the service and fixing the issues they've caused.

Most of the time it'll turn out to be completely innocuous, but you'll go to the doctor and they'll decide between it's fine, monitoring, invasive investigation, and urgent treatment. Obviously if the test itself is invasive (e.g. has a dose of radiation) then that is something that needs to be compared against the potential benefit. I certainly would not have a preventative head CT scan. However if we're talking about things like an MRI, urine/stool test, or even something like a blood panel that has extremely low risks for most apparently healthy people (I donate blood 6x a year anyway - why not take some of that and test it), then why is it so different to a skin check, besides the cost? reply apwell23 4 hours agorootparent> Obviously if the test itself is invasive (e.g. has a dose of radiation) then that is something that needs to be compared against the potential benefit.

Say you're 40 and you get a positive PSA result, maybe that means your risk of having prostate cancer has gone from (for illustrative purposes) 0.1% to 2%. That means the next step is \"what do you do to someone who has a 1 in 50 chance of having prostate cancer?\", and the answer is almost certainly not a biopsy or anything majorly invasive. The answer might be a finger up the butt, an MRI, monitoring for symptoms, repeat the test in a year, etc. The problem is that patients aren't used to handling these ambiguous results from tests because we don't do much routine testing, and doctors don't want to face the potential consequences for getting a positive test result and recommending against invasive treatment. However, in many cases, a test would still tell you something useful even if it won't directly be used to escalate to a more invasive test or treatment. For example, if a routine blood test shows prediabetes (which has happened to a few people I know when having blood tests for unrelated matters), you won't get any treatment for it, but you may be referred to a dietician and have a fire lit up under your ass to make those lifestyle changes you've been putting off. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't know why you would expect the healthcare system to do all of that stuff.

But if that's their job, they'll eventually be replaced by LLMs. When you don't fall into the typical case, you'll have to go through retelling the whole story to all the flowchart ones (easily 80%) only to find along the way snake oil salesmen (10%), honest \"I can't take your case\" individuals (5%), and the 1-5% which actually feel like scientists and problem solvers.

I'm not sure why the educational requirements are so extreme for all doctors. Certainly for some, like surgeons, I get it, but for my GP I think it's a total farce. I don't make the rules though, I just can see a broken system when it's right in front of me. reply IggleSniggle 5 hours agorootparentNot sure how it is outside the US, but subscribing nurse-practitioners (requires just 2 additional years after a nursing degree) have been quickly replacing GP docs in the US for this reason. They'll send you to a specialist just like a GP would. It's all the same problems in terms of the underlying model, but the financial and time costs to the system are lower. I'm not totally sold on what I'm selling though. My spouse has been a nurse practitioner for over 10 years; she had the option of becoming an MD but picked that route because she saw the grueling 80+ hr work weeks of older doctor friends and decided it wasn't for her. Unfortunately, she's still stuck with only 20 minutes for sometimes extremely complex patients that require a great deal of research and follow-through outside of work hours, and the extra slack in the system that is provided by her lower wages has just gone to hiring additional administrative middlemen that are seldom capable of actually filling in the gap, whether for reasons of liability, knowledge, skill, or motivation. These positions exist to try and ease the pressure on docs just like NPs exist to ease the pressure on docs, but it doesn't work because at the end of the day you need someone who can hold the liability (both legal and moral) and the knowledge (the correct diagnosis and the correct plan of action) within the same person. Just like in software, where throwing more developers at a problem doesn't guarantee your problem gets solved more efficiently, for much the same reason. You need somebody who understands the domain, understands the tools, understands the business framework, and is ready to take responsibility for solving the problem.

It should be called insulin resistance or chronic carbohydrate overdose. I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic/T2. I started wearing a cgm and watching how various foods affected my blood sugar. I eliminated foods that caused spikes, and started cooking my own meals so I could control what went into them. I wound up with a very low carb diet of meat and vegetables, and a very stable blood sugar with NO spikes ever. According to my blood work and checkups I cured my NAFLD, cured my hypertension (including getting off drugs for that), and \"cured\" my pre-diabetes. I lost a lot of weight, but still have a lot more to lose. I put cured in quotes because I don't think this diet can cure you once you're bad enough to need treatment. I think it can only put your disease into remission so that you don't suffer any health effects from it. Some of us just can't overeat carbs or we develop this disease, and the only effective treatment is to stop eating the carbs. reply fortran77 5 hours agorootparentThere are some people with T2D—a minority of them—who are not overweight.

Doing so with mild T2 diabetes could lead to complete remission (as long as the diet is kept). In more advanced T2 diabetes it could lead to significant improvement, and reduction of required medication. People with T1 diabetes simply don't produce enough insulin. External insulin is required. Management of T1 diabetes is also way more complicated and mistakes are immediately life threatening. Are you familiar with Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's approach? It is a very low carb diet (he doesn't call it Keto as Ketosis is not the aim) combined with a lifetime of experience managing it. See his book The Diabetes Solution, his Youtube channel, and the Type1Grit facebook group. There are a lot of type 1s running There are people who take insulin pumps (which provide insulin in very small very frequent doses and are ~permanently injected into your body, but are otherwise dumb as a brick) and combine them with continuous glucose monitors, and make the glucose measurements inform and control the pump. This is called “closed loop” or “artificial pancreas”, and getting one officially is very hard or impossible: not FDA approved yet / you need to be part of an university study to get one / … It’s one of those things that “will be here in 5 years”, they say every year for the past 30 years. I've had a Medtronic CGM and pump for 6 years now (680G, now 780G). It is an FDA approved system with feedback from the CGM to the pump. The only thing I needed to get insurance approval was a blood test showing that I was T1 and not T2. The auto mode has been greatly improved in the 780G pump vs. the 680G pump. I only need to stick my finger a couple times a week, and my control has improved. Without the pump and MDI it was quite a bit higher. It's nowhere near as good as an actual pancreas, but it is definitely not vaporware by any stretch of the imagination. The Medtronic support is (mostly good), and I have a pretty high degree of confidence that it will keep me alive. I do have Kwikpens as backup in case of malfunctions - which do happen. The biggest things for me are as simple as ripping your infusion set out while away from home, or the thing has an intractable Bluetooth communications problem or other kind of hardware error.

This weekend the CGM was saying she was all the sudden at 40, but she was at about 115. I am scared to think what would happen in the night if the closed loop system thought it needed to raise her blood sugar... Logically I know it wouldnt raise it to a point that would cause medical harm, it would still put it higher than would be ideal for her health. Maybe there are differences between the different brands, but the G7 from Dexcom's big selling point was \"no more calibrations\" and the FDA approval for that tagline, and we've been seeing a need to calibrate more than the G6, which is disappointing.

Also, if you have an android phone (I have a separate android exclusively for CGM use), there are open source apps that can connect to Libre 3 sensors and let you export data in several formats[0].

Unfortunately the pump vibrates/alarms far too much, causing notification fatigue. I don't even look at them anymore. I wish there was more information in the vibration pattern: just morse code or something, so I can know what the pump is saying without having to do 3 taps to unlock and see whether it's just telling me something I know already.

But the body is unpredictable, so the up correction is needed to prevent hypos. The one thing we currently have is automated glucagon delivery, but this has severe downsides: - Liquid glucagon can last only 24-48 hours at room temperature - Once glycogen storage in the liver is depleted, glucagon does help promote blood sugar production, but the effect is way lessened and unpredictable. - The liver‘s glycogen storage is for many T1Ds a life saver in case they have a severe hypo. Injecting glucagon can deplete glycogen so you lose this buffer when you really need it - meaning you won’t wake up again when otherwise you would have. So ideally, one would inject glucose directly, but that’s a volume/convenience problem.

As always - $€£ reply mono812 8 hours agoprevInteresting stuff! I'm a late T1D and there is just so much that subtly influences your blood sugar levels. I adhere to quite a strict diet and adapt my insuline dosage based on not just the carb contents and glycemic load of the meal, but also the starting point / trends I see in my libre readings. If you can predictably consume carbs (and glycemic load) you can also inject early with confidence (or even post-meal if your meal is really 'slow' or your blood sugar level is low). Going for a 20-30 minute walk during a meal spike (mostly after breakfast and lunch) does wonders for me too. I manage to maintain roughly 99% TIR (4-10mmol/l) on my Libre with this, virtually no hypos and just the occassional bit of hyperglycemia when I just don't want to care. Although obviously this does require you to plan a lot of things in advance and requires effort and all of this is just based off of personal experience and experimentation and does not necessarily translate to anyone else. I'm still really hoping for a more low-effort solution to T1D treatment (or even a cure), but I'm skeptical that we'll see that anytime soon. reply vallassy 7 hours agoparentI still haven't found a tactful way to bring this up, but have you considered a low- or zero-carb diet?

Unless the reason they got it is because of some autoimmune timebomb that's genetically programmed to go off in the 30s and destroy the pancreas. reply jevogel 2 hours agorootparentFFor more context: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. Your own immune cells attack your insulin-producing beta cells in your pancreas, leading you to lose the ability to produce insulin to absorb glucose from the blood. You will lose weight, be frequently thirsty, and have to pee frequently. T1D seems to have a genetic factor which you can be tested for. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a lifestyle disease where you become less sensitive to the insulin that your body produces. It can be prevented by maintaining healthy diet, exercise, and weight, and it can usually be detected early as prediabetes. There may be a genetic factor predisposing you to T2D, but I don't know if there are tests for it. You need to know which disease your family had to know which answer it is.

This is probably also why apps like LibreLink don't provide predictions but only show historical data - easier to not get sued if you don't give the user advice that could kill them? Re models, differential equations and finding minima: I do agree genetic algo is a bit wonky, and the greedy random walk at the bottom was able to get similar results. Do you have some resources for optimizing a N_51 x N_51 x N_51 x N_51 -> R+ unknown black-box function? My googling led me to eg. Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but I don't currently get it (the translation to the probability domain escapes me). You're mentioning shooting method and bisection, I'll take a look at those. reply Mathnerd314 4 hours agorootparentSo Metropolis-Hastings for example is a probabilistic algorithm. You don't need a probabilistic algorithm. (Well, you do when you want to estimate your physiological parameters, the Bayesian stuff and so on, but that is a whole separate can of worms). I didn't look too carefully at your objective function but it looked continuous - small perturbations in input mean small changes in the objective function. Like hypoglycemic readings, you can easily calculate \"how hypoglyemic\" rather than a yes/no. Naturally there are places where the objective function isn't continuous and that's where you have to do a discrete-style search, but when it's mostly continuous there are well-known numerical methods. Like check out https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html, it isn't necessarily what you need but looking up the Wikipedia pages of the method names will be helpful. I've also found ChatGPT knows an insane amount of math, I wouldn't trust it to write a specific algorithm but it can give intelligent comparisons and list similar algorithms. What I was saying is I don't think N_51 is the right way to model a dose. I would model it as a real number in the interval [0,50]. I would still round whatever the model gave to what I could actually measure out decently, but within the model I would not use discrete numbers. reply Mathnerd314 1 hour agorootparentOh and regarding probabilistic stuff, I have been playing with PyMC, it seems eminently usable. There is some slightly more specialized software like Stan, and it is certainly worth looking at some Stan tutorials if you don't know anything about probabilistic programming, but PyMC is hackable and modular in a way that Stan is not. There is also tensorflow-probability but I couldn't get it to work, it seems not as active as PyMC.

If you have glucose in interstitial fluid, physical activity may help. See: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25427090 I did a paper on Functional Hypoglycemia a zillion years ago. I have a condition which puts me at high risk of diabetes. Some thoughts I'm not going to try to give citations for because it's based on decades of reading etc: The liver stores sugars that the body calls upon when you are hypoglycemic. Liver support, such as milk thistle, may help. (Tldr: you need to provide the building blocks for glutathione, which the liver uses a lot of. It cannot be consumed directly and must be manufactured in house.) Diabetes is associated with inflammation which may be caused by either infection or high acidity. You could get pH test strips to pee on and track your pH levels as another data stream and IF you see a correlation, treat that as well. Functional Hypoglycemia was traditionally managed with diet. I managed mine that way for years. Avoiding sugars and having fatty, high protein foods late in the day helped prevent middle of the night severe hypoglycemic attacks. Studies show aloe vera does good things for diabetes. Will it help T1? No idea. But you could read up on that and firsthand experience suggests to me it may remedy other issues that are pertinent to diabetes but maybe not recognized as directly related because it's more like an underlying issue. reply tornadofart 9 hours agoprevI'm a T1D and I mostly agree with the author. I think this simulation is very interesting. I disagree with the author however on the following point: \"injecting insulin ~15min before you start eating would do wonders for neutralizing the BG spike, the issue is, nobody does it, because what if you then get a smaller serving at the restaurant or it gets delayed?\" My doc told me the same, which I think is insane. \"Here is a hack that solves 80% of your problems but nobody does it, so don't bother.\" WTF? If you get a smaller serving, order some bread or eat some of your emergency snacks you should always have. If it gets delayed, do the same. You don't need to cover the whole insulin dose, just delay the hypo a little bit. Relax. We live in an industrial world where glucose bombs are available always and everywhere. You'll be fine. Injecting 15mins beforehand has made my life so much easier that I would not miss it for anything. Feel free to ask me anything. reply mjaniczek 9 hours agoparentYou're definitely making me reconsider it, thanks! Along with the person in another thread saying walks after meals help as well.

If Insulin is a 20 minute lag, and eating is a 20 minute lag. Shouldn't you just dose immediately before eating so they hit at the same time? reply mjaniczek 8 hours agorootparentIt's a very rough rule of thumb, take these numbers with a grain of salt. It could very well be that some food activates in 5 minutes etc. Different insulin types also have different curves. Anyways there are studies about the \"inject 15min before food\" approach: eg. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945151/ reply tornadofart 4 hours agorootparentprevYou forget one very important rule: it's all vibes :D No but seriously: insulin starts to act after 20mins. Its action is more like a flat parabola. Glucose acts more in harsh peaks. So you want the glucose peak to hit when you are at the maximum of insulin action. Hence the 15mins delay. This is all roughly speaking, YMMV. reply rozman50 12 hours agoprevA friend of mine had to take insulin dose daily. Talking around with people, he found out that diet with carbon hydrates (bread, potato, rice…) increased blood sugar.

We’re somewhat insulin-resistant in the morning. Plus some glucose is dumped into the bloodstream to wake us up. This requires some units of a fast acting insulin or else the BG will go up even if you don’t eat anything.

We researched more and more and found cutting out carbs heavily helped more than anything else, but she still needed some insulin. When mounjaro started getting a lot of attention, she tried that along with metformin. With those two drugs combined, she was able to get completely off insulin. She lost the weight gain from the 2 years of insulin, which reduced her resistance. She started having hypoglycemia and was able to reduce the metformin by half to get back to normal levels.

As will exercise itself etc. It is a valid argument and the doctor is right. reply caseyy 9 hours agoprevI completely agree with the author. T1Ds must take care of themselves. Doctors and nurses suffer from Dunning-Kruger massively. They will quite often be confidently incorrect. I’ve seen this living in large cities in the US and Europe. Or you can read about how medics often make potentially murderous decisions on diabetes treatment — there are plenty of stories. Humility is the cure. I say this as someone who went to medschool myself and I have a lot of respect for medics. The most infuriating thing is when they say that diabetics just die in surgeries, but forget to mention that often the reason is medical negligence. Anyone who has had their T1D loved ones go through general anesthesia surgery knows some of the things doctors tend to suggest, like going off the pump for a number of hours with no insulin replacement. Or demanding significant diet changes just before the anesthesia with no insulin adjustment. One doctor once told a patient I know their blood glucose is okay in the morning, so they don’t need to check before the general anesthesia surgery in the evening — the blood glucose only needs to be checked twice a day. I’m sure the care diagram in that hospital says that, but it’s with the assumption that the patient is conscious and actively managing blood glucose on their own. Another way I agree with the author is about closed loops. Many T1Ds, I believe, cannot have adequate control with the “one basal pattern and set carb ratio boluses” approach. Much less with multiple daily injections. Their daily insulin needs just fluctuate too much for an appointment with the doctor or nurse once or twice a year for dose adjustment. If the patient has any sort of hormonal deregulation day-to-day (which many of us do), it will just not work. My closed-loop total daily dose of insulin fluctuates between 90 and 220 units with very good control. Any sort of “roughly one total daily dose every day” approach will fail spectacularly in this case. Such a patient cannot achieve good control with traditional treatment, in my opinion. Though they sure are shamed a lot by doctors who, once again, Dunning-Kruger their way into thinking that treatment absolutely should work. All in all, closed-loop is leaving many medical teams dumbfounded, some are even afraid of it (and refuse funding or tell parents their treatment is good without closed loops), but it’s a life changer. And a patient with this disease always needs to take it into their own hands because the 30 minutes T1D of training in medschool that I got is absolutely nothing compared to years of first-hand experience patients like myself have. That’s why I don’t blame doctors for being misinformed, but I do blame them quite a bit for not realizing the shortcomings of an education that, once again, generally touches on the subject very little. reply nerdponx 9 hours agoparent> The most infuriating thing is when they say that diabetics just die in surgeries, but forget to mention that often the reason is medical negligence. I find that a lot of medical research literature is like this. A couple of \"X is associated with increased mortality\" papers that make no attempt at a causal analysis is enough to get doctors to recommend against X. As far as I can tell, the organizations that make these recommendations don't want to run the risk that maybe the relationship is causal, and moreover don't know all the mediating/moderating factors and so can't safely recommend something that is associated with harming people even if they realize it's not necessarily causal. The inverse is true for positive outcomes. Y is associated with lower mortality, so we recommend Y, even though we don't understand if it's causal or not. But we do not recommend Z which is closely similar to Y and, if there is a causal connection would share a common causal pathway with the Y benefit, because we have only studied Y and not Z. It's a weird kind of extreme causal reasoning that ironically leads to a kind of abandonment of causal reasoning. reply caseyy 8 hours agorootparentThis is definitely at least one contributing factor to the situation. But another one is that many medics sadly refuse to learn from a patient. Even when the patient is an expert in practice. A cure for these kinds of issues in medicine and in software engineering is humility. We must understand our knowledge is incomplete. Our learnings are often the best that circumstances allowed us to learn, but not the best one could learn. reply monero-xmr 12 hours agoprev [–] For those of you on the cusp of diabetes, immediately start working out intensely and reduce your sugar intake.

Google is now the only search engine that can surface results from Reddit, making one of the web’s most valuable repositories of user generated content exclusive to the internet’s already dominant search engine. If you use Bing, DuckDuckGo, Mojeek, Qwant or any other alternative search engine that doesn’t rely on Google’s indexing and search Reddit by using “site:reddit.com,” you will not see any results from the last week. DuckDuckGo is currently turning up seven links when searching Reddit, but provides no data on where the links go or why, instead only saying that “We would like to show you a description here but the site won't allow us.” Older results will still show up, but these search engines are no longer able to “crawl” Reddit, meaning that Google is the only search engine that will turn up results from Reddit going forward. Searching for Reddit still works on Kagi, an independent, paid search engine that buys part of its search index from Google. The news shows how Google’s near monopoly on search is now actively hindering other companies’ ability to compete at a time when Google is facing increasing criticism over the quality of its search results. And while neither Reddit or Google responded to a request for comment, it appears that the exclusion of other search engines is the result of a multi-million dollar deal that gives Google the right to scrape Reddit for data to train its AI products. “They’re [Reddit] killing everything for search but Google,” Colin Hayhurst, CEO of the search engine Mojeek told me on a call.

There's an established player with institutional protections, then a scrappy upstart takes a bunch of VC money, converts it into runway, gives away the product for free, gradually replaces and becomes the standard, then puts out an s-1 document saying \"we don't make money and we never have, want to invest?\" and then they start to enjoy all the institutional protections. Or they don't. Either way you pay yourself handsomely from the runway money so who cares. The upstart gets indexed and has an API, the established player doesn't. The upstart is more easily found and modular but the institutional player can refuse to be indexed to own their data and they can block their API to prevent ai slop from getting in and dominating their content. reply StrauXX 2 hours agoprevIANAL but as far as I understand the current legal status (in the US) a change in robots.txt or terms and conditions is not binding for web scrapers since the data is publicly accessible. Neither does displaying a banner \"By using this site you accept our terms and conditions\" change anything about that. The only thing that can make these kinds of terms binding is if the data is only accessible after proactively accepting terms. For instance by restricting the website until one has created an account.

For the first 19 years of life, reddit had a very permissive robots.txt. We allowed all by default and then only restricted certain poorly behaved agents (and Bender's Shiny Metal Ass(tm)) But I can understand why they made the change they did. The data was being abused. My guess is that this was an oversight -- that they will do an audit and reopen it for search engines after those engines agree not to use the data for training, because let's face it, reddit is a for profit business and they have to protect their income streams. reply Closi 3 hours agoparent> But I can understand why they made the change they did. The data was being abused. Depends how you see it - if you see it as 'their' data (legally true) or if you see it as user content (how their users would likely see it). If you see it as 'user content', they are actually selling the data to be abused by one company, rather than stopping it being abused at all. From a commercial 'lets sell user data and make a profit' perspective I get it, although does seem short-sighted to decide to effectively de-list yourself from alternative search engines (guess they just got enough cash to make it worth their while). reply Ajedi32 2 hours agorootparent> if you see it as 'their' data (legally true) Is that actually true? Reddit may indeed have a license to use that data (derived from their ToS), but I very much doubt they actually own the copyright to it. If I write a comment on Reddit, then copy-paste it somewhere else, can Reddit sue me for copyright infringement? reply jedberg 2 hours agorootparentThey own a non-exclusive worldwide right to it.

This is an absolutely terrible precedent. reply BeetleB 3 hours agorootparentI know people will hate to hear this, but Reddit it's not important to the A well being of the Internet. reply TeaBrain 2 hours agorootparentI think it's the other way around, in that people don't like to hear how Reddit has become important due to the death of independent forums and the degree to which information has become concentrated on the site. reply BeetleB 0 minutes agorootparentThe death of independent forums has been greatly exaggerated. Of all the forums I used to be active in, many are still active. The ones that died did so because the community died (i.e. they did not shift to Reddit and the like). Reddit is great simply because it allowed anyone to create a community. No need to get a LAMP stack and deal with security vulnerabilities in your forum SW. These days you have Lemmy and its ilk. Much higher barrier than the old LAMP stack, but also much superior to it. I do hope it takes off. jedberg 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you in theory, but in practice someone has to pay for all this magic. reply JohnMakin 3 hours agorootparentThis is a false dichotomy. You can have services, and not have them devolve into complete unusability in the name of profit. This isn’t sustainable either. The myopic pursuit of short term gains at the expense of the product will collapse at some point in the future, no matter how much you believe in this weird frog-boil internet we’ve inherited now. reply twelve40 2 hours agorootparentComplete unusability is when ai tools clone the content and people stop visiting the original service and participating. I'll leave it up to them to defend blocking duck duck go for example, but blocking \"AI\" bots for an online community is a matter of survival at this point. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparentAlternatively, it's because the base platform has also devolved into unusability. Both Reddit and Twitter are in a position where their info is easily scraped, and their community is barely worth the advertising/paid-premium experience they demand from you. As both platforms continue to decline in quality, you might not even need to replace the original service. Both businesses appear intent on getting replaced. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparentprev> The myopic pursuit of short term gains at the expense of the product will collapse at some point in the future, The myopic pursuit of short-term gains is the only playbook that works. Long-term business strategy is a gamble, and today's businesses have all learned that they'd rather make hay when the sun is shining than be remembered as a good business. Twitter tried a long-term playbook to reverse their unprofitable sinkhole of a website. That ended up with them being undervalued and sold to the highest bidder. reply ToucanLoucan 3 hours agorootparentprevWe did. As in we, the Internet, existed for a long time without anyone making money and we paid for the privilege. Websites were built and hosted at owner's expense, for years, with no expectation that they be financially rewarded. Sure some would run donation drives, or work with sponsors relevant to the community in question, but a whole ton, mine included, just cost me a lot of money over many years. Those websites were definitely technically inferior, as the march of progress is unavoidable, but web hosting is cheaper than it's ever been. A VPS that utterly blows away what mine was capable of in 2007 for nearly a hundred a month can now be had for about $10 per month. Yet everyone wants these monolith platforms, but even that wouldn't be the worst thing ever, except that every one of these platforms has a backend to support that we in the Old Internet never did: a C-suite's worth of executives and millions of shareholders, who for some reason have decided that reddit can't exist unless reddit makes them reams and reams of money. I'd be very, very interested to see how much of, even what's probably the most massive one of all, Facebook, is non-essential busywork that could easily be shut down tomorrow with no adverse effects to the platform. Firstly the entire executive class, just, they don't do shit to make Facebook the product. In fact I'd argue their decisions almost universally have made it worse as a product very consistently for it's entire lifetime. Then, all the marketing people. There's just no goddamn reason to advertise Facebook (or reddit for that matter) the brand is so ubiquitous, if you actually found someone who'd never heard of it, I'd give you a large chunk of money. Add to that, if Facebook was doing a good job of being what it ostensibly is, then people immediately become the best advertising, because people want to hang with people in these digital spaces. Then get rid of the people working to make Facebook addictive with dark patterns. Then get rid of the entire targeted ad division, because it's gross and inhumane. Pare the company down to engineers who build the product, and if anything, expand the moderation team so they can actually ensure the safety of the platform, and of course the IT staff to back them. Now what does Facebook cost to operate? As far as I'm concerned, this pearl-clutching about \"well websites have to make money\" is grossly, grossly overstated. Websites don't cost that much to run. A ton of money is being siphoned off by the MBA parasites playing games in Excel all day. A ton more is being wasted developing features that advertisers want and users hate. A ton more is being funneled into making products artificially addictive to vulnerable people, to exploit them, so let's just not do that. And of course, leadership, rewarding themselves with generous compensation packages they aren't even remotely able to justify. Now what does your website cost to maintain? Surely not nothing, and for websites of substantial size, it will still be high, but I'm willing to bet it's a hell, hell, hell of a lot less than it was before. reply kjkjadksj 3 hours agorootparentPart of the issue is that it isn’t just the web, but the inevitable american corporate shareholder model. Even businesses could be mom and pop ified and made way more popular overnight: quit raising prices and cutting corners and it would actually stand for itself like a massive $7 burrito. However the expectation is that shareholders get returns. Costs must be cut. Prices must be raised. Margins must be improved. It doesn’t matter if this eats the business alive, as shareholders are sufficiently leveraged. The whole system is incentivized to select for inferior quality and taking all the available money on the table. reply ToucanLoucan 3 hours agorootparentMy rant above and your response reminded me of all those tons of MMO games out there that are ancient, with a tiny playerbase, that remain profitable nonetheless simply because if you have a product that people like using, putting it into maintenance mode and doing the bare minimum to keep it running is a perfectly valid business strategy. The companies that buy these service games and run them effectively just buy completed money printers and keep them operating. It's not going to make anyone rich probably, but it's a perfectly valid and profitable way to go about things. The silicon valley \"grow at all costs, always evolve and innovate forever\" model is so detached from the reality of most businesses in my experience. reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparent>The companies that buy these service games and run them effectively just buy completed money printers and keep them operating. I hadn't really thought about that topic in that way before. Really explains why some of those older MMOs have no desire to really make any improvements, the owners are happy to just keep them powered up and collect a check but have no incentive to invest in making them better. reply ToucanLoucan 2 hours agorootparentI think the notion that sometimes things are just \"done\" is incredibly undervalued in our industry.

Popular websites that allow user content to be uploaded or linked do cost that much to run, due to content moderation. There might be a small (relatively) forum here and there that a few good moderators are willing to slave away at keeping clean, but you will never see a website that allows user content with as many users as Reddit/Youtube/Instagram/etc be cheap. Although, due to AI, the cost to spam the small forums might be so small that even they might come into the crosshairs. reply megaman821 55 minutes agorootparentAlthough it is quite surprising that mainly text websites (Reddit, Twitter) are hard to run sustainably but video and image websites (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) can because it is easier to sell ads against them. reply meiraleal 3 hours agorootparentprevhow can we keep paying the ever-growing profits of multi-trillion dollar companies?

They were banned from said sub. They inquired why they were banned, and they shared they would share any responses with a journalism org (to be transparent where any replies would be going, because they are going to a journalism org). They were muted by mods for 28 days and were \"told off\" in a very poor manner (per the screenshots I've seen) by the anonymous mod who replied to them. They were then banned from Reddit for 3 days after an appeal for \"harassment\"; when they requested more info about what was considered harassment, they were ignored. Ergo, inquiring as to how the mods of a major sub are automodding non-biased journalism sources (the AP, in this case) without any transparency appears to be considered harassment by Reddit. The interaction was submitted to the FTC through their complaint system to contribute towards their existing antitrust investigation of Reddit. Shared because it is unlikely Reddit responds except when required by law, so I recommend engaging regulators (FTC, and DOJ at the bare minimum) and legislators (primarily those focused on Section 230 reforms) whenever possible with regards to this entity. They're the only folks worth escalating to, as Reddit's incentives are to gate content, keep ad buyers happy, and keep the user base in check while they struggle to break even, sharing as little information publicly as possible along the way [1] [2].

From what I've seen, there typically ends up being a small handful of moderator-enforced narratives that are deemed \"acceptable\" for a given subreddit, and any commenters deviating from those narratives get banned, or their comments end up as \"[removed]\" by \"[deleted]\", or the comments get obscured with the \"comment score below threshold\" notice. It's generally some of the most one-sided and blandest discussion around. Given that there's often no meaningful back-and-forth involving differing perspectives of any sort, I'm not even sure if it should be considered \"discussion\".

I mean, it's certainly not Quora. reply CSMastermind 1 hour agorootparentI don't think this is true. The main thing I see Reddit being useful for are discussions about entertainment. There's probably a subreddit for your favorite sports team, twitch steamer, TV show, book series video game, politics (which is entertainment for some people). Reddit has seriously degraded the experience of a lot of these communities with things like restricting custom CSS. It seems to me that the way you'd disrupt Reddit as a startup is to pick a vertical and laser focus on becoming the best discussion board for that community. If it's sports than have integrations for live stats, scores, etc. In general you could attract users by offering profit sharing on ads the same way Youtube does for creators. Have the best moderation tools in the world, a constant painpoint with Reddit. Give admins more flexibility over the appearance of the board, all things Reddit took away. The other path for disruption would be if an established company with those communities tackled the problem. Lots of communities already us Discord, but they tend to also have a subreddit because chat and forums are different communication methods. Discord could easily offer a forum product as an extension of their chat services.

It's like what happened to personal websites when things like Blogger, Tumblr and Facebook popped up. It's hard to beat something that is easy to set up and pays for hosting but still let's you control moderation. It's a no brainer. Managing your own domain where users post content is a minefield of problems these days even if you didn't mind the cost of running it. Something like this might also explain the move to things like Discord over IRC. reply tayo42 3 hours agorootparentprevReddit is quietly a huge website with a significant amount of users.

Reddit's justification for this is profoundly wrong. Their \"public content policy\" is absurd doublespeak, and counter to everything the open internet is and hopes to be. You cannot simultaneously call yourself \"open\" and \"public\" while refusing access to automated clients. Every client is automated. They even go so far as to say that \"crawling\" (also known as \"downloading\") is an \"abuse\" and violates user privacy. This is absurd, and not justified. I would love to see legislation that restricted server operators' ability to prohibit automated access in this way, but I suppose it will never happen. Some people in this thread have attempted to justify the policy by saying \"they have to protect their income streams\". No they don't. You don't have a right to an income stream, and you certainly don't have a right to lie in order to get all the benefits of an open internet with none of the downsides. Noting of course that the \"downsides\" are in this case actually just \"competitors\". reply semiquaver 3 hours agoparentSorry, what is the antitrust concern about Reddit blocking crawlers that aren’t paying them?

The internet is about to forget everything without a profit motive and just start telling you that the latest product from a monolith corp like disney is the only movie worth watching. If someone scrapes all the useful movie opinions off of reddit and spends their time crafting it into a usable format, that guy's probably got a company. But not Bill.

You haven't done that. And there's no reason to think it would be, because of antitrust.

That's like if a shopper goes to grocery store and buys an expensive $20 piece of cheese, and other shoppers can't afford cheese that pricey, and you're blaming that one shopper for buying it because it means other shoppers can't also get the cheese without paying for it. That doesn't make any sense. The store set the price, and they're the one to blame if other shoppers can't afford it. If Bing, DDG and others can't reach a deal with Reddit, that has nothing to do with Google. Again, blame here is 100% on Reddit, and 0% on Google. To assign blame to a purchaser in a case like this doesn't make any sense. reply dvngnt_ 2 hours agorootparentbing probably has the money to reach a deal, smaller companies without monopolies is less likely, and that's the problem. i don't think google is blameless like you propose. reply crazygringo 2 hours agorootparent> bing probably has the money to reach a deal, smaller companies without monopolies is less likely, and that's the problem. Reddit can charge smaller companies less money. So if there's a problem, again, the problem is 100% with Reddit. Google is absolutely blameless here. You may not like Google, and you can certainly blame them for plenty of other things.

    "originBody": "Future Perfect Traveling this summer? Maybe don’t let the airport scan your face. You have the right to opt out of facial recognition tech. Here’s how. by Sigal Samuel Jul 19, 2024, 6:32 PM UTC Passengers enter the departure hall through face recognition at Xiaoshan International Airport in China in 2022. Future Publishing via Getty Images Sigal Samuel is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic. Here’s something I’m embarrassed to admit: Even though I’ve been reporting on the problems with facial recognition for half a dozen years, I have allowed my face to be scanned at airports. Not once. Not twice. Many times. There are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I’m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I’m always getting “randomly selected” for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations. But the main reason I haven’t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out. It turns out that saying no is not only doable, but surprisingly easy — at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, with some exceptions.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, “I opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.” In theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been reports of passengers — even a senator — facing resistance or intimidation when they try to go this route. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font! This is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called “Freedom Flyers” to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA recorded an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country’s airports as summer vacation season picked up. Now is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security — and understand exactly what’s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel. How facial recognition works at the airport In the US, over 80 airports are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA’s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, arguing that this kind of automation would reduce “friction” at airports — meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security. That should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be stolen due to breaches to the chance that you’ll be misidentified as a criminal suspect — and jailed. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there’s AI bias; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately misidentify people of color. (A CBP spokesperson insisted that the agency’s facial comparison algorithm “shows virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors.”) But as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it’s seen to work as intended. When I asked Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, “The big one for me is normalizing surveillance.” Buolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. “I see this on a longer trajectory,” she said. “And they’ve shown you the trajectory.” She was referring to a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There’s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you’re using.) Then there’s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger’s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email. A particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. “Live biometrics is the Minority Report kind of thing — where you’re just walking around and they can identify you,” Buolamwini said. And if everyone’s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may create a dangerous chilling effect across society. The TSA’s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use “live biometrics” in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini’s interpretation of that term. “That interpretation of TSA’s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA’s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,” he told me. For now, Buolamwini said, “You might hear people say ‘Oh, we’re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.’” But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated. Do airports really delete your photo after taking it? The first thing to know is that if you’re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted. In fact, according to CBP documents, “Facial images for in-scope [noncitizen] travelers are also transmitted to the Department’s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.” That means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What’s more, CBP notes that “CBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP’s mission.” If you’re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP website, “CBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.” But even so, Buolamwini says, there’s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours. When you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what’s called a “face print” or “face template.” This is not an image — it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face’s metadata. The problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they’re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that they can reconstruct an image of your actual face as long as they’ve got the face print. I asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted in time for publication. After we published this story, the CBP spokesperson said that “CBP does not store or share the templates generated during the matching process, for either US citizens or non-citizens.” If you’ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time? Maybe you’re in the same situation as me. Maybe you’ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you’re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database — or two — or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines say you can opt out for domestic flights.) Buolamwini’s opinion? It’s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. “Every opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,” she said. We’ve already seen that when there’s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook’s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up deleting the face prints of more than a billion users in 2021. “Face purges can and do happen,” Buolamwini said. Remember, the TSA’s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you’re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly. A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here!

    "commentBody": "You can opt out of airport face scans (vox.com)258 points by rntn 21 hours agohidepastfavorite232 comments oceanplexian 19 hours agoI opted out at Boston International Airport. It involved arguing with the TSA for about 5 minutes while holding up a 150 person line. Then the supervisor came over, told me that I \"was required to have to have my photo taken\" and opting out consisted of checking a box in the software to not save my photo. My alternative was to not get on the flight. The whole idea of opting out is a scam. They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public. reply hammock 18 hours agoparentCounterpoint, I have opted out at multiple airports including Boston without event. They all know opting out is a thing, they press one button to turn off the camera, I hold up a piece of paper over the cameras anyway just in case, and they have never said anything. One reason to opt out even though everyone says “they already have your picture 1000 different ways” is that these cameras are not normal cameras, they are stereoscopic close-range cameras that take a 3D image of your face. That takes facial recognition accuracy up to 95%+, from 70% or less on a normal photo. Furthermore, they say they do not retain the image. That may or may not be strictly true. But they do not say they are deleting the eigenvector, facial measurements, a hash of the image, or any other useful derivatives of the image reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparent> One reason to opt out even though everyone says “they already have your picture 1000 different ways” is that these cameras are not normal cameras, they are stereoscopic close-range cameras that take a 3D image of your face. That takes facial recognition accuracy up to 95%+, from 70% or less on a normal photo. Interesting, I'm fairly sure the cameras at one US airport I was (maybe Salt Lake City?) were just bog standard Logitech C920 like my previous webcam. Do you have more information on the cameras? reply prmoustache 11 hours agorootparentHaven't seen the setup but it seems possible to me that there may be several cameras, one that is clearly visible and used to give visual feedback in the computer screen so that you put your face in the right place, and another one that actually do the biometric scan. reply hhh 10 hours agorootparentprevThe automated passport gates have way more, but the manual photo checks by guards are indeed a mounted C920. reply brk 17 hours agorootparentprevSingle sensor face rec is already above 95% on surveillance cameras, which do not have ideal positioning, even when they are intended specifically for face rec. reply Retric 17 hours agorootparentAccuracy is heavily dependent on how large the populations you’re dealing with. If you’re comparing footage from surveillance camera vs a database of 100+ million people that’s tough. Most algorithms are being tested at 10^5 vs 10^6. Worse, unlike false positive with fingerprints the suspects will likely look similar to the cops not just the algorithm. There’s a major incentive to opt out simply as a result of false positives. reply monksy 10 hours agorootparentprevEven if its a non-special camera.. they're capturing a fixed profile photo. That's the gold standard used for matching against a dataset. reply prepend 15 hours agorootparentprev> Furthermore, they say they do not retain the image. That may or may not be strictly true. But they do not say they are deleting the eigenvector, facial measurements, a hash of the image, or any other useful derivatives of the image So what? Do you think that the thousands of cameras you encounter every day aren’t doing this already? I think the aim for culture is to limit what we can do with these data, rather than to try to prevent collection of these data. Cameras are too plentiful and powerful to not expect your image linked to your identity. Especially for governmental, lawful uses like immigration screening. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparent> Do you think that the thousands of cameras you encounter every day aren’t doing this already? Of course that's happening. It's still worthwhile to reduce the amount of this sort of thing where possible, though. > I think the aim for culture is to limit what we can do with these data, rather than to try to prevent collection of these data. I agree that the real, serious issue isn't the photos themselves as much as the databases that hold them. That said, why not address both problems? Particularly since we can't ever actually know if photos are being stored or not, but we (usually) can see the camera. In terms of verifiability, restricting the use of cameras is better than restricting the use of the data. reply deafpolygon 14 hours agorootparentprevWould you consent to DNA screening every time you fly? You have to draw the line somewhere and I would rather draw the line here (not consenting to airport face scans). reply prepend 13 hours agorootparentIf it was noninvasive and already pervasive, yes. It’s not that I like facial scanning. It’s that it is pervasive and can do nothing about it. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparent> If it was noninvasive and already pervasive, yes. That’s circular reasoning. It is all the more reason to oppose this crap today so it does not become pervasive. Think of anything that you don’t like but is pervasive. Don’t you wish the people that came before you would have opposed that a bit harder so you don’t have to deal with it now? The noninvasive part of your argument does matter, but I feel that’s much harder to define as everyone will draw the line somewhere different. reply saulpw 12 hours agorootparentprevOTOH maybe we shouldn't make it too easy for them by giving in without any resistance whatsoever. Fight this to delay or derail the next thing which will be even more. reply prepend 11 hours agorootparentIt’s not like we chose. Cameras and transistors are just absurdly cheap and have millions of other purposes. So we’d have to shut down tons of other useful functions to change it. Just like dna sampling will one day be so cheap that air conditioners test for every person and every germ they see. It will be so cheap as hard to stop. I guess we can resist digital stuff making dna cheaper. But we’ll have to stop all the other benefits (real time, targeted anti-virals, etc). reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentThere are all sorts of things that are cheap and easy, but society considers so dangerous that they are restricted by law. That doesn't stop all ne'er-do-wells, of course, but it stops most. reply simoncion 10 hours agorootparentprev> So we’d have to shut down tons of other useful functions to change it. What? No. The problem with this stuff is the privacy-invasion aspect. For example, ubiquitous camera installations in public spaces and businesses are 100% fine if they're truly closed-circuit systems that have no storage capability. If all these cameras offer is tele-vision, then there's no privacy problem. So, if this sort of stuff was guaranteed to be used for a purpose that's beneficial to individual clients and the public at large (rather than scraping up pennies by selling the recordings to data brokers and data analysis firms), there'd be no problem at all. The solution becomes clear: make video, audio, still image, biometric, and behavioral data toxic waste. * If a company ever uses such data in any way that's not clearly and conspicuously disclosed in plain English to their clients, fire every executive member of that company and permanently bar each of them from holding any executive or management position ever again. * If a company ever sends any payment (whether monetary, or in goods and/or services rendered) to a company that is (or owns) a data broker, customer/consumer data analysis firm, or similar, then that company is considered to have engaged the services of said company and presumed to be sending the data of their clients to said company. Fire every executive member of that company and permanently bar each of them from holding any executive or management position ever again. reply prepend 10 hours agorootparent> The solution becomes clear: make video, audio, still image, biometric, and behavioral data toxic waste. This doesn’t seem realistic to me because those data are useful for so many valid purposes and the tech is ubiquitous. So we’d have to regulate and it would be expensive and futile. Your solutions are difficult to enforce (eg, “fire every executive” doesn’t work even in things like Enron or mine disasters). reply simoncion 9 hours agorootparent> So we’d have to regulate... No shit? You don't say. Seriously, regulations and laws are how you get companies to act against their own best interests. > (eg, “fire every executive” doesn’t work even in things like Enron or mine disasters). You seem to have forgotten the second part of the punishment. I'll quote the punishment again: > [F]ire every executive member of that company and permanently bar each of them from holding any executive or management position ever again. I don't remember any Enron executive being barred from holding any executive or management position ever again. Do you? > Your solutions are difficult to enforce... Oh? Someone comes to the relevant regulator, or Federal law enforcement with evidence of this crime happening. By law, FedGov will be obligated to investigate. Either they corroborate the evidence and deliver the punishment, or they do not and they do nothing. This punishment is so extreme that you will only have to catch a few companies to prevent nearly everyone else from breaking this law. (After all, what executive team would risk decades of each of them getting a seven-to-eight-figure salary just so that a couple of them can get a one-off bonus one or two orders of magnitude smaller?) reply latexr 7 hours agorootparentprevI have no idea where you live, but I for one do not encounter “thousands of cameras” every day. It’s not even close to that. reply BriggyDwiggs42 14 hours agorootparentprevIt would sure be nice to place those limits, but in the meantime it’s still worth opting out right? reply prepend 11 hours agorootparentWorth it to some people. People opt out of vaccines too, or not using smartphones. I think it’s a situation where people can opt out, legally and ethically, but few will. reply crazygringo 18 hours agoparentprev> They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public. They already have your photo if you have a driver's license or US passport or basically any form of government ID. The whole point is to compare it to what they already have. So I don't really understand the privacy concerns here, but maybe I'm missing something. Is there something that these cameras record that is different from the biometrics they already have from your ID photos? (You're also obviously already being constantly recorded by surveillance cameras in the airport, of course.) reply cookiengineer 13 hours agorootparent> privacy concerns The super duper classified high security no-flight list was shared internationally via a public ftp server with the username and password anonymous:anonymous. A hacker that disclosed that responsibly got into lots of troubles for exposing that. [1] So I'd argue indeed I assume that TSA and border control use the most incompetent and most lying way to solve anything when the control mechanism are privacy laws. They literally care 0% about that. If they say they delete something, I assume they keep a physical copy. And I totally understand people worrying a lot about that, given the golden age of deep fakes we live in.

I understand the whole “not in public” thing but there’s still got to be a point where the depth and/or breadth of information gathered is too much. reply cjbgkagh 17 hours agorootparentIt’s less of boiling the frog and instead a deliberate salami slicing tactics coined by Hungarian communists. It’s more apt in that we are aware of what is being done but unable to resist because each small change is ‘trivial’ until they have the whole salami and by then it’s too late. It should be noted the frogs regulate their body temperature by jumping in and out of water and thus do react to even slow increases of temperature. reply chii 14 hours agorootparent> until they have the whole salami and by then it’s too late. so what is the whole salami? It's not unreasonable to know exactly who is on which flight imho. It is slightly worse to have face recognition in public spaces, but your identity is not a secret. As long as this information is not available for private uses (aka, it is only used by law enforcement), i don't see the privacy implications of public facial recognition. reply cjbgkagh 13 hours agorootparentI’m old enough to remember a time when it didn’t really matter, the wrong person getting on the wrong flight was more of an issue for that person and maybe the airline. Governments, like many other institutions, tend to find ways to generate demand for their services. By the time it happens the response is; ‘of course we need these things’, and in time that will be replaced by ‘that’s the way it has always been’ by people who don’t know any better. Just because it’s normal now doesn’t mean it always had to be this way. I’m not going to summarize everything the whole salami encompasses - that’s a rather big topic that’s probably best left as an exercise for the reader. reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparent> I’m old enough to remember a time when it didn’t really matter, the wrong person getting on the wrong flight was more of an issue for that person and maybe the airline When was that?

No, go ahead, because what you're saying is vague enough to be useless. reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentIt’s a curious trend that the ignorant demand that I do free work for them. I see it as part of this inversion of responsibility at schools and in culture where students have not failed to learn, the teachers have failed to teach. The students have become very entitled and demanding that not only must they be spoon fed but that the information must be pre-chewed to their exact liking. I’m not paid to teach you and if you spend your life expecting others to do the work of learning for you then you assuredly will spend the rest of your life in ignorance. I’m far better off finding ways to shield myself from the negative consequences of a culture fostering ignorant masses than I am to try to fight that onslaught one person at a time. reply simoncion 10 hours agorootparentprev> When was that? Mass (as in common, not the initial one off ones) airplane hijackings started in the 1940s. IIRC, in the US up to the 1980s or so. Perhaps even into the 1990s. Hell, there didn't even used to be metal detectors in airports until a \"large\" number of plane bombings happened in the 1980s. IIRC, the excuse for installing them was to detect metal-based explosives smuggled in one's person. > Are you implying that governments are behind terrorist acts or suicidal ones... I'll note that the cumulative delays from TSA \"security\" have had a much, much larger human cost than the destruction of the WTC towers. Relatedly, the financial cost has been staggering. Tragically, the process creating both of these costs are ongoing. Two things (and only two things) ensured that there will never be another attack like that, ever: 1) Hardening and locking the cockpit doors. Pilots screamed about this for an assload of years before 9/11, but penny-pinching airlines refused to do anything about it. 2) The fact that air passengers now know that a hijacking is not an inconvenience (or maybe a stop at an exotic destination), but is a death sentence. With any plausible armament that a team of hijackers could get into the cabin with even 1970's-era security screening, they absolutely cannot win against a planeload of people who are supremely disinterested in dying in a plane crash today. reply dogleash 3 hours agorootparent> 2) The fact that air passengers now know that a hijacking is not an inconvenience (or maybe a stop at an exotic destination), but is a death sentence.

So long as I can assume an anonymous role on occasion, and other people can too, I must think twice before doing anything destructively rash. Nobody else has bombed this thing yet, and they surely could, so perhaps it exists with the consent of the people around it. But if surveillance and control exceeds some ill defined threshold such that its not clear that so many of us actually could get away with fighting back against the machinery of control that surrounds us. Well then one must question whether it actually exists with our consent. And in that case, if we're lucky enough to be able to get away with dismantling it, it very well may be our responsibility to do so. That's the principle. There must still be some line not yet crossed. Because otherwise there's nothing to do besides fight. So we don't let them cross whatever the arbitrary line is because most of us are not prepared for the fight. reply sofixa 12 hours agorootparentThe issue with that \"principle\" is that it takes one person, who could very well be from a different society with different ideas of consent, or just a suicidal lunatic or someone in for an insurance scam, to ruin it for everyone. reply pineaux 11 hours agorootparentThere is no real way around this. reply __MatrixMan__ 5 hours agorootparentI'm not sure if we're worried that the outliers are at the top exerting illegitimate control or at the bottom undermining it without justification but either way I agree that there are no easy answers here.

You say \"it's your responsibility to hold them accountable for their actions and to check at that level\"- but all I see in the parent comments is people discussing politics. People saying \"I think this law is bad\" is a critical part of the exact democratic process you seem to hold in high regard. That's how you get a consensus among the electorate that can push representatives to oppose future surveillance legislation and repeal existing stuff.

Because here, we have a series of people who don't like the law (potentially for good reasons). If the law is like that, it's because we have a \"majority\" (unless democracy is cheated) who voted for such things (additional control during plane boarding, to have border guards, to allow spying on private messages, etc). The \"majority\" defended their right; the right to feel safe. A bit like someone who does Open Carry in a state who doesn't want you to show weapons. It may be not dangerous if you openly have a weapon, but other people still voted against that for their own reasons. reply chimpanzee 16 hours agorootparent> it's because we have a \"majority\" (unless democracy is cheated) who voted for such things > other people still voted against that for their own reasons You are describing a direct democracy, not the representative democracy that actually exists.

They probe for more info, as if there needs to be some extraordinary reason for opting out to be justified over simply going along with it. \"They already have your photo\". Yes, I know. I gave it to them in exchange for documents that grant international travel privileges. The rules/laws also say I can opt out of face rec and are posted on that big ass sign. I exercised my rights as a citizen to apply for documents within the rules allowed. Now I am excising my rights to the part that says I can opt out of having my pic taken every time I want to get on a plane. I would like more clarity on the storage of the bio info derived from the photos. My guess is they keep updating profiles every time they take the pic, but discard the actual photo. This is not why I opt out, but like the salami slicing up-thread, I would guess they are waiting for everyone to get use to the pic at TSA before removing the opt-out clause and letting everyone know they are storing it to update profiles - for your safety. I am just waiting for that big leak, and then massive bio id fraud that will be harder to clean up than it is now. I know someone that has been a victim of id fraud (complete nightmare), I can't even imagine how one would clean that up once bio fraud becomes the norm. reply CPLX 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's definitely a reasonable point of view. There's another point of view though that says that the aviation system is particularly fragile, and of course it has a history of being used for acts of extreme violence. So there's a compelling state interest question here. Like I think people definitely DO and SHOULD have the right to be secure in their own homes, in their personal papers, and to be free from surveillance of their personal life. I'm extremely amenable to the idea that you should be able to \"exercise your rights, for any reason you please and without having to explain yourself\" in that regard. I think it's also clear that the rights one has are going to be circumscribed when participating in the aviation system.

I'm not aware of any X-ray emission from those devices. reply simoncion 10 hours agorootparentprevI refuse to use the pornoscanners because 0) For years and years and years, European prisons and airports refused to use them because they were deemed to be largely ineffective. 1) They're very, very, very expensive. 2) As mentioned above, they're ineffective. Explosives in a body cavity or a dense hairdo, or spread thinly across one's skin cannot be detected by these devices. Early on there were also demonstrations of fairly-reliable methods of storing weapons that would have been detected by a metal detector on one's person so that they could not be detected by the scanner. 3) When checkpoints get backed up and the lines get too long, TSA often bypass the scanners AND patdowns by running huge numbers of people only through metal detectors. 4) When they were first introduced in the US, they were obviously sufficiently-high resolution to get a clear nude picture of you. 5) No thought had been put into ensuring that these nude photos were not stored... and the only way this was discovered was by some researchers getting a hold of one and finding all of the nude photos of travellers on the thing's storage. 6) It was very, very obvious that TSA screeners were using the pornoscanners to perv on attractive travelers. I used to fly a fair bit and I often heard smoking-hot babes and dudes talk about having to go through the scanners multiple times because of a \"glitch\" or a \"bad scan\". The claim is that points four through six were addressed by making the on-scanner screens show a paper doll with a \"region of interest\". I have zero faith that the scanners stopped storing full-resolution scans on the machine's local storage, and zero faith that checkpoint personnel are unable to access that storage. I also note that even years after the paper-doll update, checkpoints had a habit of refusing to run children under 13 through the scanner, and usually ran families with kids so young just through a metal detector. This absolutely is not evidence of data storage, but given how insane the US is about data handling regarding kids under 13, it sure is suggestive of it. reply ozgrakkurt 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably because of radiation reply dangleberry 8 hours agorootparentprev> I also have a cardiac implant, if they try to tase me I might even end up dead.

So many people will (understandably) just accept it and go along with it. Surveillance is normalised. Data breaches of our most sensitive data are normalised. Companies simply giving all this sensitive data to law enforcement is normalised. Fighting back is hard if it even occurs to you that you can and should. My husband's workplace tried to force him to enrol in biometrics along with the rest of his company. It was just for doing timesheets. We'd have fought it if it were for identity verification and security as well, but no, it was just for bloody timesheets. Giving away immutable biometric data to a crappy third party company who has data breaches every six months just for bloody timesheets just felt extraordinarily ridiculous and audacious. My husband did encourage his colleagues to consider not signing it but nobody gave it much thought (or was worried about being fired). We recently needed to verify our identities to a financial institution and they pushed hard to use a (different) third party biometrics system instead of the good ol fashioned just not doing that. We needed to provide them with all the normal ID documentation anyway. Why the hell would we sign up for biometrics on top of that?

This is the same for boarding, you scan your boarding pass and it verifies your picture with a camera, then you just get on the plane. reply mathiasose 4 hours agoprevInteresting read, I (a Norwegian citizen) traveled to the US (OSL -> CPH -> SFO and back) in July and was surprised by some parts of the procedures at the airport. Some notable parts of my experience: - There is no longer the paper form you filled out on the plane/prior to customs. You fill out online forms (visa or ESTA in my case) months before you travel. - Upon arrival customs and immigration took my fingerprints and photo. My passport and ESTA were in order and I have traveled to the US several times before (and well, I am a privileged ethnicity from western Europe), and the agent didn't do any questioning about purpose of travel, accommodation, etc this time. That has happened to me on previous trips though. This type of questioning always makes me feel uncomfortable and afraid to say something wrong, so that was a relief. I would certainly not begin to argue with the agent about opting out of the biometrics at this stage. - My checked bags were not inspected by customs. On a previous US trip I did find a notice that the bag had been inspected. - On departure, at the TSA bag check there were the full body scanners you step into and raise your hands. I didn't see any information about opting out anywhere, though I wasn't actively searching for it. There was nothing in particular that made me consider that my face was being scanned in detail here. - At the gate I was surprised that boarding check was via facecam. This was the first time I have seen this and I had not considered that my pictures from before could be used this way. Everywhere else and all other times I have traveled you board with the barcode/QR on the boarding card and without any ID check. So in my experience (as an admittedly privileged traveler) the system is optimized for efficiency and \"convenience\", but certainly not for privacy. There isn't much information to find about what you must do and what you are able to opt out of. Just do the same thing as the person in front of you in the line, ad infinitum. I know I should be more concerned about privacy in general, but the stress of travel and anxiety about doing something \"wrong\" and somehow getting in trouble with these agencies make me (and probably most others) accept these things. reply reilly3000 17 hours agoprevThese scans are likely to be property of a dictator.

Reactions of the airport staff are surprisingly mixed, many don't mind at all - though universally they will force you to wait for 10-30minutes, though Gatwick staff in particular consistently repeats that “this won’t always be possible”, which is a weird statement to make to be honest, but I've travelled through there many times and they try to talk me about of it this way. reply toomuchtodo 19 hours agorootparentHas the ability to opt out changed the TSA operating model? Or does it satisfy some emotional response in those who do while adding slightly more time to aggregate screening for the opt out population? I understand the desire, but the lever you're trying to pull is in concrete. Redirect your efforts to somewhere effective.

The mechanism or process to opt-out and complete alternative processing may not impose additional burdens or requirements on the individual beyond what is necessary to complete the verification process. Many of the responses in this thread are indicating that the implementation of this opt-out is excessively burdensome, such that opting out could easily cause a traveler to miss their flight. We should all be concerned that the authority granted an extraordinary enforcement power over a functionally mandatory part of modern life ignores limitations that that we \"made at the ballot box\" because it finds them inconvenient.

By \"solving\" in this context, I mean with regards to data collection, retention, storage, and processing of sensitive personal information, biometrics specifically (quoting myself below): > If I have strong data security and privacy concerns along the lines of \"this will eventually lead to dystopian government interaction outcomes,\" the only place that is solved is at the ballot box and within the legislative and legal frameworks. Current state, the event of you traversing a checkpoint is logged in a system of record, with a human proofing your credentials against your live face. These systems automate the proofing process. Your photo exists in government databases (state for state ID and driver's license, and federal for passports and global entry/CBP). Your event of travel is logged, and also provided ahead of flights to TSA/DHS via PNR data exchanges. My government, today, already has the necessary information to cause me harm without using facial recognition to compare my ID to my live face and PNR. What material risk to privacy does swapping a human checking your ID with facial recognition incur in this context? And how does opting out materially improve your privacy posture? It very well may be that the opt-out is excessively burdensome, but if the opt out is ceremony and provides no actual benefit, then why do I care if it is excessively burdensome? Because someone believes the opt out process is providing a benefit when it, in reality, provides no benefit? That is a belief system challenge, not an objective risk to be assessed and potentially mitigated. Fear is a feeling, danger is real. If there is evidence that the opt out process materially improves someones privacy and data security posture, certainly, then it is worth expending effort to defend opt out use and overly burdensome efforts to exercise. Otherwise, I find it inconvenient to argue over the travel security checkpoint equivalent of an elevator close door button (in this context, the opt out process). Fight for and expend effort on effective improvements in outcomes, not ceremony. reply dijit 19 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that it still exists indicates that it's likely to be the case, it's clearly frustrating for them and they would get rid of the option if they thought they could. People like me are probably padding the stats in favour of a small but consistent \"preference\". There's no way they're not watching the statistics and making decisions based on that. If they think a small enough minority opt out they will remove the option. > By participating in Global Entry and opting into CBP and DHS/TSA \"one to many\" credential and identity proofing (colloquially \"facial recognition\"), it makes my life much easier while traveling.

That's not my concern, petty bureaucracy and trampling the dignity of people nonchalantly is. What I'm referring to is much larger than just the TSA, it's a global industry selling security theatre, imagining the techniques of tomorrows bomb threat are anything they've seen before, forcing you to throw your liquids away and then charging you through the nose for water on the other side. \"But you can take an empty bottle, there are fountains!\" That's the discretion of the security agent you happen to get, I've had bottles thrown out because they had \"flOz\" written on the side despite being empty. I travel a lot, so it's probably just the fact I want a consistent experience above else, and the rules are different depending on airport and very selectively enforced. Though they might argue that this is a feature to thwart terrorism.. (he says while rolling eyes) reply toomuchtodo 19 hours agorootparentIf it makes you feel better, carry on, just don't expect it to change outcomes. It clearly doesn't. Opt outs are not tracked [1].

Protest definitely does change something. The only problem is that not enough of us are doing it. If you're opposed to these scans, it is your moral duty to opt out, and to make everyone's life harder while doing it. That's exactly how things change. reply geraldwhen 18 hours agorootparentIt’s government software right? There’s no chance the opt out button works. reply toomuchtodo 19 hours agorootparentprevDo you really think that everyone is going to opt out? If so, can you please provide evidence when and why they haven’t already? Or is it more likely that a small, vocal minority will continue to be vocal? And that vocal minority will remain perpetually upset that everyone else does not protest with them? I am using the entire existence of the TSA until now in evaluating. I am simply the messenger for the bad news, based on observations of the system at scale. “If the people would just rise up” is not an argument, unless you’re going to show evidence that there is a scenario in which a non insignificant amount of the traveling public opt out, which is…unlikely in my opinion.

This would also cause the occasional person in line to think I was in line ahead of them, so they'd stop and wait behind me until an agent manually coaxed them forward. Sometimes they'd ask me if I was waiting and I'd get to say something like \"oh, no, I'm not going near that thing\". But the turbulence would generally make the agents see my waiting there as a higher priority to take care of. reply mindslight 16 hours agorootparentprevBack in the day, there was a commercial bulletin board software called TBBS (\"The Bread Board System\"). It differed from most BBSs in that it could handle multiple lines on a single computer, through a built-in multitasking implementation. Most TBBSs allowed new users to dial in and create new accounts by entering their name and choosing a password on the first login. TBBS had a companion product called TDBS (\"The DataBase System\") that allowed writing interactive programs for use by users. One of these programs that became popular was a light adventure MUD called Illusions. I had a two line demo of TBBS/TDBS I got from somewhere (I think legitimately, actually), and I downloaded a demo copy of Illusions to play with on my own machine. Looking at its databases, I found something curious - the players' characters and the non-playing characters were stored in the same database, with the user name for all of the NPCs being \"aa non-playing character\". It turns out the game did not check for a user using that name. And of course TBBS knew nothing of Illusions's design choices. And so by creating a new login account so-named, I was able to play as the NPC characters, moving them around town and chatting with other players to much amusement. At least until the sysop realized what was happening. That is all to say, I too have had the experience of choosing to play as a non-playing character. (another fun fact: the companion product for connecting TBBS to the nascent Internet was called an IPAD - Internet Protocol ADapter) reply floren 15 hours agorootparentI don't know what article you intended to post this on, but it sounds interesting and I'd like to see it! reply Bognar 6 hours agorootparentIt's a high effort way of calling the GP an NPC, so just an insult. reply floren 5 hours agorootparentAh, I missed that sentence on my first read.

You're exposed to so much radiation just sitting in an aircraft at 35,000 feet that anything beamed at you during security screening would have to be of very little consequence. reply dijit 19 hours agorootparent> You're exposed to so much radiation just sitting in an aircraft at 35,000 feet that anything beamed at you during security screening would have to be of very little consequence. I've heard this before, but this really isn't how radiation works. The higher dosages you're exposed to and the longer, the more likely the negative affects. But it's strangely additive, like getting wet. Which is a poor analogy but the most fitting I can think of. You might get \"more wet\" by standing in the rain than getting splashed with puddle, sure, but you're still increasing your \"wet-ness\" by not drying out before getting splashed. Only this wet gives you cancer if you stay wet too long, or get too wet. reply pdonis 18 hours agorootparent> this really isn't how radiation works. Yes, actually it is, at least as far as the risks of security scanners vs. flying are concerned. The radiation you get exposed to in an airplane at altitude is largely ionizing radiation. The radiation you get exposed to in security scanners is not. So in addition to the much shorter time of exposure, and hence the much smaller overall dose, the type of radiation in security scanners is much, much less damaging to your body even at comparable doses. > it's strangely additive I'm not sure what you mean by this, but if you mean that the additional radiation from security scanners is somehow \"additive\" with the radiation you are exposed to in the airplane, no, that's not correct. They're different types of radiation and do different things to your body. There's no cumulative effect between them. reply dijit 18 hours agorootparentIf you were correct the repeated exposure to low doses of radiation would not be cause for concern. Truthfully, the amount of radiation you are exposed to does accumulate its negative affects, we certainly consider it as such for every work environment for a reason. You are confident in this, and more eloquent than me at 2am, whoever I cannot let that falsehood stand. As far as ionising radiation goes, if its ionising then its ionising, there’s not “different types”- however the parent is correct that millimetre waves do not penetrate the skin and are considered non-ionising reply pdonis 17 hours agorootparent> the amount of radiation you are exposed to does accumulate its negative affects What kind of radiation? If you mean ionizing radiation, the evidence, as far as I know, is mixed; some indicates there is buildup over time, some indicates that there are threshold effects and single doses below threshold, separated in time, do not accumulate. We do have lifetime dose limits as well as single exposure dose limits for such radiation because the evidence is mixed and we can't rule out that there are accumulation effects. But if you mean non-ionizing radiation, such as is used in the millimeter wave security scanners, there is no evidence of accumulation of effects over time from low doses (i.e., doses that do not cause immediate harmful effects) that I'm aware of. Do you know of any? reply simoncion 9 hours agorootparentprev> If you were correct the repeated exposure to low doses of radiation would not be cause for concern. It's not a cause for concern, no. Tons of people live and work at high elevations, in granite buildings, and many other places where the background ionizing radiation level is far higher than normal. You'd do well to consult this chart: , paying particular attention to the expected radiation exposure from background sources, comparing that to the \"Lowest one-year dose clearly linked to increased cancer risk\" amount, and also noting that the repeated phrase \"All the doses in the $COLOR chart combined\". You'd also do well to clear fifteen or thirty minutes from your day and read this letter, published in 1997: . Do take it slow and don't skim. It's an essay written to be read, rather than for SEO, so you absolutely will miss important details if you skim. reply joe5150 19 hours agorootparentprevI agree that's a poor analogy. Nonetheless, millimeter wave scanners don't use ionizing radiation. reply prepend 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the issue is that people don’t think about limiting their airline flights, so why think about limiting mmwave?

Ryan/The Boston Globe / Getty Images CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that crashed millions of computers with a botched update all over the world last week, is offering its partners a $10 Uber Eats gift card as an apology, according to several people who say they received the gift card, as well as a source who also received one. On Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an email from CrowdStrike offering them the gift card because the company recognizes “the additional work that the July 19 incident has caused.” “And for that, we send our heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience,” the email read, according to a screenshot shared by the source. The same email was also posted on X by someone else. “To express our gratitude, your next cup of coffee or late night snack is on us!” A screenshot of the email sent to partners by CrowdStrike after the July 19 incident. Image Credits: TechCrunch / supplied The email was sent from a CrowdStrike email address in the name of Daniel Bernard, the company’s chief business officer, according to a screenshot of the email seen by TechCrunch. According to one post on X, in the United Kingdom the voucher was worth £7.75, or roughly $10 at today’s exchange rate. On Wednesday, some of the people who posted about the gift card said that when they went to redeem the offer, they got an error message saying the voucher had been canceled. When TechCrunch checked the voucher, the Uber Eats page provided an error message that said the gift card “has been canceled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.” CrowdStrike did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, CrowdStrike released a faulty update that rendered around 8.5 million Windows devices unusable, according to Microsoft. The update caused the affected computers to be stuck at the infamous “blue screen of death,” or BSOD, a bright blue error screen with a message that is shown when Windows crashes or cannot load because of a critical software failure. The outage caused delays at airports in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, and London, and across the United States.

You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop. Since the outage began on Friday, CrowdStrike has regularly published updates on its efforts to figure out what caused the mass outage. In an update on Wednesday, the company said that because of a bug during the process to check that updates are ready to be released to customer devices, the faulty code “passed validation despite containing problematic content data.” The company also published apologies from its CEO George Kurtz, as well as its chief security officer Shawn Henry. “All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz said in a message published on the company’s site. “Nothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike. As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we’re taking to prevent anything like this from happening again.” Henry wrote on Linkedin that “we failed you, and for that I’m deeply sorry.” “I’ve been in my professional life for almost 40 years, and my North Star has always been to ‘protect good people from bad things,’” Henry wrote. “The past two days have been the most challenging 48 hours for me over 12+ years. The confidence we built in drips over the years was lost in buckets within hours, and it was a gut punch.” More TechCrunch Get the industry’s biggest tech news Explore all newsletters TechCrunch Daily News Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

After I had been employed there for a couple of years, someone in HR or Legal noticed that the programmers had never signed any \"our code belongs to the company\" agreement. So they asked us to sign a paper to that effect, and gave us each a check for $20. My thought was that I always assumed the company owned this code, but if they were going to pay for it, then $20 was waaaay too little. Anyway I took the $20, signed the paper, and got back to work. But it always gave me a chuckle. reply frognumber 2 hours agoparentHere's what I suspect happened: Any contract requires consideration. Without it, it's not a valid contract. It doesn't require fair consideration, so a clause giving e.g. $1 is typical for many contracts. They were nice and bumped it up to $20. I suspect your work DID belong to the company already, under work-for-hire doctrine, but an explicit contract avoids that ambiguity. Ambiguity can be bad and super-expensive, whether during litigation or even something like an audit. If someone is buying a company, investing, making a major loan, that's the kind thing which comes up in due diligence and can be annoying. So I don't think they were paying you for the code, so much as trying to come into compliance. Very likely, this was triggered by some similar audit for some deal they were trying to make. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentInteresting. I worked for a company that got bought by another company. Pretty much everyone was a salaried employee with a standard employment contract. There was no formal rehire process, but at some point the new company did the same thing as OP's company, saying that anything we produce at work or with work resources belongs to the company. But with an added \"no moonlighting\" clause. We did not get any consideration, cash, or gift cards. Instead we were told that if we didn't sign the new company's mandatory agreements, our employment status could be up for review. reply creer 2 hours agorootparentprevWatch out for \"work-for-hire doctrine\" erm... assumptions. Last time I looked work-for-hire law only takes effect if there is explicit mention of the term \"work-for-hire\" in the contract, otherwise it's not \"work-for-hire\". And I have never seen a contract actually mention \"work-for-hire\". Do current employment contracts state \"work-for-hire\"? reply creer 1 hour agorootparentOhhh, I was wrong. Seems there are two categories where work made for hire applies. One is specifically for work made by an employee (with some constraints / definitions on that) for work made within their scope of employment. The other category requires explicit mention of \"work for hire\". So that a conventional employee is covered, but a contractor / consultant with a separate business probably isn't. reply Beijinger 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Any contract requires consideration\" I am not a lawyer and I don't understand this phrase. But many legal systems require that a contract is at arm's length. reply creer 2 hours agorootparentConsideration is generally money (but more generally and dangerously something actually received in exchange for giving away something else in the contract.) It can't be a binding contract if there is no exchange such as merely signing away the code. reply borski 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you are assigning me some rights or an entire piece of IP, I must provide you with some consideration (monetary compensation) for that to be a valid contract. You cannot simply “gift” it to me. So I would, as part of the contract, hand over $1 or $20 to establish that I have skin in the game and have paid for this contract be valid. The consideration could be stock and other things, but it can’t be null. reply Beijinger 19 minutes agorootparentAt arm's length mean, it must be an adequate amount. For example, I can sell a 10 Million dollar home in most jurisdictions to you for 1 USD. While this contract may be valid, it may create tax liabilities because the tax authorities will say this was not a sale, this was a gift. As a counter example: In many jurisdictions, a work contract that specifically request lots of overtime or forbids working for a competitor in the future would require a significant extra payment and not 1 USD. 1 USD would not be considered at arm's length. reply borski 10 minutes agorootparentSure, agreed. That is not the case that is being referred to here, where someone was assigning over IP that they had built while employed by the company but without an explicit agreement about who owns that IP. In this case, $1 or $20 would have been completely fine, as it was consideration for past IP. The work had already been paid for (salary, benefits, etc). reply scubbo 2 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppercorn_(law) reply chimeracoder 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's exactly it. The $20 is not an assessed value of the code; it's to establish consideration. $1 would have been legal. It's legal to make asymmetric contracts that benefit one party more than the other, just not contracts that are completely one-sided. They probably did $20 just so it wouldn't seem quite as insulting. Anytime you see stories of \"[insert name of rich CEO or politician] takes salary of only $1\", that's why. They can't work literally for free, or the rest of the contract becomes nonbinding. reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentprevSalary in this case would serve as the consideration for the work they perform, but lawyers love making things as explicit as possible (understandably). reply pests 1 hour agorootparentYou already get salary though. They can't just keep adding contracts and terms and say it's covered by previous payments. reply contravariant 1 hour agorootparentprevHonestly if a contract only offers 1$ as compensation for many hours worth of work then that's pretty much admitting the consideration is inadequate. reply lucianbr 2 hours agorootparentprevYou think the $20 was consideration, and yet you think they were not paying for the code? Aren't these the same thing? > Ambiguity can be bad and super-expensive If the corporation had some ambiguity in their favor, I expect they would call it \"value\" and ask for as much as they could get to remove it. But if the ambiguity is in favor of an employee or client, let's remove it for a token $20. Ugly society this one is. reply kmacdough 2 hours agorootparent$20 consideration for reducing legal ambiguity around code they already own. Even if it's almost guaranteed to roll in favor of the employer, simply having to litigate it is enormously expensive. Such litigation would be detrimental to everyone but the lawyers, but that won't stop people from thinking they have a case. I'm with you, companies will always look out for their own interests, but when clarification minimizes logistical waste, it's possible to benefit everyone. reply ortusdux 2 hours agoparentprevFor the most part, US contracts are not valid without consideration. Basically, all parties involved must receive something of value. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/consideration-every-... Any contract request that includes a small cash payout should merit extra scrutiny. reply bombcar 2 hours agoparentprevThis is because it's a contract oddity - if they told you to sign it but offered nothing; you could challenge it in court, and the courts have often said a \"one-sided contract\" is not valid (e.g., you give me copyright I give you nothing). The $20 is \"due consideration\" - just like how some deals involve selling an item for a dollar. reply rolph 2 hours agorootparentthere is a term \"gracious consideration\" often used where i am. rough translation is: \"pretty please\" [batting eyelashes] reply qingcharles 1 hour agoparentprevMy friends and I contracted to a company in 2004 to build a text message system. The company decided they didn't want to pay us the last month's bill. They'd spent all their money buying a custom Harley as a prize for the customers and now had nothing left. We met with their CEO+CFO+lawyers and our lawyers. They were adamant they wouldn't pay the last payment. We pulled out our contract and showed they didn't own any of their code because there was no IP transfer in there. They said \"We need a minute.\" We left the room, came back in and there was a check for the outstanding balance in the middle of the table. reply faut_reflechir 3 hours agoprevIt's a deliciously insulting amount because it's not quite enough for a meal on Uber Eats. reply jagged-chisel 1 hour agoparentNot quite enough?

It perfectly explains the name and also why something like this is installed so ubiquitously and still installed despite such a massive screw up. Also offensive capabilities need wide deployment just as much as defensive. Cybersecurity and cyberwar is a real thing, and surely DDOS botnets are a core part of that. Maybe it's controlled by the CIA, or maybe just has a quiet contract with USCYBERCOM and/or ARCCYBER. I mean, people don't seem that concerned about all of the nuclear missiles and submarines, aircraft carriers, and US military bases everywhere. Computers and the internet are now part of that and have been for quite awhile. If you are invested in this system then you probably want that dominance to continue (otherwise you should probably start learning Chinese). In which case we probably need something like a \"crowd strike\" widely deployed on the monopoly OS so that we have offensive capabilities. If you don't like that idea then why use Windows at all?

Then they sold off or spun down a huge portion of their businesses to set aside money for legal fees. I don't know if Crowdstrike really has any other options at this point. The amount of legal liability the company is going to be under will be staggering and the brand reputation is worse than worthless. reply jagged-chisel 1 hour agoparent> ...

Citation for legal liability Crowdstrike has? Re reputation - I've read this about all sorts of annoyances that had real economic impact, i doubt this will make crowdstrike worthless any more than: * MS became worthless after Code Red or Slammer or any of the other late 90s/early 2000s breaches. * Apple became worthless after the iPhone that requried you to hold it a certain way while talking * Toyota became wortheless after the unintended acceleration issues * Facebook became worthless after screwing up the internet for a day. * Amazon become worthless after US-EAST went down screwing everyone over for an afternoon (pick a time). * Norfolk Southern became worthless after the east palastine derailment. * A thousand others.... This issue wasn't as impacting as many of those - some computers were down for a few hours and it made a mess. It takes a lot more than that to destroy a company or their brand reputation.

A group of people probably approved it. Someone else had to purchase those cards or set up the job to send them to customers. At no point did anyone think \"this doesn't seem like the right response, I should warn someone further up the chain\". Probably due to the idea coming from further up the chain. And those ubereats/doordash/grubhub cards are worthless because $10 won't get you a thing, you'll need to spend another $30.

    "originLink": "https://papersplease.org/wp/2024/07/23/what-consent-really-looks-like-for-the-dea-and-tsa/",
    "originBody": "Jul 23 2024 What “consent” really looks like for the DEA and TSA The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have been working together for years to steal travelers’ money. The DEA pays informers to finger people who might be flying with large amounts of cash, and gets the TSA to identify these people when they go through TSA checkpoints at airports, claims that they “consent” to be searched, and then finds any money they are carrying and seizes it through “civil forfeiture”. The DEA carries out similar cash-seizure operations on Amtrak trains — mostly domestic trains that don’t cross the US border — in collaboration with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). A new video released by the Institute for Justice shows how this “consent” works in practice. In the w video, a DEA agent won’t take “I don’t consent to a search” for an answer. The agent follows an airline passenger onto their plane (without objection by airline staff), snatches the passenger’s carry-on bag, carries it off the plane, and refuses to return it. The agent claims the right to keep the passenger’s bag as long as it takes to get a warrant (although they don’t have that right, and don’t actually get a warrant). This is not meaningful “consent”, and it’s not a valid legal basis for a search. An ongoing class-action lawsuit by the Institute for Justice on behalf of air travelers who have been searched without probable cause on the pretextual claim of “consent” in order to find, seize, and “forfeit” their cash has shown just how common this pattern of illegal search and seizure is. We reported on the filing of this lawsuit in 2020, and on the first substantive ruling in the case, in favor of the plaintiffs and allowing the case to move forward, in 2021. Since then, the case has bogged down in foot-dragging by the DEA and TSA, resisting discovery of their records of searches and seizures of cash from travelers at airports. The DEA and TSA continue to claim — despite the initial ruling against them on this point — that they don’t have an actionable “policy” of targeting travelers with cash for searches because they haven’t put this policy in writing. But the latest status report on discovery to date indicates that the DEA and TSA have made thousands of seizures of “bulk currency” from air travelers in recent years. This is clearly a routine and officially sanctioned agency practice, whether or not anyone has put it in writing. The DEA and TSA claim that the volume of records of these searches and seizures would make producing them unduly burdensome. But the volume of these records is symptomatic of the scale and systemic nature of the problem — which is what the plaintiffs are trying to prove. The plaintiffs have suggested examining a statistical sample of the records of airport searches and seizures, but the DEA and TSA are resisting even that. We wish the plaintiffs in this case and their lawyers success in their pursuit of justice for travelers. Edward Hasbrouck Posted in Freedom To Travel, Surveillance State Leave a comment",

I attended a wedding that got hit by a major flash flood that required a rescue operation by boat and helicopter. Thankfully no one was seriously injured. A half dozen people were swept away and rescued from trees. The rest of us got to higher floors of the building and they were concerned about us waiting out the flood because cars from the parking lot floated and rammed the first floor of the building. It was featured on an episode of I Do, Redo. They brought in busses to transport the 61 people rescued to the local high school where they had activated the Red Cross and provided us dry cloths and food. I can't say enough nice things about the Red Cross volunteers and the staff at the high school, and same with the fire department and EMS. However, when we were loaded into the busses, the police held the busses until they had a drug dog come into the busses to walk up and down the aisles, and only after that let the busses take us to the high school. While no one was seriously injured physically, people were traumatized from the flooding event and many attendees suffered from PTSD for years. It was so cruel for the police department to do what they did with everyone in the mental state that we were in. For reasons I do not understand, we were not free to leave the high school, and even the people that did not lose their cars to the flood were required to go to the high school on the busses. I can't recall how long they detained us at the high school, I'd guess 3 to 5 hours, and then they let us leave. The friend that came to pick me up (I did lose my vehicle to the flood) got to the high school not long after I did and had to wait in the parking lot for hours. We wanted to feel safe once we got to dry land after the ordeal we went through. I did not feel safe until I got home. reply raxxorraxor 3 hours agoparentIf this happened as you described it, worst part is that this evident lack of judgement would be detrimental in fighting real crime. If they were legally compelled to do it, there also is a political problem. Maybe there is a silly explanation about the bus being confiscated from a local drug lord and people needed to be protected, but otherwise I don't see a way how you officials could come out here not looking like idiots. reply amanaplanacanal 8 hours agoparentprevWhat the hell? Why would they do such a thing? reply chickenchase-rd 5 hours agorootparentquite simply to screen drugs from reaching the emergency shelter, which is also a school, and save you from special prosecution applied to these situations and protect themselves politically from something the media will monitor closely. if they screened you at the shelter, its worse for everyone if they find anything on premises. emergency shelters will house anyone affected, including vulnerable elderly, children, mentally ill people, and unhoused heavy drug users. everyone was likely checked which also protects you while sheltering. i volunteered for a shelter during katrina and it gets out of hand very fast with just one delusional person or drug user. i stopped a robbery within 3 minutes of starting my first shift. a deranged person was aggressively drug seeking, and robbing pill bottles away from an elderly woman in a wheelchair. could have been your mom or grandma just caught up in it. so- check everyone as a protocol, as its for public shelter safety. seek therapy for ptsd, its never too late to heal. if you have heavy bias against law enforcement, perhaps consider joining a community program or volunteering - do it as a therapy to yourself to help improve your insight which will help everyone work towards improving the situation in your community. reply archerx 8 hours agorootparentprevTo bust some one too justify their budgets.

Local cop seizes assets on behalf of the DEA or other federal agency, assets are held by the federal agency rather than the local agency, the federal agency sends a kickback payment to the local agency and takes over prosecution, local agency washes its hands of the matter, enjoys the plunder, and goes off and robs more subjects. https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1044326/dl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable_sharing reply umbra07 14 hours agorootparentwhy on earth do they get a kickback?? reply wyldfire 14 hours agorootparentTo whitewash something that otherwise appeared like theft via one more level of bureaucracy. reply rebuilder 14 hours agorootparentprevIt creates an incentive. reply safety1st 12 hours agorootparentI suspect the DoJ understood this and non ironically did not consider the problem of exploitation by corrupt cops to be a meaningful one.

Well, maybe if money from fines was allowed to go directly to paying for something that directly addresses the specific type of harm that the type of crime the fine was for tends to cause, that would be ok.

You can tell that’s an opinion held by most of the people in this country by the fact that we had a set of campaign finance laws that were gutted or basically made moot by various recent developments like Citizens United. We have those adorable quaint little limits (4 figures) that a person can give to a campaign per election cycle. The point of that is that as a person, there probably ought to be a limit for how much money you can give a campaign.

Properly-motivated traffic stops (think: \"Stopping a driver who is operating his vehicle erratically\" or \"Stopping a driver whose vehicle is obviously in dangerous disrepair\") are essential to maintaining the safe operation of our public roads. What should absolutely be a felony are warrantless searches conducted as part of a traffic stop, properly-motivated or not.

To get it to work, you need to clone and build this: https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c So the steps are like this: First you'll need to obtain approval from Meta to download llama3 models on hugging face. Go to https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, fill the form and then go to https://huggingface.co/settings/gated-repos see acceptance status.

I think maybe the new RoPE scaling method Llama 3.1 uses isn't yet added in? It's some weird one time scaling mechanism found by a grid search to enable 128K context. Essentially the model was trained on 15.6T tokens on 8K context, then iteratively extended to 128K context with 800B tokens. Can open a PR if people want :) [Edit: Just opened a PR! Apologies my C is very rusty! https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c/pull/14] https://github.com/trholding/llama2.c/blob/master/runq.c#L65... needs to be scaled with some weird formula like in https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/main/unsloth/model... reply AMICABoard 11 hours agoparentOh thanks bro, nope it uses the simple llama 2 rope with tetha changed to 50k to match llama 3's.

    "originBody": "Next: Index, Previous: preview-auto in LaTeX buffers, Up: Emacs, Lisp and related technical subjects [Contents][Index] 6 On the Origin of Emacs in 1976 (Date: 23 Jul 2024) Summary: EMACS was developed at the MIT AI Lab in 1976. The specifics of the origin have been documented by different people in various places. There is an interesting thread which was discussed on the blog of the late Dan Weinreb, and preserved by archive.org. Ultimately, Guy Steele pulled up his records (in the form of printed emails). The below is an extract which is of historical interest and includes emails from the first couple months of Emacs in 1976. I quote some sections and include the verbatim text at the bottom, which starts with an ITS email from RMS to GLS. Dan Weinreb introduces And now, here’s the mail from Guy Steele. I think this is the best information we are ever going to get, and that this is the last word on the topic. The summary from Guy Steele is:- My conclusions: (1) Clearly, by the end of 1976 and thereafter, RMS was doing the bulk of EMACS development work, but it was not an “overnight” takeover. For a period of seven weeks, anyway, he had some implementation help from others (at least GLS, MOON, and JLK), and certainly had help with design and debugging from these and others (DLW, EAK, ED). He may have become the “principal hacker” more quickly than that, however, perhaps in the space of a week or less; but remember that in the AI lab culture, what I here call “principal hacker” (not a term used at the time) was a “first among equals”, not an exclusive owner. (2) Moon’s involvement was not “hidden”. (3) RMS is responsible for the names “E” and “EMACS”. RMS still deserves 99% or 99.9% or 99.99% or 99.999% of the credit for taking a package of TECO macros and turning it into the most powerful editor on the planet, twice (first in TECO and then with ELISP), pouring in enormous amounts of effort and creativity over many years. He also deserves credit for working with the early user community to work out the initial set of key bindings and command names. I don’t think RMS has any reason to deny the people who helped him out during the first few months their due share of credit. They gave of their time and creativity freely, in the best spirit of contributing to the community. –GLS The sources are: Beginning of thread https://web.archive.org/web/20121107150708/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi#comments why did symbolics fail rebuttal Moon Moon Says: November 15th, 2007 at 9:08 pm All true, so far as I can remember. But in all fairness I have to say that Stallman greatly improved Emacs after he “liberated” it from Guy and me. The early history of Emacs was followed-up compiled by Adrienne: The question of Steele’s role in the creation and development of EMACS appears to be an old issue that continues to rear its head, although Stallman addressed this as far back as 1987 in his article “Emacs the Full Screen Editor” [8] and just this year in the comp.lang.lisp thread “teco, rms, gosling, mocklisp” on 28 July: [2, viper-2]Guy Steel played a role in starting the development of Emacs in1975. He developed the key bindings, I designed the internalplatform, and we worked together for the first night ofimplementation. After that he dropped out. Guy Steele concurred: [3, Pitman 8 August]Except for the minor misspelling of my name :-) , I concur witheverything in RMS’ response. Feel free to post this reply to thediscussion thread. Adrienne Says: November 25th, 2007 at 4:13 pm Dan Weinreb: I contacted Stallman drawing his attention to the comments posted in this blog. With regard to your assertions that Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon were the authors of the original TECO-based Emacs, Stallman has requested that I inform you that your claim is false. In an email message to me dated Thursday, 22 November 2007, Stallman stated:Weinreb is wrong. Moon was never involved in developing Emacs. In a further message dated Saturday, 24 November 2007, Stallman reiterated:Please post that I told you that this claim is false. Steele and Iworked together for the first night of writing code for Emacs, andthen Steele dropped out. Moon was not involved. Sincerely Adrienne cc * Richard M. Stallman * Guy L. Steele, Jr. My conclusions: (1) Clearly, by the end of 1976 and thereafter, RMS was doing the bulk of EMACS development work, but it was not an “overnight” takeover.

If Moon was involved, he must have hidden it from me. Do you know what’s going on here? First some preliminary comments from me: - Secret decoder: GLS is Guy Steele, RMS is of course Richard Stallman, DLW is Dan Weinreb (me), Moon is David Moon, Ed is Ed Schwalenberg who was beta-testing along with me, CBF is Charles Frankston, EAK is Earl Killian, ECC is Gene Cicarelli, RMF is Bob Frankston, and JLK is John Kulp. - I agree that I’m somewhat vague on precisely which things Moon did. I remember that there was a part of “?” called the “loader” that was part of the underlying infrastructure, and I recall that Moon developed this initially. Evidently Stallman improved upon it later (see first email below), as he surely improved upon everything as time went by. Moon also worked on the “MM macros”, which meant “commands that had descriptive English names instead of being one or two keystrokes”, corresponding to today’s Meta-X commands. The MM macros feature was brought into “?” from one of the Emacs predecessors, sometimes called TMACS, that was developed and used by Moon, CBF, EAK, and ECC. RMF had already figured out how to extract the MM commands from TMACS and insert them into TECMAC, one of the other Emacs predecessors, and I borrowed (copied) that code from him. It soon became clear that what we had here was a mess, and the right thing to do was to all join forces and come up with a single code base that had the best of all the ideas in it. Thus was the project born that turned into Emacs. - The reason the mail looks funny is that it predates the Internet; some of what you see is Arpanet mail, and some (like the first one) is internal ITS mail. - Guy sent PDF files of scans, which I have no way of posting here, but he quotes all the important stuff below. - It would be even better had there been email from the previous week, but, gee, you can’t have everything. And now, here’s the mail from Guy Steele. I think this is the best information we are ever going to get, and that this is the last word on the topic. —— I think all of us have been relying on our memories, which can fail in various ways. Last time around I checked my file folder of notes about Emacs, which has some useful information, but not a lot about who did what. Now I have some more information to offer. I’m going to quote email I received during the last part of 1976. The attached PDF files are scans I made today from my paper archives of that email. I may have committed typographical errors in quoting the email below; if in doubt, consult the scans. On October 23, 1976, RMS sent this email to GLS: RMS@@MIT-AI 10/23/76 02:11:39 To: GLS at MIT-AI I HAVE HACKED ?MACS A LOT. IT NOW HAS AN IMPROVED LOADER MACRO AND SUITABLE PURIFY MACRO. THE PURIFY MACRO HAS BEEN DEBUYGGED, AND WINS; I HAVEN’T TESTED THE LOADER ON THE RESULT THOUGH. Comments: (a) At this point the new proposed consolidated set of TECO macros for real-time editing was called “?”. I had chosen this name as a kind of stubborn joke, because a non-alphabetical character as the name of a program was just a little harder to invoke from DDT; also, it followed the example of the @ program, which had just recently taken over from the @ command in TECO for creating program listings —another project that I started and then RMS markedly improved over the years. However, the @ program was useless without command-line arguments, so no one ever wanted to type @^K to start it, whereas it was desirable to start a frequently-used editor by typing a single-character name and then ^K, and I knew it, and I was being a bit mulish about it. (b) This email was sent just to GLS. From the fact that he was reporting progress to me, I infer from this that RMS did not yet regard himself as the “owner” or “principal hacker” of this project. (While the AI Lab culture did support the notion that in principle anyone could hack on any program, in practice it was also well-understood that certain people had superior knowledge about certain programs, and that superior knowledge was consulted and paid due respect. I wouldn’t have dreamed of hacking on TECO without consulting RMS, and he would not have hacked on LISP without consulting JONL or me.)

On 11/27/76, RMS sends out a long message to INFO-E reporting mane changes he has made. By this point RMS appears to be doing most of the work, and I think Moon is doing much less implementation work. On 11/30/76, RMS send a message to INFO-E, and two more on 12/05/76, and three more on 12/11/76. On 12/10/76, JLK sent a message to INFO-E announcing 18 or 19 new features. Comment: John Kulp (an implementor of one of the predecessor macro packages) was actively involved in EMACS development as late as December 10. My conclusions: (1) Clearly, by the end of 1976 and thereafter, RMS was doing the bulk of EMACS development work, but it was not an “overnight” takeover. For a period of seven weeks, anyway, he had some implementation help from others (at least GLS, MOON, and JLK), and certainly had help with design and debugging from these and others (DLW, EAK, ED). He may have become the “principal hacker” more quickly than that, however, perhaps in the space of a week or less; but remember that in the AI lab culture, what I here call “principal hacker” (not a term used at the time) was a “first among equals”, not an exclusive owner. (2) Moon’s involvement was not “hidden”. (3) RMS is responsible for the names “E” and “EMACS”. RMS still deserves 99% or 99.9% or 99.99% or 99.999% of the credit for taking a package of TECO macros and turning it into the most powerful editor on the planet, twice (first in TECO and then with ELISP), pouring in enormous amounts of effort and creativity over many years. He also deserves credit for working with the early user community to work out the initial set of key bindings and command names. I don’t think RMS has any reason to deny the people who helped him out during the first few months their due share of credit. They gave of their time and creativity freely, in the best spirit of contributing to the community. –GLS Next: Index, Previous: preview-auto in LaTeX buffers, Up: Emacs, Lisp and related technical subjects [Contents][Index]",

On the MIT-AI PDP-10, it provided an ML device (hence the name) which worked much like the local DSK device except the data was accessed through MIT's ARPANET IMP. MIT-ML of course had an AI device. >Present evidence is that ITS had a very early networked file system no later than 1972. >ITS has had a facility called the \"ML Device\", or MLDEV, for a long time. The name probably comes from a time when the users of the older more established computer called AI wanted access to files on the computer called ML. The \"device\" part is because ITS files are named by four parts: device, directory, and two file names. To access ML files from AI, the device name is ML. Conversely, from ML the AI device is used. >To date this facility, we can check timestamps from backup tapes. The earliest file called MLDEV is from July 1975. However, if we examine the source code for an earlier ITS version we see that it has built in ML and AI devices that when accessed starts a program called SYS; ATSIGN OTHER.

The earliest file with that name has a timestamp from November 1972. >We know from RFC documents 342, 344, and 366 that AI and ML were first put on the ARPANET in May-June 1972.

All in the early 70s. reply DonHopkins 3 hours agorootparentCRTSTY was kind of like \"screen\", in that it ran a virtual terminal through something like a pseudo TTY. The terminal interpreted SUPDUP protocol into any terminal type that CRTSTY supported. And you could disconnect and reattach to it later to restore your processes, to change terminals or survive a flakey modem or ARPA connection dropping out. But even without CRTSTY, ITS gave everyone the ability to reattach to their processes after they got disconnected, and even pass processes like Lisp interpreters and Zork games around from user to user to share like a joint, by detatching and reattaching them to different TTYs! https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/doc/_info_/its.pri... >VIII.B.

It originally started as a private protocol between the ITS systems at MIT to allow a user at any one of these systems to use one of the others as a display. At the current writing, SUPDUP user programs also exist for Data Disc and Datamedia displays at SU-AI and for Datamedias at SRI-KL. The author is not aware of any SUPDUP servers other than at the four MIT ITS sites. >The advantage of the SUPDUP protocol over an individual terminal's protocol is that SUPDUP defines a \"virtual\" or \"software\" display terminal that implements relevant cursor motion operations. The protocol is not built on any particular display terminal but rather on the set of functions common to all display terminals; hence it is completely device- independent. In addition, the protocol also provides for terminals which cannot handle certain operations, such as line or character insert/delete. In fact, it is more than this. It provides for terminals which are missing any set of features, all the way down to model 33 Teletypes. >The advantage over the TELNET protocol is that SUPDUP takes advantage of the full capabilities of display terminals, although it also has the ability to run printing terminals. https://its.victor.se/wiki/_media/ai_wp_235.pdf >The SUPDUP protocol [Crispin 77] is a highly efficient display telnet protocol. The advantage over the TELNET protocol is that SUPDUP takes advantage of the full capabilities of display terminals, although it also has the ability to run printing terminals. When you use the SUPDUP protocol, you do not need to tell the remote host which you are connecting to what type of terminal you have or what the terminal's capabilities are. The host you are SUPDUPing from handles the actual display support for your terminal. >Additionally, SUPDUP defines a network graphics protpcol [Stallman 78] which makes it easy for network hosts to draw pictures along in addition to text. SUPDUP Graphics Extension: https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/doc/sysdoc/grphcs.... You didn't need CRTSTY to implement the SUPDUP protocol, but CRTSTY translated SUPDUP to standard terminal escape sequences, and provided buffering and optimization. Lisp machines and Knight TVs had their own SUPDUP terminal programs, and I made one for my Apple ][ in Forth. SUPDUP had a line saving extension that RMS hacked into ITS Emacs, so it can stash lines on the screen in local memory before overpainting them, then almost instantly pop them back on the screen later, so you can scroll back and forth through text really fast at 300 baud (plus Devon McCullough made ZipMod with Huffman encoding to make it even faster on top of that): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15539983 I wrote a terminal emulator for the Apple ][ + Videx 80 column card in FORTH and reverse polish notation 6502 code, that supported SUPDUP including the line saving protocol that RMS hacked into ITS and EMACS (%TDSAV %TDRES), so Emacs could stash lines on the screen in a memory buffer (on the Apple's bank switched RAM card) and restore them later to paint the screen quickly when scrolling back and forth. (That was great at 300 baud!) This is just the part of it that interprets SUPDUP codes -- layered on top of the rest of the terminal emulator that emulated H19 (VT52 + character/line insert/delete): http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/forth/supdup.f https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37973838 At 300 baud over a congested ARPA connection, we had a lot of time to think about how to optimize terminal emulation while waiting for the screen to repaint... When James Gosling later implemented his Unix version of Emacs, he created a super-hot screen update algorithm that automatically took into account the capabilities of terminals and the length of their escape codes and padding required (some slow terminals needed padding when performing line/character insert/delete operations, otherwise they would miss characters. It used dynamic programming to figure out the optimal way of updating the screen, which was really great at low baud rates like 300 or 1200 baud. Read the paper and display.c code I linked to in the above linked comment, and see the wikipedia page on dynamic programming: >James Gosling's Emacs screen redisplay algorithm also used similar \"dynamic programming techniques\" to compute the minimal cost path through a cost matrix of string edit operations (the costs depended i.e. on the number of characters to draw, length of the escape codes to insert/delete lines/characters, padding for slow terminals, etc).

No idea why having fixed-length 5- (or even 6-) digit strings for years is preferable to normal, variable-length decimal notation we use for numbers: 48, 112, 988, 1122, 2024, etc. The year is a number, treating it as a lexicographically-imbued string only matters for things like ISO 8601 (20240724T vs. 020240724T) but even then, it's already properly ordered: both \"99991231T\" and \"099991231T\" sort before \"100000101T\". But hey, everybody has their small idiosyncratic pet peeves: I've ran twice into the same person here on HN who just can't stand term \"x64\" because it's \"unofficial\", but somehow refuses to use e.g. \"EM64T\" for it as well. reply ForOldHack 1 hour agorootparentThe Y100K Bug impacts every single financial transaction, every single transaction communication, and every single spread sheet, and table: When it comes to this, the gods of Y100,000 will simply wish it with an act of will, and it will come about. \"Home was a couple of thousand light years away, which distance they traveled instantaneously, by an application of will. \" -Joe Haldeman, \"The Groombridge Effect\" reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentprevas long as they don't go around 'correcting' your comments that seems okay? reply llm_trw 15 hours agoparentprev>- The reason the mail looks funny is that it predates the Internet; some of what you see is Arpanet mail, and some (like the first one) is internal ITS mail.

And to be more extreme: you could actually write small assembly routines and run them in the registers (the first 20 addresses in the PDP-10 address space were the registers — super fast bc they were implemented with semiconductors rather than core!). That was hardcore and I only did it once or twice, just for fun. reply Blackthorn 1 hour agorootparentI'd love to learn enough TECO to be able to do exactly that with Emacs's teco mode.

Line editors are much less of a problem. In these I typically did not insert text in the middle of a line, I simply changed/substituted text in the middle of the line. This helps maintain context in contrast to moving a point around. Fortunately, my TECO exposure was mostly tempered through VTedit, a screen oriented macro set for TECO on the PDP. Couldn’t escape it completely, but it helped reduce the load in my challenged, tiny brain. By the time I moved to VMS, they had switched to EDT. Much more accessible. reply brucehoult 13 hours agorootparent> VTedit At Waikato university a student, Ivan Piacun, wrote \"vted\", also a set of macros for TECO, on the PDP-11/70. I would say it was what most people used until the switch to VAX. I tracked Ivan down on LinkedIn a few months ago. He says when he wrote \"vted\" he had absolutely no knowledge of other similar efforts, or of either emacs or vi, both of which existed (on the other side of the world) a couple of years earlier. Everyone worked in a silo in those days. You might eventually see something in BYTE (though it focussed on microcomputers) or Dr Dobbs (ditto) or Wireless World. Or something might make it ono a DECUS tape. But mostly you were just completely isolated if you lived on an island in the South Pacific Ocean, as we did. I was happy with EDT, never got to like TPU's \"Eve\", though I didn't use it for long because I graduated ... ... graduated to a company that used DG MV10000 with AOS/VS, which had an even worse clone of TECO called SPEED. There must have been a better editor, though I think still a line editor, but I have absolutely no memory of what it was called or how it worked!! I remember having to use SPEED for some things, but not most of the time. Maybe on very large files. I was writing programs in PL/I and also Postscript on that machine. I hooked the brand new Apple Laserwriter to the MV10000, something both DG and the Apple dealer said was impossible, and used it, at first, mostly to replace an HP pen plotter to make diagrams and graphs to physically paste into gaps left in hard copy \"camera ready\" output from an IBM DisplayWriter word processing system. reply ggm 13 hours agorootparentEDT had rubber condom overlays for the Vt100 so you could know what numberpad key to use for magic edit, and the \"gold\" key which I thought was a superbad name for Meta. reply cafard 5 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to me that used SPEED in a complicated program + macro + dunno what to inspect system and error logs on AOS/VS. The full-screen editor was SED, which I remember as being a bit less odd than vi, but maybe because I encountered it first. reply brucehoult 5 hours agorootparentYeah. I just found manuals for both of them! http://www.simulogics.com/archive/public/docs/dg/sw/os/aos/0... http://www.simulogics.com/archive/public/docs/dg/sw/os/aos/0... And dozens and dozens of other old DG manuals. And an online Nova simulator, and binaries for downloadable DG simulators apparently based on SimH (which I thought did PDP/ VAX). reply ggm 14 hours agorootparentprevYea, I walked into the SOS room day one of my degree and so learned SOS and Pascal instead of LISP and TECO. I do sometimes think I chose the wrong room. But your point about the point is well made, I think the DEC-10 TECO had a way to draw the current line and show where the point was, but it was very inferior to have to do it. Like chess wizards you're meant to carry an image of the code in your head at all times. I tried teco, couldn't entirely cope. SOS led naturally to ed in due course. I did learn emacs, But never really took to it. Now, I run my daily work log in org mode and do nothing else in it, but it is very good as a massively over-engineered multi-window table editor. Charles Forsyth (York) wrote a macro for ed which took the point, redrew the 24 line vt00 display to show the lines around it (12 above 11 below) and put you back where you were. He said it made ed as good as vi, and on the baudrate of the day who am I to disagree? reply whartung 12 hours agorootparentOn the Cyber running NOS, we had XEDIT. And similar to your story, I routinely dumped 10 lines of context after each change. Whatever that command was, was hard coded into muscle memory to the point it was mostly automatic. The other nice feature was that you could do quick in place edits from the command line. Combination of ed and sed. Another aspect that impacted TECO on the PDP was the concept of paging the file in. The machine was limited enough that you as a user were responsible for swapping parts of the buffer in and out, which, while usable, was not a good user experience. When loading a large file TECO/vtedit would prompt “loading file xxx.yyy slowly”. And it was. In the labs, my friend and I would commandeer multiple terminals, with one of them being our file loaded in the editor. We’d constantly write the file out, but never exit. And by “large file”, I’m talking a 35K byte source file. It was a different time, to be sure. reply TheOtherHobbes 7 hours agorootparentprevOne of the reasons TECO worked as it did is because baudrate limitations were unimaginable by today's standards.

There is no boundary between an implementation and scriptling language, just one Lisp (Maclisp for Multics Emacs and Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp) for EINE/ZWEI/ZMACS), which in the case of the Lisp Machine also was used to implement the rest of the operating system and all its applications. reply kragen 8 hours agorootparentyes, and i should have said that, but gosmacs didn't copy that aspect of their design, just the ability to extend the editor in (mock) lisp arguably gnu emacs is almost like multics emacs in this sense; the editing functionality of gnu emacs without any lisp code loaded is not actually zero but is pretty minimal. and i was surprised to find the other day that gnu emacs on my laptop is now compiling all my elisp to machine code, which is another similarity to maclisp, albeit a very recent one reply jhbadger 8 hours agorootparentprevFor a similar situation today, there is the editor lem which is an Emacs-clone written in Common Lisp (and whose extension language is also Common Lisp). reply kragen 8 hours agorootparentalso edwin, in mit scheme: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/stable... more generally, though, even if you aren't using a gui library with a built-in text editor widget, gigahertz and gigaflops make it not especially challenging to write a usable text editor in a high-level language. http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/edumb.py is 183 lines of fairly straightforward python and includes full-text search and infinite undo; it's not quite usable but pretty close. its really stupid buffer data structure might start to get unresponsive once you're editing a file in the neighborhood of 100k reply jcynix 9 hours agorootparentprev [–] Yes Zmacs, my favorite editor of all times.

What one can do is configure the keyboard to emit a different, little-used key, and then configure X to recognize that key as hyper. I think what I do is emit left super for both super keys, and right super for both hyper keys, and then X turns right super into Hyper_L. Or something like that. This doesn’t bother me, because I don’t want to assign different meanings to the physical left and right super or left and right hyper keys — folks who do (e.g. for games) might not like it. I also had to do a little bit of magic to get hyper recognised as a modifier.

How do the languages compare? Why did you feel the need to create a new language (especially since both have a strong Haskell flavor). I'm guessing lots of people will have these questions so it could be good to mention Unison somewhere in your materials.

Well when I started on this language in 2017-2019(?), I definitely wasn't aware of Unison. I remember talking to Richard Feldman about scrapscript when he first started working on Roc (fun fact: I was the first person Feldman added to the private repo!). I spent a long time on the initial Scrapscript implementations, trying to compete in some similar applications as Roc, and Feldman just absolutely crushed it. I felt (and still feel) that Roc is doing a great job at the low-level \"platform\" experience I yearn for. [1] https://www.roc-lang.org/ Eventually I met some Unison folks at Strange Loop (2019?), and we had very different inspirations and goals. That seems to still be the case. There are some hard-to-articulate things I want out of the web, and Unison's architecture doesn't seem suited for it. Anyway, Scrapscript only got a bunch of attention a year or two when I started working on it in public a bit more. I think defeating alcoholism also made me much more productive haha -- > How do the languages compare? From what I understand, Unison has very little in common with Scrapscript. \"Content-addressibilty\" is really more of a mechanism than a \"feature\". Kinda like how AI is not really a \"feature\". You can't just sprinkle SHA on something and go raise venture capital haha I think one major difference is that Unison opted for a more traditional git-based paradigm and then built some stellar dev tools on top of that. So far, Scrapscript is a bit more ambitious in its plans. So go try out Unison! And come back and play with Scrapscript too, when it's more mature :) reply the_duke 12 hours agorootparent> From what I understand, Unison has very little in common with Scrapscript. I think you should read up on Unison a bit more, I see a lot of overlap. Both identify code with hashes, and implement code sharing through hash based syncing. Builtin serialization is also present in both, and both are very Haskell inspired. One difference I see is the sharing mechanism, where Unison has a local sqlite repository and tooling for uploading, while Scrapscript seems to be built more around IPFS. But that seems like an implementation detail rather than a fundemantal difference. Unison supports algebraic effects, aka abilities with handlers, which is a much more powerful and general concept than the platforms in Roc. reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentI think ergonomics and practicality could use more consideration when discussing new languages. A language exists in an ecosystem. At a glance to me, Scrapscript looks very traditional and easy to grok from a regular programmers perspective, there are build steps, you can use an IDE or editor etc. Unison feels more like \"Smalltalk Squeak\" and Scrapscript feels more like \"GNU Smalltalk\".

Looks like that has deepmimplications for releases, deployments, inspecting code chnages There is an implication that my-labcorp is using scrapscript. Which is interesting as it seems to be a health based platform - tracking and dealing with test results, X-ray images etc etc So I love committing to one of the most basic CS concepts (cryptographic hashes) And I love the implications for code management.

    "originBody": "NEWS FEATURE 24 July 2024 So you got a null result. Will anyone publish it? Researchers have tried a bunch of strategies to get more negative results into the literature. Nature asks whether they are working. By Max Kozlov Twitter Facebook Email Illustration: The Project Twins Evolutionary biologist Natalie Pilakouta thought it would be an easy theory to test: fish living in Iceland’s geothermal hot springs prefer warmer water than do members of the same species that live in cooler lakes nearby. Yet, when she came to the end of her two-year study, what she found was inconclusive — given the choice, both populations of fish preferred the same, cooler waters. Her postdoctoral supervisor urged her to set aside the findings and move on to other studies: “It’s a failed experiment,” she was told. “You must have done something wrong.” The words stung because publications are a crucial piece of academic currency, particularly for an early-career researcher, and she knew she’d face an uphill struggle to find a home for her results. Moreover, she felt a sense of urgency to share the counter-intuitive findings, which undermine the assumption that aquatic life might evolve a preference for higher temperatures in response to global warming. Pilakouta, who is based at the University of St Andrews, UK, was one of the lucky ones. After submitting her findings to seven journals over six years, her study was finally published1 in January 2023. But her experience illustrates academia’s oft-bemoaned ‘file-drawer problem’, in which findings with null or negative results — those that fail to find a relationship between variables or groups, or that go against the preconceived hypothesis — gather dust in favour of studies with positive or significant findings. A 2022 survey of scientists in France, for instance, found that 75% were willing to publish null results they had produced, but only 12.5% were able to do so2. Over time, this bias in publications distorts the scientific record, and a focus on significant results can encourage researchers to selectively report their data or exaggerate the statistical importance of their findings. It also wastes time and money, because researchers might duplicate studies that had already been conducted but not published. Some evidence suggests that the problem is getting worse, with fewer negative results seeing the light of day3 over time. Illuminating ‘the ugly side of science’: fresh incentives for reporting negative results Funders, publishers and researchers are not sitting idle. Many journals now encourage teams to submit plans and protocols for experiments before conducting them, so that the journals can review the proposals and commit to publishing the results, whatever the outcome. Hundreds of journals now offer such ‘registered reports’, and the number of journals adopting this approach has doubled since 2018. A laser focus on positive results is not the only way to do science, says Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia. Nosek and a constellation of researchers across the world have been pushing to rewrite how research is conducted, challenging the very definition of success. This includes a crackdown on the nefarious side of science — misconduct such as plagiarism — but also a call to curb some of the ‘softer’ transgressions such as selective reporting, with a view to publishing more negative findings. These changes have started to materialize across the publishing industry, as preprint servers proliferate and publishers adopt new manuscript formats, launch journals dedicated to null results and call for special issues. “We can surely do better,” Nosek says. Hidden results Researchers have noted the file-drawer problem for decades. But the bigger problems it was causing did not become clear until the early 2010s, when they set out to reproduce the findings of several foundational experiments in psychology and medical science, and found that they could not. Scientists began to study the extent of this ‘replication crisis’ and the problem of publication bias. Their research laid bare just how often negative results were being buried. In an analysis of more than 300,000 scientific conference presentations, informal posters or talks that scientists often endeavour to turn into papers, fewer than 40% were published in peer-reviewed journals, and negative or null findings were far less likely to be published than positive results4. The extent of publication bias varies by discipline and by country, but the problem seems to have worsened over time. An analysis of 4,600 papers from 1990 to 2007 found that publication bias had increased by 22% over that period3. There could be real-world implications to such a skew in publications. Among 74 registered clinical trials evaluating antidepressants, for example, nearly one-third remained unpublished; these trials were much more likely to show negative than positive results5. Judging by the publications alone, 94% of the trials looked as if they returned positive results, whereas a drug-approval panel judged that 51% did. This selective reporting creates an inflated perception of drug efficacies, one compounded by meta-analyses — surveys of the published literature — that contain mainly studies with positive results. How early-career researchers can learn to trust negative data: five simple steps The bias is present despite the fact that investigators conducting clinical trials in the United States are mandated by law to report their results, regardless of outcome; there can be billions of dollars at stake and trial participants who have given their time and expect the results to be published. These results illustrate “how high a hill there is to climb”, Nosek says. Adding to the likelihood of bias, studies with negative or null findings are often given stricter scrutiny than those with positive findings, especially if the positive findings “confirm something we think is true”, says Steven Goodman, founder of the Stanford Program on Research Rigor and Reproducibility at the Stanford School of Medicine in California. Jessica Payne, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, says that there’s still a perception that scientists must have had some flaw in their research design if a study returns negative or null results. Indeed, according to a survey of 480 economists6, studies with null results are perceived to be less publishable, of lower quality and less important than studies with large and significant results, even when features such as sample size are held constant — a phenomenon known as the null result penalty. If anything, Goodman says, a study with a large effect size should be scrutinized much more than one with a null finding. Cultural bias The replication crisis made one fact crystal clear: incentive structures in academia are not always in line with research integrity and reproducibility. That has a large role in why so few negative studies are published, says Anne Scheel, a metascientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. At the crux of both academic misconduct and publication bias is the same ‘publish or perish’ culture, perpetuated by academic institutions, research funders, scholarly journals and scientists themselves, that rewards researchers when they publish findings in prestigious venues, Scheel says. But these academic gatekeepers have biases, say some critics, who argue that funders and top-tier journals often crave novelty and attention-grabbing findings. Journal editors worry that pages full of null results will attract fewer readers, says Simine Vazire, a psychologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia and editor of the journal Psychological Science. This creates a tight feedback loop between researchers and journals. To attract journals with findings that seem new and noteworthy, some scientists might be tempted to change their hypothesis after seeing the results, or to release only a portion of the data, or to perform statistical tricks, Nosek says. Positive solutions To encourage more researchers to report null results, journals and funders are trying several schemes. One of the most significant changes to come out of the replication crisis is the expansion of preregistration (see ‘Registrations on the rise’), in which researchers must state their hypothesis and the outcomes they intend to measure in a public database at the outset of their study (this is already the norm in clinical trials). Source: OSF.IO The preregistration model nudges researchers to be faithful to the original intent of their study, but it doesn’t address biases that might affect whether they submit their findings to a journal, nor the biases of journal editors and reviewers in deciding what to publish, Nosek says. Instead, he and his colleagues have been focusing on promoting and evaluating the registered report model — similar to a preregistered report, but with the initial plan published by a journal, along with a commitment to peer-review and publish the results. Preliminary data look promising: when Scheel and her colleagues compared the results of 71 registered reports with a random sample of 152 standard psychology manuscripts, they found that 44% of the registered reports had positive results, compared with 96% of the standard publications7 (see ‘Intent to publish’). And Nosek and his colleagues found that reviewers scored psychology and neuroscience registered reports higher on metrics of research rigour and quality compared with papers published under the standard model8. Source: Ref. 7 When the format launched in 2012, only a handful of journals published registered reports; now more than 300 offer the format, including PLoS ONE and Nature, which is published by Springer Nature (Nature’s news team is editorially independent from its journal team). Since starting to offer the format in February 2023, Nature has yet to publish any registered reports, but its sibling journal Nature Human Behaviour has. Although the format has gained in popularity, there are still some kinks to be ironed out, researchers say. Earlier this year, Christine Blume, a sleep researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland, published her first registered report9 on how light affects human circadian rhythms in Nature Human Behaviour. Although she liked receiving feedback on her study design before data collection — “it made me feel that I had the best study design to answer the question I set out to address,” she says — she found it frustrating that the feedback process can span months, even though researchers have a limited time in which to spend grant money. These practical concerns are important to address, Nosek says. He admits that his own paper about the quality of registered reports8 was not itself a registered report, because the grant money was expiring and the team didn’t have time to go through a lengthy approval process and complete its analysis. “We cannot dismiss pragmatics, but what we can do is think about how we lower the barrier so that more of these circumstances can be dealt with,” he says. Journals that offer registered reports are not spread equally across disciplines; most are in psychology and, more recently, neuroscience. Few physical-science journals offer the format — even though null results, such as the failure of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva in Switzerland to find new subatomic particles since the Higgs boson, have been an important part of progress. Emily Sena, a translational-medicine researcher and metascientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says that few academics in preclinical fields have been keen to try the format, especially when there is already so much red tape before researchers can begin their experiments. Disputed dark-matter claim to be tested by new lab in South Korea The format has been slow to catch on among researchers, says Vazire. “We’re not receiving many registered-report submissions.” Sena and her colleagues have been spreading the word about registered reports and helping journal editors to feel equipped to review submissions, she says. Some funders are providing cash incentives: in 2022, the Center for Open Science offered up to US$50,000 to consciousness researchers willing to publish a registered report for their work. It will be important to track how these interventions affect marginalized groups in academia, Sena says. Academics of colour are more likely to be on a fixed contract, so they have less wiggle room to embrace formats that might be better for science overall but less helpful for individual scientists, she says. The Center for Open Science is planning to run trials in which researchers are randomly assigned to use either the standard publication model or a registered report, to evaluate the rigour, acceptance rate and timelines of the resulting publications. Results are expected by 2027. Not every effort to reduce publication bias has borne fruit. One that has seldom worked, Nosek says, is to set up journals with the express purpose of publishing null results. These efforts are well intentioned, he says, but often do not work because a journal can become identified with studies that weren’t able to be published elsewhere. “It can’t provide the reward that researchers need,” he says. Payne was a co-editor at one of these journals, Experimental Results, published by Cambridge University Press. After only three years, the journal ceased publication in 2023 despite carrying the “imprimatur of Cambridge”, she says. There’s an increasingly popular do-it-yourself route to publishing negative results: posting a manuscript on a preprint server. Publishing a preprint can offer an opportunity to showcase research without the pressure of journal submission. This option can be especially helpful for early-career researchers, Pilakouta says. Still, it takes time to write up a result, regardless of where it appears, and publishing on preprint servers is unlikely to offer researchers enough of an incentive to justify the time, Goodman says. Null nuance Advocates acknowledge that not every study that returns a null result is worthy of publishing. Goodman says he encourages researchers to publish null and negative findings that are “informative”, meaning they come from studies and analyses that are designed rigorously, question previous results and open up fresh areas for exploration. For example, there is a long-held idea that the womb is sterile — that the uterus and fetus are free of microorganisms. But, beginning in 2010, a series of papers found microbial contamination in the placenta, calling the hypothesis into question and suggesting that some complications of pregnancy could be linked to bacteria. It wasn’t until 2019 that a study of placental samples from 537 women — by far the largest number in an analysis of this kind — rigorously showed the absence of any bacterial signal. That study set a benchmark for investigating the microbiome of tissues that carry few microorganisms and that can therefore give rise to false-positive results, and suggested that bacterial infection is not a common cause of problems in pregnancy10. Blume says it’s important to extract something insightful from the data, even if they are inconclusive. For example, in 2022 she found that although artificial light suppresses the hormone melatonin, that didn’t equate to a change in sleep quality11. The message that melatonin isn’t necessarily a proxy for sleep quality might have helped that study to get published, she says. As long as researchers continue to seek publication in prestigious outlets, publication bias won’t go away, Goodman predicts. Still, he is surprised at how much progress has been made in the past decade: top-tier journals pledging to accept rigorous studies, regardless of outcome, would have been “unheard of” even five or ten years ago, he says. Pilakouta now leads a laboratory and can set an example for her undergraduate and graduate students. But she’s also seen first-hand how deeply engrained the thirst for positive findings is. “It concerns me how early it starts,” she says. Next time she gets a null result, she says, she’s hopeful that it won’t take seven years to publish it.

(nature.com)166 points by sohkamyung 6 hours agohidepastfavorite99 comments tefkah 5 hours agoYou could publish it in the Journal of Trial and Error (https://journal.trialanderror.org), which I created with a number of colleagues a couple years ago! Our editor-in-chief was interviewed for this related Nature article a couple months ago (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7). While it’s easy pickings, it’s still always worth pointing out the hypocrisy of Nature publishing pieces like this, given that they are key drivers of this phenomenon by rarely publishing null results in their mainline journals. They are have extremely little incentive to change anything about the way scientific publishing works, as they are currently profiting the most from the existing structures, so them publishing something like this always leaves a bit of a sour taste. reply MostlyStable 4 hours agoparentProviding _places_ to publish the result is only part of the problem. The other part is incentivizing scientists to do so. And similarly, Nature itself is responding to incentives. The core problem is that scientists themselves, the individuals, do not mostly display much interest (in a revealed preference kind of way) for null results. If scientists were interested and wanted to read articles about null results, then either journals like Nature would do so, or the numerous examples of journals like yours that have come and gone over the years would have been more succesful and widespread. Because of this revealed lack of interest, high tier journals don't tend to take of them (correctly responding to the lack of demand), and journals like your that specifically target these kinds of articles A) struggle to succeed and B) remain relatively \"low impact\", which means that the professional rewards to publishing in them are not very high, which means that the return on effort of publishing such a work is lower. Don't get me wrong, the scientific community could do a lot more to combat this issue, but the core problem is that right now, the \"market\" is just following the incentives, and the incentives show that, despite what the stream of articles like this one over the past few decades is that most scientists don't seem to actually have an interest in reading null-result papers. reply borski 2 hours agorootparentFrom the article: “A 2022 survey of scientists in France, for instance, found that 75% were willing to publish null results they had produced, but only 12.5% were able to do so.” reply EvgeniyZh 35 minutes agorootparentThe question is how many of them are willing to review and read these publications. Of course as an individual scientist (not me, but someone who does experiments), I'd love to capitalize on my work, even if it is unsuccessful (in the sense of null result), by publishing it. But do I, and scientific community in general, care about null results? I'd say mostly no. Null results, if universally published, would overwhelm already overwhelmed publication system. If you think it will be helpful to others to know about specific failure, put it in a blogpost or even on arxiv. Or talk about it at conference (for CS, workshop). Also, if we use publications as a measure of scientists success, and we do, is a scientist with a lot of null results really successful? reply dleeftink 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat if to each publication of a non-null result, academics are given the opportunity to publish their nulls as well, if only as a appendix or better, a counterpublication to their main conclusions? I don't buy the argument that papers need be of max-n length, now that documents and journals can be easily stored and distributed. I would love something like Living Papers [0][1] to take off, where the null an non-non results could be compared interactively on similar footing. [0]: https://github.com/uwdata/living-papers [1]: https://idl.uw.edu/living-papers-template/ reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentA null result may be a dead end and so there is no related paper worth publishing it in. A null result should be published right away in a searchable place, but probably isn't worth a lot of effort in general. I tried X, it didn't work, here is the raw data. reply dleeftink 4 hours agorootparentThat's my thought exactly--not a related paper but simply providing additional room for discussing the less shiny bits of the same experiment. Even if the whole thing is a null, the setup, instruments, dependencies and what methods worked/didn't work is worth describing by itself. reply acchow 1 hour agorootparentAll of that - the setup, the instruments, dependencies, methods - should be pre-submitted to the journal before the experimental results arrive. The journal should be the one that uses the data from the experiment and runs your pre-submitted program over the data to produce a result. Papers need to be published backwards. reply bumby 46 minutes agorootparentI agree that in an idealized way, this would be much better. But what do you do about going through all this process and ending up with a bad reviewer?* In those cases, how would you handle re-submitting to a different journal without looking like you're creating those artifacts after-the-fact to suit your outcome? Would the pre-submittals need to be handled by some third party? * the current process still has a lot of luck in terms of getting assigned referees. Sometimes you just plain get a bad reviewer who just can't be bothered to read the submission carefully and is quick to reject it. I would hate to see a system that only allows for a single shot at publication reply bluGill 46 minutes agorootparentprevRight now you don't even know who will publish you paper until all that is done. Your experiment might be try some promising molecule/drug in a petri dish, and see what happens, if the results are amazing you will get in a different journal than if the results are something happens but the control molecule/drug is better. reply c-linkage 3 hours agorootparentprevIn the old days, Science Weekly[1] used to print 4-5 paragraph summaries of published research in a three-column layout. The magazine was dense with information across a huge number of topics. And in the very old days, newspapers used to publish in tabular form local election results and sports games. I feel that Nature could dedicate one to two pages of one paragraph summaries of null results with links to the published papers. It's amazingly easy to skim such pages to find interesting interesting things! [1] I think that was the name; I canceled my subscription when they changed to a Scientific American wannabe. I was looking for breadth not depth! I could always get the original paper if I wanted more information. reply kkylin 2 hours agorootparentprevI agree incentivization is definitely a big part of the problem, but I think in general a bigger issue is that as a society we tend to reward people who are the first to arrive at a non-null result. This is as true in science as much as in any other area of human endeavor. reply bumby 2 hours agoparentprevYears ago, I came across SURE: Series of Unsurprising Results in Economics with the goal of publishing good, but statistically insignificant, research. https://blogs.canterbury.ac.nz/surejournal/ reply jraph 2 hours agorootparentI thought \"statistically insignificant\" meant we couldn't conclude anything. So I was surprised. [1] says: > In statistical hypothesis testing,[1][2] a result has statistical significance when a result at least as \"extreme\" would be very infrequent if the null hypothesis were true So I understand this journal publishes results for which a hypothesis was tested, found to give insignificant results, which would rule out the hypothesis assuming the research was correctly conducted, without biases in the methodology, with a big enough sample, etc. Which would be worthy to know but no journal usually takes this research because it doesn't make the headlines (which yes, I've always found was a shame). Do I get this right? [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance reply bumby 2 hours agorootparentYes, statistical insignificance doesn't \"prove\" the null hypothesis, it just fails to reject it. It's a subtle, but sometime misunderstood distinction. It's a measure of how big the effect size is and how often you'd expect to see it just by chance rather than due to the variables you're measuring. If it's a really extreme difference, we expect it to happen less often just by chance alone than if it's a really miniscule difference. >Which would be worthy to know but no journal usually takes this research because it doesn't make the headlines. That's usually correct, which gives rise to all kinds of issues like the article talks about. It can result in a lot of wasted time (when you're conducting what you \"think\" is a new experiment, but it's been done many times but unpublished because it doesn't provide statistically significant results). It provides little incentive for replication, which can lead to stronger conclusions about the results than may be warranted, etc. reply foldr 2 hours agorootparentThe flip side of this is that there is almost always a very small effect, even if you are testing a crazy hypothesis (there are very weak correlations between all sorts of things). So you can often get a ‘significant’ result just by using a huge sample, even though the effect size is too small to matter practically. reply Waterluvian 4 hours agoparentprevOmg I love this. For like 20 years I’ve joked about “The Journal of Null Results and Failed Experimenrs” and it looks like you and your friends are actually doing it. There’s so much to learn from these cases. reply greenavocado 4 hours agoparentprevIf you publish null results you accelerate the development of competing hypotheses by your competition. It's best to make sure they waste as much time as possible so you can maintain an edge and your reputation. /s reply glial 5 hours agoprevThe article hints at this, but not publishing null results (at least in a database - somewhere!) goes hand-in-hand with the replication crisis. An experimental outcome is always a single sample from a distribution of outcomes that you would obtain if you repeated the experiment many times. Choosing to only publish the most extreme positive values means that when the experiment is replicated, \"regression to the mean\" makes it very likely that the measured effect will be weaker, and possibly not statistically significant. This is not an evidence of scientific fraud -- rather, it is a predictable outcome of a publishing incentive scheme that rewards hype and novelty over robust science. I've said it before but it bears repeating - replicating published results, and adding the findings to a database, should be a standard part of PhD training programs. reply matthewdgreen 4 hours agoparentThere is a major issue of limited resources to replicate results, in terms of both time and funding. For example: I would assume that most important results are replicated. As a concrete example, if someone identifies a medication that (in one small trial) shows a statistically significant effect in curing some serious medical condition, then this will drive further replication attempts. On the other hand, if someone publishes a study showing that holding a pen in your mouth makes you 1% likelier to do well on the PSATs, this study will probably languish without replication for a decade — because honestly who cares? It’s basically a curiosity. I can’t help but notice that many of the headline results that characterize the “replication crisis” were small-effect-size social science experiments that fundamentally weren’t that important outside of popular science news. I’m not saying that our current allocation of resources is optimal. I am pointing out that our resources are finite and “replicate everything” is not even a remotely practical allocation of those resources. reply nostrademons 4 hours agorootparent> I would assume that most important results are replicated. GP is pointing out that the incentive structure makes this an invalid assumption. If publications reward hype and novelty when deciding what to publish, then there is no point spending your limited resources replicating other peoples' results, they won't get published anyway. And experiments that give a null result won't be published anyway. What's left are one-off results that showed something surprising simply by chance and don't replicate...but then, we generally will never know that they don't replicate, because the replication experiment is not novel, has a low chance of being published, and hence isn't worth spending limited resources on. Basically the publication process introduces selection bias into the types of research that are even attempted, which then filters down into the conclusions we take from it. A cornerstone of the scientific method is random sampling, but as long as the results that get disseminated are chosen by a non-random process, it introduces bias. reply bachmeier 55 minutes agorootparentprev> There is a major issue of limited resources to replicate results, in terms of both time and funding. Undergraduate students love being involved in research. It's one of the selling points of many top universities. Grad students replicate research all the time. Maybe funding is an issue in grant fields (some research is extraordinarily expensive) but that doesn't excuse the lack of replication across the board. reply bumby 2 hours agorootparentprev>“replication crisis” were small-effect-size social science experiments that fundamentally weren’t that important outside of popular science news. I don't know that this is accurate. Some of these make their way to large-scale public policy, or give bona fides to people who craft far-reaching policy. This includes changes to 401k allocations to car-insurance rates and other mundane, but consequential policies. The truth is most of science is not important outside of popular science news. So we shouldn't be surprised that the bulk of replication crises are also in the same category. Claiming this means the replication crises is not really impactful may be a case of base rate neglect. It's also important to note that your example of medical replication is a relatively highly regulated area, where most other science is much less so. reply freestyle24147 4 hours agorootparentprev> For example: I would assume that most important results are replicated.

However, this distinction is not only not advertised broadly and without aversion, it is usually (in my experience) not mentioned at all, if not outright denied using persuasive rhetorical language (like, for example, when an object level instance of not achieving it is pointed to in the wild, such as in forum conversations). This may not be fraud (that requires intent I think?), but it achieves the same end: misinforming people.

[1] Not unlike in religion, a competing metaphysical framework (model of reality) to science. reply kerkeslager 3 hours agorootparentThis sort of comment is why I think a lot of philosophy is just communicating poorly to make yourself sound smart. In your footnote, for example, you translated your philosophy-speak into English (metaphysical framework -> model of reality). Why not just say that? Your entire comment goes into \"philosophy mode\" and communicates a few very simple ideas in overcomplicated language. Science and religion are pretty poorly understood as competing models of reality. Religion originates when people make up answers to other people's questions to gain social standing, and religion continues due to (among other things) anchoring bias--the bias people have toward continuing to believe what they already believe. While religion does result in those people having a model of reality, there is no attempt being made at any point to relate the model to reality. When religious people and scientists disagree, it's not because the religious person is trying to model reality differently--the religious person isn't even trying to model reality--it's because the religious person is biased in favor of their existing belief. You said: > In its scriptures/philosophy, science describes extremely thorough and sound principles and guidelines...but in on the ground practice (by scientists, which are a part of \"science\"), they are often not achieved[1]. This is presented as some sort of gotcha, but it's not: few scientists will claim that science is being practiced perfectly or even well. Outside of a few areas such as particle physics, we're quite aware that our ability to practice scientific ideals is hampered by funding, publication incentives, availability of test subjects in human studies, data privacy, etc. And we're aware that this means that our conclusions need to be understood as probabilities rather than 100%-confidence facts. There are certainly some people who treat scientific conclusions with religious absolute confidence, but doing that is fundamentally against scientific principles. The accusation you are leveling against science would be better targeted toward people: generally science journalists and the science-illiterate public rather than scientists themselves. The entire reproducibility crisis is scientists using science to show that our practice of science is too imperfect to result in high-confidence conclusions. Religious people jumping on the replication crisis because they think it disproves science is rich. The replication crisis isn't a disproof of science, it's an application of science. The reason we know that there's a replication crisis is because scientists asked \"How confident can we be in the conclusions of existing studies?\" and applied science to answer that question. If you really think science is invalid, then you can't use science to prove that. And the fact remains that any confidence in conclusions at all is more than religion has to offer, because again, religion isn't trying to model reality--the fact that religion produces a model of reality is merely an unfortunate side-effect. reply 3np 3 hours agorootparentprev> Not unlike in religion, a competing metaphysical framework (model of reality) to science.

The main reason why people don't like publishing null results is that it hurts them in funding applications. The current system works with mentality, we shouldn't fund someone who don't get positive results. It is better to allocate this somewhere else. Most of the problems with research can be tracked down to funding issues and practices. But these are political issues, so people try to argue about other things because it is easy. reply gzer0 3 hours agoprevThe main issue with publishing research is the cost.

Making publishing compulsory could lead to other, worse problems given humans are involved. I realize as I'm writing this that I don't really understand what \"publishing\" means. It's more than just making the paper available, right? Is there a formal definition, or just a colloquial one in science? reply setopt 5 hours agoparent“Publishing” in academia usually refers to being accepted in a “peer-reviewed” journal or conference. So your paper is not just uploaded somewhere – it is sent to 2-3 domain experts, who criticize your work and force you to jump through lots hoops before it’s either “accepted for publication” or “rejected”. When this works well, it’s a good filter to prevent spam, fraud, methodological errors, etc. from being published, while improving the quality of the accepted research papers via feedback from other domain experts. When it doesn’t work well, the referees can take it upon themselves to reject papers for subjective reasons, including that the work is “not novel enough”, that they don’t like the model you used, or that they are just not excited by the research field you work in. It also happens that they require you extend your work in a way that takes an order of magnitude more time before they’ll accept it. For the authors, it’s often difficult to defend themselves from this kind of attacks, since the referees in many journals don’t need to justify their claims much, and often feel free to be extra harsh since they tend to be anonymous. Since going through the publication process can take months to years of work depending on your field, some researchers would not be willing to put in that effort for a negative result (which is unlikely to be cited and thus doesn’t help your career). It is however possible to just upload a paper (e.g. to arXiv). These “manuscripts” are often useful and can be cited normally, but researchers tend to be a bit more wary of citing them unless the authors are well-respected due to the lack of peer review. reply michaelt 5 hours agoparentprev> I realize as I'm writing this that I don't really understand what \"publishing\" means. 1.

Ideally peer review would catch this. A badly setup study should be critiqued in peer review. Forcing scientists to first publish their methods before doing the experiment also helps, as it validates the experimental setup before hand. I also think it’s worth publishing studies where a null result was reached due to some error in experimental setup or other factors, as long as it’s presented as such and reflected upon. This can still be valuable information for future experiments. Offering scientists social capital for that (an “official” publication, citations) might also incentivize scientists to publish the results as is, rather than making it appear as a “true” null result, or even as a non-null one (eg through p hacking). 2. While obviously possible, given the amount of effort scientists have to go through to raise funding for an experiment nowadays, i find it highly unlikely that people would go through this effort. 3. This is already possible and a problem. This is a problem of academic misconduct, has very little to do with null results. The current publishing system is of course already set up to be gamed, so I understand your worries. But null results should be published, as they are just science. Even if someone were to “game” the system by publishing a ton of null results, those publications should be held to the same level of scrutiny as any other publication. If someone is extremely prolific in replicating existing studies and comes up with a ton of null results, that should be lauded and those papers should be published, no? I do believe the entire idea of a researchers output only being recognized by being allowed to be published in a journal is terrible and should be abolished, but baby steps I guess. reply vharuck 5 hours agoparentprevCurrently, the system can be gamed exactly as you say by publishing sloppy studies that falsely find a \"real\" effect.

Positive result claim: the sun comes up in the morning. Negative result claims: the sun moves sideways in the morning. The sun was always there. The sun peeks up in the morning and immediately goes back down. And so on. Positive result claim: aspirin is an effective pain reliever. Negative result claims: eating sawdust is an effective pain reliever. Snorting water is an effective pain reliever. Crystal Healing is an effective pain reliever. Etc. Because there are so many negative results, it's trivial to construct an experiment which produces one. So why should that be published? Negative results should be published when people in the community are asking that question, or have a wrong belief in the answer (hence the replication crisis). But if nobody cares about the question, it's hard to argue for why a given negative result would be preferred over any other negative result for purposes of publication. reply dfgtyu65r 4 hours agoparentNone of these are negative results in the sense of being a 'null' hypothesis? In the language of hypothesis testing you have your null and alternative hypotheses.

So let's say I claim that the sun goes in a circle in the sky in the morning. The null hypothesis is that it doesn't do that. Perform experiment. Null hypothesis wins. Write up paper!

No one will publish your negative results. Unless you win the lottery and stumble across a once-in-a-generation negative result (e.g. the Michelson–Morley experiment), any time you spend working on research that yields negative results is essentially wasted. This article completely glosses over the fact that to publish a typical negative result, you need to have progressed your scientific career to the point where you are able to do so. To get there, you need piles of publications, and since publishing positive results is vastly easier than publishing negative ones, everyone is incentivized to not waste time on the negative ones. You either publish or you perish, after all. Simply put, within the current framework of how people actually become scientists and do research, there is no way to solve the 'file drawer' problem. You might see an occasional graduate student find something unusual enough to publish, or an already-tenured professor with enough freedom to spend the time submitting their manuscript to 20 different journals, but the vast majority of scientists are going to drop any research avenue that doesn't immediately yield positive results. reply cactusfrog 5 hours agoprevJust write a preprint or a blog post reply cydodon 5 hours agoparentA preprint will still give less value to the negative result.

Something for which there are estimates close to 90% is the volume of transactions happening on centralized exchanges, and since these are required pretty much everywhere to follow AML procedures, just like traditional banks (sometimes even more intrusive than banks), it means it is just as easy, if not easier, to prosecute criminals who would use these... with the added bonus of having a public ledger with records of their activity on-chain. reply GTP 9 hours agorootparentI suggest to everyone interested to also hear what Brett Johnson, a former criminal, has to say about the topic in his podcast [1].

Money is an abstraction over the relative value we assign physical goods; instead of bartering, we collectively agree on using money as an intermediate form. The financial system, then, is a lot more abstraction over the value of producers of things—and thereby human work. Of course it's way more complex than that, but that's the basic difference between real-world money and crypto currencies. reply BoorishBears 11 hours agorootparentprevGovernment backing, our shared delusion, unicorn dust, take your pick: whatever it is, it's something stable enough that it doesn't experience quintuple digit deflation in a decade. reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentyes, runaway inflation is much better! reply BoorishBears 10 hours agorootparentYour tone implies you're unironically trying to compare 3% inflation to 20,000% deflation.

If Together.ai has the model, we proxy to them, since they're faster than us. We might switch to Fireworks for the Llama-3.1 models since they offer them at lower cost; in general that's why I didn't specify the inference providers, since we'll probably change and optimize that quite a bit. (Also would be interesting to try using Groq, since they're so fast.) 2. If the model isn't hosted somewhere else, e.g. a lot of the Llama 3 finetunes, we run the models on our own GPU clusters hosted in Fly.io.

With a POSIX compliant shell, `pnut.sh` is sufficiently powerful to compile itself and, with some effort, [TCC](https://bellard.org/tcc/). Because TCC can be used to bootstrap GCC, this makes it possible to bootstrap a fully featured build toolchain from only human-readable source files and a POSIX shell. Because Pnut doesn't support certain C features used in TCC, Pnut features a native code backend that supports a larger subset of C99. We call this compiler `pnut-exe`, and it can be compiled using `pnut.sh`. This makes it possible to compile `pnut-exe.c` using `pnut.sh`, and then compile TCC, all from a POSIX shell.\" Anywhere we can see a step-by-step demo of this process. Curious if the authors tried NetBSD or OpenBSD, or using another small C compiler, e.g., pcc. Historically, tcc was problematic for NetBSD and its forks.

I think seeking a specific number of bytes and then writing data there will be a problem, though. For seeking n bytes, read nor sed will work; they work with lines. sed is the only one of those that can write, and POSIX doesn’t appear to have the -i option for in-place editing (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/s...) So, I think head for seeking followed by sed (or ed or vi, but sed is the simpler tool, I think) for replacing the first n characters, redirecting to a temp file and then doing a mv is your only option.

It's a \"perceived normality\" in the C world. There is no good reason, however, CMake isn't a C library.

It violates an important rule of selling: Never tell the customer \"Trust me\". reply leni536 5 hours agoparentprevhttps://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2008-09-15 reply wahern 15 hours agoprevThis is very cool, regardless of how serious it was intended to be taken. Before base-64 encoders/decoders became more common as preinstalled commands in the environments I found myself on, I wrote a base64 utility in mostly pure POSIX shell: https://25thandClement.com/~william/2023/base64.sh If this project had existed I might have opted to compile my C-based base-64 encoder and decoder routines, suitably tweaked for pnut's limitations. I say base64.sh is mostly pure not because it relies on shell extensions, but because the only non-builtins it depends on are od(1) or, alternatively, dd(1) to assist with binary I/O. And preferably od(1), as reading certain control characters, like NUL, into a shell variable is especially dubious. The encoder is designed to operate on a stream of decimal encoded bytes. (See decimals_fast for using od to encode stdin to decimals, and decimals_slow for using dd for the same.) It looks like pnut uses `read -r` for reading input. In addition to NULs and related raw byte issues, I was worried about chunking issues (e.g. truncation or errors) on binary data, e.g. no newlines within LINE_BUF bytes. Have you tested binary I/O much? Relatedly, how many different shell implementations have you tested your core scheme with? In addition to bash, dash, and various incarnations of /bin/sh on the BSDs, I also tested base64.sh with Solaris' system shells (ksh88 and ksh93 derivatives), as well as AIX's (ksh88 derivative). AIX had some odd quirks with pipelines even with plain text I/O. (Unfortunately Polar Home is gone, now, so I have no easy way to play with AIX; maybe that's for the better.) reply laurenth 14 hours agoparentOne of the example we include is a base64 encoder/decoder: https://github.com/udem-dlteam/pnut/blob/main/examples/compiled/base64.sh It doesn't support NULs as you pointed out, but it's interesting to see similarities between your implementation and the one generated by Pnut. Because we use `read -r`, we haven't tested reading binary files. Fortunately, the shell's `printf` function can emit all 256 characters so Pnut can at least output binary files. This makes it possible for Pnut to have a x86 backend for the use of reproducible builds. Regarding the use of `read`, one constraint we set ourselves when writing Pnut is to not use any external utilities, including those that are specified by the POSIX standard (other than `read` and `printf`). This maximizes portability of the code generated by Pnut and is enough for the reproducible build use case. We're still looking for ways to integrate existing shell code with C. One way this can be done is through the use of the `#include_shell` directive which includes existing shell code in the generated shell script. This makes it possible to call the necessary utilities to read raw bytes without having Pnut itself depends on less portable utilities. reply teo_zero 12 hours agorootparentSorry, but since the very goal of base64 is to encode \"uncomfortable\" bytes, saying that your example doesn't work with uncomfortable bytes is like providing a fibonacci demo that only works with arguments less than 3, or a clock that only shows correct time twice a day. I'd choose a different example to showcase pnut. reply wahern 12 hours agorootparentIn the context of what it seems to be primarily attempting to achieve, assisting in the bootstrapping of more complex environments directly or indirectly dependent on C, I found the base64 example (more so the SHA-256 example in the same directory) quite interesting and evidence of the sophistication of pnut notwithstanding the limitations. And as was pointed out, it wouldn't be difficult to hack in the ability to read binary data: just swap in a replacement for the getchar routine, such as I've done with od. In fact, that ease is one of the most fascinating aspects of this project--they've built a conceptually powerful execution model for the shell that can be directly targeted when compiling C code, as opposed to indirection through an intermediate VM (e.g. a P-code interpreter in shell). It has it's limitations, but those can be addressed. Given the constraints, the foundation is substantial and powerful even from a utilitarian perspective. When people discuss Turing completeness and related concepts one of the unstated caveats is that neither the concept itself, nor most solutions or environments, meaningfully address the problem of I/O with the external environment. pnut is kind of exceptional in this regard, even with the limitations. reply metadat 2 hours agoprevAlso see this related submission from May, 2024: Amber: Programming language compiled to Bash https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40431835 (318 comments) --- Pnut doesn't seem to differentiate between `int' and `int*' function parameters. That's weird, and doesn't come across as trustworthy at all! Shouldn't the use of pointers be disallowed instead? int test1(int a, int len) { return a; } int test2(int* a, int len) { return a; } Both compile to the exact same thing: : $((len = a = 0)) _test1() { let a $2; let len $3 : $(($1 = a)) endlet $1 len a } : $((len = a = 0)) _test2() { let a $2; let len $3 : $(($1 = a)) endlet $1 len a } The \"runtime library\" portion at the bottom of every script is nigh unreadable.

One reason is that dash stores variables using a very small hash table with only 37 entries[0] meaning variable access quickly becomes linear as memory usage grows. But even with that, dash is still surprisingly fast -- when compiling `pnut.c` with `pnut.sh`, dash comes in second place: ksh93: 31s dash: 1m06s bash: 1m19s zsh: >15m [0]: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dash/dash.git/tree/src/...

If you link to a 1-line problem (here, #define VTABSIZE 39), then why not boost that to 79 or 113, say, re-compile the shell and re-run your benchmark?

Do I understand correctly that you implement pointers in shell by having a shell variable _0 for the first \"byte\" of \"memory\", a shell variable _1 for the second, etc.? reply laurenth 17 hours agoparentAuthor here, That's correct! Unlike Bash and other modern shells, the POSIX standard doesn't include arrays or any other data structures. The way we found around this limitation is to use arithmetic expansion and indexed shell variables (that are starting with `_` as you noted) to get random memory access. reply osmsucks 11 hours agorootparentSince I experimented with something similar in the past to mimick multidimensional arrays: depending on the implementation this can absolutely _kill_ performance.

Did you mean [ .. ], a test expression? ^-- SC2283 (error): Remove spaces around = to assign (or use [ ] to compare, or quote '=' if literal). ^-- SC2086 (info): Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. It seems to be parsing the arithmetic expansion as a command substitution, which then causes the analyzer to produce errors that aren't relevant. ShellCheck's own documentation[0] mention this in the exceptions section, and the code is generated such that quoting and word splitting are not an issue (because variables never contain whitespace or special characters). It also warns about `let` being undefined in POSIX shell, but `let` is defined in the shell script so it's a false positive that's caused by the use of the `let` keyword specifically.

C is the language in which the very kernel of Unix is implemented!” Master Foo replied: “That is so. Nevertheless, there is more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C.” The programmer grew distressed. “But through the C language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping matchless performance!” Master Foo replied: “All that you say is true. But there is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C.” The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: “Master programmer, consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten thousand lines?” The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what Nubi had written. Finally he agreed that it was so. “And how many hours would you require to implement and debug that C program?” asked Nubi. “Many,” admitted the visiting programmer. “But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many more worthy tasks await him.” “And who better understands the Unix-nature?” Master Foo asked. “Is it he who writes the ten thousand lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by not coding?” Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened. reply VitoVan 15 hours agorootparenthttp://catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/ten-thousand.html reply wruza 10 hours agorootparentprevThis koan shows the power of a one-liner, not shell scripting in general.

Not a fan. reply eichin 4 hours agorootparentMy rule (and the code review policy I impose) emphasizes complexity instead - a 50 line shell script is great if it doesn't use if or case. (It's not so much of a strict rule as \"once you're nesting conditionals, or using any shell construct that really needs a comment to explain the shell and not your code, you should probably already have switched to python.\" This is in parallel with \"error handling in this case is critical, do you really think your bash is accurate enough?\") I wasn't the strictest reviewer (most feared, sure, but not strictest) at least partly because my personal line for \"oh that bit of shell is obvious\" is way too high. reply therein 11 hours agorootparentprevThis rule of thumb is clearly too simplified, even as far as the definition goes.

    "title": "MPPP – The first 'designer drug' disaster (2023)",
    "originLink": "https://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/mppp/mppph.htm",
    "originBody": "MPPP 1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine, or Desmethylprodine or ‘reversed meperidine’ The first ‘designer drug’ disaster Simon Cotton University of Birmingham Molecule of the Month August 2023 Also available: JSMol version. What is a designer drug? The origin of the term is credited to Dr Gary L. Henderson, of the University of California at Davis. A designer drug is based on the structure of an existing drug – which may be naturally sourced from a plant (like cocaine or morphine) or be synthetic (like amphetamine) - but with a slightly different structure (often done by changing a side-chain) designed to make it undetectable in routine drug tests. These slight changes to its structure also change the properties of the drug in the body, sometimes dangerously. Thus, recently this has meant the ‘bath salts’ such as mephedrone in place of cathinone (khat), with amphetamine-like effects, or the ‘spice’ drugs, which affect the ‘cannabinoid’ receptor and may produce similar symptoms to marijuana. So how long has this ‘designer drug’ been around? What we call MPPP was first reported in the Journal of Organic Chemistry in 1947 by Albert Ziering and John Lee of the pharmaceutical company Hofmann-La Roche. They were trying to make better painkillers, though MPPP turned out to be no better than existing ones. They tested MPPP on lab rats and found that it seemed to be safe. To make it, you first react 1-methyl-4-piperidone with phenyllithium, then esterify the resulting alcohol with propionic anhydride. Why is it called reversed meperidine? In comparison with the meperidine (a.k.a. pethidine or Demerol, the first synthetic opioid painkiller, originally reported in 1939), the ester group in MPPP is the other way round – it is an isomer of meperidine. So who did find out the nasty side to the molecule? A young chemistry graduate named Barry Kidston suddenly developed Parkinson’s disease in 1976, when he was only 23. For nearly a decade, he had been abusing a wide range of drugs, such as marijuana, amphetamines and barbiturates, before finally focussing upon opiates like meperidine and codeine. During the summer of 1976 he discovered the 1947 report of MPPP and decided to try that, successfully making it and testing it on himself, finding that it had an opiate-like ‘high’. He then repeated this synthesis several times. Whether he got over-confident in his ability or not, he seems to have taken some shortcuts in the synthesis and in 1976 developed a state of ‘muteness, severe rigidity, weakness, tremor, flat facial expression, and altered sensorium’, being unable to speak. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward. So what happened next? A number of treatments were tried. After treatments with a number of drugs including levodopa (a drug which the body converts into dopamine, used to treat Parkinson’s disease), his condition improved, and he received a number of medications until in September 1978 he was found dead from an overdose of cocaine and codeine, having continued on a path of drug abuse. Post-mortem examination of the brain revealed major destruction of nerve cells in the substantia nigra region, something also observed with Parkinson’s patients. They examined his laboratory in 1976 and found not just the MPPP but also an impurity formed at high temperatures, MPTP. This was tested on rats (and also on hamsters and guinea pigs), but without revealing any Parkinson’s symptom, so the cause remained a mystery. The medics studying the case wrote it up for publication in a journal called Psychiatry Research, and the medical world largely ignored it for a few years. MPTP Dr J. William Langston [Photo: J. Parkinson's Dis.]So what changed? In 1982, Dr J. William Langston, the Director of Neurology of the Santa Clara Valley Medical Centre in San José, was called in to examine George Carillo, a 42-year-old heroin addict who had just been admitted into the centre’s locked psychiatry unit. Carillo was ‘frozen’ – he could not move or talk. They spotted limited finger movement and after a while he was able to write very slowly: ‘I’m not sure what is happening to me. I only know I can’t function normally. I can’t move right.’ These symptoms of Parkinson’s disease had suddenly come on, over just a few weeks. And then he said he’d been taking heroin. The man’s 30-year-old girlfriend Juanita had the same symptoms. This puzzled Langston. People in their 30s and 40s were not supposed to get Parkinson’s. Certainly not from taking heroin. Then Langston found out about Bill and David, a young pair of brothers some 30 miles away in Santa Cruz, who had taken a ‘synthetic heroin’ and displayed similar ‘frozen’ symptoms. Through publicising these four cases, they learned of a drug dealer named Toby and his 21-year-old girlfriend Connie, with exactly the same history. At that point, someone recalled the article that had appeared in Psychiatry Research. George Carillo - a 'frozen addict' And? Samples of the drugs which they had taken were sent for analysis, and found that what was supposed to be MPPP was largely made up of the impurity MPTP. Animal testing was extended to monkeys, and it was found that MPTP selectively kills cells in the substantia nigra, an area of the brain important in areas like motor control and learning, in rhesus and squirrel monkeys, just as in humans, so it affects the brains of primates in a different way to other animals. Eventually George, Juanita and Connie were able to receive an experimental surgery in Sweden, during which they underwent transplanting substantia nigra cells from aborted foetuses into the damaged parts of their brains, and this helped them recover much of their motor function. How had this happened? Kidston seemed to have taken some short cuts in his synthesis in 1976, as had the West-Coast entrepreneur in 1982. If you try to carry out the esterification to make MPPP at too high a temperature, or too low a pH, an elimination reaction occurs. When Langston followed up the original 1947 synthesis of MPPP by going to the library of Stanford University, he found that the paper by Ziering and Lee had been cut out from the volume of Journal of Organic Chemistry with a razor blade. Obviously the chemist making this ‘new heroin’ did not want others in on the game. MPPP contains a tertiary carbon, which readily eliminates a carboxylate (a good ‘leaving group’) to generate a tertiary carbocation; this in turn loses H+ and is converted into 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP can cross the blood-brain barrier and, once in the brain, is mistaken for dopamine by monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes. Thus MPTP undergoes oxidation, forming MPP+, the species which is responsible for the neuronal damage. Did any good come from this? It has led to some new understandings about possible causes of Parkinson’s disease. For one thing, people spotted that MPP+ had a similar structure to the herbicide Paraquat, and scientists are working on a link between Parkinson’s and herbicide use. MPP+ Paraquat But - above all - the story of MPPP is another warning, a horrible one, about the dangers of dabbling in the wrong sort of chemistry. Bibliography A. Ziering and J. Lee, J. Org.

I took a drug once called 3-MMC that I really enjoyed. I haven't been able to find it since and I don't even know a street name. But by all accounts it was a pleasant high somewhere between cocaine and MDMA with a moderate duration and minimal comedown. But for all I know it could cause irreparable brain damage. I guess it's not too likely, since most recreational drugs have been around a long time and are well-studied, and most derivatives aren't radically different than their mainstream counterparts. And most street drugs are either prescribed medically or being studied for medical use. The real problem is purity, which is a problem caused by the ineffective and insanely expensive US \"ban\" on drugs. Solve the purity and regulation issue and you end most overdose deaths, most black market violent crime, and, apparently, accidental brain damage. reply otherme123 13 hours agoparentCareful! Analogs can be very different in toxicity and other properties: some people drink ethanol on a daily basis, and damage is relatively low. Methanol is similar, but is very toxic and can damage and kill you easily. R-Thalidomide is used as anti-inflamatory and sedative, L-Thalidomide is teratogenic; and what is worse, one form can switch into the other form. The difference between Morphine and Codeine is minimal: a H is changed to a CH3. But one is 10x stronger than the other. In fact, morphine is more similar to codeine than to heroin. There is another opioid called Oripavine, similar to morphine (and can be transformed easily into), that is known to also have analgesic effects, but can't be used because it's highly toxic. It can itself be derived to M320, which is around 10000x more potent than morphine. In the opioid large family we could do this all day, with analogs and very similar molecules having a wild range of potency and toxicity. Don't use similarity between derivatives as a guide or a scale of their potential toxicity. I agree that the easiest and safest way to deal with this is to just legalize all drugs. IMO that will have at least two desirable effects: you will know exactly what you are consuming instead of betting on a derivative, and the race after analogs will stop: people will just consume what is known to be safe and effective, as it happens with alcohol. reply dusted 10 hours agorootparentFunny thing with codine is that it's metabolized into morphine, and this happens at vastly different rates, from \"not effective as a treatment\" to \"somewhat high risk of abuse due to euphoria\" reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentprev> I agree that the easiest and safest way to deal with this is to just legalize all drugs.

Right now one would kinda have to buy it from either some guy or some darknet vendor and the only way to know it's safe is to test it with reagents. Those who don't test it run the risk of dying or suffering permanent damage from overdosing on some adulterant or substitute.

Back when I was into that scene there were basic risk-reduction methods people would use to try to minimise the surprise. Buy pure powders from sites that listed the IUPAC chemical names and structures of what they were selling. Even better if they listed results from GCMS assay on their supply. Make sure they could actually spell the name of the drugs they were selling. So look at listings for (e.g.) 4-MMC from a site the community trysted rather than a bag of \"Plant food!\" or \"gogaine blend!\" from a page that popped up yesterday and spelled 'methiopropamine' in three different ways. Preferably get it tested yourself too. Basic mandelin, ehrlich, marquis chemical tests could give you some info on what you had but in the UK there was a service where you could send in anonymous samples for GCMS. Always do an allergy test first, starting with a dilution of the substance down into the low micrograms. It wouldn't protect you from an MPPP/MPTP type scenario, but nothing will (including buying mainstream drugs) and at least at that point you can be fairly confident of what you're taking.

I saw the slow increase in the damage caused by synthetic drugs as I worked in Substance misuse as a methadome dispenser. Rather than woking predominantly with heroin addiction, clients were presenting more and more with synthetic substance addictions.

It can be a symptom of underlying health issues, and can cause other health issues (specifically if sedentary like joint pain and injury, insulin resistance, etc.), but it is not unhealthy to be obese if all other health indicators are fine. I'm 220 pounds, I can run a 10 minute mile (not the 5:45 I ran in high school, but I'm also 20 years older and don't have the 5-hours per day dedicated to training I did back then). I just completed a 5-day, 125 mile hike through the Scotish highlands with a torn MCL.

(And that in aggregate people's tolerance to petty crimes is much less than their tolerance against controlling innocent people's lives.) ... and during the 20th century \"performative law and order\" was -- how should I put it -- big, as in the 1937 Nazi rally was attended by about a million people, and the 1939 one was called Rally for Peace (but cancelled a few days before and instead of the Rally the Nazis attacked Poland) ... fast-forward a few decades later, still September, but spin the globe a bit, and dear Nancy and Ronald are concerned about drugs! oh my ... while they supplied arms to Iraq ... and Iran at the same time, directly violating a law he personally signed. reply im3w1l 4 hours agorootparentI think this is basically right, but I would add the suffering of the family as well. Obesity will not lead you to abuse your spouse or children. Obese people can hold down a job. Obese people don't lose custody of their children. The closest analogue, I think, is smoking. It will demonstrably take years of your lifespan and healthspan. It does lead to minor harm of people in your immediate vicinity (2nd hand smoke, those kids probably get fat too). reply dbspin 4 hours agorootparentI think smoking is bang on as a comparison. Massive lifetime average costs to the health system, spending on which is by definition zero sum. Both smoking and morbid obesity are enormously damaging life paths. I say this as someone who struggles with their weight. I want to acknowledge that weight isn't a simple calories in, calories out situation. That other illnesses, medications, childbirth and gut health have enormous impacts on the capacity to maintain or lose weight. And that many people (particularly in the US) live in food deserts. What I'd criticise is the valorisation or excusing of obesity as equivalent to healthy living. 'Healthy at any size' social messaging is enormously damaging on a social and personal level. I've personally known a few people who became politicised in this direction (as a subset of radical queer politics) and went from being highly functional to disabled due to overeating and other health consequences of inactivity and overeating. Life is difficult, aging is terrifying. Making it worse by pretending that these conditions aren't awful is extremely irresponsible. reply jajko 3 hours agorootparentprevMaybe not abuse of children per se, but most obese parents have obese children, so the self-caused sickness is passed down. I see it very often in such cases. It boils down the lifestyle, 2 generations ago their grandparents were most probably skinny due to simple food they ate and physical labor they went through every day. If kids see lazy tired parents, chances of them being athletic and eating healthily are very low, and its a baggage that gets heavier to shed off with each passing year. reply AmericanChopper 3 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in a relatively high tax country with universal healthcare. My government in particular didn't publish everything I'd need to figure this out, but if they were comparable to similar countries with similar budgets and similar obesity rates, then I'd be paying 100% of my income for about two weeks every year in taxes to pay for the additional healthcare costs caused by obesity. So if I didn't have to pay for obese people's additional healthcare costs, I could have either gotten myself a rather sizeable tax break, or a couple week of extra holiday free every year. reply pas 1 hour agorootparentthat sounds very interesting! I tried to look for some overview, and ... found this study .. and even more interestingly in the Netherlands obesity seems to be cheaper than the alternative (probably because living longer leads to having more cancers, and those are fucking expensive) https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.11... This one is much easier to interpret as the result is just \"In per capita terms, costs of obesity in 2019 ranged from US$17 in India to US$940 in Australia.\" ... and yeah a thousands bucks could have been spent on something nice. Drugs for example! https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/10/e006351 reply AmericanChopper 8 minutes agorootparentA study in my home country (which aligned with my own back of the napkin estimation) put the additional cost of obesity at around 8% of government expenditure. Which given I was giving up over half my salary in taxes (well over half once you count sales taxes), comes out to over two weeks of work exclusively for obese people’s additional medical costs. That’s not too far off the study you linked, which states an average of 1.8% GDP (though I’m not sure that sample of 8 countries is representative of much), which again would be somewhere between 4.5-6% of government expenditure depending on their expenditure to GDP ratios (assuming 30-40% is pretty normal). Perhaps one week of work dedicated exclusively to subsidising obese people excess medical costs every year would be more reasonable for a more typical tax payer. But that’s still a lot. I’m not sure I buy the increased mortality bringing that number down story very much either. Obesity tends to only take about 5-10 years off your life expectancy (depending on how obese…), but it’s going to drive your medical care costs up for your whole life. Obesity kills you a lot slower than cancer does. pas 1 minute agorootparentI was surprised too, and for the other countries in the sample the result is the way you would expect. (But it seems that the Netherlands is an outlier exactly because the cost of end of life care is very expensive compared to \"obesity care\". But it would probably be much less surprising if we would see the data on graphs, as health problems - so associated costs too - tend to spike waaay up above 80, so in this model it seems that ~5 year difference makes up for a lot of money...)

Frankly, if the opiate epidemic taught us anything it's that there's probably lower risk in your teenagers taking an edible at a party than getting an overly aggressive codeine prescription from their doc after breaking their arm. I'm not really arguing with you, education of kids is key. But legality is such a poor yardstick. See: opiates, tobacco, and alcohol - super damaging, extremely habit forming, yet completely legal and even culturally acceptable. Meanwhile, LSD is treated like fentanyl (literally the same Control Substances Act schedule - the highest #1) and is pushed underground where it's adulterated by god knows what, even though a small gov-sanctioned lab could easily produce the entire country's supply of entirely pure substance in a few weeks. I don't know what the answer is, but surely it's more nuanced than drugs=bad, legal=fine, doctor-perscribed=no-risk.

Let's not act as if taking drugs is normal or something everyone should try. reply alan-hn 4 hours agorootparentUsing psychoactive drugs is incredibly normal and has been practiced for thousands of years by humans. In fact it is one of the most human things you can do because many other species don't exhibit this behavior. We should be working in the interest of reducing stigma of drug use to reduce harms associated with it. Drugs are illegal because politicians wanted a way to crack down on communities that didn't agree with their policies, it is simply a form of control. Have you never asked why alcohol is legal and cannabis or LSD are illegal? Fear and control. reply tsol 1 hour agorootparentThis is true of opium. They used to give it to babies. This was because they didn't have safer drugs like we do today reply alan-hn 1 hour agorootparentAre you arguing that adults should not be able to choose what they ingest because some people used to give opium to babies at one point? reply koonsolo 3 hours agorootparentprevJust because something is done for hundreds of years doesn't mean we want to live in such society. I'm from Europe, so your theory to control certain communities sounds very much as a conspiracy theory to me. reply alan-hn 3 hours agorootparentThe US forced their system of controlling psychoactive substances on the rest of the world through treaties primarily. Perhaps you should learn about the history of drug use and control. You also didn't answer my question about alcohol. Why is it legal and not cannabis? reply koonsolo 55 minutes agorootparentBecause alcohol is more interwoven into our society than cannabis. If I had a magic wand and had to pick 1 legal one, I would go for cannabis. I think it has less negative effect on society than alcohol. But here we are, and my standpoint is to no approve new drugs and try to phase out the current ones. I like my beer, wine and tequila, but I also see youth doesn't flock to it as much as my and previous generations. If properly done, it can be phased out. reply alan-hn 32 minutes agorootparentWhose society? Western society? What about Mexican society? South america? The native Americans used psychedelic cactus and mushrooms. You seem to be drawing relatively arbitrary lines based on your own biased upbringing And we don't have to choose only one, that's arbitrary too. We can easily dismantle the current prohibitory system to allow for a system of regulated production and access which would improve safety and reduce overdose deaths. Most overdoses happen because of the nature of the black market. There is no regulation or testing so substances, particularly opioids, can get cut to unknown potencies depending on the person handling it. This makes it a gamble every time a person were to use rather than consuming a measured amount of a pure substance. Prohibition objectively increases harm to individuals, society, and the economy. reply koonsolo 1 minute agorootparentYou claim overdosis happpen because of \"bad product\"?

The discussion here is about meeting in a healthy middle and you seemed to have taken the latter position, which you must agree is radical and out of the question reply freeopinion 4 hours agorootparentIt is extremely difficult to agree on a healthy middle. If you look at something I think most people consider much safer, we see how hard it is. What is a safe level of high fructose corn syrup that should be allowed as an ingredient of hamburger buns? At some level, everything we put into our bodies has consequences, but it seems terrifying to me to have discussions about a healthy middle ground of how much meth is ok in a serving of mozzarella.

I thought you just said having your parents tell you not to smoke worked just fine. reply koonsolo 3 hours agorootparentFor my family it works out fine. And it already improved since I was young.

I'm happy my kids can go out now without the terrible smell in their hair, clothes and passive smoke in their lungs. It's getting prohibitted in more and more places, so I'm on the winning side :D. reply vladvasiliu 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't really have a horse in this race, but it seems to me that making something illegal doesn't always work as expected and stop people from consuming it. See: prohibition in the US. So, if the actual goal is harm-reduction for the population at large (and not for what seems to be a small sample who wouldn't care either way since they're not into that), maybe instead of outlawing substances, we should make sure that people don't take random crap that will mess them up even worse than what they were originally looking for. Because it seems that people will continue taking drugs. So maybe, as a society, we should finally accept reality instead of insisting that wishful thinking will somehow work after it has failed miserably for ages. reply koonsolo 3 hours agorootparentI think it starts with educating youth, with proper campaigns. Make it clear living as an addict is not something you want. The legal aspect is a very difficult discussion, and it's more based on opinions than facts. But at start we need to decide if we want these drugs in our society or not. And I'm always surprised at how the HN crowd is: taking drugs are awesome, we want it in our society. reply vladvasiliu 34 minutes agorootparentI think the HN stance is a bit more nuanced: it may depend on the drug. It's pretty clear that not all drugs have the same health risks and addiction potential, so I'm not surprised people don't treat them all the same way. As an easy example: I don't consider myself an alcoholic and even hate being drunk, yet I would be bummed to never be able to have a drink again. > I think it starts with educating youth, with proper campaigns. Make it clear living as an addict is not something you want. Indeed. But I'm not convinced that banning the substances in addition to this education is actually useful. > But at start we need to decide if we want these drugs in our society or not. That's a good question. But, like it or not, these drugs are in our society today. I don't see any practical means of getting rid of them. Outlawing them clearly not only doesn't work, but actually has some pretty terrible side-effects of its own: health-related (via adulterants) as well as social (drug-related gang crime). reply Jerrrry 4 hours agorootparentprevThose coffee aficionados are particularly annoying yes reply leoedin 3 hours agorootparentprevMy parents taught me to stay away from smoking and drugs. It didn't really work. The facade collapsed when I realised that actually a lot of people use all sorts of drugs recreationally with very limited adverse effect. And that they can be extremely, life alteringly fun in a way no prohibition lecture captures. Obviously there's plenty of downsides too - but the idea that a stern lecture or twenty will stop kids taking drugs is kind of laughable. reply koonsolo 56 minutes agorootparentI don't lecture my kids. What I do is probably not acceptable by many, but hey, it works. When we go to hospitals, and those cancer patients are outside smoking, I point out \"see, these are the smokers\". Every opportunity when marginaal people are smoking, I point out how stupid and marginaal they look. My kids are disgusted by it, the same way I was. So it's not a \"you are not allowed to smoke\" or \"smoke is bad for you\", it's a \"you want to be a loser?

It was clear even then that synthetic opioids were going to be significant. Fentanyl (compound 52, Figure 17) is an analgesic of high potency, approximately 300 times that of morphine, which was developed by Janssen in 1962 (Janssen 1962b) and is N-[(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidyl]-N-phenyl-propanamide. The first CsA (controlled substance analog) of fentanyl came to the attention of law enforcement in late 1979 but was not identified until 1981 (Allen et al. 1981). In the next three years a procession of new fentanyl CsA's appeared in the illicit drug market. The abuse of fentanyl CsA's peaked in 1985 and has since decreased dramatically (Henderson 1987), a phenomena which was the result of DEA successfully terminating the operation of the responsible laboratories. However, the ripple effect is still being felt as international and national meetings have been held to discuss the problems presented by CsA's. reply dendrite9 14 hours agoparentWow. The next paragraph is interesting to read from the future: It is the author's opinion that fentanyl CsA's will be back as the future analgesic drugs of abuse. The thoughts behind this statement are that the published synthesis schemes for the fentanyl compounds allow for the use of wide variety of precursors as discovered by the confiscated notes from an anonymous clandestine laboratory that synthesized a drug, based on information presented in two separate volumes of the Journal of Organic Chemistry (...). Also, several fentanyl derivatives have such high potencies that the quantities required to be synthesized are trivial. For instance, carfentanil (...) is approximately 4000 times as potent as heroin and has an extremely favorable therapeutic index (Janssen 1985). Hence, an easy week's work for two chemists could provide 10 kilograms of carfentanil which would be equivalent to 40 metric tons of pure heroin. reply sharpshadow 13 hours agorootparentEspecially now since Afghanistan is back in Taliban hands.

Trigger/content warning, folks: there are some deeply unpleasant parts to that story. It ends well enough, but the path is pretty dark. reply LoganDark 15 hours agoprevI know \"designer drugs\" primarily through psychedelic analogues (e.g. 1V-LSD); also, through psychedelic fakes (e.g. NBOMe in place of LSD), which can be fatal. I don't think either one of these are designed to avoid drug tests, but rather to avoid being technically illegal, so that they can be sold over the clearnet to average people. The fakes are designed to be cheaper to manufacture than the real thing, though not designed to be safe. People have died from overdoses of these analogues (and even from regular doses). You are not supposed to be able to overdose on LSD (at the very least, it should not be able to kill you), so this is pretty bad and unexpected when it happens. It's one of the major reasons why reagent testing is so encouraged by harm reduction communities: if you really want to take some substance, it's very important to make sure you know that you're taking the correct substance in the first place; otherwise, even what very limited bets you would've had are already off. The reagent to test for LSD is usually Ehrlich's reagent, but many reagent kits come with multiple reagents so you can not only verify the presence of LSD but also the absence of other adulterants. One can never really be too safe; the wrong drug can have all sorts of undesired effects, all the way up to potential death (or Parkinson's as in the linked article). https://dancesafe.org reply hnick 11 hours agoparentI've heard of the \"technically illegal\" thing and find it odd, is that actually true? Over here in Australia I think they just decided it was easier to make them all illegal too, with the schedule saying things like \"TETRAHYDROCANNABINOLS and their alkyl homologues\" as a catch-all. reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentYes, it's true that LSD analogues such as 1cP-LSD have been technically legal to sell in the United States in the past (and in some parts of Europe, I think). Every time a new analogue gains traction, it gets separately banned by new legislation, but there is no catch-all that bans \"all substances that are analogous to LSD or that metabolize into LSD\". I believe there is a catch-all that attempts to classify substances by their effects regardless of formula (i.e. any hallucinogenic drug is automatically illegal), but sellers get around that by saying the substance is for research purposes only and not for human consumption; then you simply consume it anyway. reply temp0826 2 hours agorootparentIsn't this the \"catch-all\"? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Analogue_Act reply borski 24 minutes agorootparentThe key line there carrying a lot of weight is “…but only if intended for human consumption.” Market it as “for research only” and that law does not apply. reply anal_reactor 12 hours agoparentprev> You are not supposed to be able to overdose on LSD (at the very least, it should not be able to kill you) Not true. LSD raises your body temperature, which can be fatal, especially in the summer. \"Just take a cold shower\" yeah I was too high to come up with this idea, so I was just lying in my bed being miserably hot. I'm not taking a full tab ever again because it fucks my brain to the point I cannot do basic things to ensure my own survival. reply LoganDark 11 hours agorootparentInteresting. I'm sure I've experienced this effect, but I hadn't noticed that it happens to a greater degree than normal; even without LSD, I've always had a problem with overheating: I have a 12,000 BTU air conditioner pointed directly at me at all times, but still somehow manage to sometimes overheat, usually because the thing automatically turns itself off around 61°F. I had modified my last unit to ignore the temperature completely, but as of yet I can't seem to locate the thermistor in this one. (I found at least one of them, but it's somehow the wrong one. Why are there multiple?!) With that said, it would indeed be a problem for you not to be able to think well enough to perform basic self-care. At the very least, LSD is dehydrating as the body attempts to filter it out as urine, so you'd need to get that out and then drink water (or gatorade or something hydrating). I'm sure dehydration would contribute at least partially to the additional body heat. Anyway, you totally don't need LSD to suffer heat stroke in the summer. All I'd need to do is walk outside and stand there for a while. With that said, it's not exactly like generating additional body heat necessarily kills you as long as you can keep yourself cool somehow. Even if you can't, I wouldn't consider the LSD to have been the source of the death, just the overheating, which is a general failure regardless of how the overheating happened (e.g. panic attack, overexertion, etc.). reply borski 6 hours agorootparentIf the overheating happened as a side effect of the acid, and the person had generally never had issues with overheating, it’s a very small jump to say that acid caused it. That said, I’m less convinced that it raises your core body temp enough to kill you. reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparentAcid caused the overheating, sure; overheating caused the death. At this point I'm nitpicking, but it's a relatively important semantic difference. Some substances can outright kill you but LSD generally will not. reply borski 2 hours agorootparentThis kind of nit is not worth picking, imho. Jumping off a bridge doesn’t kill you; hitting the ground or water does. But not always. So is jumping off a bridge not the cause of death? Should we say blunt trauma? reply LoganDark 1 hour agorootparentIf you jump off a bridge to your death nothing can save you. If you take something that raises your body temperature it is still possible to compensate. But yes in that case blunt trauma is the cause of death and the blunt trauma occurred because they jumped off the bridge. reply borski 42 minutes agorootparentOkay, we’ll just agree to disagree on this one. reply anal_reactor 3 hours agorootparentprevDriving fast is very safe, it's the sudden deceleration that's dangerous! reply LoganDark 1 hour agorootparentDriving fast is not safe, because there is the risk of sudden deceleration and death.

As far as I could tell that seemed likely to have been the case here, which is why I mentioned my being autistic, because that may help one understand how I happened upon this train of thought under a submission that speaks nothing of psychedelics or LSD whatsoever. (The triggering phrase was 'designer drug', a term which I've also seen used in the context of psychedelics.) reply hoseja 10 hours agorootparentI don't think mentioning you're autistic actually clears that up. Would probably be better to mention the association thought process without leading with the diagnosis. reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentIt's cleared up separately, immediately after that mention. The thought process appears obvious because it makes logical sense once explained, but people don't always intuitively infer it, if that makes any sense; it's difficult to explain, but I think my comment was perfectly sufficient. I suppose the mention of autism was meant as a qualifier for the information that follows; sort of a \"here is why my brain works this way\" before the actual \"here is how that comment happened the way that it did\". reply borski 6 hours agorootparentWhile I hear what you’re saying and I agree in general, I think what you’re reading is that in this case the logical jump was fairly obvious with or without the mention of your diagnosis. I have ADHD, and it seemed very obvious to me. That said, you can be as open as you want about your diagnosis.

Yes, much of the reason drugs even have an effect is because receptors for them already exist in the body. That's also the reason why they can be so dangerous; normally endogenous signals are regulated by the body, but externally administered substances are often not. Physical dependence is the body's self-regulation trying to compensate for the presence of external substances that it can't downregulate; a sudden lack of the substance may cause withdrawal symptoms as the body takes time to adjust back to normal. These withdrawal symptoms can be fatal (such as in the case of benzodiazepine withdrawal, or indeed opioid withdrawal). Also, external substances can trigger receptors or permutations of receptors that don't naturally occur as frequently, as strongly, or at all, resulting in undesirable or even potentially fatal effects. Small changes even to substances that are normally unproblematic can nonetheless change their effects significantly enough to cause a problem, as illustrated by the submission. reply sharpshadow 11 hours agorootparentAbsolutely that’s why substance abuse is very dangerous. I would even append permanent destruction of receptors to the list. reply LoganDark 11 hours agorootparentOh, right; I forgot that's also a thing. I try to advocate for the reduction of SSRI use for that reason. It's a known side effect that they can permanently destroy or desensitize serotonin receptors when used for periods that exceed around a year or two (this varies by individual). I wouldn't even go that far, personally, but some people's doctors do not know about that effect of SSRIs and keep prescribing them for five years or more, in which case I usually take it upon myself to educate the person directly if their doctor does not know. I don't tell them to stop taking it immediately or anything, just that they might want to watch how long they stay on it. (Side note: I don't know what's so special about prescribers when most of them don't even fully understand the substances they're prescribing. It's possible that fully educating myself about what I'm doing might actually have been better than having blindly accepted a prescription for it, at least in some hypothetical future where this stuff can even be prescribed at all. I guess some people associate illegality automatically with immorality/irresponsibility.) reply kerkeslager 14 hours agorootparentprevBecause people's lives are inherently valuable. reply LoganDark 14 hours agorootparentprevI don't need to prove myself to anyone, but just for the record, I don't get high off this stuff.

You don't know what I am chasing (it is executive function). The fact that there's relatively little professional research into the substance should mean that you can't know how dangerous it is or isn't; you should know not to jump to conclusions.

But that safety promise goes for the ones we have plenty of experience with, especially the naturals; once you start putting random substances in your body, all bets are off. reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentWhat safety promise? There is no promise of safety here. Part of being a responsible user is understanding that safety cannot be guaranteed; one can only attempt to minimize risk. That's the guiding principle behind the concept of harm reduction. Making sure you're actually taking what you intend to take is indeed very important, because if it's something else, that indeed would be random and you might not only apply the wrong strategy, but take an incorrect dose as well; the correct dose may be \"none\" if it is a toxic or lethal substance. But even when you know exactly what you're taking and what are the risks involved, you can't guarantee safety; no one can. This is important to understand. An incorrect understanding can lead to reckless behavior that will get you killed. reply codr7 9 hours agorootparentYou're typically not going to kill yourself with weed or shrooms, or a lot of other well researched psychedelics. It may well get uncomfortable, but not dangerous. reply LoganDark 9 hours agorootparentUnder psilocybin, certain smells can make me suddenly lose consciousness. Due to this, while trying some out at the start of this year, I fainted while exiting the bathroom and woke up with a head injury that required staples in order to close. Sure, it wasn't the drug itself's fault; all it did was make me sensitive to smell, and then the smell made me faint. I had been fine for something like 8 hours since having taken it. But stuff like this is a risk with psychedelics. If I had fallen slightly differently I probably could've died. I took the other half of the psilocybin about a week later in order to process the trauma; I figured out the reason for the fainting when I walked past the bathroom again and felt like it was about to happen again. Pretty crazy if you ask me. I guess the moral of the story is that you really can't expect anything to be perfectly safe even if it won't kill you on its own. reply LoganDark 11 hours agorootparentprevLSD is also a party drug. You may be referring instead to hard drugs, which are so called because they create physical dependence, psychological addiction, or brain damage (or all of the above). LSD is technically legally considered a hard drug, because it has the potential to trigger schizophrenia and psychosis in individuals who are in any way predisposed to such; it also is legally classified as a hallucinogen, and all of which are classified as hard drugs, legally speaking. However, non-legally speaking, I don't consider it a hard drug because it doesn't cause dependence, addiction, or brain damage that is detectable; despite the relative lack of professional research into the substance, there is at least decent evidence that it is not literally neurotoxic. With that said, the potential psychological effects are not to be underestimated, and the experience of a bad trip can cause significant damage purely through the emotional trauma of it. Practically speaking, there's little difference between being prescribed the substance by a doctor and administering the substance myself, other than that the responsibility of managing my regimen would fall to the doctor rather than myself; however, I'd technically prefer to get this stuff from the pharmacy because then I'd know it's not adulterated, but I can just do reagent tests at home for now. I would be happy to move to a prescribed treatment if ever this treatment is able to be offered by prescription; that aside, however, my own due diligence is sufficient for my needs and is not likely to result in a fatal overdose. I can't be entirely confident that it's impossible of course, but I can have a high degree of confidence that I'm not putting myself in significant danger right now. The slippery slope argument doesn't entirely apply here, as I've actually tried other hard drugs (benzos, opioids, dissociatives, etc.) and could never really get into them (with the exception of benzos which I had to stop filling). I understand how they become addictive for others, but I don't really think I'm personally interested in them. What's more addictive for me isn't a body high but the ability to fully utilize my mind, which is what LSD does for me. It makes me feel as if I'm not limited like I am normally, which is incredibly refreshing. reply RamblingCTO 2 hours agorootparentThe big differentiator for me is possible harm and addiction. Psychedelics don't typically bring both (I am under the impression, that we actually don't really know how schizophrenia and psychosis relates or is triggered by psychedelics, that was my impression of recent research). Using crack, heroin etc. and \"designer drugs\" etc. is a whole other thing. Safety of consumption is just on another level for both classes. Even with \"designer\" psychedelics that are just added molecules. Tbh I don't know about any totally and weird synthetic psychedelics, I'm assuming shrooms, LSD/AL-LAD (which are both of course synthetic as well), mescaline, ibogaine, and DMT essentially. I hope everyone reading get's the distinction I'm trying to make. reply LoganDark 1 hour agorootparentYes, I understand. Serotonergic psychedelics are typically not big sources of addiction, and they typically only cause great harm if taken incorrectly or by someone with a genetic predisposition towards schizophrenia or psychosis; though even then, the harm is only really psychological (but it can be permanent). Please do note, however, that there are psychedelics which are not serotonergic psychedelics, such as psychedelic amphetamines. These are not typically nearly as safe, just as amphetamines in general typically are not particularly safe when used incorrectly. reply LoganDark 13 hours agorootparentprevYou don't know the definition of drug abuse if that's what you think this is. I do agree that the medical profession has a reason to exist, and I would very much prefer to receive this treatment from a doctor, but doctors are not currently allowed to prescribe it; even psilocybin (where legal) can only be administered under professional supervision, and is currently approved only for psychedelic therapy, not for ADHD treatment. There's a lot we don't understand about these substances, but I have overwhelming evidence from experience that what it does for me is something that helps. I'm sorry to hear about the overdoses. reply the_pwner224 13 hours agorootparentprevAs someone with ADHD and a cardiovascular system that does not like stimulants (I don't have any health issues, it's just that low doses don't do much to my brain and even medium doses make my HR/BP excessively high)... Mind sharing any resources to learn more about this? Or details on what you take yourself? reply voidUpdate 10 hours agorootparentI found out this week that I apparently have the exact same reaction to stimulants to you lol (or to Elvanse anyway). Do you know if you respond better to other kinds of ADHD medication? I recognise that drugs that are generally less legal can be beneficial for some people but I would personally not like to go down that route if possible reply iSnow 7 hours agorootparentAtomoxetine would be an option. reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentprevDextroamphetamine (or lisdexamfetamine as in Elvanse/Vyvanse) isn't the only stimulant medication; there is also Ritalin (methylphenidate). You may also want to look into generic non-prodrug dextroamphetamine, typically called dexedrine - different brands, too; in my area there are Actavis/Teva capsules as well as Mallinckrodt capsules, and only the Mallinckrodt capsules work well for me. There are also non-stimulant medications, such as Wellbutrin (bupropion; an atypical antidepressant that is known to help in certain cases of ADHD). I've also heard of SSRIs potentially helping, but I would not recommend them because of their long-term effects (they can damage serotonin receptors permanently). Plenty of legal options if you haven't already tried them yet. Obviously, please discuss them with a real doctor if you intend to look into them. reply voidUpdate 10 hours agorootparentThank you, I will of course discuss them with a medical professional. I was given a few Elvanse from a family member who found it wasn't working for them, just to see if it affected me in a positive way, but I've found after taking a couple of doses (20mg, 40 then 20 again over three days) that it hasn't really affected me much mentally (apart from me writing really long paragraphs now and obsessively fixing capitalisation?), and I've been feeling a worrying amount of heart palpitations. I recognise that it probably wasn't incredibly bright to do this, but I'm starting to get really impatient at how long it's taking to get professional help (it's like I've got ADHD or something lol). I'm also not honestly that surprised that it didn't work so well, given how genetic ADHD is I'm still waiting on actually getting to talk to a doctor about a prescription, because supply issues and the speed of the NHS, and I also have to take an ECG, which I didn't think I needed but after this experience, I absolutely think I need lol. I think they're going to trial me on methylphenidate first, assuming the ECG lets me, but I'll bring up the other options you recommended as well. Thanks! reply LoganDark 9 hours agorootparentI would like to let you know that typical starting dosages of dextroamphetamine are usually in the 2.5–15mg/day range, so taking 20mg and 40mg could have way overshot your therapeutic window. Taking too much will end up not helping. > I'm also not honestly that surprised that it didn't work so well, given how genetic ADHD is It's not necessarily just that ADHD is genetic as much as it is that ADHD is pathological. It affects your whole brain. Sometimes stimulants really do help, because dopamine and/or norepinephrine can absolutely be possible culprits for entire brain dysfunction, but if you happen to have another root cause for the disorder then they might not particularly help. Still, you can't necessarily rule it out just by taking 20mg and then 40mg; it may be possible that a lower dose could still help you. reply voidUpdate 8 hours agorootparentThat's weird... I was given the remains of a prescription which only had 20, 30 and 40 pills, nothing any lower. Would taking too much also have no effect? It feels like it should have too much effect, however that would manifest. Having a quick look at wikipedia, the source of all correct knowledge, it looks like 50mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (elvanse used in oral capsules) is roughly equivalent to 20mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate or 15mg of free base dextroamphetamine, which is backed up by its citation at medicines.org.uk, so 20 lis would be like 6 dex I meant the genetic stuff because the person that gave them to me was close family, and I suspect another close family member has it too, so I'd guess it would present and potentially be helped in similar ways between us, as well as having similar side effects reply iSnow 7 hours agorootparentYou are right, Vyvanse/Elvanse comes in 20,30,40mg. Dextroamphetamine has a different dosage. reply LoganDark 8 hours agorootparentprev> Having a quick look at wikipedia, the source of all correct knowledge, [citation needed] (/s) > Would taking too much also have no effect? It's not that it has no effect, it's that the effect it has can stop treating the ADHD at too high a dose, if that makes any sense. reply kstrauser 4 hours agorootparentprevI take Focalin (dexmethylphenidate). A low dose of it is enough for me to do the needful. I also track my blood pressure regularly and it’s still well in the healthy range while taking it. YMMV, of course. reply LoganDark 12 hours agorootparentprevI can't in good conscience recommend this treatment to anyone else because my limited understanding is that I am a very rare exception to the general rule that LSD is a very risky thing to take, especially on a regular basis. Since taking it results in a psychedelic trip, it can be extremely easy for that to backfire and result in a very negative and potentially traumatic experience, commonly referred to as a bad trip. It's also typically intoxicating; not quite to the level of alcohol, but enough to mess with your sense of balance and ability to speak coherently. I know this from personal experience - this did not start out as an ADHD treatment for me; it started out as a recreational activity, and required the same amount of investment as psychedelic use typically does. I used to hallucinate (mildly) and be at risk of having a bad trip if anxiety took over. The first time I took this, I had HPPD for the following two weeks; the experience was actually quite comforting for me, but it's important to note that risk as well. However, over time, even only using it every two to three weeks, my brain gradually became tolerant to its effects. I believe there's some sort of permanent tolerance that isn't documented on PsychonautWiki, which was my primary source of info about the substance; on a couple occasions, I've gone over a month between doses, and it's never quite been as intense as the first time I ever took it, even if I were to take more than before. I don't know if this happens for everyone. I really do not. I cannot guarantee or even suggest that it would happen to you or anyone if one were to reproduce these steps. There is a lack of study-backed research that exists in this area; this substance really is not especially well understood except by recreational users, and even then, they are only aware of and able to share anecdotes about its effects on themselves individually. Anyone who claims to know whether or not LSD would be safe for you is lying. But, I will tell you what I am doing, for the express purpose of academic curiosity. Perform your own research into anything that you are ever curious about trying, and please do not take my comment as a suggestion that this will work for you; it would likely not. I take dextroamphetamine (dexedrine), which I am prescribed for ADHD by my doctor. I take LSD while this drug is still in my body; that is, I mix them. I started the dexedrine before I ever started taking LSD, but I have always been on dexedrine even while dosing LSD. I find that, on its own, dexedrine does not fully help with the ADHD anymore, at least not like it once did; however, combined with LSD, my brain seems to just work, and I finally feel in full control of my actions. My doctor is aware that I use LSD in this way. He professionally recommends against it because he cannot guarantee that it is safe, but he understands that I find it helpful. Obviously, you should generally not tell medical professionals that you regularly do illegal drugs; I trust my doctor to a great degree, and he seems to trust me, too. This more frequent usage (i.e. more frequent than a couple times a month) started slightly over a week ago, when I took this stuff to help myself process the resultant trauma from being hit by a truck and nearly dying about a week prior. It felt incredible to me how much it helped, not only with processing the trauma, but even just with general cognition, language, and executive function; I started taking it about every other day for a couple times, then switched to taking a small non-microdose (100–200μg) every morning. I take my dexedrine in the evening, right before I go to sleep; my dose is 30mg per day. By the way, without getting into LSD or even alternative medicine in general, it's important to note that different drug manufacturers produce different products even when it's supposed to be the same drug. Actavis/Teva produces dexedrine that I can't take because it immediately puts me into a hypertensive crisis, but Mallinckrodt makes stuff that I can take 30mg/day of and nonetheless maintain a completely normal blood pressure. (My doctor takes it every visit, so he would have told me a long time ago if it were abnormal.) I would always recommend the prescription route if possible, just because it does lessen the burden on you and it also somewhat lessens your responsibility. I am responsible for my own self, and involving non-prescription drugs means that I need to pay a lot closer attention to their effects in order to ensure that I'm not harming my health. Sometimes this is not worth the effort, especially if the responsibility can't be properly handled for whatever reason. reply chriscappuccio 13 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] LoganDark 13 hours agorootparentWhy do you say so? reply hexo 11 hours agoprevhmmmm An error occurred during a connection to www.chm.bris.ac.uk.

I'm not sure these should be called \"designer drugs\" because that makes it sound like people are making and taking them to have specific, desirable effects. That's not the case: in most cases, people don't want to be taking these drugs, they want to be taking the illegal drugs that have \"better\" effects, but are taking legal or grey-legality drugs because drug prohibition keeps them from taking the drugs they actually want to take, which are better-understood and generally safer. I'd prefer to call these grey-market substances \"research chemicals\" because it's a neutral term without the fearmongering associated with \"bath salts\" or the romanticizing of \"designer drugs\". And it's honest: these are chemicals that we are researching and should continue to research, to understand both the positive and negative effects these substances have. It's a dangerous world out there. If you're going to use drugs, please use a test kit.

Just call them what they are, grey-market drugs for getting high. There are varnishingly few real researchers actually handling them. reply GuB-42 10 hours agoparentprevI think the term \"research chemicals\" came out of the necessity to call these substances anything but drugs. They can't legally be sold as drugs, that would require some kind of approval from a regulatory agency, which they obviously don't have. So they call it by a name that don't suggest human consumption. \"research chemicals\", as if they were reagents, \"bath salts\", \"plant food\", etc... often with a \"not for human consumption\" label. Certainly not \"designer drugs\", that's a term I generally only see in articles with an \"anti drug\" stance. reply sharpshadow 13 hours agoparentprevI think they called it bath salts to be able to sell it as such and they called it designer drugs to make them attractive. As you say the illegal drugs have the “better” effect and are well understood. reply chriscappuccio 13 hours agoparentprevThe DEA popularized the term designer drugs in the 80s to refer to drugs designed to evade legal restrictions.

It began in the late 1970s.[1] Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the UK, U.S., Japan, Singapore, India, South Korea and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as Sri Lanka. The maze is made up of a 16×16 grid of cells, each 180 mm square with walls 50 mm high.[2] The mice are completely autonomous robots that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. The mouse needs to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. Having reached the goal, the mouse will typically perform additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from the start to the finish. Once the optimal route has been found, the mouse will traverse that route in the shortest achievable time. Competitions[3][4] and conferences[5] are run regularly. Half-Size Micromouse [edit] A version of Micromouse called the Half-Size Micromouse was introduced at the 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition in 2009.[6][7] Instead of a 16×16 maze, the Half-Size competition uses up to a 32×32 maze. Cell and wall dimensions have been reduced by half,[8] providing a new challenge. There have been half-size competitions in Europe in Hungary in 2015[9] and the UK in 2018.[10] Maze solving [edit] See also: Maze-solving algorithm Mice used in competitions employ the fundamental elements of robot navigation, including mapping, planning, and localization. Additionally, they optimize their path through the maze using various search algorithms. Common search algorithms use variations of the Bellman flood-fill method,[11] Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search algorithm, among various graph traversal and tree traversal algorithms. Performance [edit] Mice can run at over three meters per second, depending on the maze design. Some of the best micromouse builders are Yusuke Kato,[12] Ng Beng Kiat[13] and Fumitaka Nakashima.[14] The current world record is 3.921 seconds[15] and is held by Ng Beng Kiat. Performance in recent years has improved considerably. As of 2015, winning mice are likely to run with forward acceleration and braking well over 1g.[16] Cornering with centripetal acceleration as high as 2g is possible. Micromice are among the highest-performing autonomous robots. Most recently, robots are being equipped with a fan to create a partial vacuum under the mouse while it is running.[17][18][19] The additional downforce available has made possible a huge improvement in performance. Compared to a non-fan mouse, the newer robots are likely to be able to achieve centripetal accelerations of 6g or more. Straight line accelerations can easily exceed 2.5g.

I was very hyped about building such a mouse with it, just to prove to myself that my CPU can actually do something \"real\". It don't need to be the fastest, lightest, smallest, but a small robot that can solve a maze would be cool.

There are two brackets, one for LEGO robots (mainly for children) and another one for \"more serious\" robots. Micromouse is one of the categories. It is pretty difficult to do with LEGO, we've tried and always failed. The main problem is that the stepper motors are not precise enough to turn 90 degrees and the error accumulates. We've even tried using a LEGO magnetometer, but it wasn't precise enough. The other categories are easier in my opinion: - Pathfinder: The robot has to follow a drawn line. The line is interrupted in some places, there is a tunnel and there can be obstacles -> in case of obstacles the robot needs to leave the line, avoid the obstacle and find the line again. - Sumo: Two robots start in a drawn circle, once one of them leaves the circle the other one wins. There is a limit on mass and dimensions. (There are some new categories as well, but I have never competed in/watched those.) The competition is pretty great at engaging young kids in programming. reply anfractuosity 8 hours agoprevMaybe the mice could use mmwave to possibly see through maze walls. Or use a little 360 degree camera on a pole. I assume this would be classed as cheating though. Sounds a fun competition :) Looking at the Veritasium video they're crazy fast. reply GuB-42 8 hours agoparentApparently, using a camera on a pole is not cheating, but it is not really necessary to \"see through walls\", as the robot has 10 minutes to score the best run, from start to finish, giving the robot enough time to explore the maze and figure out the best path. Only the fastest run counts. The pole can make figuring out the best path easier, but at the cost of making the robot bigger and heavier, which I suppose is a problem when you see how fast the top contenders are moving. Source: https://attend.ieee.org/r2sac-2020/wp-content/uploads/sites/... reply The_Colonel 8 hours agorootparentAt first, I thought this makes the problem of finding the optimal path rather easy, but on a second thought it's not, because the algorithm needs to take into account exact properties (max speed, acceleration/deceleration, turning), so each model of mouse may have dramatically different optimal routes. I also imagine that mice will have a certain aggressiveness setting, perhaps even switching to a different route, using which you can achieve higher speed at the risk of a crash. It would be interesting to see if there are some strategies around it. reply anfractuosity 8 hours agorootparentprevThanks, I didn't realise that regarding the 10 minutes/fastest run. reply hoseja 7 hours agorootparentThis actually sort of ruins the sport for me. I'm sure there's practical reasons for it, just like with BattleBot but it's just so... lame. Put them into an irregular tunnel maze, time them from the millisecond they enter. reply GuB-42 4 hours agorootparentMaybe they are arbitrary but they are the rules. They are the reasons the sport is how it is today. And considering that there is actual competition and innovation, these are good rules. Feel free to organize your own competition using the \"blind maze\" rules, maybe it will become a success, but it will be a different sport, which will test different skills. They can coexist, not one lamer than the other. reply tjoff 6 hours agorootparentprevBut then luck becomes the dominant factor. Whichever robot decides to take a left turn at the right time will win. reply hoseja 6 hours agorootparentAnd that's bad, how? Is it a sport (where the optimal amount of luck is non-zero) or a scientific study? Also just make them run multiple mazes then. I tend to think of sport fundamentally as simulated warfare, the further you go from the mess of reality in pursuit of fairness and justice, the less worthy the endeavor becomes. reply tjoff 5 hours agorootparentReducing luck is bad, how? There are scales of it, reducing luck in the sense that you don't require a perfect course. That a speck of dust ruins your run etc. is, within reason, part of the game. But flying blind into a maze and just randomizing your way through it isn't particularly challenging. Just enter the game with a 100 identical robots and you'll have a better chance at winning. Multiple mazes isn't a bad idea, but a massive endeavor just increasing the barrier for these competitions to take place. >... the less worthy ... Why? The most noble sport is a lottery then? Because that is essentially what you would turn this competition into. reply hoseja 5 hours agorootparentNo, I don't think random pathing is the best algorithm for maze exploration. Doing best possible with limited information in real environment should be the meat of this competition, not having all the time time to leisurely map the entire regular gridded space and then hyperoptimize a solution based on specific behaviour of tiny wheels on flat cardboard surfaces. Boston Dynamics robots can do backflips nowadays. As I said, I consider _some_ luck better than no luck or all luck. Entering with 100 identical robots... you'd have to actually build all of them, people would shun you and I'm sure nobody would be against a rule against that. edit: But the accessibility argument is probably valid, yeah. There should be a higher less artificial league then, or something. reply ziggyzecat 8 hours agoparentprev> Or use a little 360 degree camera on a pole. that made me chuckle. mmwave to see through walls at that size & speed can't be done yet, or can it? reply anfractuosity 8 hours agorootparentI'm not sure to be honest. http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/ is something I've come across before to detect pose of a human behind a wall.

I bet that these days, that person would be a lot more enthusiastic: it's artificial intelligence! reply soneca 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat a find! A video posted 10 years ago, 88 views (after you posted here) and a non- descriptive title or description that is about micromouses How did you find it? reply layer8 7 hours agorootparentGoogle image search (what GP tried) for “zx81 micromouse” but clicked on “The rest of the results might not be what you're looking for. See more anyway” at the bottom, which surfaced a link to https://forum.arduino.cc/t/its-1982-and-you-need-a-microcont.... I tend to take it as a challenge when someone claims they can’t find something on the net. ;) reply soneca 7 hours agorootparentI am glad you did! It was great watching this. Thanks! reply kragen 7 hours agorootparentprevtechnically thezeus is a zx80, but they're very similar machines from very nearly the same time reply cromulent 7 hours agoparentprev [–] I remember a write-up of this competition around the same time, a year or two earlier perhaps, in Popular Mechanics or some such magazine. From memory there were two main strategies: simple brute-force wall-followers and maze-mappers. The only bot I can remember was named Harvey Wallbanger. Edit: 1980, found it. http://davidbuckley.net/RS/mmouse/images/PM80p17article1268.... reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
