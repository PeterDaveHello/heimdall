The FTC and its state partners say Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon. The complaint alleges that Amazon violates the law not because it is big, but because it engages in a course of exclusionary conduct that prevents current competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging. By stifling competition on price, product selection, quality, and by preventing its current or future rivals from attracting a critical mass of shoppers and sellers, Amazon ensures that no current or future rival can threaten its dominance. Amazon’s far-reaching schemes impact hundreds of billions of dollars in retail sales every year, touch hundreds of thousands of products sold by businesses big and small and affect over a hundred million shoppers. “Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them. Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Amazon to account for these monopolistic practices and restore the lost promise of free and fair competition.” “We’re bringing this case because Amazon’s illegal conduct has stifled competition across a huge swath of the online economy. Amazon is a monopolist that uses its power to hike prices on American shoppers and charge sky-high fees on hundreds of thousands of online sellers,” said John Newman, Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Seldom in the history of U.S. antitrust law has one case had the potential to do so much good for so many people.” The FTC and states allege Amazon’s anticompetitive conduct occurs in two markets—the online superstore market that serves shoppers and the market for online marketplace services purchased by sellers. These tactics include: Anti-discounting measures that punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering prices lower than Amazon, keeping prices higher for products across the internet. For example, if Amazon discovers that a seller is offering lower-priced goods elsewhere, Amazon can bury discounting sellers so far down in Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible. Conditioning sellers’ ability to obtain “Prime” eligibility for their products—a virtual necessity for doing business on Amazon—on sellers using Amazon’s costly fulfillment service, which has made it substantially more expensive for sellers on Amazon to also offer their products on other platforms. This unlawful coercion has in turn limited competitors’ ability to effectively compete against Amazon. Amazon’s illegal, exclusionary conduct makes it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold. With its amassed power across both the online superstore market and online marketplace services market, Amazon extracts enormous monopoly rents from everyone within its reach. This includes: Degrading the customer experience by replacing relevant, organic search results with paid advertisements—and deliberately increasing junk ads that worsen search quality and frustrate both shoppers seeking products and sellers who are promised a return on their advertising purchase. Biasing Amazon’s search results to preference Amazon’s own products over ones that Amazon knows are of better quality. Charging costly fees on the hundreds of thousands of sellers that currently have no choice but to rely on Amazon to stay in business. These fees range from a monthly fee sellers must pay for each item sold, to advertising fees that have become virtually necessary for sellers to do business. Combined, all of these fees force many sellers to pay close to 50% of their total revenues to Amazon. These fees harm not only sellers but also shoppers, who pay increased prices for thousands of products sold on or off Amazon. The FTC, along with its state partners, are seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that would prohibit Amazon from engaging in its unlawful conduct and pry loose Amazon’s monopolistic control to restore competition. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin joined the Commission’s lawsuit. The Commission vote to authorize staff to file for a permanent injunction and other equitable relief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was 3-0. NOTE: The Commission issues a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. You can learn more about how competition benefits consumers or file an antitrust complaint.

Most of us are in the $250k to $5 million dollar range.The impact of Amazon’s monopoly power is felt big time by us as we’re being squeezed with no place left to go online especially post-iOS change.Our second option used to be the Facebook&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;TikTok to Shopify connection but with that being dead in the water most of us have had to commit 100% to FBA to be able to stay afloat.With the increase in inflation and Amazon abusing its power to significantly raise its prices for FBA and force us to use its advertising services our revenues have been severely impacted.This doesn’t include their unwillingness to meaningfully fight counterfeitsOr that they penalize you if you attempt to drive sales elsewhere with lower pricing on other sitesBloomberg did a write up on this a few months back:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2023-02-13&#x2F;amazon-am... reply mrraj 18 hours agoparentFrom the Bloomberg article :\"Chuck Gregorich, who sells fire pits and outdoor furniture, says turning a profit on Amazon is getting harder. One of his popular fire pits costs $200, of which Amazon takes $112 for its commission, warehouse storage, delivery and advertising. That leaves him with $88 to pay the manufacturer, ship the product in from China and cover his overhead.\"I have a hard time sympathizing here. They farm out manufacturing to China and logistics&#x2F;warehousing to Amazon, and then also lend brand to a marketplace they don&#x27;t own. Assuming this is how FBA selling works on Amazon, it sounds like the low profits they make are just a byproduct of them not actually doing much work. reply meesles 17 hours agorootparentYou make a good point, but I think the parent point is true as well. You still have people actually producing work, unable to compete on these platforms where Amazon will literally make a copy of their product at a lower price.This is the result of commoditizing &#x27;starting a business&#x27; to the point of near-worthlessness in the bottom 50%+. Like you say, I don&#x27;t value the businesses that simply re-sell re-labeled products without ever interacting with anything very much. But let&#x27;s not confuse the &#x27;spam&#x27; of the problem with the squashing of actual business that this is historically known to cause. reply notyourwork 17 hours agorootparentIs drop shopping the kind of business to fight for supporting? That’s all this is. reply pyrale 32 minutes agorootparentThe thing is, an importer adds real value to their clients by selecting the products, taking the risk of moving the goods, etc.You are right that the current state of dropshipping is an abomination, and there&#x27;s not much left to save of that job. But the reason for that is that more and more of the job and benefits from that business are being taken by Amazon, and the sellers are left with that doesn&#x27;t really justify their position.What they&#x27;re left with - being a plausible scapegoat and discovering new products - is not their choice, it&#x27;s the part that is not profitable to Amazon. reply jollofricepeas 3 hours agorootparentprevWhoa buddy.That’s a hell of an assumption.1. Manufacturing does not happen in America anymore.2. The proliferation of counterfeiters does not allow dropshippers to scale to a meaningful size. Everyone is game to Alibaba.Within our industry of paper goods, our manufacturers have to get their parts and raw materials from overseas.The larger FBA mom and pops will design and market their products here in the US using American workers and have them manufactured overseas completely or in-part.The impact of Amazon’s monopoly power on American online product businesses is less jobs that pay well.- Less accounting and bookkeeping jobs- less marketing jobs- less design jobs- less seller fulfilled packing and logistics jobs reply cbsmith 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but if you search and replaced the part where the $88 is to pay the manufacturer, and instead say it is to pay they employees and the cost of materials, it&#x27;s not like that suddenly looks like a viable business. reply cowsandmilk 8 hours agorootparentExcept it has been for decades. In traditional retail, the split is 60% store, 40% seller. So your same $200 product would be $80 to the seller, not $88. And manufacturers have been operating with that split for a long time. reply cbsmith 1 hour agorootparentYou&#x27;re talking about gross margin&#x2F;mark up, and there really isn&#x27;t a \"traditional retail margin\". It varies a lot by product, but, as an example, the typical mark up for grocery stores is 15%. I used to do retail sales for appliances, including BBQs. The markup could get as high as 50%, even more for high end BBQs that sell in the $800+ range, but was generally more like 30%... and discount outlets or online retailers, it was much more like the grocery store mark up. A $200 BBQ with a markup of 150% like you&#x27;re describing is not a thing I ever saw. reply megaman821 1 hour agorootparentAre talking about markup from cost of goods? The manufacturer costs usually take into account their overhead; assembly line, warehousing, transport, running the business, profit etc. Amazon is taking over some of those things for sellers, so yes they take a bigger percentage than a normal retail store. reply TylerE 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd saying just don&#x27;t use FBA is no solution either. Shipping large heavy stuff is expensive, and I best Amazon has much better rates negotiated with the carriers. reply ComputerGuru 12 hours agorootparentStorage plus shipping through FBA isn’t cheap. The problem isn’t that FBA is expensive, the problem is that selling on Amazon but not via FBA is heavily punished with placement and appearance leading to poor conversion rates. reply starluz 10 hours agorootparentYes this is the issue for consumers as well. The first 16 pages of every search are nearly identical low quality fba products. Need a search layer to find the small sellers! reply mcfedr 8 hours agorootparentYea, but be honest, you really only want to buy from FBA because that&#x27;s the one that will arrive tomorrow reply behringer 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t even buy from small sellers on Amazon mainly due to terrible resilts. That&#x27;s what ebay is good for. reply __alexs 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you need to sell on Amazon at all? Surely that is where the problem is? reply tebbers 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd that hopefully will be the basis of any anticompetitive action. Sounds like logistics and commerce might need to be broken up. reply sneak 14 hours agorootparentprevYes. Curation is valuable. reply djtango 10 hours agorootparentI have done a bit of shopping on Taobao which is basically buy direct from manufacturers and yes, curation is valuable. Both of quality and design. reply thghtihadanacct 16 hours agorootparentprevDude needs to learn how to weld his own fire pits, teach some new employees, rinse repeat reply meetingthrower 15 hours agorootparentYeah all forif they can push you out of your business that easily you weren’t the critical component of it.Alternative suggestion: modern monopolistic corporations are disproportionately powerful. If they can topple a country to sell bananas cheaper, they sure as hell can kill a small business, no matter how relevant that business is. reply BizarroLand 16 hours agorootparentprevShow me a business that Amazon couldn&#x27;t destroy just for kicks.Also, it&#x27;s not like you have any choices. If you manufacture your products yourself, you have to fund a massive venture to handle the workload. If you outsource the products, then the companies you pay to manufacture your stuff can easily make knockoffs and then let drop shippers undercut you with inferior versions of your own products.Look at a lot of the stuff for sale on Temu for instance. There are hundreds if not thousands of products that were invented, tested, and designed by Western companies that you can now buy a reasonable facsimile of on Temu for a quarter of the price.This includes art work, enamel pins, battery packs, woodworking tools.You&#x27;re on a hard path either way, but if you make it to the point where you have a standout product knowing that at the final step Amazon can easily step in and price you out of existence, even if they had to take a loss on it just to destroy you, they could and there&#x27;s not a damn thing you can do about it.That should be broken up. Monopolies are bad. Monopsonies are bad. They are bad for the country, bad for the people, and bad for the flow of money.I hope we see record fines against them and that everyone affected by this gets to be part of an earth shattering nuclear verdict. reply gmd63 1 hour agorootparentWe&#x27;re reaching the point in the economy where racing to the lowest cost, such as Temu, comes with great damage to the world. It&#x27;s spyware that collects data on the american consumer across applications, and the products are made with illegal forced labor.If people keep choosing to reward dishonest cheaters and criminals just to get something for lower cost, we are not in a good place. And either cheating or disguising the true nature of your company is becoming the easiest way to stand out in a commoditized world.More important than how you vote is how you buy. reply danielmarkbruce 16 hours agorootparentprevApple Iphone, airpods, ipad, macbook. Google search. Coke. Boeing. Caterpillar. Goldman Sachs. AirBnB. Exxon. AutoDesk. BlackRock. CME. Costco. JP Morgan Chase. Mastercard, Visa, Nike, TSMC and a thousand others.They started out as a retailer, and opened up a bunch of their infrastructure to competitors. The idea that they&#x27;d make it easy for competitors using their infrastructure to beat them makes zero sense. reply eru 8 hours agorootparentHow did Goldman Sachs &#x27;[start] out as a retailer, and opened up a bunch of their infrastructure to competitors&#x27;? Or am I misunderstanding you? reply thghtihadanacct 16 hours agorootparentprevThose are good ones but i was thinking of local stuff like grocery (which they tried and are currently failing) and gas (not that i use it). Also, real services like plumbing, electric, vehicle maint. ... Angies list got that corner ;) reply danielmarkbruce 16 hours agorootparentThe list is extremely long as you say. Amazon isn&#x27;t good at much except cheap third party stuff made by contract manufacturers in china, books, and AWS. reply 8note 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think Amazon could destroy apple or Walmart just for kicks.Aramco? Air Canada? Samsung? Memory Express? Digikey? McMaster Carr? McDonald&#x27;s? The Big R? Cantillion? Texas Instruments?\"Show me a business\" is quite vague reply berniedurfee 16 hours agorootparentWhy not McMaster Carr or even Digikey?I’m sure Amazon has put a sizable dent in their sales without even really trying.Amazon now has special search tools for buying fasteners that make it easier to find exactly what you need.Prices are cheap, risk is high, but prices are cheap. reply lostapathy 12 hours agorootparent> Amazon now has special search tools for buying fasteners that make it easier to find exactly what you needEasier but they are no McMaster, by a long shot. reply callalex 10 hours agorootparentI have a lot of friends in the manufacturing business that range from self-employed to military-backed conglomerates. None of them use this tool. Are they all Luddite idiots, or is this Amazon search tool, backed by their swiss-cheese supply chain, just not that useful? reply mbreese 1 hour agorootparentI used the Amazon tool recently to get a very particular type of screw. It was really easy to find exactly what I wanted.Then I still got the wrong part delivered. It doesn’t matter how great the selection tool is, the rule is always: garbage in, garbage out. reply tyingq 5 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s the same as the overall enshitification of all products and product quality. Consumers now value cheap fast shipping and low prices over everything else. Amazon delivers that, with the tradeoffs in product quality, support, etc. Other things are low quality too, like the product listings themselves. Often, for example, the listed dimensions or other specs (thread type, grade strength, etc) are missing or just wrong. That&#x27;s much less true for sites like McMaster. But nobody values that anymore. reply exar0815 8 hours agorootparentprevEvery cent Digikey looses they loose by being Digikey. Of all large suppliers, they are by country miles the worst and we try everything to avoid them. Farnell, Mouser, LCSC beat them handily. And their pages are already bad. reply fshbbdssbbgdd 16 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not connecting for me how breaking up monopolies is going to stop Chinese clones of Western products from winning price wars. It might change how the margin gets carved up between the people who make the clones and various middlemen but how would it stop the overall trend of cloned products? reply adaptbrian 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s all about discoverability, you wouldn&#x27;t find them, tree falling in the woods, no one is around. Does it make a sound? reply fshbbdssbbgdd 14 hours agorootparentI would expect if Amazon disappeared, since people can’t go there to search for products to buy anymore, they’d use Google instead, or some other product search aggregator sites. They’d presumably still list the cheap sellers first (or whoever pays for an ad slot). That would be a huge change in the e-commerce industry, FTC can argue it benefits consumers because the prices of everything will be cheaper without Amazon’s fees, but I’m not seeing how to reduces the prevalence of cloned products. reply eru 15 hours agorootparentprevWe should encourage more price wars. They are good for customers. reply chii 11 hours agorootparentExcept once the price war is over, the consolidation of market share to one or a few players means that there is a good chance of monopoly pricing.Unless, if the price wars are never over. reply eru 8 hours agorootparent> Except once the price war is over, the consolidation of market share to one or a few players means that there is a good chance of monopoly pricing.Almost never happens like that. reply j16sdiz 6 hours agorootparentIt always happen like that. That&#x27;s why there are anti-dump rules on international trades. replyzdragnar 14 hours agorootparentprevAccording to Amazon&#x27;s rebuttal to the charges, 80% of all retail is still brick-and-mortar. Amazon has tried it a few times, but remains essentially an online only service.If your business depends on potential competitors for it&#x27;s existence, then being eventually forced out seems like a pretty natural conclusion. reply abduhl 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s the problem here? If you don’t have a durable competitive advantage then you’re going to get eaten up. First movers should not get a license to continue to reap a profit in a competitive market absent real innovation, which would come in the form of reputation (trademark) or technology (patent). Drop shippers who can be displaced by Amazon in the way you discuss have neither. They already made a profit on the front end, so don’t feel bad for them just because they can’t continue to rent-seek. reply letsdothisagain 17 hours agorootparentThe anti-competitive bit is they have all the sales information that would typically be a trade secret for a company.Go ahead, call up your local 7-11 and ask them what their sales were for the quarter. They&#x27;ll tell you to fuck off. reply cowsandmilk 8 hours agorootparentYour local grocery store has store brands that compete with the name brands. Your local grocery store also charges for shelf placement.Amazon is actually more open than other stores about this information, giving product rankings so that you could decide to knock off popular products too. reply abduhl 16 hours agorootparentprevBut Amazon is the 7-11 (and more)! It is the customer facing part of the business that houses and delivers the beef jerky to the ultimate customer. 7-11 sees that jerky sells, that lots of brands can sell jerky, that consumers don’t seem to care about the brand of jerky as long as it says teriyaki, and so 7-11 now sells 7-11 basics teriyaki jerky.The FBA middlemen are more like traveling salesmen - they take an order, send it in to HQ, and HQ ships it to the 7-11. They don’t do anything but take orders. They are Tom Smykowski - they take the plans to the engineers!You’re complaining that the storefront that the goods are sold through has its own sales information. The amount of sales you have through Amazon may be a trade secret, but it is not a trade secret from Amazon. reply havnagiggle 11 hours agorootparentIf we&#x27;re coming up with brick and mortar analogies, it&#x27;s got to be grocery stores and generic branded items. Kraft Mac vs Great Value.It&#x27;s hard for me to say Amazon shouldn&#x27;t be able to do it while every grocery store can, but there seems to be a quantitative difference because of the ridiculous number of options online vs the finite shelf space of a brick and mortar.All the same economic games are played. Items are placed on specific shelves to drive specific sales, etc. Sale numbers are known by the store and they get their cut.The distinguisher is supposed to be in the quality. Premium vs generic. That doesn&#x27;t seem to play out healthily in Amazon&#x27;s marketplace.Maybe one difference is the consumable nature of the grocery products vs what one typically buys online (Amazon batteries as opposed to an animal carrier). Or maybe we have given up too much with the consolidation of grocery chains the last few decades and that is equally problematic. reply LeonB 9 hours agorootparentI think that a lot of the same problems exist in generic brands at supermarkets. Supermarkets already have a lot of ways to pressure suppliers, and “own brand” products are weaponised extensively.I’m all in favor of suppliers competing with each other, as that’s in the best interests of society overall. But when the platforms&#x2F;marketplaces themselves participate in that competition they have tremendous advantages, which is anti-competitive, and it benefits no one but themselves. reply jtbayly 5 hours agorootparentprevBut Amazon refuses to be the actual seller taking the risk in the first place. They aren’t buying jerky from anybody and then selling it. Until they decide to make their own based on the actual seller’s data. reply ipaddr 15 hours agorootparentprevBut should barr them from selling a line of similar products. reply ameister14 16 hours agorootparentprevThey aren&#x27;t being eaten because of innovation, they are being eaten because of monopolization. reply trogdor 16 hours agorootparentThe person you are responding to was saying that dropshippers are being eaten because the products they are selling lack innovation.For example, Amazon cannot swoop in and sell a cheaper Amazon Basics version of a product to which you own a critical patent. reply ameister14 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m aware.They are really saying, though, that without barriers to entry and in a competitive market, players that don&#x27;t innovate don&#x27;t survive.>First movers should not get a license to continue to reap a profit in a competitive market absent real innovation, which would come in the form of reputation (trademark) or technology (patent).The problem with that is that this is not a competitive market, so the player that wins is not innovating, they just have market power because of their size. reply berniedurfee 15 hours agorootparentprevBut they do, right? At the very least they turn a blind eye to the countless counterfeiters. reply LeonB 13 hours agorootparentprevAmazon is the rent seeker here. reply BizarroLand 17 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is being both the platform and a competitor.They have an inside advantage that no one else on the planet outside of ebay and Alibaba (and its ilk) have.It entrenches them and enriches them unjustly. They make profit off of their competitors and have the option of destroying anyone who rubs them the wrong way without repercussion. The capitalistic market cannot speak on the matter as there is a monoposonistic gatekeeper on the market path. reply danielmarkbruce 16 hours agorootparentThey started out as the competitor. They have always been that. They opened up their capabilities to competitors. They didn&#x27;t have to. reply BizarroLand 16 hours agorootparentThey didn&#x27;t open their capabilities to competitors. That is completely false.No one who sells on Amazon is a competitor. If you are selling on Amazon you are a customer, and every once in a while, Amazon comes in and starts selling your goods for less than you can because they decided they would make more money without you in the picture.For a little proof, try to find Ammoon products on Amazon. They used to be everywhere. And the information isn&#x27;t exactly public but there was a falling out between Ammoon and Amazon and now you can&#x27;t buy Ammoon products on Amazon, but you can find Lekato and Sumimma and Joyo and Cuvave knock offs of the exact same products, and not long after this happened, Amazon started selling cheap guitar pedals under their Amazon Basics brand.You may say, sure, whatever, but the primary product Ammoon sold was the cheapest ($35) looper pedal on the market.Amazon undercut that price (to $26.50) and also booted their closest competitor and biggest customer in the guitar pedal looper segment.Who would defend that kind of scummy action? reply danielmarkbruce 16 hours agorootparentIn an enormous number of cases Amazon both sells products and the same exact product from a different supplier, and they sold the product before opening up the store to others. That&#x27;s the definition of a competitor.The fact that they didn&#x27;t sell every single product on planet earth doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t a competitor. They are practically in the \"easy to manufacture by a third party in china consumer products\" market. If a company adds so little value that Amazon&#x27;s 5th rate people (The best minds at Amazon aren&#x27;t sitting up at night worrying about the guitar pedal looper market) can beat them, they aren&#x27;t adding value. And, one single distribution channel (the amazon website) doesn&#x27;t define a market (with almost zero exceptions, amazon&#x27;s website not being one). reply chii 10 hours agorootparent> And, one single distribution channel (the amazon website) doesn&#x27;t define a market (with almost zero exceptions, amazon&#x27;s website not being one).if amazon captures a large ratio of people buying goods online, i would certainly consider amazon itself a market. But unless they also control some other aspect of the online market, it would be hard to claim they&#x27;re a monopoly tbh._Anyone_ can setup an e-commerce site and sell online. Amazon doesn&#x27;t quite fully control the hosting, IP and backend servers completely! reply jupp0r 11 hours agorootparentprevWhere&#x27;s the harm for consumers here? All I see is that I can now buy guitar pedals for a fraction of the price. Isn&#x27;t consumer harm the point of anti trust? replyneycoda 13 hours agorootparentprevThe whole Amazon Basics thing, cannibalizing sellers, should be illegal. It just victimizes people trying to make a living in a crap job market where online sales are closing street shops. reply newsclues 17 hours agorootparentprev\"This is the result of commoditizing &#x27;starting a business&#x27; to the point of near-worthlessness in the bottom 50%+.\"Is this not just a market effect of saturating the market with competition because suddenly running a business is comparatively easy (communications technology, platforms and existing logistics and production networks) to any other era.I can probably start a company drop shipping crap on Amazon in a short amount of time with a smartphone from my bedroom. The barrier to entry has dropped, rather quickly. reply berniedurfee 16 hours agorootparentVery similar to the music industry, where technology has made producing music so easy the market is growing by tens of millions of new songs every year.The slices of pie are getting very thin indeed. Especially when there are only a few pie delivery services to choose from and they take their slice first. reply deepsun 10 hours agorootparentIn efficient market every business must have razor-thin margins, otherwise competitors squeeze into it.Good fat margins are a result of an ineffective market. reply hnlmorg 9 hours agorootparentSo Amazon making good fat margins on every small business that sells on Amazon is demonstration of an ineffective market. And hence why the FTC are stepping in. reply SenAnder 12 hours agorootparentprevAmazon inflating rates after capturing the market, permitting counterfeits, and penalizing sellers offering lower prices off-Amazon, has nothing to do with market efficiency or commoditization. reply starluz 10 hours agorootparentNot saying it’s right but this has been their business model from day one back when it was just books reply midoridensha 7 hours agorootparentprevThere should be some tough laws against selling counterfeits, with harsh penalties. reply reuben364 5 hours agorootparentSimultaneously, there must be harsh penalties for abusing that system. See Samsung&#x27;s use of a patent on display technology to label third party displays as counterfeits, despite not using that patent nor misrepresenting themselves as Samsung screens.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A002AesVaFk reply xphilter 3 hours agorootparentprevRunning a business being easy is limited to these low-value drop-ship businesses. Running an actual business is hard. What they’re doing is just arbitrage: buying in bulk from Ali Baba and selling individually on Amazon. No value would be lost if these companies went away. Compare that to a bookstore or cafe being closed in your town. reply BeetleB 17 hours agorootparentprevYes - some of the complaints seem legitimate (e.g. burying search results really far low - that hurts me as a buyer, and hurts the seller).But complaining that you need to use Amazon&#x27;s warehouses to be part of Prime? That&#x27;s rather obvious! You can always sell as non-Prime. Many do and are successful at it!Basically, Amazon allowed many businesses to exist by creating a very convenient way to sell.

They are just trying to make money by adding some marketing and connecting dots together. reply SkyPuncher 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure most of these sellers are actually designing their products.There&#x27;s an increasing trend of foreign manufacturers copying (or even simply producing unlabelled variants) popular products then white labelling them. You see this all over Amazon where there are dozens of brands selling the exact same product with their name stamped on it. Those products are always some slight variation of a bit name.* Solo Stove - dozens of identical knock-offs* Power screwdrivers - Nearly limitless variations of the popular brands* Theragun&#x2F;Hypervolt - Literally dozens of knock-offs with slight variations in packaging.This continues for nearly every single category. reply notatoad 9 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;stores&#x2F;page&#x2F;DA1BA85C-60B5-4150-B030-A...a quick google search turns up this store. whether they designed these firepits themselves or it&#x27;s a catalog design from a chinese seller, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really fair to compare it to an iPhone. and given the sheer number of designs in his store, i think it&#x27;s a fairly safe bet that they&#x27;re reselling catalog products from chinese sellers. reply seanmcdirmid 1 hour agorootparentEither they are selling someone else’s design, or someone else is also selling their design. reply conorgdaly 7 hours agorootparentprevalibaba link for exact product(same images&#x2F;title&#x2F;description etc.)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;Black-Crossweave-Larg...alibaba unit price(list): $40.00 amazon seller price: $199 reply notyourwork 17 hours agorootparentprevDing ding ding.

It attracted so much attention in the antitrust law community that it led to her becoming the youngest FTC chair in history.She has literally been building this case against Amazon since she was a student. It’s not just about dropshippers. It’s also about how Amazon uses automated price controls, guided by scraping of competitors, to engage in dumping [2] and predatory pricing [3] to wipe out competing e-commerce sites. Since everything is automated, prices can change in a matter of seconds, so once competitors are destroyed, prices go back up automatically.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yalelawjournal.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.p...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dumping_(pricing_policy)?wprov...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Predatory_pricing?wprov=sfti1 reply intended 2 hours agorootparentNice! I remember her argument regarding Amazon.From what I recall, the reason why her argument was recognized is because it solved a thorny problem of US anti trust law, proving harm.Currently, in the US what matters is showing that consumer welfare was harmed. AINAL but proving harm is not easy - Amazon in particular reduces prices to the end customer, increases choices and makes sales easier.This is where most arguments died, however her approach had enough merit to pursue.However, it seems her approach and argument has changed, and is more couched in terms of current legalese - more focused on showing consumer harm than applying a new legal approach. reply __alexs 2 hours agorootparentprevThe existence of Shopify seems to contradict this.

People who weigh in on these tech topics should actually try these things out to understand them better.It&#x27;s nothing like listing on eBay where there&#x27;s some haircut off the top and that&#x27;s that.There are fees for - accepting inventory, holding inventory, returning unsold inventory, shipping sales, processing returns, destroying returns, transaction fees, ads to promote your listings in market, and probably 5 other things I forget. Depending on the fee it is - fixed, % of $, weight based, volume based, or some combination.The fees change constantly with not much notice. So every time you think you&#x27;ve got just the right size&#x2F;weight&#x2F;price balance you get screwed. And where else are you going to go?Like Uber drivers, I imagine some % of FBA sellers don&#x27;t know they are losing money in real time. You need to do some decent accounting to track as all these different fees hit at different times. It&#x27;s not like Amazon gives you the data & tools to track your all-in costs per sale. reply BeetleB 17 hours agorootparentDisclaimer: Former FBA seller here.> So every time you think you&#x27;ve got just the right size&#x2F;weight&#x2F;price balance you get screwed. And where else are you going to go?You&#x27;ve skirted around the obvious question: Why did you pick FBA to begin with? Amazon sellers existed long before FBA. They did their own shipping, so almost none of those fees apply. Many sellers continue to do well on the Amazon platform while not being part of FBA.If you can&#x27;t succeed without participating in FBA, then all that&#x27;s happened is Amazon created an environment for previously unviable businesses to succeed, and has merely tightened it.Edit: Amusing that this comment is being downvoted, whereas my other comment saying pretty much the same thing is being upvoted. reply agentgumshoe 17 hours agorootparentI think a more obvious question is how are Amazon making this possible if it&#x27;s not profitable otherwise? reply BeetleB 17 hours agorootparentAmazon gets to negotiate good shipping rates, and has larger economies of scale than a regular business can achieve.In general, cost per unit is cheaper if you have more volume. reply shiftpgdn 20 hours agorootparentprevAWS works this way too but I’ll get dogpiled by Amazon sycophants and other people who have built their careers around getting witless companies sucked into the Amazon machine. reply smallnix 20 hours agorootparentSteve gave examples for the different kind of fees and that it&#x27;s hard to track them and why.

This isn&#x27;t exactly arcane information anymore.> You&#x27;re criticism seems to be grounded in a distaste for the kind of business being done (and I think it&#x27;s quite fair to be critical of the business model based on cheap Chinese labor).My criticism is that the same people who cry from the rooftops about how free commerce is essential and how they have a right to sell marked up goods under any name they like to people who can&#x27;t trace their supply chain have zero basis to complain when consumers get wise to their shenanigains and go elsewhere. It&#x27;s literally this kind of \"business owner\"&#x27;s fault that Amazon is becoming near unusable now. I&#x27;m not shocked one bit that Amazon is cracking the whip; their reputation is on the line and has been trending steadily down for years.\"Buyer beware\" they chant. Until the buyers start bewaring, and then they start whining about unfair competition and high fees for their store that is entirely operated by a third party and literally cannot exist without it.Amazon is no angel here either of course. They have monopolized the absolute shit out of online retail, one of the ways they did was offering reseller services and getting businesses on their platform in the first place. Neither \"side\" of this is right, per se. Both of them would send me as a customer up the proverbial river to make a single dollar. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, them fighting in court is strictly entertainment, apart from whatever precedents get set that might affect other businesses I actually give a shit about down the line.But like, the businesses I give a shit about are like, local ones. Ones run by people, to serve people. Not ones pulling tag clouds from trending social media topics or buying ad space on instagram to sell an egg beater shaped like a cat for $35 that they got from a Chinese manufacturer for $5.50&#x2F;10,000 and dropshipped to people. This is just that, with an extra step. And the entity that&#x27;s the extra step is realizing how raw of a deal it is, and they want a heftier cut to put up with these middle men.

You can&#x27;t do that without having a lot of leverage. reply wolverine876 19 hours agorootparent> It just gets passed down to the customers.That&#x27;s a common but not an accurate belief:As a business owner pricing a product or service, if your costs increase you can either take the marginal cost out of your net income or increase the price.Taking it out of your net income is simple: You keep prices the same, revenue remains the same, and profit drops a bit.Increasing the price is more complex; you are changing one component in a system of dynamic feedback: When you raise the price, fewer people buy your product, so the outcome may be less revenue and less profit. The impact of price changes on purchasing is called elasticity: Some products - e.g., fancy restaurant meals - are easily forgone and are thus price sensitive. Others, like necessary healthcare, can be priced extortionately and people will still buy it.Arguably, if you are the mythical optimal manager, you&#x27;ve already priced your product to maximize revenue and therefore any change will decrease it. In that case, price increases will only worsen your profit.The reason for your price increase is orthogonal to the customer&#x27;s purchase decision - you raise the price, they buy less. They usually don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care why - do it for greed, to cover additional cost (and maintain your beloved profit margin), because your finger slipped on the price-your-goods app, whatever. reply robertlagrant 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just elasticity.

So you can’t measure whether your ad being clicked in one app resulted in a purchase in another app (aka. a “conversion”). That throws a big wrench into ad pricing, because the sellers want to pay-per-conversion. It hurt companies like Snap, Shopify. Since Amazon owns both the search&#x2F;discovery and checkout in the same app, this doesn’t affect them.Also, Apple didn’t limit their own advertisers from measuring conversions. So if you click an ad in Apple News and then buy an app from the App Store they will measure and charge the advertiser for that conversion without ever popping up a scary message saying Apple wants to track you. Go figure.The companies have worked around these issues by doing stuff like statistical modeling to guess the conversion rate, but this has obvious downsides and makes everything harder, which puts them at a competitive disadvantage vs. vertically-integrated players like Apple and Amazon. reply comex 17 hours agorootparentprevFor one thing, the privacy rules only cover sharing data with third parties. They don’t cover Amazon using its own data for product recommendations.But also, Amazon doesn’t rely on product recommendations in the first place. When I want to purchase something, I usually go to amazon.com and type in exactly what I’m looking for. No need for Amazon to guess. Amazon does make recommendations, but at least in my case they represent a tiny fraction of purchases.In that way I’m voluntarily contributing to Amazon’s monopoly. I feel bad about that. But I use Amazon anyway because there are no alternatives that offer even a remotely comparable buyer experience. reply asow92 16 hours agorootparentprevBy virtue of everything sold on Amazon being in the Amazon app the rule in question is kind of moot.

Sellers would select among competing fulfillment services (warehouse+shipping). Platform referral fees would go toward customer remediation, anti-counterfeiting, and review integrity.I don&#x27;t merely say this as a \"fuck Amazon\" reflex or a \"fuck capitalism\" reflex. I say it because it obviously would allow so much of the dying segment of mom and pop small business to become viable again. Just from a policy perspective it&#x27;s a home run because it&#x27;s a way to juice GDP, improve consumer purchasing power, AND reduce income inequality.As a matter of fact I would suggest that Amazon as it exists is anti-capitalist. It is feudal. Capitalism is the deployment of capital and assumption of risk in pursuit of new value creating activity. Amazon is not marshalling new capital to innovate or improve its digital marketplace. Rather, Amazon simply owns digital real estate and extracts rent, like some kind of futuristic dystopian corpo-baron.The best part of all this is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have to be forcibly nationalized or broken up or anything like that.

It would just be the actual marketplace connecting buyers, sellers, and fulfillment.Amazon can continue to do order fulfillment if they like, it&#x27;s just that any company with a warehouse can actually begin to compete with them. Sellers would be able to freely associate with whatever fulfillment company best suits their needs, rather than being captive to FBA.> What on earth are you on about? They own a url.Right, from which they extract enormous rents. It is not a product in which they continually invest. If you have used it with any frequency over the past decade, you&#x27;ve almost certainly noticed how shitty it&#x27;s become. That&#x27;s not an accident; their \"sellers\" (tenants) are locked in, and are paying something more like obligate rent rather than indicating with their dollars that Amazon&#x27;s product is the best.It would be the same story with privately owned power lines or privately owned roads. You&#x27;re not using them because they&#x27;re the best, but because you don&#x27;t have a choice. We screwed up with the actual internet cables, but we still have time to get it right with internet marketplaces. reply jdietrich 12 hours agorootparentprevAmazon owns one of the most sophisticated logistics networks in the world. They own warehouses and robots and trucks and planes. All of that adds up to a meaningful, valuable contribution to the world.I buy tons of stuff on Amazon. I buy from them rather than from eBay or an independent online retailer because I know it&#x27;ll actually get delivered to my house on time. For me, the marketplace is basically irrelevant - it&#x27;s the promise of fulfilment by Amazon that I care about.I sometimes reluctantly buy from an eBay seller or a random e-commerce site when the item I want isn&#x27;t available on Amazon. Those retailers tend to offer \"FREE DELIVERY\", but they also tend to be very evasive about how long it&#x27;ll take and which company will do the delivering. Sometimes they&#x27;ll advertise next-day delivery, but take two or three days to actually dispatch the package. Sometimes they&#x27;ll use an ultra-cheap delivery service that takes 3-5 days, with no prior warning of which day they&#x27;ll actually try to deliver on. Sometimes their terrible delivery service will decide that they just can&#x27;t be bothered to deliver to my house, so they&#x27;ll lie about having tried to deliver it and tell me to collect it from a warehouse. Sometimes they deliver to somewhere random in the vague vicinity of my house (a neighbour, underneath a parked car, behind a bush) and I get to play a fun scavenger hunt where the prize is something I already paid for. These bad outcomes literally never happen to me when I buy from Amazon.In the event that something did go wrong with a delivery, I&#x27;m confident that I could just contact Amazon and they&#x27;d make it right; when something goes wrong with $OnlineRetailer, I often find myself refereeing a dispute between the retailer and the logistics company, both of whom deny responsibility.There are plenty of alternatives to Amazon, but from a customer&#x27;s perspective they just suck. reply blibble 19 hours agorootparentprev> I can&#x27;t help but think that Amazon should be replaced with a non-profit or regulated public utility that provides a single unified online marketplace, part of internet infrastructure like ICANN.if the market was working correctly Amazon&#x27;s profits would be driven down to zero and you&#x27;d effectively have this> As a matter of fact I would suggest that Amazon as it exists is anti-capitalist.

Consumer behavior seems to be to simply go to their default marketplace rather than to search the whole internet (which is slow, painful, and low-trust), so it ends up being a winner-take-all system where alternative marketplaces like eBay are almost irrelevant and Amazon charges whatever they like and basically ignores counterfeiting and review fraud.There are \"natural monopolies\", like with roads and power distribution networks, and I would argue that online marketplaces have turned out to be another one, and we should modify our public policy to reflect that. reply shopifyeocks 20 hours agoparentprevWhat’s do you mean exactly about the Shopify tiktok Facebook connection being dead? reply adamsb6 20 hours agorootparentProbably that Apple&#x27;s privacy changes made those advertising channels far less effective. reply shopifyeocks 17 hours agorootparentThanks yes I reread the comment and that sounds most likely reply mvdtnz 18 hours agoparentprevHow much do you personally shop at Amazon versus other outlets? reply 22289d 16 hours agorootparentOnce I figured eBay out, it&#x27;s about 90% eBay, 5% Amazon, 5% other.Amazon does a great job of making it appear that they are the best option to shop at.

    "originBody": "Writing Software, technology, sysadmin war stories, and more. Tuesday, September 26, 2023 The Philips Hue ecosystem is collapsing into stupidity If you've gotten into the home automation thing in the past few years, it's possible you set up some Philips Hue devices along the way. This was an ecosystem which had a bunch of bulbs, switches, outlets and a hub that spoke Zigbee on one side and Ethernet on the other. It was pretty much no-nonsense, never dropped commands, and just sat there and worked. Also, it integrated with the Apple Homekit ecosystem perfectly. Unfortunately, the idiot C-suite phenomenon has happened here too, and they have been slowly walking down the road to full-on enshittification. I figured something was up a few years ago when their iOS app would block entry until you pushed an upgrade to the hub box. That kind of behavior would never fly with any product team that gives a damn about their users - want to control something, so you start up the app? Forget it, we are making you placate us first! How is that user-focused, you ask? It isn't. Their latest round of stupidity pops up a new EULA and forces you to take it or, again, you can't access your stuff. But that's just more unenforceable garbage, so who cares, right? Well, it's getting worse. It seems they are planning on dropping an update which will force you to log in. Yep, no longer will your stuff Just Work across the local network. Now it will have yet another garbage \"cloud\" \"integration\" involved, and they certainly will find a way to make things suck even worse for you. If you ever saw the South Park episode where they try to get the cable company to do something on their behalf and the cable company people just touch themselves inappropriately upon hearing the lamentations of their customers, well, I suspect that's what's going on here. The management of these places are fundamentally sadists, and they are going to auger all of these things into the ground to make their short-term money before flying the coop for the next big thing they can destroy. What can you do about it? Before you say \"Home Assistant\", let me stop you right there. Javascript plus a \"curlsudo sh\" attitude to life equals \"yeah no, I am never touching this thing\". Instead, I have a simpler workaround, assuming you just have lights and \"smart outlets\" in your life. Get a hold of an Ikea Dirigera hub. Then delete the units from the Hue Hub and add them to the Ikea side of things. It'll run them just fine, and will also export them to HomeKit so that much will keep working as well. I will warn you that Ikea isn't perfect here, either. They won't plumb through the Hue light/motion/temp sensors or the remote controllers to HomeKit. This means you lose any motion sensor data, the light level, and the temperature of that room. You also lose the ability to do custom behaviors with those buttons, like having one turn something on and then automatically switch it off a few minutes later. (Don't laugh - this is perfect for making kitchen appliances less sketchy when unattended.) Also, there's no guarantee that Ikea won't hop on the train to sketchville and start screwing over their users as well. My hope is that someone with good taste and some sensibility in terms of their technology choices will make something that does Zigbee on one side, Homekit on the other, and is at least as flexible as the Hue setup that existed originally. Until then, it's going to be yet another shit show. And people wonder why I don't trust these things. More writingContact / send feedback",

Buy something dumb, non-smart, non-cloud2. Build it myself3. Buy something that can be hacked and used with my own infrastructureThe problem isn&#x27;t even their infrastructure, it is that they decide when they want to change it. Even if it was all good faith changes, that could be a reliability issue and force me to dedicate time to the issue on their whim. I don&#x27;t like that. If I run such things myself I can decide myself when to update and how much time I want to invest when (provided the system is decoupled from the public internet).And this point isn&#x27;t even about any single company trading the good will of their customers bit by bit — it is just about me not having to jump when their service changes or ends for whatever reason (and there are many). reply dugite-code 11 hours agorootparentNothing wrong with buying smart equipment, as long as it&#x27;s local first using common protocols like generic Zigbee.

But that was with the TRADFRI, which it seems they don&#x27;t sell anymore. It looks like the DIRIGERA supports up to 100 devices though, so probably nothing to worry about. Feels like I probably bought the first gen of their smart products. reply blindriver 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve completely replaced all my Hue lights with Lutron Casetas. They work so much better than individual light bulbs talking to the bridge. I use Apple Home which is mostly meh, but feels more robust than Hue or Google Home. reply jader201 11 hours agorootparentI have nearly all of our light switches on Casetas (except for things like bathroom and closets, where we&#x27;re not sitting&#x2F;lying down or care about dim levels).However... in some rooms (office and board game room), I do like having the option for cool white during the day, and warm white at night. So I like having Hues there.So, while Casetas are good for automating a single color, you still need bulb-level automation for anything involving multiple colors. reply inasio 12 hours agoparentprevWhen Ikea came out with smart home stuff, I bet that they would get it right, or at least not as bad as the others (I previously suffered through the enshitification of Samsung&#x27;s SmartThings). In my experience their stuff has been flimsy and not sure trustworthy. It at least works without an app, so far, but I&#x27;ve not been able to regain any enthusiasm for the promise of home automation reply julianz 10 hours agorootparentWhen was SmartThings good? I missed that. The only thing I use it for is an oven that, even though it is connected to the internet, can&#x27;t manage to update the time when daylight savings time changes. To get the oven to update the time, you have to open the app, find the oven, go to Settings, turn OFF the \"automatic time sync\" option and then turn it back on again. Every 6 months.I performed this ritual last weekend, and followed up by filing a bug report about what a shitshow the whole thing was from the feedback option in the app. I got a very nice message back from Samsung telling me my message had come to the wrong place and that I should do something different if I wanted to give feedback about the app. FFS. reply imp0cat 11 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, this.

To me it sounds as illegal as a car manufacturer requiring you to use Shell vpower in order for you to not void the warranty, and doing so after you bought the car.Maybe the EU could then deal with this and ask the important question: Are they even allowed to link the functionality of IoT devices to an online account?My reason for buying all Phillips was that their system was relatively open, that the gateway could be accessed and controlled via HTTP and put behind a firewall without access to and from the internet. And the ability to use 3rd party apps.I&#x27;ve moved over to using Zigbee2MQTT together with a Zigbee USB 3.0 Dongle and all controlled from a custom Python based server on a Raspberry Pi, which made me lose all the access via the apps (I&#x27;m not into Home Assistant), but it&#x27;s now all automated and controllable via dimmers and other events so that in my case the Phillips gateway has become obsolete.But it was a great entry into the ecosystem, just because it was simply usable via HTTP, which allowed the best of both worlds: the apps and the ability to tinker with it all. The only thing which was missing was the real-time access to events.Sad to see that they are turning their back on us, but let&#x27;s hope that the EU notices and creates some new laws, even if it&#x27;s in 10 years. reply neop1x 7 hours agoparentI am using the same setup: sonoff zigbee plus dongle + zigbee2mqtt + home assistant.Fully local solution with no 3rd party clouds, EULAs, proprietary hubs or propruetary apps or restrictions.

There is nothing wrong with JS itself, in fact, as far as languages go, it is pretty secure due to the attention it gets by being what runs in web browsers.As for \"curlsudo sh\", yeah it looks scary, but it is not worse than downloading a .deb and then doing \"sudo dpkg -i your.deb\", or installing any downloaded binary on your machine for that matter. You may say something about signatures, but often, the public key you have to trust is on the same website you downloaded the .deb. In all these cases, TLS is the only thing protecting you. Going through a file you don&#x27;t audit doesn&#x27;t change anything, and in practice, almost no one does the audit, and few linux boxes have AV scanners.Don&#x27;t trust it?

Now though, I’ve realized that no one is really paying that much attention to anyone else, even if someone were curious about why you walked away for a moment, the room getting brighter and you sitting back down doesn’t require a brain surgeon to piece together what happened.Once you remove the completely voluntary awkward part of that video call, fiddling with an app and flipping a switch are on a lot more equal footing. reply heyoni 12 hours agorootparentGood lighting is a luxury for sure but can definitely get complicated to control properly with just switches. The other thing is, once you’re in that ecosystem, you fiddle a lot at the beginning and then you don’t.

Lights follow the same trend: it isn’t that turning on and off the lights is a pain, but being able to turn on or off all the lights with just one command is useful. We’ve only bothered with our open kitchen living room, but we had 4 switches all around the 2nd floor to manipulate before (and we went Lutron for our shades anyways, so we can set scenes with both).I don’t get the mood lighting.

I don&#x27;t use cloud services either. I also kinda just kept writing, so this is a bit of a text wall.I live in an old house. 80% of the lights in my house are operated by walking up to them and twisting the stem. The remaining 20% are switched.To properly turn the lights on in my living room, I have to visit four separate lamps and turn each one on. The dining room has three lamps, bedroom has three, office has three, etc. When it&#x27;s time for bed, I have to walk around the house turning each lamp off. If I want them dim, no luck. To do that would require either all new lamp fixtures, or rewiring the house with new dimmer switches.Or, that was how it was before I did the Zigbee&#x2F;HomeAssistant thing. Now I just hit that master switch on my nightstand and all the lights turn off. My whole house changes into \"Night Mode\". The thermostat will widen the setpoints. The doors lock if they weren&#x27;t already. If I happen to get up at 3AM to take a piss or get a glass of water, the lights all know to come on at minimum brightness, and to turn off shortly thereafter.My front door lock used to be a pain in the ass when I had my hands full of groceries. Or my coffee and the mail. Now my door unlocks automatically when I walk up to it. It&#x27;s a small joy, but it reliably makes me smile each time. (And I don&#x27;t have an ugly keypad, and still have a standard key slot if I need it).I have an ancient stove and oven. No electronics at all. So I wrote a simple automation to alert me if the kitchen motion sensor&#x27;s temperature rises 10°F more than the rest of the house, for longer than 30 minutes. This has saved me a couple of times now when I forgot to turn the oven off. (It takes a good hour for that temp sensor to reach the threshold as well. I wrote that automation after discovering that my oven had been on for hours. When I looked through the temp logs, I saw a clear signal I could use in the future.)I also put a remote temp sensor in one of my HVAC registers. Comparing its reading to the ambient reading gives me a ΔT on my air conditioner, and a couple years ago the steadily-declining value of that delta alerted me to a refrigerant leak weeks before it would have been large enough to notice otherwise. I was able to get that repaired in the spring rather than in the heat of summer. This isn&#x27;t something I would have done with a regular thermometer; having to remember to check it every so often and do the math taking into account the humidity and the elapsed time since the start of the cycle. But seeing all that temp data logged over many weeks makes the pattern easy to spot.In the den I sometimes want it to be bright enough to read or do detailed work, and other times I want it dim so there&#x27;s no glare while watching TV. Before, that meant I would have to buy lamps with a dimmer on them, then dim each one and go flip the ceiling fan light off. Now when I click the switch[1] to turn the TV&#x2F;stereo combo on, it automatically dims the lights at either end of the couch, and turns the overhead light off.Color temperature! That&#x27;s another thing that isn&#x27;t possible without some smartness in the bulbs. At night my whole house is as close to 2200K as possible. I really like that kind of light. But in the middle of the day, my kitchen lights are closer to 3300K.My porch light turns on 30 minutes after sunset and off before sunrise. It&#x27;s under a roof so I would have needed to either replace the switch with one of those fancy ones, or installed a photocell somewhere else. But it was just a couple automations added to the config file to get that functionality.[1] I originally put a Tasmota wall relay in to save the 20W (!) of idle power my old stereo receiver was constantly drawing. When I realized I always fiddled with the lights whenever I turn the TV&#x2F;stereo on, I just automated that away. reply nerdbert 12 hours agorootparent> My front door lock used to be a pain in the ass when I had my hands full of groceries.

I’m not OP but I use August smart locks and they work great, easy to install, nothing on the exterior to give it away, and it unlocks automatically when I get home. Could someone hack into the August servers and remotely unlock my door? Could the Bluetooth connection from my phone be spoofed? I’m sure it’s possible but the effort level is 1000x beyond what anyone would reasonably do to break into my home. Anyone motivated to break into my house would just break a window with a rock. The convenience is incredible. Seriously, I haven’t had to worry about my keys in years, and since it automatically locks the door after two minutes my house is safer than ever. Not having to think “did I remember to lock the door before I left?” is such a weight off my mind, and being able to unlock it remotely is an added bonus even though it rarely gets used by anyone outside of the family. reply function_seven 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a Kwikset 914S2.

Some of these devices seem to offer remote control, some offer actual automation. I also love not having to get up and hit arrow keys on my television monitor to change the channel. Likewise, my ceiling fans have radio controllers. It would be nice if lights had those as well. On the other hand, I feel no need for motion detectors, voice control, or any kind of service running on a server somewhere trying to learn when I want the lights on or off. But a switch that can be flipped without having to walk to wherever the wall-mounted switch is would be nice. That can be a simple radio device or infrared or whatever they prefer, just like a television remote. Don&#x27;t need an app that requires an account with a remote service. Same thing with a thermostat. When I first married and moved in with my wife a decade ago, she had Nest thermostats and those things annoyed the hell out of me, using eco settings by default, requiring access to WiFi, trying to learn my living patterns. Some of these answers are right. The longstanding automation offered by thermostats was great. I like being able to program when I want specific temperatures in specific rooms and then it just happens. But that was enough. I don&#x27;t need a cloud-based service to learn when I&#x27;m home and in what rooms. I already know that. reply catiopatio 16 hours agoparentprevI like the idea of local home automation. “Siri, make the bathroom lights dark blue”Problem is, it comes with a ton of headaches.The cloud is a problem, as you noted, but also a bunch of fiddily, unreliable software, firmware updates that go haywire, and apps that are tied to iOS and will stop working with my physically installed home hardware if the manufacturer ever stops treading water and fails to update for the latest breaking iOS update.Home automation could be simple, reliable, and future-proof. It’s really not, though. reply bdamm 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not so sure it can be simple, reliable, and future proof, at least not in the consumer space.Everyone is chasing the lowest price, and it has to compete with existing solutions that are cheap, like just putting a filter on a white bulb, or installing a dimmer switch. What these products are offering is convenience, but not fundamentally new life experiences. So they can&#x27;t charge a lot.Meanwhile, they have to interact with an absolutely enourmous range of interfaces. The wi-fi router, the phone, the electric service itself, etc. And the user has high expectations for ease of use (after all, it is a light bulb, it should be simple!) while needing good security (it is your home after all, if you can&#x27;t be safe in your home then where can you be safe?)A simple experience with a wide range of interfaces at low cost has almost never been successfully done. Even Apple can&#x27;t do it; they offer ease of use, but in a limited ecosystem and at a premium price.So these products are fundamentally flawed and they probably can never be fixed. This industry is fundamentally not viable until someone comes along and solves the interface issue or until people accept paying a lot of money for these kinds of things, and even in that case it would probably be a reseller performing a home install then providing API access to these services, which is only one step away from home-as-a-service.And I personally do not think I could tolerate a home-as-a-service.

I suspect simple enough for the consumer would be something which came with it&#x27;s own wifi AP and pre-configured mesh routers so the IoT network would start out intrinsically separated. reply skywhopper 16 hours agoparentprevOne of the big benefits of Hue, as alluded to in this article, is that you didn’t need to use their cloud services or share any data.

It is nice to have automation capabilities for some scenarios to avoid rewiring or to customize lighting for different purposes in the same space with one controller.But if you don’t personally need it, you also don’t really need to drop in and bash the concept.

They are not cheap.And surely an app can keep working with minimal updates, I don&#x27;t see that as a huge expense for Hue. reply fy20 11 hours agoparentprevActually there is, but it&#x27;s not cheap, so it doesn&#x27;t appeal to the average consumer. KNX and DALI are effectively the standard in Europe for large commercial buildings. Green building certifications are requiring lights that turn on and off automatically based on occupancy and ambient conditions, and nothing else even comes close to matching it for this. Remote monitoring and management saves money compared to having someone periodically inspect every light in a building.They are available for residential installs too, but for a new build you are talking about paying the price of a car (and not a Dacia) on top of what you&#x27;d pay for a standard lighting installation, so it&#x27;s only a thing in luxury homes. For that you end up with truly automatic lighting (controlling lights with your phone is not home automation), variable colour temperature and much higher quality lighting.But the average consumer doesn&#x27;t care. A lot of the time they can&#x27;t even replace a bulb in a set with the same colour temperature. reply bananapub 7 hours agoparentprev> Sadly there is no money in home automation unless you can force them into your SaaS serviceSource?

Manufacturers are free to implement it however they want, which will always result in enshittification.Counter-intuitively, the closed standard, Z-Wave, operates more like an open ecosystem. My Z-Wave Thermostat (ACD-2000, nearly the only Z-Wave thermostat that doesn&#x27;t look like it hails from the 90s) swears that it requires the Alarm.com ecosystem on the store page - but the simple truth is that it wouldn&#x27;t be Z-Wave compliant (and therefore couldn&#x27;t be sold) if it didn&#x27;t work with any hub (Aoetec in my setup - they are particularly friendly with the HA community). Compare this with an Ecobee: a Zigbee device which requires their hub (and other Zigbee devices are unlikely to work with the Ecobee hub, so I&#x27;m sure you get the idea).Hue bulbs are one firmware update away from the same situation, even though Philips have \"promised\" not to.I&#x27;m not sure what the situation is with Matter&#x2F;Thread - my Google fu isn&#x27;t strong enough to determine whether it will go the way of Zigbee (which it&#x27;s based on, but merely as a channel) or Z-Wave.As for LEDs and the rest?

They&#x27;re all on Kasa switches and hooked to Alexa for voice control. So, you can turn on the sink lights to wash dishes without touching anything and lights can be turned on&#x2F;off in groups no matter where you are standing.Other living areas use a combo of table and floor lamps at multiple locations&#x2F;outlets, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to turn everything on together by room with a voice command.

We still require them to create custom engines in their sophomore year, but in their junior year (and beyond, in some cases), they&#x27;re all using commercial engines. One of the main things we want to focus on is giving them a chance to work on a truly cross-discipline team, where every member has a chance to thrive at their work, regardless of their degree program. If you&#x27;re a student of game design or art, it can be very stressful to be on a team with a custom engine, because the bar is so high for them to provide the features you need to get your work done and accomplish your goals. If the engine and its editor and other support tools are all already completed when the project begins, these stresses and barriers are removed. Meanwhile, the programming students get a chance to work in an existing engine, which is applicable for the career trajectories of so vastly many of them, who will graduate and go on to work for companies that are using an existing engine (possibly even the one they used in GAM class). If they use Unreal, they&#x27;re often working in C++, interfacing directly with the engine code. These are valuable experiences as well.I have an imperfect perspective of the students&#x27; attitudes, but it seems to me that they tend to agree with my point of view: at the beginning of the year, I said, \"Raise your hand if you wish you&#x27;d be working on a custom engine this year,\" expecting to see a few dozen hands go up. Surprisingly, only about one and a half hands were raised!

Doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t have breakfast again anyway! reply adamrezich 13 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s great that sophomores still have to make their own engine from scratch.making two engines, one in C for GAM150, and another in C++ for GAM200, were extremely formative experiences for me. when I was attending DigiPen, it was at the beginning of the ECS craze, so, naturally, I implemented terrible, extremely naive ECSes, in C and C++. they were woefully inefficient and byzantine to the point of ridiculousness (look up Game School Simulator 2015 on the DigiPen student games site—its framerate is terrible, despite rendering just consisting of a few dozen sprites), but I learned so much from making them—both good and bad. I especially enjoyed GAM200 when we got to have artists who had any spare time to work on a GAM project, because working with them to integrate them into the workflow was an amazing experience.I understand that DigiPen wants to provide students with as much career opportunity as possible, and that means Unity and Unreal. or rather, it did mean Unity and Unreal, until very recently—now, it&#x27;s kinda just Unreal. and Unreal isn&#x27;t going away anytime soon, of course—but that&#x27;s what we would&#x27;ve said about Unity just a short while ago.even though it&#x27;s certainly the pragmatic choice as far as getting a job after graduating goes, personally I firmly believe it&#x27;s a mistake to forgo having students make their own engines after sophomore year. at least when I was there, there was borderline zero education about how to even go about making a game engine, despite requiring teams to make one, so there was that—but there was also a vibrantly competitive culture of one-upmanship among students, and it was fun to see what other teams were working on, and strive to do better and cooler stuff yourself. (Josh Fisher, if you&#x27;re somehow reading this for some reason, your shit was always way better than mine and I was always super jealous.)if students stop learning about how video games work at any lower level than \"just use an off-the-shelf general-purpose game engine\", then who&#x27;s going to make game engines going forward? some of the smartest classmates I had were guys who put their heart and soul into their engine projects, and they all went on to find success one way or another as far as I know.perhaps more importantly—and I only say this now with a decade of hindsight and experience since then—you don&#x27;t need to make a general-purpose game engine in order to make a video game. our GAM 150 game did not need an ECS written in C to function. when I look at the code now, it&#x27;s completely unreadable—everything is strewn about in random files, tenuously connected, such that it&#x27;s a real archeological task to even figure out how the (extremely simple) core logic of my GAM 150 game even works. like I said, I really appreciate having had the experience of making terrible garbage tech, such that I could go on to learn how to do better. but it would&#x27;ve been even better if we had better instruction from professors, explaining that you don&#x27;t need any of these fancy features to make a fully-functioning video game, especially on the scale of what&#x27;s expected of a GAM 150&#x2F;200 team.I worry that going forward, the new generations of video game programmers are going to be too entrenched in thinking about things in terms of how e.g. Unreal does them, rather than what the solution to a given problem necessarily entails at the minimum level. sure, these people will be able to go onto find work in the industry at Unreal shops, but then what happens in the (admittedly extremely unlikely) event that something happens to Unreal as it did to Unity?I don&#x27;t know what DigiPen has been like in the past decade, but after I dropped out and talked to students from other game schools, it sounded like they had always, even back then, been pretty much Unity-centric—what happens to their former students now that Unity&#x27;s in the situation it&#x27;s in? do they feel cheated, like the only way that they know how to make games, the way they were taught, has now been somewhat invalidated? if they jump ship to another engine like Unreal or Godot, will they adapt, or will they still be trying to fit an Unreal peg into a Unity-shaped hole?when Zero Engine was heavily in development while I was at DigiPen, it was hugely inspiring, because Zero was a great product, and the Zero team were available to chat if you needed advice about engine development. it&#x27;s kind of a bummer to hear that nobody&#x27;s taking their GAM 200&#x2F;250 engine into GAM 300&#x2F;350... reply TrevorSundberg 17 hours agorootparentprevI heard the same thing and I really hope what they&#x27;re doing is for the best. It would have fundamentally changed my path if I didn&#x27;t get that core low level experience of building game engines. reply wahnfrieden 18 hours agorootparentprevdo you know what engine was in use or development during around 2002-2003? the engine was somewhat baked but flexible and had entry points where you drop c++ snippets in, I believe with a GUI reply sakras 18 hours agorootparentWas it a 2D game engine?

So two objects in the same scene can occupy different \"spaces\" (for physics), \"scenarios\" (for rendering), or \"worlds\" (which encapsulate a space and scenario, for both physics and rendering). Objects in these different contexts will appear in the same scene but will be separated in terms of those contexts and won&#x27;t e.g. collide with each other or be affected by forces from one space if in a different space, or be lit by lights from a different scenario. reply depressedpanda 4 hours agorootparentInteresting. What are the use cases for being able to do this? reply lionkor 4 hours agorootparentprevEverything in Godot is a scene, from actual scenes to groups of objects, etc.It makes composing and managing objects and compositions much easier than just with the tree view.Like a Unity prefab, but much better reply araes 17 hours agoprevI like the concept.

Opera only has 2 \"Uncaught (in promise)\" and both Google and Firefox have 0.There&#x27;s something comforting about the idea that Microsoft still does not trust Microsoft.

Sometimes I look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;proposals and it&#x27;s very confusing. There are the type imports proposal(years away), the almost complete GC proposal(which is apparently only for GCd languages, but not for anything browserwasm), the component model(which looks and sounds as something not for the browser use case), JS String Builtins (which will provide faster JS strings, but not DOM) and ECMAScript module integration (which will turn WASM modules into ES modules, but Web-APIs aren&#x27;t ES modules so no luck). Sometimes I read contributor interactions and it looks as if providing such functionality isn&#x27;t their priority or even in their plans, and for the majority the WASI + component model for the cloud, crypto and similar use cases are more important. reply TrevorSundberg 17 hours agoparentI really yearn for this myself. I would love to see a “pure wasm” browser where the pages are just wasm and the “browser” just provides a bunch of platform imports like WASI. I agree with you though, seems like it’s not a priority for them. One of these days… reply CryZe 17 hours agoparentprevReference types technically already allow for calling directly into the browser APIs as reference types allow wasm to pass JavaScript objects around. So if you import all the relevant web apis, you don&#x27;t really need any (almost any?) intermediate JS anymore, because you can just forward the JS objects between the individual API calls.The only real need for JS would be to initialize the wasm module in the first place. reply nullifidian 16 hours agorootparent>you don&#x27;t really need any (almost any?) intermediate JS anymoreI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. You still need JS glue code that would return these externrefs. A WebAssembly module loaded through ESM integration can&#x27;t as far as the current proposals access Web-APIs on its own. As far as I understand there is also a number performance issues related to the wasm spec itself that limit possible optimizations, making wasm second class to JS in terms of performance of WebAPI access. reply a1o 16 hours agoparentprevThe problem of pure wasm is we get a closed source web with unblockable ads. reply nullifidian 13 hours agorootparentthat ship has sailed. Minified and optionally obfuscated js is already highly annoying to decipher. The wasm spec is surprisingly high level for what should be a low level VM, and is planned to get much more high level approaching near jvm levels, and isn&#x27;t any less readable than C++ compiled to asm.js. reply wewxjfq 9 hours agorootparentStill infinitely better than WASM blobs where everything is painted on a canvas, which is un-adblockable. The experience will also be hellish, because every website will ship a 10 MB blob of half-baked things that your browser already does a million-times better out of the box. And for what? Because people think it will be faster (it won&#x27;t). reply taway1237 4 hours agorootparentI was sceptical WASM is ever going to be mainstream, but after reading your post I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the future.

The engine seems to run in a worker and render to an offscreen canvas then transfer the image data in JS to the main thread before drawing it to a canvas there. reply TrevorSundberg 16 hours agorootparentThe transfer of image data only happens when we yield inside the engine which only occurs when you hit a breakpoint in script. Otherwise we&#x27;re just rendering to the OffscreenCanvas and letting the normal flow blit it to the screen (not doing any copying).I just did some profiling on Firefox and I feel like the profiling result doesn&#x27;t quite make sense but it&#x27;s saying that the majority of time is spent calling Performance.now() from the clock calls in C++.

I think the primary difference is that this engine is a learning tool primarily, and doesn’t have any intention to compete with bigger name engines. reply hoistbypetard 20 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s been sitting on \"downloading runtime\" for a very long time.That makes me think this must be a challenge to host. What are the pain points to hosting it? reply TrevorSundberg 20 hours agoparentThe runtime is currently about 37MB, and when served with gzip it’s around 11MB compressed. Once it’s downloaded it should be cached and quickly startup. I think a lot of the challenge is going to be spent getting the binary to be smaller, or potentially breaking it up into separate individually loadable parts. reply DonHopkins 7 hours agoprevCheck out what I wrote earlier about how WAForth dynamically generates and links WASM code! By just reading the WASM documentation I didn&#x27;t realize it was possible to call back into JavaScript to dynamically create and link in WASM code on the fly, but WAForth opened my eyes to that, by compiling each FORTH word definition into a tiny little module and linking them all together. No (practical) limit on the number of modules that you can use in the same WASM app. It would be cool for a game editor app to have a visual programming language that compiles directly to WASM that way, so you can edit code at runtime.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34374057 reply damon_c 20 hours agoprevHow do I add WASD controls to the camera? reply TrevorSundberg 16 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to code up yourself, however to get you started this script checks for pressing the W key and moves forward:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;8kMTCu3Y reply damon_c 16 hours agorootparentHugely helpful, thanks!

I’d also mention that WASM isn’t tied to a browser either (despite being called WebAssembly, it’s now widely used outside of browsers). You can in fact make native executables now from a WASM binary. reply diogenes4 10 hours agorootparent [–] That&#x27;s certainly an innovation.

EU tells Apple to open everything up to its rivals William GallagherSep 26, 2023 54 Facebook Twitter Reddit European Commissioner Thierry Breton says the Digital Markets Act is just a beginning, and Apple must open up its whole ecosystem to competitors. The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) was created to target Big Tech firms like Apple, and make a fairer business environment for all comers. The DMA became law in the EU in November 2022, and became applicable from May 2023, though it is still in the process of being implemented. According to Reuters, Thierry Breton has now called on Apple to open up its hardware and software ecosystem. \"The next job for Apple and other Big Tech, under the DMA is to open up its gates to competitors,\" he said. \"Be it the electronic wallet, browsers or app stores, consumers using an Apple iPhone should be able to benefit from competitive services by a range of providers.\" Watch the Latest from AppleInsider TV Breton said this after meeting with Tim Cook in Brussels, where the Apple CEO is certain to have reiterated the company's arguments about security and privacy. \"EU regulation fosters innovation, without compromising on security and privacy,\" Breton told Reuters. Apple has not commented. Cook's trip to Brussels was not announced, and he hasn't referred to his meeting with the EU Commissioner. However, he has tweeted about meeting with Apple Store staff in the city.

The actual thing. With containers and extensions. Let Safari compete on the merits.I want the choice of being able to pay for a great app or use its \"good enough\" open source equivalent outside of the App Store.iOS is a fantastic operating system. iPhone and iPad are stellar hardware with brilliant physical UX. Apple Watch is leagues beyond anything else in its class. I will keep buying Apple stuff until I can&#x27;t anymore.But a monopoly on core system functions isn&#x27;t necessary to keep that high bar high. reply faeriechangling 17 hours agoparent>you can only run Safari on iOSApple mandating WebKit is the only thing holding v8 back from a total monopoly, while WebKit itself has no chance of being a monopoly in the forseeable future, so I doubt there&#x27;s a good anti-competitive case to be made for forcing Apple to stop doing this. It would only accelerate the monopolisation of the browser market if this happened. It would be good for consumers in the short term to allow v8 on iOS but I deeply distrust Google.Breaking the App Store monopoly there is a much stronger case for. There is a security argument for the app store, which I would accept were it not for Apple adding 43% to the purchase price of most paid applications, which is much worse for the end user than the average piece of malware. Not to mention the expenses it imposes on developers, like requiring them to maintain a subscription and buy Apple hardware. reply noirscape 7 hours agorootparentIf Blink becomes a monopoly, and with it chromium, then Google can finally be \"properly\" hit with an antitrust case over Chrome. Especially when combined with the fact the big G can&#x27;t keep directly funding Firefox to create a fake competition anymore under the new rules from the digital markets act.Google should&#x27;ve been hit with an antitrust case on Chrome years ago and their recent shenanigans with the topics api only make that more relevant, where now Google is playing gatekeeper to an already technically dubious system meant to put the spying on users directly into the browser (all because they couldn&#x27;t solve the fact that the topics api still makes fingerprinting rather easy). Eliminating the \"competition\" that Google has artificially made needs to be done though because otherwise it&#x27;s just not obviously visible. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparent> If V8 becomes a monopoly, and with it chromium, then Google can finally be \"properly\" hit with an antitrust case over ChromeV8 isn&#x27;t a monopoly in the antitrust sense, at all. Google gives away the source code to most of Chrome that allows other people to make browsers with it, and they do. Something being popular doesn&#x27;t indicate a monopoly. Microsoft could choose to make a browser engine, but they don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s not because V8 is a monopoly. reply amiga386 4 hours agorootparent> Something being popular doesn&#x27;t indicate a monopolyBeing on the standards board for \"what browsers need to do\", having the standards board under your thumb, and continually adding in requirements that only the highest spenders can afford to implement securely, that does indicate a monopoly.Embrace (web standards), extend (with a billion features), extinguish (rival browser engines) reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparentApple can afford to implement anything they want. But they clearly have a very strong business interest in not letting web apps gain all the features that native apps may have.Also, there is no legal requirement to implement every single API that the standards body specifies. The point of having standards is to make sure that _if_ a browser maker decides to provide some functionality, then they can implement the standardised API rather than inventing their own.This is a good thing in spite of the fact that it doesn&#x27;t solve other problems related to market dominance. reply Gud 3 hours agorootparentprevPlus aggressively marketing their web browser on the most popular search engine. reply marcus_holmes 7 hours agorootparentprevI think this isn&#x27;t the case.

Using a monopoly as power in another market is. Microsoft got hit because they used their monopoly in desktop operating systems to freeze out competition in the browser market and jam IE down people&#x27;s throats. The browser market being a different market than the desktop operating system market. reply tzs 2 hours agorootparent> Having a monopoly isn&#x27;t illegalCorrect. Antitrust is about monopolization. You can have a monopoly without monopolization, and you can do monopolization without having a monopoly.For example, suppose there was a small maker of farm implements, Dirty Hoes, and that one of the stores that sold Dirty Hoes hoes was Sneed&#x27;s Seed and Feed (formerly Chuck&#x27;s).Sneed&#x27;s also sells hoes made by another small company in a small town in Suffolk County New York, Hoes of Babylon.Dirty Hoes tells Sneed&#x27;s that unless Sneed&#x27;s stops selling Hoes of Babylon hoes Dirty Hoes will stop selling to Sneed&#x27;s.That could be an antitrust problem of Dirty Hoes, even though they aren&#x27;t anywhere near having a monopoly, because it could be seen as attempted monopolization. reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparentprev> Having a monopoly isn&#x27;t illegal. Using a monopoly as power in another market is.Mm.With the caveat that I&#x27;m not a lawyer, that seems like \"we gave away the source code to this engine\" might still count as abusing market dominance in one domain (browser) to support another (ads)?At least in principle. I couldn&#x27;t describe the specifics of such laws even if a lawyer helped me out. reply nordsieck 4 hours agorootparent> With the caveat that I&#x27;m not a lawyer, that seems like \"we gave away the source code to this engine\" might still count as abusing market dominance in one domain (browser) to support another (ads)?There has to be a link. How does one influence the other?I don&#x27;t think \"making sure that non-crappy web browsers exist\" is enough. reply mbreese 4 hours agorootparentThere doesn’t have to be a link… there has to be a competitive market. Giving away something that someone else sells can be anti-competitive, in certain situations. For example, if the goal of Google with V8 is to create a JS engine monopoly so that they could then start charging for it — that would be anti-competitive.If there were calls for V8 to be considered a monopoly, you’d first have to prove that there are viable competitors available and they were being harmed. And particularly — was that harm impacting consumers. Anti trust only gets involved when consumers are being harmed (usually though higher prices or lack of choice).SpiderMonkey exists and is pretty viable for many use-cases. But, the open source nature of V8 makes it hard to argue that it was really a monopoly. If Google did anything anti-competitive in V8, other developers are free to fork it, revert the change, and distribute that version. reply ben_w 4 hours agorootparentprevFor that I would ask — rhetorically because I don&#x27;t know the answer — what convinced Google to develop and advertise Chrome in the first place given that by Firefox already existed.And why they went further and made the core open source: every time I&#x27;ve been around the \"we should open source $foo\" conversation, the managers have asked, essentially \"what&#x27;s in it for us?\" reply pocketarc 4 hours agorootparent> And why they went further and made the core open sourceWorth noting that Blink is a fork of Webkit, which is a fork of KHTML, which is LGPL-licensed.

And google uses their monopoly of the browser market to give other google products an advantage. reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agorootparentprevThe browser isn&#x27;t the product. The product is the ads Google pushes through their browser. reply noirscape 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah I reworded it - I meant Blink. And no, I&#x27;d argue that just because it&#x27;s open source doesn&#x27;t change that it&#x27;s an antitrust-worthy browser. The obvious problem being the conflict of interest in developing a browser (which is meant to serve users) and an advertising platform (which is meant to serve business customers). That alone should have prevented Google from entering that field, but here we are.---In a technical sense, Chrome is a monopoly though. The development of Chrome moves at such a rapid pace that only Firefox can keep up (kind of, Firefox had to give up on anything involving PWAs to do it and they take a large sum of money from the big G for putting their search engine as the default).Similarly, just look at how many web RFCs amount to \"this was implemented by Chrome and technically a Chrome fork is a second implementation, so it can be OK stamped\", which has squeezed the market for third parties to be able to develop their own browser just by making the amount of \"required\" features so large nobody could meaningfully implement them.[0]And then there&#x27;s the utterly dismal state of the Android platform, where Google just uses their control over OEMs and the ROM to outright prevent anyone from easily replacing the System WebView (the browser Android uses to render stuff \"in-apps\", basically if you&#x27;ve ever used an app that seemingly opens external links without launching chrome, that&#x27;s the System WebView) with a non-chrome engine (basically, Google lets OEMs specify a hash on what the System WebView should be - almost all mainstream OEMs lock it to the Google implementation -or Chrome Canary which is just the same fucking browser-, leaving the only option to circumvent it to be rooting, which has its own issues and limitations).There&#x27;s no meaningful maintained alternatives to it either (Mozilla&#x27;s work on GeckoView only targets individual apps, not the system version; Vanadium and Mulch are both just Chrome forks that implement it as part of a larger custom ROM but in the end are only competition in the same way GNU IceCat is technically a competing browser - they&#x27;re openly tied to the Chromium upstream because they lack the manpower to do it on their own. The Vanadium dev also stopped anyone from using his work in the future by setting his System WebView implementation to GPLv2-only to prevent folks from forking it), since nobody wants to bother.Just being open source doesn&#x27;t prevent a company from using their leading position and size to muscle away all the competition.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drewdevault.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;Reckless-limitless-scope.... reply tzs 2 hours agorootparent> The obvious problem being the conflict of interest in developing a browser (which is meant to serve users) and an advertising platform (which is meant to serve business customers). That alone should have prevented Google from entering that field, but here we are.Considering that probably 90+% of the content that the average person uses their browser to browse to is paid for by ads, and there is no other existing business model that would currently [1] be workable to pay for creating and distributing 90% of that content, I think you&#x27;d have a very hard time making a winning legal argument that Google&#x27;s advertising platform does not serve users.[1] There are things that are workable technically, but they either require cooperation from many governments to change how they handle sales taxes or VAT because otherwise accepting micropayments from customers is a tax collecting and reporting nightmare or they require websites to sell the content through third party marketplaces that will act as the legal seller and handle the taxing so that the websites are only dealing with one potentially international relationship (if the marketplace company is not in their country). But consumers don&#x27;t want to have to have accounts with a bunch of different content marketplaces, so for this to not end up like video streaming has (Netflix, Disney+, HBO, Peacock, Paramount, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, ...) which would be a million times worse for websites we probably need to end up with at most two marketplaces which together cover pretty much everything. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentprev> In a technical sense, Chrome is a monopoly though. The development of Chrome moves at such a rapid pace that only Firefox can keep upNo - MS could too. They choose not to. Others could too, but it&#x27;s not worth it.

Also, firefox funding is for their search business, so it&#x27;s at least one level of indirection. reply scotty79 6 hours agorootparentprev> Google can finally be \"properly\" hit with an antitrust case over Chrome.What do you think google should do to avoid getting punished? What kind of action would you like to see from Google regarding the near monopoly of Chrome and Blink? reply noirscape 4 hours agorootparentBreak off Chrome into its own company that can serve it&#x27;s own interests in making a good browser that serves the user (remember it&#x27;s called the user agent because the browser must ultimately serve the user above all else) rather than serving Googles ad interests would be the right kind of action.Right now, Chrome is compromised in terms of meaningful user privacy and user security because Googles bottom line largely relies on them not making those features as good as they can, while pretending they do. They can&#x27;t just block 3rd party cookies to reduce tracking, it has to come with their Topics API so that Google can keep its ad monopoly (and that API consolidates Googles powers even more, especially considering the current implementation has Google playing literal gatekeeper over who can and can&#x27;t use it instead of solving the privacy issue that the Topics API has).For another example; WebManifest v3 was intended as a security update to the mess of v2... but it also conveniently takes a wrecking ball to adblockers (a major issue for Google the ad company) and guess what Google (the browser developer) is basically completely non-responsive about. They could respond to this and work out an actual solution, but the only thing they do is keep pushing back the permanent end date for V2 to avoid the bad PR.Finally, as for avoiding punishment; Google could do all of the above and make an agreement (with legal consequences upon violation) that the Chrome team&#x2F;subsidiary is wholly independent from the rest of Google when it comes to making executive decisions on where to take a browser. That way, they wouldn&#x27;t have to break it off and can still take in the profits&#x2F;fund the development of Chrome without it being compromised into serving Google. reply mbreese 4 hours agorootparent> Break off Chrome into its own company that can serve it&#x27;s own interests in making a good browser that serves the user That’s nice in theory, but historically, browser only companies haven’t been very successful in the market. No one wants to pay for a browser and monetizing one is a full of a big pool of dark patterns.The most successful browser engines have always been those that we tied to another source of income, namely, the OS or search. Doesn’t Firefox still get the bulk of its funding from Google?Even as a separate company, Chrome would be beholden to some external entity (likely Google search) for money, and that still carries with it the same risks as now, just formalized with contracts. reply palata 4 hours agorootparent> and that still carries with it the same risks as nowWould it, though?

Maybe overall the web tech would move slower, but I don&#x27;t think that would necessarily be bad. replyscotty79 2 hours agorootparentprevHow would Chrome company make money?

It being possible on iOS changes the equation significantly with how iOS users are typically higher value targets due to how on average, they buy&#x2F;spend more.It also gives them the opportunity to normalize per-megacorp app stores across the board instead of them always being a weird Android thing like they would be if Meta opened an App Store on Android now. reply wkat4242 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a weird iOS thing too if it happens.

How? reply shuckles 55 minutes agorootparentPicking a single sentence in a long comment is flattening. reply intended 10 hours agorootparentprevApple is not a monopoly. That is why we have contrast points - eg the Android ecosystem, to see how privacy and user centric reality is.Users are the end customers for apple. For platforms, advertisers are end customers.All arguments in this thread roll up to -- You cant have open systems with an advertiser driven economies.Until people are the end customers for platforms, as ridiculous as it may sound, Apple is the only other choice.Even MSFT has started inserting ads into Windows. Good grief. reply kaba0 9 hours agorootparentApple is a monopoly on the market of Apple apps. You can’t just hand-wave away self-created platforms, and given how absolutely important and essential mobile phones are, it’s only fair that the government gets a say there. reply pmontra 6 hours agorootparentThis but also because of the size of Apple&#x27;s market. If they sold 1000 phones per year nobody would give a f... about their commercial practices. In the USA apparently Apple is bigger than Android, so about phones Apple is a larger monopolist than Google. In the EU, not as much but still a relevant one. reply intended 3 hours agorootparentAndroid has a 66% market share in the EU, and ~55% in the US - which it gained only recently (~2021&#x2F;22). Otherwise Android has had the largest share globally.By definition, A monopoly force does not have a 33% or 50% market share. It has full control.If you want, you can switch. If you want, you can use products that are NOT locked to a vendor. You have Dropbox, you have obsidian, email - any number of tools that are not vendor locked.If you want a phone, you can take many of the comparable or superior phones in the Android ecosystem.This is being phrased as a goal for \"User Freedom\". If a user wants the freedom to have a locked ecosystem, where they are the actual paying customer, so what?Any absolutist user freedom argument has to also deal with users who dont want that freedom.If this is about meaningful freedoms, then the threat is revenue models. There is no reason the Apple ecosystem should outperform Android - yet it does. reply a-user-you-like 6 hours agorootparentprevApples market share is less than Android. Your argument is like saying Amazon is a monopoly in the kindle store.Some folks are just power hungry and like to wield force unnecessarily. reply intended 7 hours agorootparentprevThat is not the definition on a monopoly.And if the question is of \"its only fair that govt gets a say\", then its a question of what Govt says fairly.If your goal is user freedom, then Apple is the only eco system that is actually pro user, compared to the alternative (Android).In which case, Govt should be tearing into Android&#x2F;Google and all advertising driven&#x2F;invasive platforms.Govt would have to advocate that Android be out of Google&#x27;s purview, or all mobile OS dev be separated.The issue isn&#x27;t Apple. Its Economics. reply kaba0 6 hours agorootparentWe can call it “exerting their power in unrelated markets” as well. replylodovic 8 hours agorootparentprev> And lord knows actual governments, even the EU, aren&#x27;t going to enforce consumer protectionsThe EU probably has the strongest consumer protection laws. And they do enforce them. Which is the subject of the linked story. reply kaba0 9 hours agorootparentprevWhile I agree with the distinction between freedom-as-in-{anarchy, liberty), I don’t think this argument stands in case of Apple. Their OS is very secure and has a top notch sandbox - that’s the actual defense boundary on their devices. They do barely any AppStore checks.I think the optimum would be a well-hidden (like android dev mode, click 6 times on whatever option), but possible sideloading without hacks like AltStore&#x2F;7-day resigns, etc. Maybe they shouldn’t even allow other stores, just apps - as installing is a very specific permission. reply matheusmoreira 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I don&#x27;t understand it at all. It&#x27;s shocking to me to see people on Hacker News defend the trillion dollar corporation&#x27;s right to literally own their computers and their entire digital lives. We shouldn&#x27;t even have to justify these viewpoints here. reply jampekka 6 hours agorootparentJust the good old War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. reply caskstrength 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd I am perpetually baffled by people crying \"Steve Jobs phone open when???!!1\" in every such thread, so let me explain in clear terms that even most obtuse people could understand: I spent enough time removing crap like MacKeeper from my GFs&#x2F;mothers MacBooks and really _not_ looking forward to having to do the same on their iPhones. No, they don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to be tricked into installing crapware on their devices same way as I don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to cut my face with an open razor. _Real_ cool haxxors like you (as opossed to \"so-called hackers\") can buy an Android device and install whatever software they want like I did. reply matheusmoreira 9 hours agorootparent> buy an Android device and install whatever software they want like I didGood luck with that. Hardware remote attestation will fail, outing you to the corporations as someone who \"tampered\" with the device. You&#x27;ll be refused service based on that alone, from frivolous content consumption to vital banking services. reply caskstrength 9 hours agorootparentWhat does it have to do with forcing Apple to allow installing iOS software outside of their approved appstore? Manually installed FF from hypothetical non-Apple store will somehow magically pass remote attestation on iOS or what? reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentIt has everything to do with it. Computing freedom is paramount. We should be able to install whatever software we like on our machines. Therefore it follows that corporations shouldn&#x27;t be able to discriminate against us for doing so.Things like remote attestation should be illegal. reply caskstrength 8 hours agorootparentSo it is not related at all either to the article or my previous comment? Okay... reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentYour comment was essentially \"but you can exercise your freedom if you want to\". I said they will discriminate against you for exercising your freedom, robbing you of choice. \"Whatever software you want\", provided they belong in the set of software approved by Google or Apple.If you still don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s related, I don&#x27;t know what else to say. reply caskstrength 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure I have multiple apps installed on my phone that weren&#x27;t approved by either Google or Apple. reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentThen for your sake I hope they don&#x27;t find out about those apps. It is their device, after all. They don&#x27;t like it when you do things they didn&#x27;t approve of. Their methods grow ever more sophisticated. Hardware cryptography is only the latest innovation. replyshaan7 9 hours agorootparentprev> No, they don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to be tricked into installing crapware on their devices same way as I don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to cut my face with an open razorBut guess what, in the real world you do have the freedom to cut your face with an open razor. Still, you don&#x27;t see everyone using one (unless they know what they&#x27;re doing), they rather use a safe razor - they have the sensibility.I find it demeaning that we \"hackers\" assume that a certain set of people will never learn about safety when it comes to computing. They can (they did with the razor), but they certainly won&#x27;t when we give up on them. reply caskstrength 9 hours agorootparentYou conveniently skipped part of my comment where I suggested that people who want to install software from outside of corporate app stores are free to vote with their money and buy a phone that allows that? I just want to be free to continue buying safe razors and locked devices for use-cases I deem beneficial. reply shaan7 8 hours agorootparentUm, you&#x27;re making the wrong comparison. Apple can just offer a \"locked\" version of iPhone if you want that. You could buy a unlocked one for you, and a locked one for $whoever. iOS vs Android should not a safe vs unsafe argument, it should be a Gillette razor vs Philips razor argument.Also, I don&#x27;t think the only merit that iPhone brings is this so-called safety, it is also a very well engineered device. I&#x27;d like to buy one but the only thing that has held me back is how closed the ecosystem is. If the EU is able to force Apple to fix that, I might finally buy an iPhone for the first time :) reply caskstrength 8 hours agorootparent> Um, you&#x27;re making the wrong comparison.

Just buy a phone you can&#x27;t run your banking app on because they only support locked down platforms. The freedom of choice is astounding. reply caskstrength 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure my Android phone allows me to communicate with my family and local business contacts. Banking apps also work fine on it. And I even installed bunch of coolhaxxor software like WiFi scanner or a browser with real ad blocker from third-party app store! reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentHuh? Give it some time then. My banking app refuses to run if I so much as enable developer mode. WhatsApp will permanently ban your number if you use an alternative client. I have access to neither if I choose to run postmarketOS. reply caskstrength 8 hours agorootparentHow will any of these issues be solved by forcing Apple to allow side-loading? reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a necessary step. We cannot solve those issues and allow Apple to own the machine. First we must acquire the keys. Then we fight them when they discriminate against us for using them. replyrafaelmn 6 hours agorootparentprev> No, they don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to be tricked into installing crapware on their devices same way as I don&#x27;t need \"freedom\" to cut my face with an open razor.Are you suggesting we ban razors for public safety then ? reply caskstrength 5 hours agorootparentYou can buy both open razors and phones that allow side-loading right now and I suggest to keep it that way. reply diego_sandoval 16 hours agorootparentprevTo me, actual freedom, understood as being free from unjust coercion, is more important than \"user freedom\", understood as having a wide range of services and goods to choose from.In this case, the former is being attacked in order to achieve the latter. reply Daishiman 15 hours agorootparentUsers in a duopoly are getting coerced to a degree far more important to individual freedoms than the largest publicly traded corporation. reply diego_sandoval 14 hours agorootparentUsers are not being coerced.

    "originLink": "https://ariel-miculas.github.io/How-I-got-robbed-of-my-first-kernel-contribution/",
    "originBody": "Ariel Miculas Software Engineer at Cisco Blog About How I got robbed of my first kernel contribution Context Around a year and a half ago, I’ve asked my former company for some time to work on an issue that was impacting the debugging capabilities in our project: gdbserver couldn’t debug multithreaded applications running on a PowerPC32 architecture. The connection to the gdbserver was broken and it couldn’t control the debug session anymore. Multiple people have already investigated this problem and I had a good starting point, but we still weren’t sure in which software component the issue lied: it could have been the toolchain, the gdbserver, the Linux kernel or the custom patches we applied on top of the kernel tree. We were quite far away from finding the root cause. Investigating the issue After diving into the existing analysis for this issue and channeling my google-fu, I’ve had my first breakthrough: an email thread which not only described the same symptoms as our issue, but also pointed to the exact commit which introduced it. The patch that introduced the bug moved the definition of thread_struct thread from the middle of the task_struct to the end, a seeminlgy innocuous change. After debugging the issue, this is what Holger Brunck observed What I see is that gdbserver sends for each thread a SIGSTOP to the kernel and waits for a response. The kernel does receive all the signals but only respond to some of them in the error case. Which then matches with my “ps” output as I see that some threads are not in the state pthread_stop and then the gdbserver gets suspended. The low-level issue was that after interacting with gdbserver, some threads were in the wrong process state and gdbserver couldn’t control them anymore. I’ve spent 3-4 days reading commit descriptions related to the PowerPC architecture and the changes around task_struct, trying to figure out whether this issue was solved in subsequent kernel versions (spoiler: it was not). I’ve moved thread_struct thread around to determine when the issue reproduced and used pahole to inspect task_struct’s layout. I’ve used ftrace to figure out when the threads of the debugged process were scheduled and that’s how I realized this could be a memory corruption issue: the threads that were stuck were only scheduled once, unlike the other ones. I’ve originally dismissed that this could be a memory corruption issue because in the original thread it was mentioned that: the content of the buffer is always zero and does not change. So at least no one is writing non-zero to the buffer. That’s what I get for not verifying that the structure isn’t overwritten with zero bytes (always validate your assumptions). I remembered that the x86 architecture has debug registers that could be used to trigger data write breakpoints. In fact, this is how I solved a bug back in my earlier days as a software engineer. Sure enough, PowerPC also implements a similar capability with the help of the DABR register. I’ve investigated how I could use hardware breakpoints on Linux and I ended up implementing a linux kernel module based on this excellent stackoverflow answer. This allowed me to place a hardware breakpoint on the __state field to figure out who on earth writes to it. Finding the bug And that’s how I found the issue: my custom kernel module showed the stack traces from the places where the __state field of task_struct was being written to. I’ve noticed an outlier which revealed a buffer overflow in ptrace_put_fpr (used by the POKEUSER API). This led to important fields from task_struct getting overwritten, such as __state, which stores the state of the process and it’s also used by the kernel to keep track of which processes are stopped by the debugger. The cause of this overflow? Taking an index meant to be used with an array of 32-bit elements and indexing an array of 64-bit elements. There were 64 indexes that addressed the FPR, so the total addressable memory was 64 * 8 = 512 bytes. But there were only 32 entries in the fp_state.fpr array, which means that the available memory was only 32 * 8 = 256 bytes. That allowed the user (aka gdbserver) to write up to 256 bytes past the end of the array. Sending the patch upstream I’ve sent a patch to the Linux kernel security team (security@kernel.org) because I wanted to err on the safe side: a memory corruption issue that could overwrite the memory of the processes’s states could have security implications. Unfortunately, this mailing list is private so I cannot link to the original patch I sent. Michael Ellerman, the PowerPC maintainer, followed up and told me he will contact me in private to figure this issue out. I have actually sent him two patches fixing the issue: the original one that I sent to the security mailing list and another version (quite different from the first one) which addressed some suggestions received in reply to my original submission. And the latter patch was actually based on existing kernel code, which emulated PowerPC32 operations on PowerPC64 (yeah, they got the FPR indexing right). Neither of those were accepted by Michael Ellerman, and instead he implemented his own version of the fix. I told him that I would really appreciate if he could accept a patch from me, so that I could receive credit for fixing this issue and become a kernel contributor. I was also open to working with him, addressing his feedback and sending subsequent versions of patches. He said (paraphrasing): Sorry, I like my version better. If you want to be a Linux kernel contributor, here’s an issue you could fix. I found this really perplexing and insulting. Instead of getting recognized for fixing the issue, he wanted to give me more work to do. My company and I should have received proper credit for solving this issue, especially considering how much effort we put into it. I felt it was really unfair to only get a “Reported-by” tag. Here’s the purpose of the tag: The Reported-by tag gives credit to people who find bugs and report them and it hopefully inspires them to help us again in the future. Well, I certainly didn’t feel inspired to get involved with the kernel community again. On the contrary, I felt belittled and angry that my work wasn’t properly recognized. Conclusion I spent a lot of time and effort doing root cause analysis, fixing the bug, testing and validating the fix, getting feedback from other engineers at my company, adapting the fix to the latest kernel version, and sending two different patches to Michael Ellerman, the PowerPC maintainer. Instead of accepting my patch or guiding me towards a better solution, he went ahead and implemented his own fix, giving me credit only for reporting the issue (which was already reported six years prior to this). My first contribution to the kernel was a really frustrating and discouraging experience, dealing with people who do not think it’s important to get proper recognition for your work.

I’m surprised everyone thinks the maintainer is in the right here.If someone scooped up your work and took full credit for it, despite it being a collaboration (and even if miculas code was absolute garbage it was still a collaboration), that wouldn’t feel right, and you wouldn’t want to work with them again. reply alain94040 12 minutes agoparentAgreed. I see the job of an experienced maintainer as a facilitator who should bend over backward to help other people&#x27;s contributions land cleanly. The help often involves feedback on style and architecture consistency, but a sign of a great maintainer is someone who credits others, and mostly stays behind the curtain making sure everything goes smoothly. reply whats_a_quasar 1 minute agoparentprevAgreed. The maintainer can insist on writing the code that makes it into the kernel for quality purposes - that makes sense. But here the article author is a co-author of that patch.In academic publishing, this is analogous to sending a pre-print to someone, and that person then publishing on that topic listing you in acknowledgments rather than as a co-author. I get that the point here isn&#x27;t publishing, it&#x27;s kernel development, but authorship is still quite important for a professional C.V. reply Ajedi32 1 hour agoparentprevHe was credited.

These are the kind of go getter get stuff done type of individuals every company longs for. reply loeg 55 minutes agorootparentprevThe thing non-kernel people (including this guy) don&#x27;t seem to understand is that the debugging and investigation is much more valuable than the actual code fix. The author of the article and commenters here seem overfocused on the actual patch. But the valuable and hard part was identifying the issue. Reported-by gives credit for that.(Sure, in the same situation I would prefer to also be credited with authorship too. But I get it.) reply matrss 39 minutes agorootparentReported-by should go to the person who reported the issue 6 years ago. Finding the issue (again), investigating, debugging, fixing and testing that fix sounds more like a hypothetical \"Fixed-by\", or co-authorship, depending on how similar the final patches really are.Authoring the patch is often trivial once the debugging is done. Describing the debugging as just reporting is underselling it. reply jacquesm 29 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair, but before you know it you&#x27;re going to have a whole taxonomy of different kinds of contributions and there simply isn&#x27;t one for &#x27;x did RCA&#x27; and the fact that the original patch wasn&#x27;t properly signed off as mentioned in the exchange with the kernel maintainer may have been all that stood between that and another level of accreditation. Which by the way wasn&#x27;t responded to by the OP as far as I can see, even though the maintainer clearly mentioned it and the LKML list spells out that that is a requirement for accreditation. reply jxramos 12 minutes agorootparentyah, this is a sticky point. This is one of those scenarios where I put the onus on the person more familiar with the process to inform others for these sort of nuances. Its one of those information asymmetry &#x2F; familiarity problems. Maybe both were not well versed in the concept of coauthorship though to be fair and it didn&#x27;t occur to either of them not knowing what they didn&#x27;t know. reply jacquesm 4 minutes agorootparentI suspect the maintainer never properly realized how much Co-authorship or authorship of the patch meant to the contributor (given that this was their first contribution), and that was probably informed by the size of the patch, the fact that the OP used their corporate email address and the fact that the patch wasn&#x27;t ready for inclusion.One thing I&#x27;ve learned from this thread is that as maintainer of a FOSS package, especially a popular one you are always going to get yelled at, no matter what you do. People are literally calling for the maintainer to leave. CydeWeys 50 minutes agorootparentprevReporting a bug is a lot less credit than debugging and fixing a bug. He did the latter, even if his exact fix didn&#x27;t end up being the one merged into the repo.Generally most of the work occurs after a bug is reported, as it did here. reply bluGill 9 minutes agorootparentprevWhich is all the more reason to give good credit. I have to justify effort I do on company time to my boss. If I had to put in months of work on company time, that needs to be clear to my boss&#x27;s boss who may not know anything about programming but signs the check. Such people think writing code is the hard part, so it is easier to justify the costs if I&#x27;m given credit for writing code for several months (even though the code itself took a couple hours) reply FireBeyond 27 minutes agorootparentprevAnd when your fix was the actual fix, but the maintainer rewrote it stylistically? Why should the maintainer get that credit? reply kevincox 1 hour agorootparentprevI think it depends a lot on how much the final patch was based on the one he wrote. There are a few phases of solving an issue:Identified: They have found an issue and reported it.Debugged: They found the cause of the issue.Fixed: They wrote the fix.It seems that Ariel should be credited for somewhere between Debugged and Fixed. But is only explicitly given credit for the first \"tier\" of solving the problem. It would have been nice to explain a bit more the work that Ariel put in.But I agree that I wouldn&#x27;t expect an inferior (by the maintainer&#x27;s perspective) patch to be included just to give that credit. But a sentence explaining how Ariel contributed would likely be much appreciated. reply leereeves 1 hour agorootparentUnfortunately the author wasn&#x27;t comfortable sharing his patch (\"this mailing list is private so I cannot link to the original patch I sent\"), but a comment now buried deep in the discussion [1] says:> The only difference between the patch that was accepted and the one that was proposed is where the fix is. In one case it&#x27;s in an ifdef outside of an if. In the other it&#x27;s in an inner if statement. That&#x27;s it. This is a difference in style not a technical difference in the patch at all.It sounds like the author wrote the fix and the maintainer merely edited it to fit the project style.If that truly is all that was done, how hard would it have been to ask the author to quickly make that change?1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37672558 reply bluGill 1 hour agorootparentIF the patch was only edited for style or other minor issues, then the copyright remains with the original contributor. If the patch was completely rewritten from scratch and is very different then not. (linux does not require copyright attribution)If the poster wants to get a lawyer he can probably force rewriting git history to give him credit.

And this is typically how those are dealt with. To claim &#x27;unethical conduct&#x27; is one small step removed from a formal complaint about the maintainer, and which is exactly the wrong message to send here. Witch hunts like this cause good people to leave FOSS projects. The maintainer could have given more credit but chose not to, that&#x27;s the rules you play by when sending in unsolicited patches.

The original patch&#x27;s commit message says \"On PPC32 it&#x27;s ok to assume that TS_FPRWIDTH is 1\", but then includes this anyway: #define FPRNUMBER(i) (((i) - PT_FPR0) >> 1) #define FPRHALF(i) (((i) - PT_FPR0) & 1) #define FPRINDEX(i) TS_FPRWIDTH * FPRNUMBER(i) * 2 + FPRHALF(i)Sorry, just because you found this trivially fixable array mismatch doesn&#x27;t mean your buggy patch has to be accepted the way it is.The maintainer should, however, acknowledge that Miculas didn&#x27;t simply report the problem, but that Miculas investigated identified the root cause, and had his own version of almost the same simple fix.\"Reported-By\" lacks the precision to express that it was thoroughly investigated by that party, and root-caused. reply bhouston 32 minutes agoparentI agree that the maintainers work is better. But he could have just done this as a code review on the patch and ask for an update.That happens constantly for new contributors to a project and it is the proper way to do things - it teaches people and brings them up to speed.

A lot of people have this extremely idealistic view of open source but the reality is that the vast majority of patches you receive will be atrocious and you shouldn&#x27;t have to tutor every single \"potential\" contributor.

I often go through a bunch of bug reports and merge requests to ascertain how a patch will likely be treated. I have walked away from fixing quite a lot of bugs in projects as they didn&#x27;t appear to be very good to contribute to, the Linux kernel being one such example back in 2003.

For all we know there were gaps or issues with the submitted code and not accepting it was the only reasonable response.Now, the maintainer could have made this guy more welcome... but I imagine it&#x27;s quite a bit of work to get a new contributor up to speed to the point where they are consistently a net positive for the project. In any particular case you have to decide whether you want to take on that work or not, and I can hardly blame someone who isn&#x27;t getting paid for opting out of that, even if the reason is just that they don&#x27;t want to do it that day.> I was also open to working with him, addressing his feedback and sending subsequent versions of patches.That&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s important to note that that&#x27;s asking the other person to do a bunch of work that helps you, not them. You&#x27;re asking for a favor here, probably the dearest and often scarcest resource of an open source maintainer -- their time.I suspect the author failed a little test when rejecting the other piece of kernel work... who needs someone who wants you to help them work on their problems but isn&#x27;t willing to help you work on yours? reply inglor 6 hours agoprevThe linux kernel isn&#x27;t a reward and while I empathize with the OP I would absolutely prefer a better solution to maintain than one from the community. So the maintainer was well within their rights.That said, it&#x27;s so easy to just give people who contributed to the fix attribution, in Node.js we make a point of trying to give credit in release notes and add `Co-Authored-By:` to PRs where we took _some_ work people did in PRs and adapted it.When you maintain something for a while, credit often stops being important to you (you _are_ the maintainer of the area after all) so it&#x27;s hard to remember that for new contributors it&#x27;s often very important.Totally a loss for OP and that part of linux that the maintainer wasn&#x27;t more attentive to the fact sharing credit (especially when deserved like in this case) was important to OP. reply reacharavindh 6 hours agoparentI&#x27;d be pissed if I put in a lot of effort revising my contributions to a project, only to be told at the end that \"I like my version better, so go away!\".

Co-author appears to be the minimum credit. reply guenthert 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are typically multiple ways to write code to address a given issue. They might differ in aesthetics (including clarity of intend), but also performance, maintainability, extensibility and robustness. It&#x27;s not uncommon that those who wrote the code to be fixed rewrite the patch in order to improve on aforementioned properties while avoiding lengthy back-and-forth when asking for improvement of the patch. They are often in a better position to do so due to familiarity with the code, it&#x27;s history and (unwritten) development path.That is by no means plagiarism. If not communicated clearly, can however lead to disappointment of those who submitted the patch. An &#x27;inspired-by&#x27; comment would have been nice. reply fleshdaddy 1 hour agorootparentYeah it just seems like a bad strategy on the maintainers part. Seems like one of those perfect places to teach a new contributor style guides and make them more useful in the future.

Paraphrasing a source without citing it is certainly considered plagiarism in non-programming contexts (even if you think that you improved the prose style). reply jacquesm 35 minutes agorootparentA patch, by definition is a modification of an existing piece of code, in this case a very small one. Now, it is possible that copyright protection would apply to such a small piece of code in that context but plagiarism usually does not involve a perfect record (the mailing list where the patch was submitted) that states exactly where the original work was submitted, what was done to it to make it ready for inclusion as well as an admonishment that the patch was not usable because it wasn&#x27;t properly signed off.Plagiarism means that the kernel maintainer included the code and pretended that it was their original creation and nothing of the sort happened so I don&#x27;t think that word should be used in this context. Nobody doubts the OP wrote the code, nobody is saying that they did not and nobody passes it off as their own. reply foldr 27 minutes agorootparentMisrepresenting your level of reliance on a particular source is plagiarism, and is uncontroversially recognized as such in any other context. If I say that I was inspired to study a particular problem by Paper X, but don&#x27;t mention that my own paper includes several copied paragraphs of Paper X that I&#x27;ve lightly edited, then that is plagiarism.If there is a public record that makes it obvious that you&#x27;ve plagiarised, then that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not guilty of plagiarism. It just means you failed to cover your tracks.None of this has anything to do with copyright. Not all plagiarism involves copyright violations and not all copyright violations are instances of plagiarism. reply jacquesm 18 minutes agorootparentWell, for me the bar for plagiarism is apparently higher than for you, for me it is &#x27;passing something off as your own&#x27; and that never happened here. I&#x27;m open to other definitions that I&#x27;m not currently aware of. reply foldr 14 minutes agorootparentThe commit log and associated metadata misrepresent the authorship of the code.I am using the bar that you can find by googling &#x27;plagiarism policy&#x27; and reading any number of documents explaining what constitutes plagiarism in an academic context.Plagiarism is not a crime, so the kernel maintainers can choose to decide that it&#x27;s socially acceptable in the context of kernel development if they want to. jacquesm 11 minutes agorootparentI think you just relegated a very large chunk of the Linux kernel to plagiarism.PH95VuimJjqBqy 2 hours agorootparentprevThe maintainer is responsible for quality and correctness. I don&#x27;t know the specifics of this patch, but it&#x27;s absolutely not strange for a maintainer to make changes with these goals in mind.Hell, maintainers are usually more aware of broader concerns than the contributor. reply Arnavion 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t know the specifics of the patch either since OP has not linked their patch nor the final kernel commit. I don&#x27;t understand why being a private list would be a problem since they can just post their patch on their website. Maybe they&#x27;re waiting for the fix to hit mainline first.But when someone submits a patch to any of my OSS projects and I want to make modifications to it before I merge it, I either keep the original author as the Author and make myself as Co-Authored-By, or make myself the Author and keep the original author as Co-Authored-By, depending on how much change I had to make to the original patch. In either case I also have the original author review my version to get their approval of my version.The only case where I would not credit the original author at all (or only as Reported-By) is if my version had absolutely nothing to do with their patch, say they fixed the symptom in file X and I fixed the cause in file Y.Edit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37674872 found the patches.

I agree that Miculas did do the hard work by finding the cause of the issue in the first place - but he&#x27;s correctly credited as the reporter.As for the clean patch - part of the issue is that Miculas was slightly overengineering some of it with the additional macros and added noise with extra conditions on the fpidx declaration.Ellerman&#x27;s \"I don&#x27;t want to coach this rookie\" vibe is somewhat understandable given this is the security mailing list - it&#x27;s just not the time and the place to be going back-and-forth. reply loeg 50 minutes agorootparentprevEllerman&#x27;s patch also has a significantly different and more detailed commit message, which should not be ignored. reply jabradoodle 2 hours agorootparentprevAfter he did none of the hard part. reply sangnoir 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m sure other people did the \"hard part\" too for the Row hammer and Heartbleed bugs; which were even harder. All they got was credit in identifying the bugs; kernel-contributor-status is not a prize for doing hard work finding bugs. reply jabradoodle 22 minutes agorootparent* OP didn&#x27;t identify the bug, it had been reported years prior. OP identified the root cause and suggested a working fix.* What then is the hard part, if this is the \"hard part\"* What is kernel contributor status a \"prize\" for then, if not for contributing to the kernel?* Why all the focus on OP wanting recognition for the work, and 0 on the dev who merged the patch. Why not have all patches be merged by a committe&#x2F; someone who isn&#x27;t the author. replyjacquesm 2 hours agorootparentprev> There is nothing wrong with being motivated by getting credit.They did get the credit, just not for the code, and rightly so.If the goal is to fix something to be able to put kernel contributor on your resume with a mediocre contribution in order to achieve yet another goal then that&#x27;s not a good reason to be credited for the code, especially if it isn&#x27;t your work that makes it into the kernel, more so if it is posted as a security issue which get special treatment and a whole pile of extra review to make sure that the fix doesn&#x27;t introduce yet another problem.This is several levels above people that work their way into OSS projects in order to gain visibility by fixing a lot of trivial issues, clearly some work went into this. But the motivation isn&#x27;t clean and if you care more about the credit than you do about the fix then clearly you have your priorities mixed up, especially if you want to do security work where the details really matter, so props for identifying the issue, but no medal for delivering something that didn&#x27;t meet the bar for inclusion. And that last bit is where &#x27;kernel contributor&#x27; comes in. The whole &#x27;robbed&#x27; angle is an interesting one, it appears that there is a much higher perceived value than the one that is normally associated with getting an issue fixed (which is what most people would like to see). Perverse incentives are a thing and it is good to be aware of them.> The value of FOSS is fixing a problem once for everyone.No, the value of FOSS is the ability to read and modify the source code.> Linus Torvalds himself had questionable attitude at times.Whether Linus has had questionable attitude at times is immaterial: clearly he was a contributor and so is credited. This person did not contribute as of now. You see the same with YC and pretty much anything that people would like to have on their resume: the thing itself is less important than the CV mention.> have hurt for doing all the analysis, even if the patch itself got completely rewritten?That there are many more implications for being allowed to call yourself an author. The kernel contributors are doing very important work and their standards for inclusion are high. You don&#x27;t make it into that circle without adopting their standards. reply f3d46600-b66e 2 hours agorootparentI will point out that finding and root causing a bug (and perhaps writing a test) is THE contribution. Very often fixing the bug, once all unknowns have been resolved, is trivial.Many times a one line fix takes days off debugging and analysis. Seems like this was the case here, since the original bug was open for 6 years. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentAnd indeed, they received the proper accreditation for that. As well as the mailing list entries which are there for all to see. reply bitcharmer 18 minutes agorootparent\"Reported-by\" reads like: \"this person mentioned the problem to us\". In this case he did all the heavy lifting which is like 95% of the work. How is reported-by a proper accreditation? I feel like many commenters here never had to debug any complex or subtle, hard-to reproduce bugs. Either that or there are many assholes on this site. reply jacquesm 7 minutes agorootparentWell, maybe there should be a &#x27;contributed an improperly signed patch with issues&#x27; tag that would cover the situation. But in the case of mailing to a security list your general expectations should be to hope that it will be included, and hopefully speedily. disintegore 2 hours agorootparentprev> They did get the credit, just not for the code, and rightly so.They received credit for reporting the issue, which is a fraction of what they did. They provided the entire solution, full stop. The maintainer only restated it. reply jacquesm 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s because it is a tiny fix. To ask for credit as a contributor makes it seem as though that was the whole goal and that&#x27;s why the OP feels &#x27;robbed&#x27; as though this is a thing of great value that has been taken away from them.That&#x27;s not how I interpret the contents of the exchange:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mail-archive.com&#x2F;linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org&#x2F;m...Could the kernel maintainer have handled this better? Probably yes. Was the OP robbed? In my opinion, no, their work was credited and the fix is so small it doesn&#x27;t warrant elevating the OP to &#x27;Kernel contributor&#x27; which is typically reserved for more substantial contributions, not bug fixes of a few lines.Another comment has a nice middle ground in the form of the &#x27;Suggested-by&#x27; tag which I think would have been an improvement. I&#x27;ve got a little project on the go and I&#x27;m meticulous about crediting people but the context is entirely different there, nobody is going to hold up my project to claim they are a contributor on their CV so I&#x27;m fine with the kernel maintainers keeping the list of &#x27;kernel contributors&#x27; manageable. reply phendrenad2 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve been in the open-source space for very long, because this is not how it works. It&#x27;s pretty standard to work very hard to give credit (and not some silly \"reporter\" credit) to the first person to show up with a working patch for an issue (as long as they are willing to work with the maintainers and make requested changes), because it builds goodwill in the community and encourages contributions. Of course, the kernel maintainers are free to break that social compact, but it&#x27;s still \"robbing\" someone of what social norms lead one to expect. And this \"robbery\" isn&#x27;t a victimless act, either. Finding a high-complexity (and it was, don&#x27;t confuse yourself) issue and solving it is a good undertaking that shows that you&#x27;re a good developer, and also brings some spotlight to the company you represent, which can be good for recruiting and developer relations.Source: I have asked this question on HN before: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31225599 reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentBut: it wasn&#x27;t a working patch, it was mailed to a security mailing list alerting, and it wasn&#x27;t properly signed off as required for inclusion. Those things alone make the expectations for credit strange. LKML has its own set of very specific rules around this stuff. reply phendrenad2 42 minutes agorootparentOf course, this all makes perfect sense if you live inside the LKML bureaucracy. From the outside it just seems bonkers. This is why it&#x27;s important to reconsider policies that don&#x27;t make sense. reply jacquesm 23 minutes agorootparentAgreed, but OP made himself part of that bureaucracy entirely voluntarily. It&#x27;s as if I show up to a casino and start playing without familiarizing myself with the rules and the environment first. Note that the kernel maintainers are in general getting a lot of crap for doing a very large amount of work and that this sort of post that attacks a particular maintainer by name is really damaging, far more so than if the OP had never submitted their patch in the first place. reply camgunz 1 hour agorootparentprevIDK this stuff all sounds specious to me. If I envision a world where anyone who contributes Miculas&#x27; level of effort into the kernel gets into \"kernel contributors\", that world seems great to me. Linus wrote a whole new version control system, surely someone over there can figure out how to maintain a list of contributors.> To ask for credit as a contributor makes it seem as though that was the whole goalThere&#x27;s nothing, at all, wrong with this. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparent> There&#x27;s nothing, at all, wrong with this.I don&#x27;t know about that. I maintain a small project and I&#x27;ve received exactly one outside contribution, and I made sure to properly credit that. Nobody is going to send me patches in order to gain social standing. But popular open source projects are a different matter and the maintainers there are hip to the fact that people use often minor contributions to increase their standing. Now: the OP clearly went beyond that, and I&#x27;m on the same side as another commenter here in that the &#x27;Suggested-by&#x27; tag would have been the more appropriate one. But that&#x27;s hairsplitting to me and if that&#x27;s worth penning a post like this for, especially one that misrepresents the kernel maintainers words in a meaningful way then all perspective is lost. reply camgunz 1 hour agorootparent> the maintainers there are hip to the fact that people use often minor contributions to increase their standingThat&#x27;s a fair concern but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here. This isn&#x27;t someone running around correcting whitespace or documentation to pad their resume. They did a bunch of technical and mailing list research. That kind of effort is promising.> I&#x27;m on the same side as another commenter here in that the &#x27;Suggested-by&#x27; tag would have been the more appropriate oneYeah or maybe \"co-author\" or whatever (IDK anything about kernel tags). It seems pretty evident to me that Ellerman cleaned up Micunas&#x27; original patch using his kernel expertise. I&#x27;m not at all calling \"plagiarism\" or anything like that, but I am calling \"collaboration\".> if that&#x27;s worth penning a post like this for, especially one that misrepresents the kernel maintainers words in a meaningful way then all perspective is lostI&#x27;m not sure what the original private email was so who knows if it&#x27;s a faithful paraphrase, but I can forgive OP for being miffed and I could also forgive Ellerman for being irritated about being misrepresented. Someone should be the mature person here though, and--call me naive if you want haha--I&#x27;d look to the kernel dev for that. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentFor Co-developed-by status though it would require a properly signed off patch which this wasn&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s where you run into the issue of this being posted to a security mailing list for all to see: you&#x27;ve essentially started the clock on something that you no longer control and fixing the but takes priority over other niceties. reply mfru 2 hours agorootparentprevAfter how many lines of someone contributing code to the kernel are they considered to be a >kernel contributor it may be that most of the authors of such small patches have historically had a better idea of their place in the greater scheme of thingsHistorically, denying those, who went to great lengths for their contributions, even the minor bit of attention they deserved, has led at times to the castle getting torched down. reply jacquesm 58 minutes agorootparentIt pays off to have your expectations calibrated before you engage in an activity. To be named a kernel contributor on the basis of this particular patch seems to be a bit excessive (even if it had been properly signed off, which it wasn&#x27;t), of course you are entirely welcome to disagree with that.To give some perspective: there are ~30 million lines of code in the kernel and about 5K named contributors, and a much smaller set of maintainers who will accept patches, modify them, discard them, rewrite them and or merge them based on their judgment, which they generally exercise very well. reply peyton 37 minutes agorootparentAgreed the expectations are so far out of line I doubt the maintainers see a problem.

His motivation is very clear:> Around a year and a half ago, I’ve asked my former company for some time to work on an issue that was impacting the debugging capabilities in our project: gdbserver couldn’t debug multithreaded applications running on a PowerPC32 architecture.

But that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m reading, I read accusations about robbery, see words put in people&#x27;s mouths that are not backed up by the evidence and a patch that misses required bits and pieces to be accredited in the first place.What they wrote in their blog is without value after changing the nature of the exchange with the kernel maintainer to make them look like a dick when nothing of the sort actually happened. It only proves that you can&#x27;t believe what is in that article. reply JimDabell 4 minutes agorootparentHe did almost all the work in fixing a problem that had existed unfixed for six years. He figured out what the problem was and fixed it. He did this because it was causing problems at work. When he contributed the fix upstream the maintainer tweaked it a bit and merged it, with a bug report credit. The author did far more than simply report a bug. As he says – the bug was already reported six years ago (and apparently the actual reporter didn’t get credit for that). He figured out what the problem was and fixed it, but he didn’t get credit for that.His motivation is clear – he fixed the bug because it affected him. The fact that he’s pissed off for not getting credit for that bug fix doesn’t change that.> If the goal is to fix something to be able to put kernel contributor on your resumeThis quite clearly was not his goal. His goal was to fix the bug he was experiencing at work. So why are you saying otherwise?NBJack 2 hours agorootparentprev\"That circle\"? You make it sound like an exclusive club for the elite. This isn&#x27;t supposed to be a popularity contest.Linus&#x27; attitude is very material. Kernel leadership sets the stage for other contributors to do the same, good or bad. reply jacquesm 2 hours agorootparentLinus&#x27; attitude has nothing to do with it, he wasn&#x27;t part of this exchange at all. And yes, it&#x27;s an exclusive club, hence people trying to become a part of it. reply mfru 2 hours agorootparentOpen source software development is not an exclusive club. If you contribute to open source software you are an open source contributor.Stop gatekeeping. reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentSecurity patches are the last place (especially tiny ones) where you want to make a stand for proper attribution of four line patches, the rest got properly credited. Note that the OP misrepresented the nature of the exchange with the kernel maintainer and that puts their motivation about the whole thing in doubt. Nobody got robbed. OP still has contributed code, the LKML lists are proof of that and if you think that in the future every such patch should carry an automatic &#x27;Suggested-by&#x27; or &#x27;Coauthored-by&#x27; tag then you could propose that. But for now this is the maintainers call and by sending mail to the LKML you play by their rules.That&#x27;s not gatekeeping, that&#x27;s just reality, and yes, kernel maintainers are an in-group whether we like it or not. My take on that is that if I had stuff that gets included that I couldn&#x27;t care less about the attribution because what they give me is so much more than I&#x27;ll ever be able to give back. Of course everybody is welcome to their own motivations, but you send unsolicited patches with the hope that they&#x27;ll be used, if you get credit that&#x27;s great but then the patch had better be ready to run as is and preferably for something a bit more substantial. reply kaishiro 1 hour agorootparentprevIf ever I was considering contributing to a FOSS project, this comment and many others like it within this thread has firmly convinced me that it’s not worth the trouble. reply DeepSeaTortoise 1 hour agorootparentThat&#x27;s almost spot on.I&#x27;ve just barely arrived at the conclusion that I could make a change, offering minor suggestions and changes on projects I care about and then have the read someone degrading a contribution that is still \"several levels above people that work their way into OSS projects in order to gain visibility by fixing a lot of trivial issues\"And when you point this extreme ranking out as inappropriate, your comment gets vaporized.This REALLY bloody hurts reply haswell 1 hour agorootparentprev> If the goal is to fix something to be able to put kernel contributor on your resume with a mediocre contribution in order to achieve yet another goal then that&#x27;s not a good reason to be credited for the code, especially if it isn&#x27;t your work that makes it into the kernelSomeone&#x27;s desire to put \"kernel contributor\" on their resume is immaterial to the appropriateness of receiving that badge. \"Mediocre\" is a judgement you&#x27;re projecting here, but we don&#x27;t have evidence that the code was mediocre. And even if it was mediocre, most software goes through iterations, the first of which is almost always a mess. If the code he wrote was directly responsible for the code the maintainer wrote, there&#x27;s a case to be made that credit is still due even if not a single line of the original code made it into the codebase.\"You didn&#x27;t type the exact line of characters that made it into GitHub so therefore you did not contribute\" is a very limited view of the whole series of interactions and investment of human capital that ultimately led to the fix.> But the motivation isn&#x27;t clean and if you care more about the credit than you do about the fix then clearly you have your priorities mixed upThis is projection again. When you don&#x27;t receive credit for your work and get upset about it, it does not imply that the only reason you did something was for the recognition. If you get passed up for a promotion at work because a coworker lied and took credit for your work, you&#x27;re allowed to be pissed about that, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that you don&#x27;t deserve a promotion because you worked hard to get a promotion. I don&#x27;t get the logic here at all.I agree that if the only reason someone contributes is to play a status game, that can lead to some questionable behaviors. But there&#x27;s no evidence that this is the case here.> No, the value of FOSS is the ability to read and modify the source code.There is no singular attribute that makes up the \"value of FOSS\". Reading and modifying source code are valuable, but not exclusive to FOSS. The shared value of contributed fixes is also a major benefit of FOSS. FOSS is many things.> This person did not contribute as of now.I cannot imagine how you could conclude that the author did not contribute. If your definition of contribution is limited to \"lines of text checked into a repo\", perhaps you&#x27;re correct, but this is an extremely limited view and incomplete picture of the nature of open source contribution.The bug was around for many years. Would the code that did make it into the kernel have been written in the same timeframe if the author had not submitted their own solution?There could have been many very good reasons not to include the author&#x27;s code, and I&#x27;m not arguing against that. But it seems extremely disingenuous to claim that the author did not contribute quite a bit to this fix. reply jacquesm 59 minutes agorootparent- the patch was missing a required element if the author wanted to be credited in the first place- the patch was incomplete- the patch was mailed to a mailing list that has a different set of priorities than the patch submitter assumedThe author did get credit though and that was for the 98% or so of the work they did. And finally, the LKML will - presumably forever - document his contribution in all its glory.Anyway, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to see eye to eye on this one, in my experience nothing out of the ordinary happened here. Maybe that&#x27;s wrong and it needs to be addressed but I would have picked a different hill for that battle. reply DeepSeaTortoise 1 hour agorootparentprevMy comment didn&#x27;t survive long at all, yet I still recommend giving it some serious thought.> This is several levels above people that work their way into OSS projects in order to gain visibility by fixing a lot of trivial issuesAs someone just getting started with but a tiny OSS footprint and grade care to not step on anyone&#x27;s toes, this is a deeply unfair statement. reply UncleMeat 1 hour agorootparentprev> There is nothing wrong with being motivated by getting credit.While in this case there isn&#x27;t a big problem, \"motivated to commit to OSS projects for credit\" causes loads of aggravation in general.

Someone else reviewed my code, made some changes, but my name was on the commits. I was happy that someone else took the time to make my code better and at the same time, keep my name on it. reply shkkmo 57 minutes agorootparentAs has been mentioned elsewhere if this had been submitted via the standard process, something more like that might have happened.However, this was submitted to the security mailing list which is optimized for quick, precise fixes, not for teaching new contributors how to adhere to coding standards. reply FireBeyond 5 minutes agorootparentThis methodology also has the side effect of \"new contributor has security fix but can&#x27;t contribute it because they need to be \"taught\" on non-security issues first.\" reply shortcake27 5 hours agorootparentprev> Their work needed this. The company needed this to work better, and they deserve the credit for doing the work. This is not open for discussion in my opinion.Why is it not open for discussion? I can’t just fill in a pothole or cut my neighbours grass and expect credit and&#x2F;or compensation. OSS isn’t common property. You can’t just do whatever you want and expect to receive credit.Yeah, their work needed a fix and they got a fix. That’s already a better than average outcome. reply bayindirh 5 hours agorootparentFree software is common property. This the rule 0. It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s. This is why four freedoms exist, and The Kernel is GPLv2. i.e. Free Software.Compensation and credit are completely different things. Credit is not compensation. It&#x27;s an answer to question \"Who did this?\".He didn&#x27;t do whatever he want. He was experiencing a problem, he traced, researched it, debugged it, fixed it, and submitted a patch to The Kernel.If that was only something \"whatever he wanted\", the patch would be shot down. The bug is accepted&#x2F;confirmed on The Kernel side, his patch is being reviewed and deemed \"stylistically unacceptable\", the reviewer&#x2F;maintainer wrote his own version, and by pushing the fix w&#x2F;o attributing him, he effectively claimed that he did all the work from discovery to patching, incl. everything in between.The maintainer didn&#x27;t have to accept the patch per se. He could have just written \"This bug is discovered, dissected and fixed by $THE_PERSON. Patch is implemented and committed by me. Thanks a lot, $THE_PERSON!\".This is basic human decency. I have my name on many bug reports, either reporting them, or providing more information leading to solution of the bug. I have a couple of patches here and there, and I experienced something similar from another prominent project people interact with every day, but I said that \"mneh, whatever\".The author certainly didn&#x27;t because the treatment he got is really bad, and good for him publicizing this, because these kind of people needs to be known. Well, there might be miscommunication and the story can be completely different, but starting the discussion from somewhere is healthy. reply shortcake27 4 hours agorootparent> Free software is common property. This the rule 0. It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s. This is why four freedoms exist, and The Kernel is GPLv2. i.e. Free Software.Just because something is free, it doesn’t make it common property. Being able to use the kernel and modify _your own copy_ is not the same as the kernel itself being common property.

He could have just written \"This bug is discovered, dissected and fixed by $THE_PERSON. Patch is implemented and committed by me. Thanks a lot, $THE_PERSON!\".That’s basically what happened, yeah? The author got credit for reporting it. reply bayindirh 4 hours agorootparent> The four freedoms don’t grant us permission or rights to alter other people’s copies of the software, so those copies are not common property.Of course, but accepting a bug, giving feedback on a submitted patch to be included in the kernel is openly saying \"We&#x27;re willing to accept this, but you need to polish this and that\", which the author did.In practice he got the permission to modify their copy.> That’s basically what happened, yeah? The author got credit for reporting it.No, definitely not. They got a \"reported-by\" tag, which means \"the author told me that something is not working, so I did all the work to find why, did all the work to solve, did all the work to implement, did all the work to commit.\"In reality, the author found, debugged, solved and patched the problem. The maintainer didn&#x27;t like the style, pushed his version, and claimed that all work is done by him, except hitting his proverbial foot to a proverbial stone while walking (i.e. discovering the bug). reply shortcake27 3 hours agorootparent> In practice he got the permission to modify their copy.I wouldn’t consider it common property if permission is required. It seems like our definitions of common property differ, but I’m not sure there’s any value in trying to align ourselves on this.> No, definitely not. They got a \"reported-by\" tag, which means \"somebody told me that something is not working, so I did all the work to find why, did all the work to solve, did all the work to implement, did all the work to commit.\"Got it. Yeah I agree this is not the same. However, I still stand by my original stance which is that no one is owed anything, especially when they do something no one asked them to do. reply bayindirh 3 hours agorootparent> I’m not sure there’s any value in trying to align ourselves on this.Same here.> I still stand by my original stance which is that no one is owed anything, especially when they do something no one asked them to do.I understand your point, but nothing is mandatory in Free Software. However, this is not about internet points, but it&#x27;s human decency with consequences.Strip the event from The Kernel and computer domain, this is plain rude, unjust and unethical. The author says this, and I concur.First, we need to do better as humans. This is the lesson. replyghosty141 6 hours agoparentprev> you asked a maintainer to accept an inferior fixWhy is the fix by the author inferior? By all we know it could even be better. Not taking sides, just pointing out that your response seems kinda biased against the author.> Also, the only reason you put so much effort into this was to fix your own problemIsn&#x27;t this the case with most problems? Fix the problems that impact you first, then other ones. That&#x27;s completely normal. reply sshine 6 hours agorootparent> Why is the fix by the author inferior?It very often happens in FOSS that a contribution is well-intentioned, but doesn&#x27;t match all qualities of the project, and asking them to fix it vs. rewriting wastes a lot of time. I&#x27;ve seen this pattern several times before: First-time contributor delivers patch, reviewer thinks \"The idea is great, but it&#x27;s faster if I just rewrite it rather than give feedback.\"Consequence is, first-time contributor will not contribute to this project again.FOSS maintainers can learn some pedagogy here.I tried having a patch rejected only to see the maintainer rewrite my patch that introduced bugs. reply amiga386 3 hours agorootparentOnce, I learned that someone wrote a \"security patch\" for another project that embeds mine. They focused solely on the part where their fuzzer caused a crash, they wrote a patch that, in their mind, fixes exactly the problem they found. But the patch made no sense - it added a check mid-loop for something which was an invariant. The actual wrongness was in an entirely different file, it was passing invalid initial values, and checks needed to go there instead. I fixed the issue in my project correctly, and in the changelog I gave credit to the original person for both discovering the security flaw and providing a patch... that I didn&#x27;t use.In another situation, I was using an emulator and it didn&#x27;t read a file correctly. I read its source code for the first time, I fixed it, in what I thought was the right way. I supplied the bug report and the patch. The maintainer thanked me and fixed it a different way - a way that wasn&#x27;t obvious from their code, but was a better fit.In another situation, I found a library that sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn&#x27;t accept values that other libraries do (the standard they&#x27;re all aiming for says the value is \"implementation defined\" so this is technically allowed but it annoys me). I raised a bug. I offered a patch. The maintainer had a bug up his ass about this particular value and told me he was changing nothing. Not much I can do about that.In conclusion:FOSS maintainers aren&#x27;t endless fonts of personal validation for you. Some of them don&#x27;t even want contributors. They already gave you the software for free, _and_ the legal means to fix it yourself. You can patch it, you can fork it. Your fork might be better than theirs!They might accept your bug report. They might review your patch. They might accept your patch. They might mentor in you how their project works. They might devote all their time to contribution management and never have time to write their own project. Each of these takes their time and energy. They don&#x27;t owe you any of that. Not every project is a popularity contest, not every project wants your help. This is all OK. reply NBJack 2 hours agorootparentIt isn&#x27;t sustainable, and it&#x27;s a sign of bad leadership waiting for the proverbial (or literal) \"hit by a truck\" principle to show up.You are correct in that it is the maintainers&#x27;s choice. No doubt about it. But now, a potential contributor who invested a significant amount of time in a problem clearly nobody else had solved up to that point, was snubbed. The work was capitalized on, used as a foundation for a solution, and not even a comment giving credit was given.This sends a terrible message not only to them, but to future contributors as well on a project that needs a new generation of talent to perpetuate it. This isn&#x27;t just any OSS project; this is the Linux kernel, something millions if not billions rely on. Scale up this behavior, and it won&#x27;t end well. reply derangedHorse 4 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a stupid approach to maintaining a project. A maintainer should want to make their project the best it can be, and the best way to do that is encouraging contributors to keep contributing. If they can&#x27;t do that, their work deserves to die and yield way for better managed repos&#x2F;forks.I have a similar experience with a bug fix I submitted and the decision to delay my fix to literally change the whole architecture of the project left a bad taste in my mouth. After that I stopped contributing to the project and just kept my fixes to myself.It&#x27;s especially annoying when the maintainer asks for help and pulls this. Architecture changes after proposing small fixes to projects has been a somewhat common occurrence for me. reply catiopatio 3 hours agorootparentLinux seems to be doing just fine.Accepting drive-by patches carries an enormous cost. It’s very common to need to rewrite them substantially.Regardless, this individual received a reported-by credit. That’s more than adequate. reply derangedHorse 3 hours agorootparent> Linux seems to be doing just fine.\"just fine\" is not what we aim for. \"just fine\" is probably what they thought of the OpenSSL library before heartbleed.> Accepting drive-by patches carries an enormous cost. It’s very common to need to rewrite them substantially.Sure but it sounds like you&#x27;re making a generalization about a specific instance you know nothing about. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be an enormous cost detailed by the maintainer in the email thread. Just that he&#x27;d rather gatekeep the project and rob someone of the opportunity for contribution. reply catiopatio 3 hours agorootparentLinux is doing more than “just fine” and is in no way similar to OpenSSL.This individual wasn’t robbed of the opportunity for a contribution. He received credit for his contribution via a reported-by flag. It’s a tiny patch — all the work was in identifying the bug, which is what he received credit for.He did something valuable, and has every right to write it up, but clearly has limited understanding of the development process he’s participating in. It was wildly inappropriate of him to of put anyone on blast in response to this. replyarghwhat 6 hours agorootparentprev> Why is the fix by the author inferior?The maintainer deemed it inferior and they are the one to decide. By posting on a security list, the maintainer went out of their way to give the issue critical priority, speedy processing and extra critical correctness review. We all like the feeling of credit, but this context is very important.It&#x27;s too bad the proposed fix wasn&#x27;t good enough, but getting the issue resolved is always first priority, above getting claim to the fix. reply lr1970 5 hours agorootparent> We all like the feeling of credit, but this context is very important.Exactly, this is why a field \"co-authored-by:\" is a nice middle ground that allows for providing partial credit to the original author while maintaining maintainer&#x27;s freedom to rewrite the whole damn thing. reply phendrenad2 1 hour agorootparentprev> the proposed fix wasn&#x27;t good enoughThat hasn&#x27;t been proven, we need to see the patches. reply nurettin 5 hours agorootparentprevI think the maintainer&#x27;s post mentions that he solved the problem by making a special case for 32bit instead of introducing conditionals and macros, which I assume was what the reporter had. reply glitchc 2 hours agoparentprevSorry, you&#x27;re way off base, in particular with the especially snarky last paragraph. If the effort up to the point of the patch was used, then the effort has value and an acknowledgement is necessary. Taking the work without attribution is tantamount to plaigiarism.Could you tell us which open source projects are yours so that we, as a community, can avoid contributing to them? We don&#x27;t want to support this type of behaviour. reply orra 6 hours agoparentprev> It seems like they’re only interested in OSS when a) they get creditThat&#x27;s incredibly reasonable. Not crediting them is plagiarism.Moreover, even most permissive open source licenses require attribution. reply lamontcg 6 hours agorootparent> Not crediting them is plagiarism.not if it is a substantially different fix. reply rootlocus 6 hours agoparentprev> In other words, you asked a maintainer to accept an inferior fix just so you can put “kernel contributor” on your resume.He asked to accept \"a patch\" not \"the patch\". You left out the next sentence: \"I was also open to working with him, addressing his feedback and sending subsequent versions of patches.\" reply arghwhat 6 hours agorootparentThe thing is, working with the contributor to guide them to write a specific patch entirely different from what they did is a lot of work, and quite frankly really awkward for both parties. And at that point, it is no longer the contributors patch. The maintainer authored it in its entirety, and the contributor slapped their name on it.It should also be noted that by sending to security@, you trigger a machine optimized for getting fix merged fast to protect the user base - not one optimized for teaching new contributors. reply jacquesm 2 hours agorootparentThis is exactly the problem. By doing this with a security issue you are essentially going to have to be happy to see the problem fixed, regardless of whether or not it has your name on it because the maintainer has more to do than to tutor you until you &#x27;get it right&#x27;. There are other more suitable venues for this. reply darkwater 6 hours agorootparentprev> It should also be noted that by sending to security@, you trigger a machine optimized for getting fix merged fast to protect the user base - not one optimized for teaching new contributors.This is the crux of the issue, and that generated a mismatch of expectations vs reality. If it went through LKML I&#x27;m pretty sure someone would have guided him to have a patch accepted and fully authored by OP.As an external observer, however, I empathize and sympathize with OP. reply armada651 6 hours agoparentprevProper attribution is actually important though from a licensing standpoint. Contributors publish their patches under the GPL, but they retain the copyright.If an OSS project ever needs to change the license they will need to seek permission from each contributor. You can&#x27;t relicense a project if you have some code that&#x27;s submitted without proper attribution to the actual copyright holder. reply yosef123 6 hours agoparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t matter what the intent behind the fix is, even if it is 100% for personal gain. In my opinion, it should be treated fairly, like any other commit and given credit where credit is due. reply praash 6 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s as if people have work to do and can only spend their paid time in OSS fixing problems blocking their work.Having done all the debugging work and figuring out a way to fix it, it&#x27;s a bit nasty of the maintainer to make a \"better version\" of it and rudely tell them to be \"more useful. Basically it&#x27;s the same as accepting the contribution and refactoring it afterwards.If the author \"only wanted Linux street creds\", without the context of a problem, they could have searched for an easy issue to fix and contribute on that. No, wait, now you&#x27;d consider that an act of selfless OSS contribution, fixing random problems not related to you! reply joshuaissac 6 hours agoparentprev> You seem to have no interest in fixing other problems (which you were given an opportunity to do).Based on what happened the first time, fixing other problems may have led to the same outcome again. reply shortcake27 6 hours agorootparentIf someone is more interested in receiving credit than fixing bugs, OSS might not be the best place to hang out. reply m-p-3 4 hours agorootparentWhy not? OP identified a problem that affects everyone and inplemented a fix. Maybe the original fix wasn&#x27;t as optimized as it should be, but they deserve proper recognition nonetheless. In the OSS world, recognition and reputation are important. reply throeaaysn 6 hours agorootparentprevHe was interested in fixing the bug. That&#x27;s enough. Your logic is flawed. reply bakugo 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure the OSS ecosystem would be better for everyone if every project started removing the names of contributors from the commit log and replacing them all with the name of the primary maintainer. Everyone loves it when they dedicate time out of their life to improving something and it ends up under someone else&#x27;s name, after all. reply JodieBenitez 6 hours agorootparentYeah, it&#x27;s baffling to me how many people here have little consideration for the recognition of work. I sincerely hope these people never ever attempt a management career. reply ylyn 9 minutes agorootparentI can&#x27;t believe people are trying to extrapolate this situation into how someone would act as a manager in a company.Can&#x27;t you see that the kernel has its own conventions and practices that are entirely different from typical corporate practices? reply cp9 2 hours agorootparentprevthis thread is *wild*, everyone is jumping down the OPs throat for the crime of doing a ton of work while receiving zero credit for it and having the gall to be upset about it reply jacquesm 2 hours agorootparentHe did a ton of work and got credited for it. The four line patch isn&#x27;t a ton of work once you&#x27;ve done the RCA and besides it required work by the maintainer to get it to pass. And he changed the essence of the interaction with the maintainer, who isn&#x27;t going to hang around to teach a newcomer how to properly submit a patch in a cycle of back-and-forths (of which there were already plenty) in a security issue. reply cp9 1 hour agorootparent> The four line patch isn&#x27;t a ton of work once you&#x27;ve done the RCA and besides it required work by the maintainer to get it to passthe debugging *is* the work! the work for which he went uncredited, that&#x27;s the crux of the whole thing. he got a Reported-By which just means he ran into a bug and told someone about it, not that he root caused it, wrote a patch and bothered to submit it. reply ylyn 13 minutes agorootparentNo, that&#x27;s not what \"Reported-By\" means. The kernel community has different conventions.This entire HN comment section is ridiculous with everyone acting as if the author wrote an entire subsystem and someone else took attribution.The author here figured out a bug and suggested a fix. It happens that they conmunicated their fix in the form of a patch, but that happens very regularly in kernel land.In the end the author got a Reported-By, which is entirely appropriate for what happened. If the maintainer accepted the author&#x27;s patch as-is or with minimal modification then yes, they should get Author attribution. But the patch that was taken was substantially different. jacquesm 2 minutes agorootparentWhat is interesting about this whole thread is that apparently a whole raft of people are ready to string up the kernel maintainers for doing what they&#x27;ve been doing for years rather than to stop to question whether the first time contributor may have a communications issue or a different set of expectations than that which is the norm for a project that has been going for a couple of decades.Weirder still because all of this has been done in the open for all of that time, it&#x27;s not as if how the Linux kernel is maintained is a secret. jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentprevReported-by is the normal response for this kind of patch, 1000&#x27;s of examples in the kernel mailing lists.This whole thing tastes to me like a pay-off for an unwanted gift, you don&#x27;t go into this sort of an exchange on a security mailing list expecting kernel contributor credit for fixing a bug. That&#x27;s just not how it works. Maybe it should work like that but it simply doesn&#x27;t. OP had pre-set expectations and those were found to be in the wrong, nobody got &#x27;robbed&#x27; and misrepresenting the exchange to one that makes the kernel maintainer seem like an asshole when that wasn&#x27;t at all how it went down makes me feel even less good about the whole thing.Reported-by ranges the gamut of &#x27;I ran into this bug&#x27; to &#x27;I found this issue and here is my patch, which I hope is useful to you&#x27;.If you want to negotiate credit rules for 4 line patches up front you are of course welcome to do so but keep in mind that maintainers can and do accept patches, rewrite them and contribute them under their own name (and their responsibility), especially security patches. reply JodieBenitez 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t think the number of lines is relevant. A patch is a patch and the author should be credited as such.> Maybe it should work like thatDefinitely reply ylyn 12 minutes agorootparent> A patch is a patch and the author should be credited as such.But the patch was not taken. The maintainer fixed it a different way. So credit is given for reporting the issue and suggesting a fix, and that is what is represented by the Reported-By. Is that so hard to understand?shortcake27 5 hours agorootparentprevThis isn’t even remotely close to what I said, and I can’t even see how it could be misinterpreted so badly. Did you reply to the correct comment?If receiving credit is your primary motivation, over actually solving problems that affect people other than yourself, I don’t think that’s a great attitude towards OSS. I’m genuinely surprised this is even considered a hot take. reply throwaw12 6 hours agoparentprev> It seems like they’re only interested in OSS when a) they get credit, and b) for only fixing problems that affect them.(a) so why it is okay for companies to sponsor events and use it as a marketing, but not okay for people doing same?(b) what&#x27;s wrong if people want to help fixing problems when they get impacted? isn&#x27;t it good that they are not demanding someone else to fix, but giving a help? reply shortcake27 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is the combination of the two. Ie, “I’ll only contribute on problems that affect me personally and then only if I get credit”. I’m not convinced this mentality is productive in the OSS community. reply rand_r 4 hours agorootparentBased on what? Discounting credit as motivation is a bit naive and motivation is the only way shit gets done. reply VagabundoP 5 hours agoparentprevNothing wrong with those motivations at all. The maintainer should be fostering new contributors who are doing all this work, who cares if they just want the label. Is the work good or not is all that matters.And, if getting your code into the Kernel is the only way you get that label then that&#x27;s a shit system, all the testing and writing solutions \"contributes\" to the final code, its like the 90% you don&#x27;t ever see. reply JodieBenitez 6 hours agoparentprev> It seems like they’re only interested in OSS when a) they get credit, and b) for only fixing problems that affect them.So what ?

Enhanced Browsing with Safari In Safari, profiles keep browsing separate between topics like work, school, and more so users can quickly switch between them. Private Browsing gets even better with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track users — Private Browsing windows become locked when not in use and known trackers are blocked from loading. Safari users can also now add any website to the Dock as they would with an app, complete with a simplified toolbar and notifications for an app-like experience. An Immersive Gaming Experience With the power of Apple silicon, tens of millions of Macs can run demanding games with great performance, long battery life, and breathtaking visuals. macOS Sonoma improves the gaming experience even further with Game Mode, providing more consistent frame rates and dramatically reducing input and audio latency with wireless game controllers and AirPods. Game Mode works with any game, including recent and upcoming Mac games like DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR’S CUT, Stray, Layers of Fear, and SnowRunner. Additional macOS Sonoma Updates Notes: Users can view PDFs and scans of presentations, assignments, research papers, and more right inside Notes. They can also create links from one note to another to relate ideas and content. Passwords: A set of passwords can now be shared among a group. Everyone in a group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date, and since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it’s end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, the one-time verification codes received in Mail will now autofill in Safari, making it easy to securely log in without leaving the browser. Messages: Search filters and swipe to reply enhance everyday messaging, while all-new Live Stickers can be created and synced across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Reminders: Intelligent grocery lists in Reminders streamline weekly trips to the store by organizing lists into sections and arranging them horizontally using a new column view. Keyboard: Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model that improves accuracy. A refreshed design makes corrections easier to fix and inline predictions quickly finish sentences. Dictation brings next-level speech recognition and the ability to move fluidly between voice and typing. Screen Sharing: A new high performance mode in the Screen Sharing app delivers incredibly responsive remote access over high-bandwidth connections — enabling creative professionals to accomplish their work remotely.

Some of the major updates have meaningful changes to the underlying OS (gatekeeper, SIP, etc.), but others - like this one - are primarily changes to frills like Messages, Notes, Safari and other Apple-native apps that I don&#x27;t even use.I have no problem with Apple bundling these apps and making them work seamlessly together, and I don&#x27;t even mind that they&#x27;re all updated simultaneously (except for Safari, which I wish I could update independently without relying on the \"Technology Preview\" beta channel). But I do have a problem with upgrading my entire OS and disabling the new bloatware features just because I want to keep auto-updates enabled. I used to delay updating and then would end up way behind, which is why I enrolled in auto-update. But now it feels like I&#x27;m being held hostage to their update schedule.And for what benefit? There are hardly any useful OS-level changes in this release, but there are a bunch of new features I&#x27;ll need to disable (while hoping the next auto-update doesn&#x27;t break my external monitor), all powered by freshly written code contributing to an expanded attack surface. If I had my way, then I&#x27;d take the OS updates and skip all the apps. Keep the attack surface small while still meaningfully improving the core. I don&#x27;t care about the rest. reply aeyes 16 hours agoparentYou know what would be even better? If you could reliably uninstall all this junk or not even install it at all.Every time I hit some button on my keyboard and the Music app opens asking me to create an account I am reminded how hostile all commercial operating systems are. reply amatecha 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s interesting, I&#x27;ve been using OpenBSD for the past couple years and it has _not once_ enraged me the way Windows and Mac do. I still use Windows for work, and own a ton of Macs (probably getting close to ~30 by now), but OpenBSD is the OS I use for most general computing stuff.I mean, I&#x27;m using a GUI that is really primitive by comparison to Win&#x2F;Mac (i3wm) but it&#x27;s actually great. Extremely fast, efficient, and stays out of my way. There is literally no mechanism in the OS to pop up a notification or bounce an icon or blink anything at me. It couldn&#x27;t interrupt me and piss me off even if some piece of software wanted to. It&#x27;s amazing. Nothing updates on its own, and the OS runs very very few services or other background stuff -- basically only whatever I have explicitly configured and enabled. Again, awesome. I&#x27;m easily aware of every single process that runs on this machine, and if there&#x27;s one I don&#x27;t know about, there&#x27;s comprehensive documentation about it, including how to configure it. That&#x27;s honestly effectively impossible for someone using Mac or Windows.Oh, I just installed a security patch in about 20 seconds. Open terminal (winkey->enter), \"doas syspatch -c\", type pass, see there&#x27;s a patch, \"doas syspatch\" to apply it, done in 2 seconds. Once I reboot the newly-patched kernel is active. There is full documentation of the patch, including why it&#x27;s needed, how the patch resolves the issue, and a diff of the patch is included. reply reacharavindh 9 hours agorootparentI love OpenBSD…… as a server particularly as a DNS or a network gateway with pf as a firewall.But, I cannot fathom how using OpenBSD on a Desktop&#x2F;Laptop for personal computing would NoT enrage me everyday. The things I’d do on my personal computer :1. Browse all bloated modern websites using a modern web browser - Firefox2. Work with photos(personal) - edit them, crop them to share with someone, markup screenshots to put in docs etc.3. Use PDFs without worrying about formats, markup on them as needed, fill forms on PDFs.4. Media - playback audio and video. Without worrying about whether I have the right codecs or file formats.Wouldn’t OpenBSD make me constantly fight against its opinionated safety first way of doing things? Sure, one can run Firefox on OpenBSD, but would it play YouTube and Netflix without making me pull my hair?I can install ffmpeg, relevant codecs, PDF tools, Darktable or other Unix friendly photo tools, but wouldn’t that be a constant fight and tweaking to keep them running? reply baz00 9 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t touched OpenBSD for a few years if I&#x27;m honest but one of the things that did not enrage me about it was that it didn&#x27;t nag me to change anything once I&#x27;d got it working properly. I suspect that&#x27;s part of it. There is a clear separation of OS and applications. Regarding all the other stuff I remember it mostly just worked. But of course that is within the realms of the particular package actually working in the first place, which is variable probability.As for myself I got lazy and just use Windows 10. It doesn&#x27;t enrage me if you turn off all the cloud shit, treat it like a file manager&#x2F;window manager shell and run all your open source stuff on it. Again that works because there&#x27;s a clear separation of OS and applications.When you start mixing the two (hello Linux) it&#x27;s where you get problems. I think snaps were an attempt to solve some of that (badly). reply walteweiss 8 hours agorootparentOn Linux, I enjoy the idea that all the software can be interchanged. So there is no separation between the system and user installed software. For me, it’s difficult to grasp the minimalism of those other systems. When you clearly have your system as a rock that you cannot modify. I have very little experience (some theoretical and none practical) with BSDs, but it pains me there is a base system for macOS with an absolutely unused and not needed software, like Chess. reply reacharavindh 8 hours agorootparentYou can install *BSDs with only the things you want. Same like you can on Linux. However, the question of default packaging holds on both sides.Trying installing the default .iso of Fedora workstation or Ubuntu-latest and see all the things Gnome brings along.. Maps, Photos, IM client, even a bundled browser (Evolution or something) that is based on Firefox but dependednt on the few Gnome packagers to keep up to date(instead of just letting the user download Firefox on their own or shipping the latest firefox).Even Archlinux, if you install Gnome-desktop, you get all the cruft. You need to explicitly find a way to install just the minimal gnome desktop without all its apps.OpenBSD however, for a server usecase, comes with a very cohesive, sane set of tools carefully maintained by the folks who ship OpenBSD. If anything, they are very conservative about adding stuff to that ecosystem. reply jefftk 5 hours agorootparent> even a bundled browser (Evolution or something) that is based on FirefoxThe Gnome web browser is based on WebKit (Safari) not Gecko (Firefox): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GNOME_Web reply wyclif 2 hours agorootparentprevre: Arch Linux.

With the difference I have no practical experience with BSDs yet (was eyeing FreeBSD for a while now), so I use very minimal barebones Arch Linux installation with sway wm. Why had you chose OpenBSD? reply gnicholas 13 hours agorootparentprevOh man, it gets worse than that. After updating to iOS 17 the other day, I said to my phone \"play OverCast\" (my podcast app). It used to start playing from that app. This time, it started playing a band called Overcast, and told me I had just started a 7 day free trial of Apple Music.

Jeebus. reply dncornholio 5 hours agorootparentprevHow is this \"It gets worse\"?iOS has to assume what you mean with play OverCast. Maybe there are other people that wanted the device to play the band? This is such an edge-case which is easily solved by further specifying your prompt. reply viraptor 4 hours agorootparentIt knows a) whether you have overcast installed and when was it last used, b) whether you added the overcast band to your favourites or ever explicitly played one of their songs. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some tiny section where the the extra prompt would be useful, but they could be so much better than that. reply i_don_t_know 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not just playing the wrong band &#x2F; app. It&#x27;s signing you up for a subscription. You still have time to cancel before you have to pay. But it&#x27;s one more thing you have to worry about now.It should have confirmed that you&#x27;re fine with subscribing if that&#x27;s what you have to do to listen to the band.

Apple did a wonderful job with M1&#x2F;M2, but on the software side, I have mixed feelings. Xcode is a mess, and Swift UI is not a complete replacement for Cocoa.And on the OS side, I feel like Apple is creating features that I instantly disable because they do the exact opposite of what I want. reply bingemaker 10 hours agorootparentXCode is refusing to install.

No errors, it just stopped installing somewhere around 90%. Plenty of free disks space and RAM. reply Hammershaft 9 hours agorootparentprevApple&#x27;s hardware is incredible but the software is increasingly grating for any kind of power usage. Xcode is frustrating, the permissions system is flagrantly designed for Apple&#x27;s self interest, window, monitor, and app management is rife with ancient bugs and half baked design decisions. reply callmeal 4 hours agorootparent>Apple&#x27;s hardware is incredibleI used to think the same, but I had to sell off the 2016 macbook pro because the keyboard was unusable, my 2019 macbook pro has already gone back for stuck arrow keys a year ago, and now the left command key is randomly sticking, which is really annoying because you never know which shortcut key will be triggered.Compared to my 2010 macbook pro which was used without any repairs for close to 8 years.Unless you all are buying new apple devices every year or two, I don&#x27;t see how the \"apple hardware is incredible\" claim can be substantiated. reply bzzzt 6 hours agorootparentprevBut what&#x27;s the alternative? Windows has also become incredibly grating with even more telemetry and commercial offerings embedded in the OS (especially the home versions). If you think of macOS as &#x27;half baked&#x27; I&#x27;m curious what you think of Linux distributions with their infighting about everything from the desktop and graphics stack to which tool should start up system services. There&#x27;s even less internal consistency there. reply chatmasta 8 minutes agorootparentI bought a 2017 ThinkPad for $100 and installed Linux on it. It&#x27;s quite good. I would never use it as a daily driver though. I love macOS too much, even with all its flaws. But I try to do as much development in Linux as possible (whether on a device, in a VM or on a remote machine). I feel like every dev tool I install on Mac is more technical debt that I need to pay for each time I update the surrounding OS. reply absrec 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had almost 0 problems being a power user with a KDE Plasma Arch Linux. There is internal consistency in distro lineups. Linux is not one OS. You can have the telemetry ridden but more accessible Ubuntu experience to the extremely fast and barebones Xfce Arch experience, it&#x27;s your choice. reply alluro2 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been someone who used Windows, MacOS and around 20 Linux distros extensively across many laptops &#x2F; PCs. Always tempering, endless configuration, customization, frustration with Windows instability, MacOS inflexibility or e.g. needing to spend days so my audio works on Linux.A couple of years ago, I picked up Thinkpad P1 (Ryzen 4800U) and got settled with Arch + Plasma. I&#x27;ve never before had such a snappy, quiet, stable, 3 monitors, all hardware and software just working, fully customized, and empowering experience of using a computer and went years without needing to touch anything - as it was perfect.It ended when I couldn&#x27;t resist a new MBP 14, but I&#x27;ve been slowly accumulating nostalgia for my Linux setup since and will surely get back to it, hopefully when Asahi Linux completes support for external monitors. reply MichaelZuo 4 hours agorootparentprevIs SwiftUI supposed to be a complete replacement of Cocoa in 2023? I thought that was a nebulous goal for the distant future? reply crossroadsguy 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are being utterly charitable by saying you’ve mixed feelings about Apple’s software prowess (or rather lack of). reply AHTERIX5000 7 hours agorootparentprevXcode is a mess in many fronts. For example my Xcode updated automatically to a version which couldn&#x27;t support Ventura anymore, the OS I&#x27;m still running. I had to uninstall the app store version and manually download older one to fix the situation. reply tempodox 6 hours agorootparentFriends don&#x27;t let friends install Xcode from the AppStore. reply lloeki 2 hours agoparentprev> I wish Apple would separate the updates of their bundleware from their OS.In a way it&#x27;s a bit of a philosophical standpoint: macOS is the whole indivisible thing developed, built, and released in lockstep, kinda like FreeBSB base is the whole indivisible thing developed, built, and released in lockstep (and the rest is ports). In a way, removing tcsh from a FreeBSD install because you only ever use bash from ports does not make sense and may break things; so you just ignore it and pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist. reply chatmasta 7 minutes agorootparentYeah, I get that, but I think there could be a middleground. They could ship all their apps as a bundle, and their raw base OS separately. reply rpgbr 14 hours agoparentprevSafari is updated independently of macOS. Today I installed Safari 17 on Ventura. It’s available in Monterey as well. reply zuhsetaqi 7 hours agoparentprev> except for Safari, which I wish I could update independently without relying on the \"Technology Preview\" beta channelFor me the Safari update is always a seperate update in System Preferences which I can install without updateing the OS reply janandonly 6 hours agoparentprevFor tech minded folk, the upgrade-everyting-or-nothing is indeed unwanted.But I love the facts that I can tell my family to upgrade and they will have all the new stuff at once, like with an iPhone or iPad. That is for most users what they want and&#x2F;or need. reply neovive 3 hours agoparentprevMaybe Apple should consider dev editions for MacOS that allows more customization during setup. MacOS is still heavily used by web and mobile developers, so I&#x27;m sure this would be received well.I do end up removing many of the Apple apps, but recently started using Safari, Notes, and Reminders more. Apple does an excellent job making their apps work seamlessly within the Apple ecosystem. reply vaughan 16 hours agoparentprevSomething cool however is you can actually build the open-source WebKit browser engine yourself and make closed-source Safari use your locally built version. reply pchangr 10 hours agorootparentDo you have a link or something ?

And being afraid of new features that you don&#x27;t use... pretty irrational. reply replete 5 hours agorootparentIt is by no means irrational to hesitate on a new major release of an Apple operating system. MacOS upgrades have caused many people all kinds of issues, for instance a Big Sur update broke a metric fuckton of USB-C hubs and they didn&#x27;t address it for 6 months. reply absrec 4 hours agorootparentI updated from High Sierra to Catalina and it broke a lot of things.

Warning: You are using macOS 11. We (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version. It is expected behaviour that some formulae will fail to build in this old version. It is expected behaviour that Homebrew will be buggy and slow. Do not create any issues about this on Homebrew&#x27;s GitHub repositories. Do not create any issues even if you think this message is unrelated. Any opened issues will be immediately closed without response. Do not ask for help from Homebrew or its maintainers on social media. You may ask for help in Homebrew&#x27;s discussions but are unlikely to receive a response. Try to figure out the problem yourself and submit a fix as a pull request. We will review it but may or may not accept it. reply tacker2000 7 hours agoparentYea the homebrew dev team is pretty user hostile tbh. The more you read their github, the more you realize how insufferable and arrogant they are. It leaves a very bad impression.Also, if you are not going along in the upgrade rabbit race, homebrew gets really annoying and actually in your way at some point.I see myself moving to macports soon, if brew gets worse and the stability of my setup is compromised (lots of php versions with valet for example).I guess brew is now more targeted at “prosumers” now since it is imposing unnecessary limits on what “pro” users want and need. reply andy_ppp 6 hours agorootparentI always expect endless support from free products, built by the community, that I&#x27;m not paying for or contributing to. reply tacker2000 4 hours agorootparentOf course the devs dont need to support everyone and answer every feature request.Its more nuanced than that.As a dev, i like a stable environment and i dont like to do big updates all the time, since that means i have to spend hours updating my setup again. Everytime i run brew im scared it will hose my PHP versions, etc, since it auto updates everything.To install old PHP versions one needs to hack the install files to make it work.If you bring up any of these issues you are screamed down by the devs as “you should always be on the latest versions anyway bla bla”… but that is just not a realistic scenario in the real world. Legacy code is everywhere.In the end brew is not really for pro users, but, as i said, maybe for people using it to install youtube-dl or whatever.Once the pain of reinstalling and hacking it to make it work becomes too big then i will switch. reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad we have both Homebrew as well as MacPorts. It&#x27;s like having options to choose a bleeding-edge or stable distro. I prefer the former (as a dev, who often wants to use reasonably new features and libraries - and honestly despite keeping up in versions I can count the breakage to my workflow in the past decade on one hand, at least I&#x27;m not a JavaScript developer) but I totally respect the latter as well, so I&#x27;m glad we can each have what we need. reply underdeserver 4 hours agorootparentprevHow much is your support contract with them? reply gumby 4 hours agorootparentprevPlease return homebrew for a full refund. reply chuchana 4 hours agorootparentprevAnother alternative that might be worth looking into is the Nix package manager. reply marcinzm 3 hours agorootparentprevThe alternative is orders of magnitude more work for them as they need to maintain old versions of packages and old versions of operating systems. reply Phurist 3 hours agorootparentprevJust use Nix reply n8henrie 18 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;download.html#nix-install-macosThe homebrew team seems incredibly burnt-out, to the point of hostility.

The difference between no Nix install and having one isn&#x27;t huge. But your first installed Nix package will pull in very low level common dependencies— on Linux, everything between whatever application and the kernel (and on macOS, a bit less). Your next application will come with a smaller increase. Once you have a handful of programs installed, you no longer have big downloads for individual additions. When you have a lot installed, the difference isn&#x27;t that huge, proportionally.Over time, your Nixpkgs version will rotate and you can end up with deps from old versions of Nixpkgs, which can take up a lot of extra space. But that&#x27;s easy enough to manage by pinning Nixpkgs.If you ever uninstall programs, Homebrew&#x27;s broken uninstallation functionality can very quickly make a Homebrew installation much (up to several times) larger than the equivalent Nix one once you have more than a handful of packages installed. reply faitswulff 13 hours agorootparentprevThe Determinate Systems nix installer is quite smooth: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DeterminateSystems&#x2F;nix-installer&#x2F;Though it does tend to get clobbered on macOS updates. reply iFreilicht 8 hours agorootparentYeah, that&#x27;s a long-running and pretty much unfixable issue as macOS updates overwrite &#x2F;etc&#x2F;zshrc.

Not everyone can afford to buy a brand new computer every year. reply travisjungroth 11 hours agorootparentOne of the problems with OSS burnout is this many-to-one relationship with the users and maintainer. It’s sort of like the relationship between an outfielder and the bleacher crowd at a baseball game.Maintainers get requests to do things they have no interest in, like maintaining software for OSes past a certain date. That doesn’t sound so bad, but there are a lot, and they can even be mean. The maintainer can block these users individually, but it’s different users all the time, so that doesn’t stop it.So, the maintainer addresses the user base, the whole crowd all at once. The problem is most of these users haven’t seen these interactions, so the message seems hostile. Having someone say “I owe you nothing.” seems really weird when you’ve never asked them for anything. Or, if they list of all the ways and reasons for you to not contact them it looks hostile. The users don’t see the fan next to them throwing a beer can at the center fielder. reply KennyBlanken 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not burnout. The homebrew team have been insufferable and egotistical for a long time.Max Howell (founder of homebrew) went to interview at Google, shoved a coding exercise back in their faces, made a snotty comment about how all the engineers at Google using Macs use his code and how dare they blah blah greatest engineer in the world blah blah, and walked out the door.That coding exercise was likely given to him precisely because all the google engineers had a lot of experience using brew, or they did it as ego check to see if he&#x27;d be insufferable to work with.Howell failed to realize that and instead went and bragged about it on twitter, almost certainly confirming for the hiring committee that things had worked exactly as designed.Whole lot of fucking sass from a man who either didn&#x27;t care or didn&#x27;t know about the security implications of making a directory in the default path user-writeable, thus making probably hundreds of thousands of developer&#x27;s systems less secure:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infotoast.org&#x2F;site&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;homebrew-is-... reply rfrey 9 hours agorootparentThis is very reductive.

I have two perfectly good but now unsupported 5K iMacs from 2015 and 2017 in my household, both don&#x27;t get any more upgrades. Heck, I would even pay up to 100 EUR&#x2F;USD for longer support. But that&#x27;s probably not a viable business case for Apple anymore. reply tzs 1 hour agorootparentBy upgrades you mean upgrades that change the major OS version, right?Those both should still be getting security updates. Ventura just updated to 13.6 this morning, Monterey updated to 12.7 a few days ago, and Big Sur updated to 11.17.10 a little over two weeks ago.Big Sur is expected to stop getting security updates in a couple months. Monterey will probably get them until sometime in the last quarter of 2024, which would be the end of the line for 2015 5K iMacs. 2017 5K iMacs should get Ventura security updates through the last quarter of 2025. reply MilaM 55 minutes agorootparentIndeed, and I hope Ventura will get at least two years of security fixes.It&#x27;s still my impression, that the 2017 Macs (sold by Apple well into 2018), should have made the cut for Sonoma. I don&#x27;t even care about any of the new features. I&#x27;m more interested in bug and security fixes. So hopefully I have more time to hunt for the perfect display that can adequately replace the 5K 27\" of my current setup. And I know there is the Studio Display. But that one is too expensive for me. reply walteweiss 6 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried to install some Linux distro (like Fedora or Ubuntu) on it? If your workflow allows it, of course.

The issue with switching is more about my previous investment in buying and learning dozens of third-party apps.

Why is it that every package manager assumes I’m an administrator on my machine? Even if I am, how does it make sense to take over a global directory as a single user? reply pxc 9 hours agorootparentNix leverages hardcoded paths inside the binaries and other outputs it builds in order to ensure determinacy. Nix packages are not always trivially relocatable. Consequently, reliance on the binary caches means different users have to rely on the same path to the Nix store, since it&#x27;s part of all those outputs.You can build Nix with a custom store prefix and run it that way if you&#x27;re willing to build from source.In practice, Linux users don&#x27;t really have to contend with that tradeoff because you can relocate a Nix store wholesale using a bind mount, or a user namespace (unprivileged chroot), or various fakeroot tricks to run a Nix store in your homedir as if it lives in &#x2F;nix. Unfortunately macOS just doesn&#x27;t have any of those mechanisms.If macOS some day gets first-class container support and, consequently, relevant user-facing primitives for user-mode chroot, then unprivileged, cache-friendly Nix installation methods for macOS will doubtless follow. I hope both happen! reply pxc 46 minutes agorootparentI have a bad habit of writing user-mode when I mean &#x27;unprivileged&#x27; in the sense of &#x27;not as root&#x27; and I don&#x27;t think the word really works that way. I did it again here! Whoops. reply n8henrie 2 hours agorootparentprevOnly true for MacOS though, Linux supports a proper single-user no-root install. reply miniBill 16 hours agorootparentprevNix does not require you to be an administrator to install a package though! reply raunakchhatwal 15 hours agorootparentI think he may be referring to installing Nix itself, which does require root even if the intention isn&#x27;t to install anything system-wide. I did once think about modifying the nix installer to let me set an arbitrary nix store because I wanted nix packages in a docker container I was debugging, but never really got around to it. Let me know if you know of somebody else who tried this. reply iFreilicht 8 hours agorootparentSo this is possible, but there are a lot of caveats. First, the installer itself explicitly says:```# Please don&#x27;t change this. We don&#x27;t support it, because the# default shell profile that comes with Nix doesn&#x27;t support it.readonly NIX_ROOT=\"&#x2F;nix\"```I haven&#x27;t seen any configurations where the entire &#x2F;nix is relocated, but nix _does_ support relocating the store with the environment variable `NIX_STORE_DIR`.[1]However, this means that you can no longer use the the binary cache and *everything* you install has to be compiled from scratch, including glibc. The reason is that nix usually patches paths like `&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myprogram` to `&#x2F;nix&#x2F;store&#x2F;1238f...-myprogram-1.2.3&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myprogram` in everything that depends on `myprogram` during build time to isolate the build outputs from the system. If you change your store, all those paths will now be invalid, including the hash part.So using a nix store that isn&#x27;t `&#x2F;nix&#x2F;store` is possible, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is actually doing it except in a few select scenarios.You can also compile nix itself with a different root. That will work as expected, but you still have the issue that you need to compile everything you install yourself.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;nix&#x2F;stable&#x2F;command-ref&#x2F;env-common.h... (you can also relocate most other directories. The `prefix` in the paths is `&#x2F;nix`) reply bshacklett 3 hours agorootparentNow that&#x27;s interesting. I use Homebrew in a similar way. It does mean I have to compile a lot of things from scratch, but Homebrew has knowledge of which packages are relocatable and which aren&#x27;t, so I get to use binary \"bottles\" for about 25% of the packages I install. I&#x27;ll have to give this a try. reply watermelon0 13 hours agorootparentprevHomebrew is the same, there is no good way to have Homebrew installation shared among multiple users on a single machine, much less to have separate packages for each of them. reply bshacklett 3 hours agorootparent> ...there is no good way...Agreed, but it&#x27;s at least possible. My usual install is just cloning Homebrew to ~&#x2F;homebrew and setting up a symlink. It&#x27;s far from ideal, due to the number of packages I need to build from source, but it works, and it&#x27;s allowed me to function normally in tightly controlled environments.As far as I can tell, the initial installation for Nix doesn&#x27;t allow this, though iFreilicht pointed out some options that I haven&#x27;t seen before, so I may be wrong. reply krackers 18 hours agoparentprevThese warnings keep getting longer every homebrew release.

Still, these ports maintainers did not give up and eventually found a way to fix SBCL builds on PPC: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.macports.org&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;65484I recall seeing some work to bring back PPC support upstream, but I am not sure what the progress on that is.

Why do you choose Homebrew for your Linux distro instead of its default package manager? reply maleldil 6 hours agorootparentMore recent packages, for one. I need to use Ubuntu 20.04 for work, and it&#x27;s easier to get the latest versions I want from linuxbrew than from apt. E.g. clang is on 10.0 from apt and 16.0 from brew. Similarly, fish is 3.1.0 vs 3.6.1. reply cglong 9 hours agorootparentprevThe Homebrew UX is great as long as you&#x27;re on their happy path. Speaking from experience, as soon as I see the warning message I shared at the top, Homebrew gets way worse.For instance, installing ripgrep now requires building the latest version of Rust from source, which takes three hours per Rust version; installing Pandoc requires building and storing the whole GHC; etc. reply sph 9 hours agorootparentprevNo one is talking about issues here. reply saaspirant 17 hours agorootparentprevHe is talking about MAC OS 11 Big Sur reply georgespencer 15 hours agorootparentmacOS or MacOS but never MAC OS or MACOS.

I have no idea whether the alternatives improved in the intervening 10-ish years, any I have no good reason to look into it since homebrew still works. reply KennyBlanken 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great until homebrew breaks in some fucked up way (which a few years ago it used to do often), or they break a package (ditto) and you try to report that to them, and they act like insufferable little shits back (and don&#x27;t fix the problem.)It reminds me of my boss emailing gnu.org to tell them one of their mirrors was down and got a nastygram back that said \"It&#x27;s spelled GNU&#x2F;Linux\" and the mirror went unfixed. reply prmoustache 9 hours agorootparent> and the mirror went unfixed.They don&#x27;t maintain the mirrors themselves.

When I got my M1 MacBook in 2021 I saw some of this negativity about Homebrew, and since I was doing a clean install anyway I decided to try out MacPorts. I quickly ran into problems and switched back to Homebrew and it&#x27;s been smooth sailing. reply koito17 14 hours agorootparentWhat problems did you run into? I&#x27;ve been using MacPorts for years at this point since Homebrew can never seem to install libraries in a way that pkg-config, gcc, and ld can find them. (Yes, I&#x27;m aware there is a subcommand in brew to manually print the paths to libraries, this is still not ergonomic compared to MacPorts where I install a library and it more or less \"just works\" when I want to use it).Also, Homebrew attempting to nuke &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local on uninstall left a quite bad taste in my mouth. I had installed MacTeX before Homebrew, and thankfully MacTeX had proper file permissions set up, so my TeX installation was left in-tact. Still scary knowing that this is just done in the background without warning (unless the operation fails with errors). reply inferiorhuman 10 hours agorootparentIt makes a mess out of iconv because it&#x27;s not compatible with the OSX bundled version. Without digging into it further it seems like the macports iconv headers and libraries shouldn&#x27;t be in the default search path. reply jeffcox 17 hours agorootparentprevUltimately users will go where the package maintainers are. There are more people out there willing and able to write Ruby today than Perl (Fink) or TCL (MacPorts).I&#x27;m sure someone will start a macOS package manager based on python and yum to signal the waning days of those technologies. reply wwalexander 10 hours agorootparentMacPorts has 36k active ports.

The other available package managers would work 70% of the time on a good day. Homebrew is bulletproof on a current OS. reply hotnfresh 11 hours agorootparentprevI switched because Macports reliably borked itself doing ordinary operations every 4-6 months, and Brew didn’t. That was like 2012 to be fair, but Brew’s never given me much trouble and the package selection is insanely good, so I’ve had no reason to look at other options since.Its being in ruby is a strike against it, for me. I use it anyway. It’s probably my favorite package manager, all things considered, and I’ve used a lot. reply pxc 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure some Ruby programmers were attracted to Homebrew because it felt more familiar than something written in a language like Tcl.But Homebrew&#x27;s fundamental tradeoff w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t purity was also a huge boost to installation speed at a time when most package managers for macOS still required you to build most things from source.That and the slick, user-friendly UI were probably the biggest factors for Homebrew&#x27;s success when it came out. reply stouset 14 hours agorootparentprevPeople switched to it because MacPorts was constantly broken and took ages to install new packages due to compiling everything. reply runlevel1 12 hours agorootparentHomebrew built almost everything from source back when everyone was already migrating to it. Fink and MacPorts being frequently broken was really the big driver, IMO.As for why Homebrew packages seemed to be broken less often, I can only speculate. At least one big benefit it had was being on GitHub. A lot of folks were already familiar with how to cut a PR. Not so with how to submit a Portfile patch to the MacPorts Trac. reply amake 14 hours agorootparentprevMacPorts has provided binaries for many years at this point. reply stouset 11 hours agorootparentIt has, but by then they&#x27;d already lost many users. reply eviks 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a false trip down the memory lane, nothing was \"perfectly good\" back then, arguably even now there are big issues with all the package managers reply beowulfey 16 hours agorootparentprevIt works well now though—do you prefer any of the other package managers still? reply halostatue 13 hours agorootparentI use both MacPorts and Homebrew. By and large, I prefer MacPorts (because I can pin a package and it will stay pinned, whereas Homebrew will upgrade a package if it happens to be a dependency of something else) but there are numerous packages and casks only available in Homebrew.If I could switch entirely to MacPorts, I would. reply AndroidKitKat 2 hours agorootparentI wonder why there aren&#x27;t more \"casks\" for MacPorts. On my work MacBook, I&#x27;ve got Firefox, Google Chrome, Orbstack, and Visual Studio Code installed via brew casks, and none of them are present in the MacPorts catalog. Maybe I should step up and learn how to package things for MacPorts... reply halostatue 34 minutes agorootparentI think that, by and large, MacPorts wants to ultimately build things. I was just looking at the MacVim port and it does not have a way of downloading the Release from GitHub (as far as I can tell). It will download a precompiled binary from the MacPorts build farm, but it has Sparkle disabled, etc., so it is managed fully from MacPorts.It would be an interesting discussion to have, as they do have some of that sort of thing (the 1Password CLI, for example), but I don’t know what the general policy would be.I’d love to see MacPorts get more funding for build resources and to potentially add that, because the way that Homebrew works occasionally leaves things broken (`pipx` venvs are a great example). replypedalpete 17 hours agoprevDoes anyone else have no idea what macOS version is which? Which came first? Is there some hidden naming protocol that I just don&#x27;t grasp?I&#x27;ve only started using a mac part-time while I&#x27;ve been developing an iOS app over the past few weeks, and I keep seeing different names for the OS version. I have no idea what version I&#x27;m on, or if Big Sur came before Sierra, or what. I know I could look it up, but it seems that in the name of good user-experience, I shouldn&#x27;t need to.You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d at a minimum say \"people aren&#x27;t going to be able to figure out which is which, so let&#x27;s go in alphabetical order with our naming. reply crazygringo 11 hours agoparentYeah, at this point I wish they&#x27;d just use numbers like iOS.So we&#x27;re at iOS 17 and macOS 14.Because honestly I stopped caring about keeping track of the names long ago. It&#x27;s cute if you care, they can still put it in the About window for the sake of tradition, but it would be a lot more helpful if it were just referred to as macOS 14 in the press and documentation. reply brandall10 16 hours agoparentprevIt says the in the \"About This Mac\" Apple menu item. In this case, it will be Sonoma 14.0.Historically versioning is weird due to the integration of NextSTEP after Job&#x27;s return to the company. First it was versioned up to 9, then the NextSTEP integration was 10, then subsequent major releases were minor bumps (ie 10.1, 10.2) as OSX was a brand unto itself until 11 which rebranded to MacOS and full versions were used again. So Sonoma is the 14th release from the NextSTEP integration. I think referring to them by names eased the confusion some.This gives a good rundown:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MacOS_version_history reply speak_plainly 14 hours agorootparentSonoma is the 21st release of a Mac operating system based on NeXTSTEP.

If you&#x27;re going to have names, it&#x27;s a great way to do it. OpenStack, Ceph & Ubuntu all do that.However it&#x27;s still a challenge. I work with all of those daily and I often think about the project over-all and it&#x27;s features or bugs in terms of the alphabetical name, but there is also a numerical name and I have to lookup and translate from it - when looking at diagnostic output from customer installs, or git tags, etc. I keep some subset of the translations in my head but not all them :) reply pfranz 9 hours agorootparentJust think of how fast you&#x27;ll be with a1z26 ciphers! reply wldcordeiro 9 hours agorootparentprevI could have sworn the dessert names were code names and they did numbered releases too the entire time but they did drop the 1.x numbering for just whole versions. reply akerl_ 16 hours agorootparentprevMacOS versions have a number, which counts up, the same as iOS and WatchOS. \"Sonoma\" is a cutesy name for \"MacOS 14\", the same way that \"Jammy Jellyfish\" is the cutesy name for Ubuntu 22.04.The version number is shown in the About This Mac page, which is the top menu item in the Apple menu at all times. reply emmelaich 13 hours agorootparentAt least Ubuntu&#x27;s names are alphabetical.Off the top of my head I couldn&#x27;t tell which was later out of Big Sur, Ventura, Monterey ... reply rahoulb 6 hours agorootparentI constantly get Mojave and Monterey mixed up.And I&#x27;m completely lost with Debian releases. reply brandall10 16 hours agorootparentprevAs mentioned in my post the NextSTEP integration - OSX - was a major branding effort for Apple.

It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Prophet is open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is available for download on CRAN and PyPI.

Taylor, Benjamin Letham (2018) Forecasting at scale. The American Statistician 72(1):37-45 (https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf). Installation in R - CRAN ⚠ The CRAN version of prophet is fairly outdated. To get the latest bug fixes and updated country holiday data, we suggest installing the latest release. Prophet is a CRAN package so you can use install.packages. install.packages('prophet') After installation, you can get started! Installation in R - Latest release install.packages('remotes') remotes::install_github('facebook/prophet@*release', subdir = 'R') Experimental backend - cmdstanr You can also choose an experimental alternative stan backend called cmdstanr. Once you've installed prophet, follow these instructions to use cmdstanr instead of rstan as the backend: # R # We recommend running this in a fresh R session or restarting your current session install.packages(c(\"cmdstanr\", \"posterior\"), repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\"))) # If you haven't installed cmdstan before, run: cmdstanr::install_cmdstan() # Otherwise, you can point cmdstanr to your cmdstan path: cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path(path = ) # Set the R_STAN_BACKEND environment variable Sys.setenv(R_STAN_BACKEND = \"CMDSTANR\") Windows On Windows, R requires a compiler so you'll need to follow the instructions provided by rstan. The key step is installing Rtools before attempting to install the package. If you have custom Stan compiler settings, install from source rather than the CRAN binary. Installation in Python - PyPI release Prophet is on PyPI, so you can use pip to install it. python -m pip install prophet From v0.6 onwards, Python 2 is no longer supported. As of v1.0, the package name on PyPI is \"prophet\"; prior to v1.0 it was \"fbprophet\". As of v1.1, the minimum supported Python version is 3.7. After installation, you can get started! Anaconda Prophet can also be installed through conda-forge. conda install -c conda-forge prophet Installation in Python - Development version To get the latest code changes as they are merged, you can clone this repo and build from source manually. This is not guaranteed to be stable. git clone https://github.com/facebook/prophet.git cd prophet/python python -m pip install -e . By default, Prophet will use a fixed version of cmdstan (downloading and installing it if necessary) to compile the model executables. If this is undesired and you would like to use your own existing cmdstan installation, you can set the environment variable PROPHET_REPACKAGE_CMDSTAN to False: export PROPHET_REPACKAGE_CMDSTAN=False; python -m pip install -e . Linux Make sure compilers (gcc, g++, build-essential) and Python development tools (python-dev, python3-dev) are installed. In Red Hat systems, install the packages gcc64 and gcc64-c++. If you are using a VM, be aware that you will need at least 4GB of memory to install prophet, and at least 2GB of memory to use prophet. Windows Using cmdstanpy with Windows requires a Unix-compatible C compiler such as mingw-gcc. If cmdstanpy is installed first, one can be installed via the cmdstanpy.install_cxx_toolchain command.

The coverage probabilities are way off. reply Donald 17 hours agorootparentDo you have an example implementation of reimplementing the core of these? reply mochomocha 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s literally what I did at work last week, which is why I found this submission timely. I&#x27;d have to check with my employer if it can be made public. I don&#x27;t see any reason why not, there&#x27;s not much to it. reply em500 10 hours agorootparentWhat did you use to implement the regularization of the trend breakpoints? Prophet by default uses a regular grid and thins them out with STAN. I couldn&#x27;t find a quick regularization replacement in numpy&#x2F;scipy&#x2F;statsmodels with equivalent performance. (I don&#x27;t want to drag in another huge dependency with Torch or TF). reply ImageXav 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is interesting to me. Do you use a library to estimate the fourier series of a data series or have you implemented it from scratch? I&#x27;ve searched for this in the past but always got results RE. Fourier transforms, not series. reply 3abiton 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy is STAN viewed negatively in this light? I am curious why bayesian libraries are the black sheep. reply XTXinverseXTY 14 hours agorootparentI think he just means that it can be an incredible pain to install. reply nextos 16 hours agorootparentprevI am curious too. I have used Stan extensively. I found it extremely polished and pleasant to use.It generated very efficient samplers for particularly weird (and enormous!) hierarchical models I had. Documentation is also great.It is also worth reading Andrew Gelman&#x27;s post about Prophet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;facebooks-... reply rdli 19 hours agoprevAs others have pointed out, Prophet is not a particularly good model for forecasting, and has been superseded by a multitude of other models. If you want to do time series forecasting, I&#x27;d recommend using Darts: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unit8co&#x2F;darts. Darts implements a wide range of models and is fairly easy to use.The problem with time series forecasting in general is that they make a lot of assumptions on the shape of your data, and you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re spending a lot of time figuring out mutating your data. For example, they expect that your data comes at a very regular interval. This is fine if it&#x27;s, say, the data from a weather station. This doesn&#x27;t work well in clinical settings (imagine a patient admitted into the ER -- there is a burst of data, followed by no data).That said, there&#x27;s some interesting stuff out there that I&#x27;ve been experimenting with that seems to be more tolerant of irregular time series and can be quite useful. If you&#x27;re interested in exchanging ideas, drop me a line (email in my profile). reply ImaCake 16 hours agoparent> they expect that your data comes at a very regular intervalDoes prophet rely on this assumption? For health timeseries data the tool of choice is survival analysis - typically using Cox proportional hazards regression or similar regression tools that are able to handle irregular or censored data.I&#x27;ve seen some moves towards using fancy bayesian or fancier machine learning stuff for clinical trials but a big issue is that they are very difficult to communicate to their intended audience. reply laichzeit0 11 hours agorootparentThere’s also the auton survival library. I’ve used it for very big survival models with time varying coefficients:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autonlab.org&#x2F;auton-survival&#x2F; reply cjalmeida 16 hours agorootparentprevI find Bayesian regression models are actually simpler to explain as the assumptions you make are explicit and part of the model specification.(Thought the actual sampling mechanics and tooling can be much more complex) reply carlossouza 12 hours agorootparentPyMC or Pyro&#x2F;NumPyro make the implementation of Bayesian regression dead simple reply rdli 16 hours agorootparentprevI tried Prophet via Darts, and all the models in Darts assume a regular time series.Re: \"fancier machine learning\" -- I&#x27;ve seen different flavors of RNNs & LSTMs have some success in analyzing time series data. I&#x27;ve struggled to get them to work on real-world (i.e., messy) data, but have had some encouraging results with a transformer encoder-only NN. reply hackernewds 8 hours agoparentprevWhat does Dart do that a multibillion dollar entity with an excellent open sourcing track record misses doing? Perhaps it addresses a niché case well. Genuinely curious reply specproc 7 hours agorootparentAs others have mentioned in the thread, Prophet has been abandoned, and in my experience anyway, wasn&#x27;t all that great. reply GraceCat123 7 hours agoparentprevCan we employ stochastic processes like the Poisson process to represent irregular data points? Are there any existing models for this? reply rdli 4 hours agorootparentA common strategy is interpolation. The challenge is that forecasting itself is a form of interpolation. So you&#x27;re forecasting based on forecasted data. reply clircle 4 hours agorootparentprevI think a common “solution” is to use a Gaussian process model. reply Tarq0n 20 hours agoprevProphet is such an appealing package because it promises to abstract away all the difficult parts of forecasting. However, in practice it does not fulfill its promises. I think this is a good discussion of the problems: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microprediction.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;prophet reply kimukasetsu 14 hours agoprevAs others have pointed out, it is a good idea to encode domain knowledge in your time series model through specification and priors. Prophet rarely beats a well specified GLM or SARIMA in real world applications, especially when uncertainty estimates are needed. Professionally, I have succesfully applied Gaussian Processes to many such cases.A GP is an intuitive and expressive way to code time covariance in a model. A famous example is the relative birthdays model, discussed by Gelman et al in Bayesian Data Analysis and here [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avehtari.github.io&#x2F;casestudies&#x2F;Birthdays&#x2F;birthdays.h... reply krawczstef 20 hours agoprevThis library is old news?

It often leads to less-than-ideal results.Curiously, in Medium-like (ie low effort) publications it&#x27;s still the recommended way to tackle a forecasting problem. The promise of a model that can solve any time series problem sounds great, but not all that glitters is gold, and as you get more experience you discover that solutions like this usually don&#x27;t work. reply braza 20 hours agoparentI used Prophet and personally I do not have any problems, but I agree with the criticism that the tool it’s extremely focused in ergonomics that abstracts important aspects of the tool that can be used to built better models [1].[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryxcommar.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;zillow-prophet-time-series-... reply elesiuta 19 hours agorootparentI thought the biggest issue wasn&#x27;t with the models themselves, but how Zillow decided to apply and act on them, which is why it didn&#x27;t work in practice.So on average their predictions may have been pretty good, but since each transaction also depends on the other party to accept their offer, and whether they get outbid, most of their predictions where the offer actually goes through would be on the tail end of where they slightly overestimated the price.This tweet from the article summed it up nicely> Zillow made the same mistake that every new quant trader makes early on: Mistaking an adversarial environment for a random one. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xdoug&#x2F;status&#x2F;1456032851477028870I was lucky to make and learn from that mistake pretty quickly with some algorithmic trading on much smaller amounts. With housing transactions being much larger and slower, you wouldn&#x27;t learn this lesson until it was too late. Models never perform as well in practice as they do in theory, and you need to remember to account for both known unknowns and unknown unknowns. reply GraceCat123 7 hours agorootparentGreat comments! I&#x27;ve learned a lot from them. I&#x27;m just getting started with algorithmic trading and time series modeling, so I appreciate your insights. reply pantsforbirds 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve honestly had consistently better results with standard regression models. I really love the idea of it, and maybe I need to be tuning it better somehow, but overall I haven&#x27;t had a great experience. reply wendyshu 20 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t recommended by whom? reply alexmolas 20 hours agorootparentEvery time I, or someone at work with more experience than me, have tried Prophet it has ended up in changing the approach and trying a different technique. In my experience with time series hand-crafted recipes tend to work much more better than out-of-the-box solutions. reply techwizrd 20 hours agorootparentI agree completely. We always end up moving away from Prophet every time. The results from Prophet are just not very good, although it can be useful for a proof-of-concept. reply hackernewds 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you instead? I think Prophet does get close to an answer that isn&#x27;t \"depends\" like everyone else is suggesting as an alternative reply pantsforbirds 21 hours agoprevHas anyone else struggled with Prophet? I&#x27;ve experimented with it on a few real world datasets and I&#x27;ve had very inconsistent results. reply ttt333 20 hours agoparentYes. I&#x27;ve tried using it for pretty straightforward time series forecasts, and I struggled to make it into something useful in a business context.I&#x27;ll disclaim that I&#x27;m just a finance dude and not a data scientist or programmer. But the documentation leads me to believe that I am in the target audience. I felt like I could grasp the basic mechanics after reading the paper, but I wish the documentation could help someone like me be more intelligent with the &#x27;tuning&#x27; of the model. I could never get accuracy below 15% average error, which is too large for my use case.Probably user ignorance, but that&#x27;s my experience. reply SpaceManNabs 20 hours agorootparentYou are the primary audience. Time series forecasting with deep learning is fraught with inconsistency. Someone on r&#x2F;ML went pretty hard on detailing a survey and the stuff that was SOTA 10 years ago still is.

I might go chasing this lead down, but even a fuzzy estimation of when would help. Will come link it here if I find it. reply SpaceManNabs 19 hours agorootparentI updated my comment! reply eep_social 20 hours agorootparentprevThis looks to me like something they’d be using for internal capacity planning. If so, they’d be asking it questions like, “how much capacity do we build out for the upcoming holiday rush?” I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if financial datasets are very noisy compared to service capacity metrics. I didn’t read the paper though, maybe this is addressed and maybe I’m wrong about the use case! But stuff like the below from the docs reads like capacity planning tool to me:> As an example, let’s look at a time series of the log daily page views for the Wikipedia page for Peyton Manning. We scraped this data using the Wikipediatrend package in R. Peyton Manning provides a nice example because it illustrates some of Prophet’s features, like multiple seasonality, changing growth rates, and the ability to model special days (such as Manning’s playoff and superbowl appearances). reply philjohn 18 hours agorootparentAlso perhaps anomaly detection in a metric. reply hackernewds 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sad to see no one has responded with a solution to your problem. You are absolutely the target audience, and in my experience, Prophet is \"as good as it gets\" to generalized forecasting. reply HWR_14 20 hours agoparentprevBased just on the documentation, it seems there are some assumptions they expect the data to adhere to, and if they don&#x27;t apply then it would not produce good results. reply sbohacek 20 hours agoparentprevI have not been able to get good results either, but I have not tried it in the past year. I also tried many of the architectures in Darts. I have found that fairly straightforward architectures work well. That is, I can iterate on my own design for my own specific data (with all its specific covariates) and get better results than I could with Darts or Prophet. reply jgalt212 20 hours agoparentprevmaybe because time series forecasting, for any time series of interest, is pretty much not possible. reply xs83 14 hours agoprevIm a Data Engineer in a large consulting company and I have been incredibly impressed with AutoGluon for forecasting.

This adds a lot of flexibility on the class of problems it can handle. With that said, Prophet is \"flexible\" not \"universal\". A time series of entirely random integers selected from range(0,10) will be handled quite poorly, but fortunately nobody cares about modeling this case.Second: the same reason that only a small handful of possible stats&#x2F;ML models get used on virtually all problems. Most problems which people solve with stats&#x2F;ML share a number of common features which makes it appropriate to use the same model on them (the model&#x27;s \"assumptions\"). Applications which don&#x27;t have these features get treated as edge-cases and ignored, or you write a paper introducing a new type of model to handle it. Consider any ARIMA-type time series model. These are used all the time for many different problem spaces, and are going to do reasonably well on \"most\" \"common\" stochastic processes you encounter in \"nature\", because its constructed to resemble many types of natural processes. It&#x27;s possible (trivial, even) to conceive of a stochastic process which ARIMA can&#x27;t really handle (any non-stationary process will work), but in practice most things that ARIMA utterly fails for are not very interesting to model or we have models that work better for that case. reply GraceCat123 6 hours agorootparentThese insights are really awesome! It reminds me of the common aphorism in Statistics: &#x27;All models are wrong, but some are useful.&#x27;These insights are really like a wake-up call, thank you! reply wgd 20 hours agoparentprevDisclaimer: I haven&#x27;t looked at the linked library at all, but this is a theoretical discussion which applies to any task of signal prediction.Out of all possible inputs, there are some that the model works well on and others that it doesn&#x27;t work well on. The trick is devising an algorithm which works well on the inputs that it will actually encounter in practice.At the obvious extremes: this library can probably do a great job at predicting linear growth, but there&#x27;s no way it will ever be better than chance at predicting the output of &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random. And in fact, it probably does worse than a constant-zero predictor when applied to a random unbiased input signal.Except that it&#x27;s also usually possible to detect such trivially unpredictable signals (obvious way: run the prediction model on all but the last N samples and see how it does at predicting the final N), and fall back to a simpler predictor (like \"the next value is always zero\" or \"the next value is always the same as the previous one\") in such cases.But that algorithm also fails on some class of inputs, like \"the signal is perfectly predictable before time T and then becomes random noise\". The core insight of the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem is that when summed across all possible input sequences, no algorithm works any better than another, but the crucial point is that you don&#x27;t apply signal predictors to all possible inputs.Another place this pops up is in data compression. Many (arguably all) compressors work by having a prediction or probability distribution over possible next values, plus a compact way of encoding which of those values was picked. Proving that it&#x27;s impossible to predict all possible input signals correctly is equivalent to proving that it&#x27;s impossible to compress all possible inputs.Another way of thinking about this: Imagine that you&#x27;re the prediction algorithm. You receive the previous N datapoints as input and are asked for a probability distribution over possible next values. In a theoretical sense every possible value is equally likely, so you should output a uniform distribution, but that provides no compression or useful prediction. Your probabilities have to sum to 1, so the only way you can increase the probability assigned to symbol A is to decrease the weight of symbol B by an equal amount. If the next symbol is A then congratulations, you&#x27;ve successfully done your job! But if the next symbol was actually B then you have now done worse (by any reasonable error metric) than the dumb uniform distribution. If your performance is evaluated over all possible inputs, the win and the loss balance out and you&#x27;ve done exactly as well as the uniform prediction would have. reply pachico 5 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s the mechanism used by Grafana&#x27;s forecasting feature.

Could i ask for a link to a relevant article to get me started on the flavour of GLM that you recommend? reply davmre 19 hours agoprevProphet has gotten a lot of attention since being released in 2017, I think because the idea of a fully automatic solution is very appealing to people. One of the original developers, Sean Taylor, recently posted a nice retrospective on the project&#x27;s successes and failures: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@seanjtaylor&#x2F;a-personal-retrospective-on-... He quotes one of his earlier tweets: If I could build it again, I’d start with automating the evaluation of forecasts. It’s silly to build models if you’re not willing to commit to an evaluation procedure. I’d also probably remove most of the automation of the modeling. People should explicitly make these choices.Having worked on similar Bayesian time-series forecasting tools at Google, this matches my experience (though I&#x27;ve never used Prophet seriously, so please don&#x27;t take this as any direct judgement of it as a software package). There is a lot of value in a framework that lets you easily experiment with different model structures (our version of this was the structural time series tools in TensorFlow Probability, see, e.g., https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tensorflow.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;structural-time-series-m...). But if you&#x27;re forecasting something you actually care about, it&#x27;s usually worth the time to try to understand yourself what structure makes sense for your problem, and do a careful evaluation on held-out data with respect to whatever metric you&#x27;re really trying to optimize. A fully automated search over model structures is cute, but even when it works, it mostly just ends up rediscovering properties of the data you could or should have already known (e.g., of course traffic to your work-related website will have a day-of-week effect), so the cases where it really adds practical value are harder to find than you might like.Even in the age of deep learning, I do think these relatively classical Bayesian models have a lot of value for many applications. Time-series forecasting tends to be a case where:- you don&#x27;t have a ton of iid data points (often, only a single time series),- you&#x27;d like forecasts with principled uncertainty estimates, e.g., credible intervals, giving you a range of scenarios to plan for,- you often do have a pretty good idea of what features are relevant to the process you&#x27;re predicting, and- you want to understand in detail what features the forecast is accounting for (and what it might be missing),all of which play to the strengths of more classical, structured statistical models, compared to more data-hungry black-box deep learning models. So the basic ideas in Prophet and similar tools do still have a lot of relevance going forward, IMHO. reply esafak 17 hours agoparentYou mention classical models but Bayesian deep learning is a thing too. One can even retrofit existing DL models to obtain uncertainty estimates, at the expense of increasing (possibly doubling) the number of model parameters.The quality of the uncertainty estimates is a question though. reply littlestymaar 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;d be curious to see how it performs on economics data compared to mainstream models (say DSGE) whose results have never impressed me with their predictive power. reply 54r4rf 20 hours agoparentNonsense vs nonsense.

AMD’s hardware portfolio includes data-center–class CPUs and GPUs, consumer GPUs, FPGAs and the Ryzen 7040, a client CPU with NPU designed for PCs. Software is key to unlocking the performance of these different hardware platforms. But how does AMD compete with its GPU competitors’ strong offerings, given its more diverse hardware? AMD’s software stacks for each class of product are separate: ROCm (short for Radeon Open Compute platform) targets its Instinct data center GPU lines (and, soon, its Radeon consumer GPUs), Vitis AI targets its XDNA chips including FPGAs and Ryzen 7040, and ZenDNN targets its CPUs. How far along is AMD with unifying these stacks? “We have enormous customer pull coming, and that is dictating quite a bit of our near-term plans,” Boppana told EE Times in an interview after his talk here. “The plane is flying right now, so we cannot disassemble the engine. However, we are absolutely doing things at the foundational level to make more unification happen in our stack.” PARTNER CONTENT VIEW ALL Briocean Technology Shines Bright as It Ranks 8th on the Top Asia Pacific Distributor List By Briocean Technology 09.26.2023 Unlock the Benefits of Endpoint AI Solutions for Laptop Computers By Himax Technologies. Ltd. 09.26.2023 SK hynix’s Evolution in CIS HDR Technology and Future Outlook By Suram Cha, Technical Leader of Next Gen Biz Team, SK hynix 09.26.2023 AMD’s Vamsi Boppana gives a keynote address at the recent AI Hardware Summit in Santa Clara, Calif. (Source: Kisaco Research & Jeffrey Hosier Photography) Boppana said that there’s some common infrastructure and tooling underlying all three stacks, including an ongoing effort to make a common quantizer. “Over time, we want to get to a place where users have one execution provider, and underneath that, you will be able to select [a hardware target],” he said. “In the near term, modules are shared across stacks, and over time, as things like heterogeneous platforms are going to become prevalent, the unified elements start coming through.” A unified stack would be helpful for heterogeneous systems, Boppana said, especially where partitioning is required. Currently, the Vitis stack handles CPU plus xDNA targets, but he agrees that both automatic and user-driven partitioning will be necessary. “In that scenario, we need to be able to take a problem statement and cut the graph, such that both parts of the graph get executed on [different parts of the hardware], and they need to inter-operate,” he said. ‘ROCm has evolved’ ROCm is less mature than competitors’ GPU software offerings, with Nvidia’s mature CUDA stack often seen as a big part of the market leader’s competitive advantage. “Software is a journey,” Boppana said. “Anybody who has written or managed complex pieces of software knows it takes time. The good news is, we have been on the journey…ROCm has evolved.” AMD has made ROCm the No. 1 priority at the company level in the last year, Boppana said, standing up a new organization that’s brought together assets from all the company’s software contributions. “We have much larger resources actually working on software, and [AMD CEO Lisa Su] has been very clear that she wants to see significant and continued investments on the software side,” Boppana said. “We have agreed to provide people internally, we have acquired Mipsology, and we are looking to grow talent both organically and inorganically.” AMD also recently stood up an internal AI models group to increase its experience using its own software stack. “We want a much tighter feedback loop,” Boppana said. Using open source to challenge Nvidia AMD has embraced OpenAI’s Triton, an open-source programming language and compiler for GPUs that promises to offer an open-source alternative to Nvidia’s CUDA for developers who want to write high-level code that performs optimally on the hardware. “There are different personas that are programming [our GPUs],” he said. “[Triton] is a level of abstraction that people are comfortable with. It’s productive. And it gets to hardware in a pretty efficient, cogent fashion. But for other customers, that doesn’t matter; they don’t need to develop new kernels. For them, we can ship libraries. So, it’s just a matter of who wants to use us.” In contrast to Nvidia’s approach with CUDA, which is mostly proprietary, most of AMD’s ROCm stack is open source. “We partner with the [AI frameworks] and the people writing the libraries and say, ‘If you have a kernel you want to put together, you can take something that exists from us, but if you find there’s the opportunity for you to optimize source code, [you can]’,” he said. “Then we have so many more people that are willing and able to contribute. So, that’s very important and very powerful for us: We think it’s the right strategic direction for us to take.” AMD has a diverse portfolio of hardware architectures for AI acceleration. But how does the company manage its AI software stack for such diverse architectures? (Source: AMD) MI300 samples are currently with customers, Boppana said, and both customers and AMD have AI training and inference workloads up and running, with availability coming at the end of this year. ROCm will be crucial to the success of both the MI300 and MI300X. “Being candid, we have a few places to grow,” he said. “Allowing the community to contribute [to ROCm] alongside us helps us bridge the gap faster.” Suggested Reading What RF Wireless Needs Now - EE Times Energy Needs a Smarter Approach - EE Times Sponsored content Archives - EE Times The Golden Age of Custom Silicon Draws Near - EE Times Silicon 100: Startups Worth Watching in 2023 RELATED TOPICS: AI AND BIG DATA Share this: TwitterFacebookLinkedIn Sally Ward-Foxton Sally Ward-Foxton covers AI for EETimes.com and EETimes Europe magazine.

The other next big target that is currently being worked on is getting full ROCm 5.7 support.I fully expect Debian 13 (trixie) to come with full ROCm support out-of-the-box, and as a consequence, also derivatives to have support (Ubuntu above all). In fact, there will almost certainly be backports of ROCm 5.7 to Debian 12 (bookworm) within the next few months, so one will be able to just $ sudo apt-get install pytorch-rocmOne current obstacle is infrastructure: the Debian build and CI infrastructures (both hardware and software) were not designed with GPUs in mind. This is also being worked on.Edit: forgot to say that the CI infra that the Team is setting up here tests all of these packages on consumer cards, too. So while there may not be official support for most of these, upstream tests passing on the cards within the infra should be a good indication for practical support.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salsa.debian.org&#x2F;rocm-team&#x2F; reply slavik81 15 hours agoparent> One current obstacle is infrastructure: the Debian build and CI infrastructures (both hardware and software) were not designed with GPUs in mind. This is also being worked on.To be more direct, one thing we lack is funding. AMD has provided RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 GPUs for the Debian CI, but to fill out the rest of the architecture matrix I have been personally buying GPUs. That&#x27;s been sufficient for covering most architectures, but we will need a sponsor if we are to acquire CDNA 2 and CDNA 3 hardware.Our goal is to cover every modern discrete AMD GPU architecture on the CI. At the moment, that would be Navi 33, Navi 32, Navi 31, Navi 24, Navi 23, Navi 22, Navi 21, Navi 14, Navi 12, Navi 10, Aldebaran, Arcturus, Vega 20, Vega 10, and (maybe) Polaris. I have been very successful at bringing the AMD GPU libraries to architectures that are not officially supported upstream. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying systems out of my personal funds. I have personally spent ~7k USD on hardware for the CI and I have been offered reimbursement from the Debian project for my next ~5k USD in spending. That has given us a good foundation, but we could do more to improve hardware support if we had more funding available.Please consider donating to the Debian Project [1] if you wish to support their efforts.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;donations reply ssivark 14 hours agorootparent> but to fill out the rest of the architecture matrix I have been personally buying GPUs.

The fact that you are funding it out of pocket is seriously calling into question AMD’s commitment. What am I missing here? reply neilv 12 hours agorootparentI think Debian is one of the first places AMD should be looking to fund for ROCm.Especially if there&#x27;s already motivated capable volunteer labor, and all they need is equipment, and maybe a devrel point of contact.The cost seems like a few peanuts dug out of the sofa cushions, on a strategic push like this. reply bick_nyers 24 minutes agorootparentprevThank you for your service, breaking the NVIDIA monopoly on AI will only be possible from the efforts of people such as yourself.May I ask, why isn&#x27;t AMD providing GPUs beyond RDNA 2&#x2F;3 for you? Is it just because that is considered the priority as those are the newer cards?I have an RX 580 8GB at home I would be happy to give you free of charge if you don&#x27;t have access to that card (Polaris 20). reply ksec 13 hours agorootparentprev> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying systems out of my personal funds.

If you want to create standard deb or rpm build script for building in distro build infra, or inside mock, for rpm-based distributions, the cmake build actively makes steps to make it as difficult as possible.There used to be a talk titled something like \"How to make distribution maintainers hate you\" (I cannot find a link to in now); it seems that ROCm developers have seen it, took it to their hearts and then wrote several new chapters themselves.That&#x27;s building. Do not even think about testing.There&#x27;s a reason why it took distributions years to package it (still not done completely).

I think AMD will fix this eventually, but today you need to use Instinct.We will post more information explaining how this works in the next few weeks.The middle section of the blog post above includes some details including GEMM&#x2F;memcpy performance, and some of the software layers that we needed to write to run on AMD. reply dotnet00 20 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s nice to hear that there are actual results to show, since AMD execs simply saying that ROCm is a priority isn&#x27;t really convincing anymore given their track record on claims regarding support on the consumer side. reply viewtransform 19 hours agorootparentThe difference this time is that the executive is from Xilinx. Xilinx has had an AI software development team for a while in the FPGA space.AMD has had poor management in the GPU computing space since Raja Koduri&#x27;s time (he put the best engineering resources on VR during his tenure and ignored deep learning). Subsequent directors have not had a long term vision and left within a few years.Looks like Lisa Su has corrected this now - they seem to have moved AMD software engineers en masse to work under Xilinx management on AI. Remains to be seen if this new management hierarchy will have a better vision and customer focus. reply tbruckner 20 hours agoparentprevI would really hope you could get decent utilization on ops as fundamental as GEMM&#x2F;memcpy on a single device. Translating that to MFU is a completely different story. reply gdiamos 20 hours agorootparentWe get good utilization at scale as well. Typically 30-40% of peak at the full application level for training and inference.Perf isn&#x27;t the biggest problem though, many AI chips can do this or a bit better on benchmarks, if you invest the engineering time to tune the benchmark.The really hard part is getting a complete software stack running.It took us over 3 years because many of the layers just didn&#x27;t exist, e.g. scale out LLM inference service that supports multiple requests with fine-grained batching across models distributed over multiple GPUs.On Instinct, ROCm gets you the ability to run most pytorch models on one GPU assuming you get the right drivers, compilers, framework builds, etc.That&#x27;s a good start, but you need more to serve a real application. reply mgaunard 20 hours agorootparentPeople have been using their GPGPUs for decades on a variety of scientific applications, and there are all kinds of hybrid and multi-device frameworks that exist (often supporting multiple backends).The difference is that it didn&#x27;t get a lot of love as part of the overhyped python LLM movement. reply gdiamos 20 hours agorootparentCompletely agree, I&#x27;d love to see some of the innovations from HPC move over into their LLM stack.We are working on it, but it takes time.Contributions to foundational layers like ROCBlas, pytorch, slurm, Tensile, huggingface, etc would help. reply jauntywundrkind 18 hours agoparentprev> If you want to try this out, one big issue is that software support is hugely different on Instinct vs Radeon.

They might just care about Instinct, where margins are so high, and ignore consumer cards or making more friction and segmentation for consumer cards.Part of what made CUDA so successful was that the low hardware barrier to entry created such a popular offering. Everyone used it. I really hope AMD realizes that, and really hope AMD invests in consumer card software too.

All AMD would have to do to eat into Nvidia marketshare is remove the hardware locks in low-end cards and ship one with 64GB+ of VRAM.This of course would only work if they have comparable&#x2F;usable software support.

This time, I need to see major projects in my application areas working on AMD before I buy, because AMD has taught me that \"trust us\" and \"just around the corner\" can mean \"10 years later and it still hasn&#x27;t happened.\" I&#x27;m pretty sure that this time is different, but the green tax is dirt cheap compared to learning this lesson the hard way, so I&#x27;m letting others jump first this time. reply kldx 19 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ve shipped two commercial products based on it which still works perfectly today on all 3 desktop platforms from all GPU vendors... what&#x27;s not to love?In my experience, if commercial products involved any sort of hand-optimized, proprietary OpenCL, one would be shocked by the lack of documentation and zero consistency across AMD&#x27;s GPUs. Intel has SPIRV and Nvidia has PTX and this works pretty well. But some AMD cards support SPIR or SPIRV, and some don&#x27;t and this support matrix keeps changing over time without a single source of truth.Throw in random segfaults inside AMD&#x27;s OpenCL implementation and you have a fun day debugging!Dockerizing OpenCL on AMD is another nightmare I don&#x27;t want to get into. Intel is literally installing the compute runtime and mapping `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;dri` inside the container. On paper, AMD has the same process but in reality I had to run `LD_DEBUG=binding` so many times just to figure out why AMD runtime breaks inside docker.There may be great upsides to AMD&#x27;s hardware in other domains though reply Conscat 20 hours agoparentprevOpenCL isn&#x27;t very useful now that we have Vulkan. Its biggest advantage is that there exist C++ compilers for its kernels. But AMD&#x27;s OpenCL runtime inserts excessive memory barriers not required by the spec (they won&#x27;t fix this due to Hyrum&#x27;s Law) and Vulkan gives you more control over the memory allocation and synchronization anyways.

In theory there&#x27;s nothing preventing good compilation to Vulkan compute shaders, in practice people just aren&#x27;t doing it, as CUDA actually works today.I also agree that Vulkan is more promising than OpenCL. With recent extensions, it has real pointers (buffer device address), cooperative matrix multiplication (also known as tensor cores or WMMA), scalar types other than 32 bits, proper barrier (including device-scoped, needed for single pass scan), and other important features. reply cpill 20 hours agorootparentprevAI libs could use it and we&#x27;d break the bonds in CUDA.

You can learn CUDA off any consumer nvidia card and have it translate to the fancier gear, that&#x27;s part of why nvidia has so much mindshare.Eg I can write my cuda code with my 3090s, my boss can test it on his laptop&#x27;s discrete graphics, and then after that we can take the time to bring it to our V100s and A100s and nothing really has to change. reply jauntywundrkind 17 hours agorootparentprevApologies for the snark, but maybe it&#x27;s better that so far AMD has had terrible consumer card support. What little hardware they have targeted seems to be barely stable & barely work for the very limited workloads that are supported. If regular consumers were told their GPUs would work for GPGPU, they might be rotten pissed when they found out what the real state of affairs is.But if AMD really wants a market impact - which is what this submission is about - getting good support across a decent range of consumer GPUs is absolutely required. They cannot win this ecosystem battle with only datacenter mindshare. reply dingi 9 hours agorootparentprevGood luck man! Its your money to waste. reply jauntywundrkind 17 hours agoparentprevVirtualization is such a key ability. I really really lament that it&#x27;s been tucked away, in a couple specific products (The last MxGPU is, what, half a decade old? More? Oh I guess they finally spun off a new one, an RDNA2 V620!).I keep close & cherish a small hope that for some use-cases we might get a soft virtualization-alike that just works. I don&#x27;t know enough to say how likely this is to adequately work, but in automotive & some other places there are nested Waylands, designed to share hardware. You still need a shared OS layer, a shared kernel, and a compositor that manages all the subdesktops - this isn&#x27;t full virtualization - but hypothetically you get something very similar to virtualized&#x2F;VDI gpus, if you can handle the constraints.This is really a huge huge huge shift that Wayland has potentially enabled, by actually using kernel resources like DMA-BUFs and what not, where apps can just allocate whatever & pass the compositor filehandles to the bufs. Wayland is ground up, unlike X&#x27;s top down. So it&#x27;s just a matter of writing compositors smart enough to push what data from whom needs to get rendered and sent out where.I would love to know more about what hardware virtualization really buys, know more about the limitations of what VDI is possible in software. But my hope is, in not too long, there&#x27;s good enough VDI infrastructure that it&#x27;s basically moot whether a gpu has hardware support. There will be some use cases where yes every users needs to run their own kernel & OS, and that won&#x27;t be supported (albeit virtio might workaround even that quite effectively), but for 95% of use cases the more modern software stack might make this a non-issue. And at that point, these companies might stop having such expensive-ass product segmentation, charging 3x as much to have a couple hardware virtual devices, since in fact it costs them essentially nothing & the software virtualization is so competitive. reply ElectronBadger 1 hour agoprevReally?

Same for using modified versions of ROCm on APUs, it&#x27;s just no one has been willing to invest in paying a few developers to work on broader hardware support full-time, thus any bugs outside enterprise Linux distros on Radeon MI series cards do not get triaged. reply freeone3000 19 hours agorootparentprevROCm on Vega only works on certain motherboards because the card lacks a synchronization clock over the PCI bus. They added it on some later cards. It’s absurd how much is lacking and inconsistent. reply gdiamos 20 hours agorootparentprevInstinct has much better SW support today than Radeon, so you would need to send MI210s&#x2F;etc .I think it&#x27;s at the point where if you are comfortable with GEMM kernels, setting up SLURM, etc it is usable. But if you want to stay at the huggingface layer or higher, you will run into issues.Many AI researchers are higher level than that these days, but some are still of us willing to go lower level. reply spacecadet 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this. I tried to do some computing with AMD server grade cards 2 years ago and found all of the API so out of fate and the documentation equally out of date... Went CUDA and didnt look back. Sad, cause Im an AMD fanboy of old. reply tysam_and 20 hours agorootparentprevIt seems like Hotz and co are able to move pretty well on it, so maybe there&#x27;s some low-level stuff they&#x27;re using (or maybe they&#x27;re forced to for a few reasons) w.r.t. the tinybox, but it is impressive how much they&#x27;ve been able to do so far I think. :3e.g. Why not...A key part of progress is choosing the direction to progress in. Flashy knee-jerk moves like that sound good but it isn&#x27;t the fastest way to move forward. The first step (which I think they&#x27;ve taken) is for the executives to align on what the market wants. The second is to work out how to achieve it, the third to do it. Handing out freebies would probably help, but it&#x27;ll take sustained long term strategy for AMD to make money.AMD&#x27;s problem isn&#x27;t low-level developer interest. The George Hotz video rant on AMD was enlightening - the interest is there and the official drivers just don&#x27;t work. A few years ago I made an effort to get in to reinforcement learning as a hobby and was blocked by AMD crashes. At the time I assumed I&#x27;d done something wrong. I still believe that, but I&#x27;m less certain now. It is possible that the reason AMD is doing so poorly is just that their code to do BLAS is buggy.People get very excited about CUDA and maybe everything there is necessary, but on AMD the problem seems to be that the card can&#x27;t reliably multiply matrices together. I got some early nights using Stable Diffusion because everything worked great for an hour then the kernel paniced. I didn&#x27;t give AMD any feedback because I run an unsupported card and OS - effectively all cards and OSs are unsupported - but if that is widespread behaviour it would be a grave blocker.I think they are serious now though. The ROCM documentation dropped a lot of infuriating corporate waffle recently and that is a sign that good people are involved.

Note that &#x27;graphic cards&#x27; is no longer a proper identifier either, they just happen to have display connectors on them (and not even all of them).

The central concept is that the decision to launch a workgroup is made by a programmable controller, rather than just being a cube of (x, y, z) or downstream of triangles. A particular workload it would likely excel at is sparse matrix multiplication, including multiple quantization levels like SpQR[1]. I&#x27;m hopeful that it could be an advance in execution model, but also a simplification, as I believe a lot of the complexity of the current GPU model is because of lots of workarounds for the weak execution model.I&#x27;m not optimistic about this being built any time soon, as it requires rethinking the software stack. But it&#x27;s fun to think about. I might blog about it at some point, but I&#x27;m also interested in connecting with people who have been thinking along similar lines.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2306.03078 reply nyanpasu64 5 hours agoparentI heard Unreal Nanite built a job queue system on compute threads (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eviSykqSUUw&t=1611s), would that help with your use case or not? reply JonChesterfield 19 hours agoparentprevA workgroup&#x2F;kernel can launch other ones without talking to the host. Like cuda&#x27;s dynamic thing except with no nested lifetime restrictions. This is somewhat documented under the name HSA.Involves getting a pointer to a HSA queue and writing a dispatch packet to it. Same interface the host has for launching kernels - easier in some ways (you&#x27;ve got the kernel descriptor as a symbol, not as a name to dlsym) and harder in others (dynamic memory allocation is a pain). reply raphlinus 19 hours agorootparentYeah, dynamic memory allocation from GPU space seems to be the real sticking point. I&#x27;ll look into HSA queues, that looks very interesting, thanks. reply johncolanduoni 20 hours agoparentprevHow does this differ from CUDA’s dynamic parallelism, which lets you launch kernels from within a kernel? reply raphlinus 20 hours agorootparentThere are a lot of similarities, but the granularity is finer. The idea is that you make a decision to launch one workgroup (typically 1024 threads) when the input is available, which would typically be driven by queues, and potentially with joins as well, which is something the new work graph stuff can&#x27;t quite do. Otherwise the idea of stages running in parallel, connected by queues, is similar.

Have you tried using yaml as the format with the models instead of JSOn? Feel like you&#x27;ll use far fewer tokens to describe the same thing. Perhaps it&#x27;s a bit more forgiving as well.EDIT: Just tried using the decorator to output a fairly complex pydantic model and it failed with \"magentic.chat_model.openai_chat_model.StructuredOutputError: Failed to parse model output. You may need to update your prompt to encourage the model to return a specific type.\"I typically try to give examples in the pydantic Config class, perhaps those could be piped in for some few-shot methods, and also have some iteration if the model output is not perfectly parseable to correct the output syntax.. reply jackmpcollins 10 hours agoparentYes, I&#x27;m working on allowing few-shot examples to be provided as part of defining the prompt-function, which should help in cases like this. Unfortunately from my testing just now it appears that OpenAI ignores examples added to the model config.In the meantime, have a look at the ValidationError traceback which might highlight a specific field that is causing the issue. Some options to resolve the issue might be: the type for this field could be made more lenient (e.g. str); the `Annotated` type hint could be used to give the field a description to help correct the error [0]; the field could be removed. You could also try using gpt-4 by setting the env var MAGENTIC_OPENAI_MODEL [1].If none of these help resolve it or it appears to be an issue with magentic itself please file a github issue with an example.

Some other commenters have suggested it does something interesting by implying \"AI will provide the logic,\" whereas \"pass\" doesn&#x27;t necessarily do that. reply inpaner 5 hours agorootparentprevIn code, using ... implies that the code is yet to be written. pass means it&#x27;s explicitly a noop. reply fbnbr 12 hours agoprevI think the comments on great api design got me thinking of a world in which you can have multiple of these frameworks orchestrate together.

If you look inside `@prompt` it&#x27;s creating a `PromptFunction` instance which I think would be a similar API to what you would end up with without using decorators https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jackmpcollins&#x2F;magentic&#x2F;blob&#x2F;afdb22513385b... reply 3abiton 8 hours agorootparentI never got on board of decorators in python, but you sold me on it. reply jwestbury 5 hours agorootparentAnother really good use is performance metrics -- decorators to track execution time, for instance, with the ability to specify things like function groups, logic concepts, etc. It makes it trivial to add this sort of observability to your code. reply dragonwriter 21 hours agoparentprevLooking at the code, it looks like it is a way to support typing; just making it a function with the string template would let you return a dynamically-defined function but I think would make it harder to get static typing. reply zainhoda 20 hours agoprevNice! I’m going to try it out and possibly integrate it into my Python package: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanna.ai reply conor_f 22 hours agoprevLooks super cool! A few questions:1) Can you get the actual code output or will this end up calling OpenAI each function call? 2) What latency does it add? What about token usage? 3) Is the functionality deterministic? reply jackmpcollins 20 hours agoparent1) The OpenAI API will be queried each time a \"prompt-function\" is called in python code. If you provide the `functions` argument in order to use function-calling then magentic will not execute the function the LLM has chosen, instead it returns a `FunctionCall` instance which you can validate before calling.2) I haven&#x27;t measured additional latency but it should be negligible in comparison to the speed of generation of the LLM. And since it makes it easy to use streaming and async functions you might be able to achieve much faster generation speeds overall - see the Async section in the README. Token usage should also be a negligible change from calling the OpenAI API directly - the only \"prompting\" magentic does currently is in naming the functions sent to OpenAI, all other input tokens are written by the user. A user switching from explicitly defining the output schema in the prompt to using function-calling via magentic might actually save a few tokens.3) Functionality is not deterministic, even with `temperature=0`, but since we&#x27;re working with python functions one option is to just add the `@cache` decorator. This would save you tokens and time when calling the same prompt-function with the same inputs.---1) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jackmpcollins&#x2F;magentic#usage 2) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jackmpcollins&#x2F;magentic#asyncio 3) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;functools.html#functools.c... reply pedrovhb 15 hours agoprevJust wanna say, that&#x27;s pretty great API design :) reply retrovrv 21 hours agoprevSuper cool!

These would probably each be an existing library that implements generating structured output like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;outlines-dev&#x2F;outlines or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;guidance-ai&#x2F;guidance. If you have ideas how this should be done let me know - on a github issue would be great to make it visible to others. reply jackmpcollins 21 hours agorootparentOh, and some companies offer APIs that match the OpenAI API and there are some open-source projects that do this for llama running locally. Since those would be compatible with the openai python package they will work with magentic too - though some of these do not support function calling.See for example Anyscale Endpoints https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.endpoints.anyscale.com&#x2F;landing and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AmineDiro&#x2F;cria reply michaelmior 17 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also LocalAI[0] which allows the use of local LLMs with an OpenAI compatible API.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-skynet&#x2F;LocalAI reply jackmpcollins 11 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing!

I hacked a smaller version of this together when I built an LLM app with Elixir. Honestly, the async by default of Ex is so much better suited to this stuff, especially as it’s just api calls.Tempted to have a go at porting these ideas. Should be v doable with the macro system. reply BoorishBears 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve personally found frameworks like this to get in the way of quality COT: It&#x27;s rare for a prompt that takes great advantage of the LLM&#x27;s reasoning to fit in the format these generators encourageA friend mentioned how terrible most cold email generators are at actually generating natural feeling emails. It just took asking him questions about how actual people in marketing come up with emails to come up with a chain of thought that produces intentionally uncanny emails for a wide range of inputs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentry.co&#x2F;54hbzIt&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t technically fit what I described into bunch of comments (or an obnoxiously long multiline comment), but it&#x27;d be bulky and not conducive to general happiness of anyone involved.I much prefer repurposing Nunjucks templates to keep all of that a separate document that&#x27;s easy to manage with version control reply jackmpcollins 19 hours agoparentWith magentic you could do chain-of-thought in two or more steps: one function that generates a string output containing the chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, and a second that takes that output and converts it to the final answer object. I agree though that this is not encouraged or made obvious by the framework.The approach I&#x27;m encouraging with this is to write many functions to achieve your goal. So in the case of your email writing example you might have some of the following prompt-functions - write key bullet points for email about xyz -> list[str] - write email based on bullet points -> str - generate feedback for email to meet criteria abc -> str - update email based on feedback -> str - does email meet all criteria abc -> bool And between these you could have regular python code check things like blacklist&#x2F;whitelist of keywords, length of paragraphs, and even add hardcoded strings to the feedback based on these checks. reply BoorishBears 12 hours agorootparentWhy would you add a second function for the answer object when you can return an answer object in the same response as the chain of thought?Overall your second approach makes for really terrible UX and dramatically weakens the performance at the task unless you go and repeat every single definition along the way: ensuring you now have X copies of the prompt spread across the code base and have blown up your token count.Once you get to that level of granularity between calls, you&#x27;ve pretty much fall back into doing a slower more expensive version of NLP pre-ChatGPT. reply pphysch 21 hours agoprevThis is neat.

    "originBody": "PAPERS, PLEASE! The Identity Project ABOUT EDUCATION LITIGATION ACTION CONTACT JUN 26 2023 9th Circuit rejects TSA claim of impunity for checkpoint staff who rape travelers Last December, we attended and reported on oral argument before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a case in which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) argued that TSA checkpoint staff have absolute immunity from lawsuits for assault, even sexual assault or rape, committed against travelers they are “screening”. We’re pleased to report that today the 9th Circuit panel of judges rejected the TSA’s claim of impunity. The three judges found unanimously that the Federal Tort Clams Act (FTCA) allows lawsuits against the TSA for damages caused by checkpoint staff who assault travelers. The 9th Circuit thus joins every other Circuit Court of Appeals (the 3rd, 4th, and 8th) to have addressed this issue in a published opinion. The case decided today by the 9th Circuit will now return to the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas for much-belated consideration of the claim against the TSA and its officers. The precedent set by today’s decision will apply throughout the 9th Circuit, the largest of the Federal judicial circuits, including all of the states on the West Coast. Kudos to Jonathan Corbett, Esq., who has represented the plaintiffs in each of these cases. Coals for Christmas to the TSA for continuing to argue for impunity for its staff to one Circuit Court after another, despite the growing weight of precedent against the agency and, perhaps more importantly, the moral repugnance of arguing that any agents of the government should be entitled to assault or rape members of the public with impunity.

However, congress has created exceptions to sovereign immunity, and the ruling is that the TSA is included in those exceptions. reply SoftTalker 21 hours agoparentThat is not what TFA says: the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) argued that TSA checkpoint staff have absolute immunity from lawsuits for assault, even sexual assault or rape, committed against travelers they are “screening”.That clearly says TSA staff, not the TSA itself. Is that summary of the argument wrong? reply blindhippo 21 hours agorootparentDigging a bit more into the links I found this:Instead, the TSA has argued that, even if all of the allegations in Ms. Leuthauser’s complaint are true, the TSA and its employees have absolute impunity. Regardless of what “torts”, even rape, TSA checkpoint staff commit against travelers, the government claims that Federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear lawsuits or consider claims against them.So TSA is claiming immunity for both staff and the agency. I didn&#x27;t read the actual judgement, but I&#x27;m guessing the grandparent comment has that covered. reply gruez 21 hours agorootparentThat might be a different case. If you look the court&#x27;s opinion for this case[1], it explicitly says it&#x27;s not about whether the TSA officer can be sued.>Whether Leuthauser can state a claim against TSO Serrano under Bivens is not at issue in this appeal\"Leuthauser\" is the plaintiff, \"TSO\" stands for \"Transportation Security Officer\"[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov&#x2F;datastore&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;2... reply enragedcacti 20 hours agorootparentBivens is not the only possible way to sue a federal employee individually.

Maybe there&#x27;s justification for protection from assault due to physical altercations while attempting to restrain someone. There is NEVER reasoning for rape. FULL FUCKING STOP. Seriously, WTF is wrong with people for a) suggesting it in the first place, and b) ratifying it into accepted policy reply sublinear 19 hours agorootparent> Maybe there&#x27;s justification for protection from assault due to physical altercations while attempting to restrain someone.I don&#x27;t know the details of this particular case that would lead to claims of rape. But, I do know that certain types of search on someone&#x27;s person can be... invasive.... especially if they&#x27;re suspected of smuggling. I can certainly see how that kind of search becomes a rape claim.It&#x27;s literally the textbook definition of rape to search someone like that with the threat of physical harm. The legal difference is the context and intent.There is a gray area here people don&#x27;t want to talk about, but TFA is lying by omission if this is the kind of case at hand. reply cgriswald 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really see the gray area here.We live in a world where x-ray machines are ubiquitous. There&#x27;s zero reason we need to have government-committed legalized rape at the airport, regardless of context or intent. reply cloverich 18 hours agorootparentX ray&#x27;s are likely not specific enough; more over if the x ray is positive a cavity search is perhaps next anyhow. A CT has too much radiation and an MRI would be cost prohibitive. That&#x27;s my guess.Then there&#x27;s cases of legitimate foreign bodies anyways, e.g. a tampon full of fentanyl or something comparable. The X ray won&#x27;t help there. reply cgriswald 18 hours agorootparentCustoms already uses x-rays for this exact purpose. reply sublinear 15 hours agorootparentAnd if the x-ray finds drugs and the suspect doesn&#x27;t want to take it out themselves?

Saying \"pretty please\" is a waste of time. reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentIdeally the person with drugs in their body would be sent to a hospital where medical professionals would handle extracting whatever needed to be removed in a way that didn&#x27;t cause harm to the person.I can&#x27;t imagine when it would ever be necessary for a random TSA thug to go elbow deep in someone to rummage around for a balloon filled with drugs that could rupture and kill them. replyben_w 18 hours agorootparentprevWould this be analogous to the way that \"being shot dead by a police officer in the course of their duties\" isn&#x27;t \"murder\"?(I am not a lawyer, don&#x27;t rely on random people on the internet for legal advice, especially when the word &#x27;analogy&#x27; is involved, etc.). reply sublinear 15 hours agorootparentYes.

You&#x27;re a hero in those cases. reply Spooky23 19 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a matter of law, not conscience.

I can&#x27;t find any analyses that contradict this or cases where individual agents are sued rather than the agency (outside of bivens cases which are about constitutional violations and supersede federal law).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;jm&#x2F;civil-resource-manual-33-immunity... reply dmvdoug 18 hours agoparentprevThat’s not right. The suit is against the United States, not the TSA. The Federal Tort Claims Act waives the United States’ sovereign immunity in certain limited cases. One of those is if an intentional tort is committed by “investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States.” The question here was do Transportation Security Officers count as investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States. Court: they do. Therefore, the waiver of sovereign immunity applies. reply wnoise 19 hours agoparentprevIt looks like the screener was certified as acting under the scope of their duties pursuant to the Westfall act, and thus the TSA was substituted as the defendant. reply HumblyTossed 21 hours agoparentprevSuccinct. Thank you. reply xp84 22 hours agoparentprevThank you for this great, succinct analysis! reply JumpCrisscross 23 hours agoprevNote: this is a question of the TSA&#x27;s liability, not the alleged rapist&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a question of whether sovereign immunity is waived under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and turns on whether TSA staff are \"investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States\" [1].The ruling seems reasonable. But it wasn&#x27;t the no-brainer the title seems to imply it was.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov&#x2F;datastore&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;2... reply tssva 22 hours agoparentThe TSA has raised these arguments in 4 separate circuits and now have lost in 4 separate circuits.

I wouldn&#x27;t confuse prolixity for ambiguity, in case that was your point. reply dreamcompiler 19 hours agoprevIANAL but it looks like the TSA partially self-owned here.As the court document [0] points out, there exists a “law enforcement proviso,” which waives sovereign immunity for torts such as assault and battery committed by “investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government.” In other words, government cops can be sued for assault and battery. TSA said \"our people aren&#x27;t cops, so they can&#x27;t be sued.\" The court said \"Aha! You gave them badges! So they&#x27;re cops!\" (I&#x27;m oversimplifying -- the badges were just one piece of evidence the court cited).Back in 2008, the TSA made a big deal about giving their people badges so they would be more respected by the public [1]. The court document even points this out and provides the [now dead] link to the press release. There was a bit of PR blowback then because most members of the public didn&#x27;t think TSA screeners deserved badges. But the TSA insisted that they did, so now they have badges.So that means they can be sued.

This is especially true when the substituted word sounds like the word most lawyers would use. It makes the author sound like he doesn&#x27;t understand that this is a term of art. It might add variety to the piece, but when I&#x27;m reading reporting on legal matters, I&#x27;d rather see terms of art used throughout, rather than have the author \"mix it up\" with these sorts of substitutions. reply dragonwriter 19 hours agorootparent> Sure, but when you&#x27;re reporting on a legal development, it makes sense to use the appropriate legal terms.If you are reporting for a lay audience it makes sense, esepcially in a headline, to use the common English that best conveys the impact.

But more importantly, no one ever claimed impunity.

Sovereign immunity is immunity for a state itself [2]. In 1946, the U.S. waived its sovereign immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act [3] under certain circumstances.

But one thing to consider is it’s effectively a jobs programHow was transferring the security function from private industry to the federal government a jobs program? Its an airline-industry subsidy (and it was lobbied for by the industry for exactly that reason in the wake of 9&#x2F;11), both by making the government responsible for the direct cost of the function and by the government absorbing (or, via sovereign immunity, eliminating) legal liability for both abuses in carrying the function out and failures resulting in harms to travelers and third parties. reply wk_end 21 hours agorootparentWhen people say \"dissolve the TSA\", they don&#x27;t mean: \"I want all the security theatre, it&#x27;s just that I want private industry to do it\". They mean: \"eliminate the security theatre, thus vastly decreasing the number of people employed to perform security theatre operations\". It&#x27;s a jobs program because all of theatre needs a huge number of bodies to perform the play. reply jghn 21 hours agorootparentYes, exactly this. Further, its a jobs program because it allows for an easy vector to add *more* jobs by adding *more* theater and by and large the citizens are willing to accept it. Because who wants to argue against safety? reply Akronymus 20 hours agorootparentArguably the TSA is actually reducing security by breaking locks on gun cases and such. reply toast0 21 hours agorootparentprevThe existing security function was transferred, but the scope&#x2F;intensity increased.What used to be two, maybe three people running a metal detector and an x-ray machine for parcels, is now probably ten people running a lot more equipment, a lot slower.I&#x27;m not convinced we need the intensity of inspection that we have, especially when passenger education in real time was enough to foil the targeting of the 4th plane, and locked cockpit doors and policy changes should foil hijackings without the participation of the pilots. It&#x27;s a huge cost for a small benefit. reply bagels 19 hours agorootparentprevAirport security used to be two people operating a single metal detector.Now it&#x27;s dozens of people operating xrays, body scanners, metal detectors, searches, etc. reply kbelder 20 hours agorootparentprev>How was transferring the security function from private industry to the federal government a jobs program?By making it much less efficient. reply AYBABTME 21 hours agorootparentprevThey could clean the streets instead, that&#x27;d be a better use of money and everyone&#x27;s time. reply jghn 21 hours agorootparentAs I&#x27;ve noted elsewhere in the thread, somehow \"clean the streets\" is considered to be \"evil socialism\" to half the country but \"stand around looking bored by the security line\" is not. And that&#x27;s why it is the way it is. reply rurp 20 hours agorootparentprevBut the \"work\" they do at the TSA wastes immense amounts of time and property, as well as causing untold amounts of stress on people who do actually productive things. Putting them to work planting trees or some other useful activity would be far better for everyone. reply MichaelDickens 20 hours agorootparentprevI would much rather the government paid people money to dig ditches and fill them back in, or even just give them the money for free, rather than paying people to actively make others&#x27; lives worse. reply bagels 21 hours agorootparentprevGive them jobs fixing roads then. reply Aloha 22 hours agorootparentprevAlso the job still needs to be done, be it TSA or something else. reply mindslight 21 hours agorootparentprevFix potholes?

In contrast \"defend our people from evil terrorists\", either via TSA or military, does not get the same scrutiny. reply toast0 21 hours agorootparentSure, some of those sound like socialism, but not fixing roads, and I don&#x27;t think cleaning up transit stations either (but of course, having transit stations could be considered socialism, and making therefore making the stations better could be too).Hell, making roads nice and making nice parks sounds a lot like &#x27;make america great again&#x27; to me. But maybe I&#x27;m not conservative enough to be the sounding board. reply jghn 21 hours agorootparentAgain, I 100% agree with this too. And yet I guarantee that it&#x27;d be excoriated on Fox News. reply mindslight 21 hours agorootparentprevSure, that&#x27;s called culture.

The proto-fascist culture where the only uses of government are domination and control shouldn&#x27;t be encouraged. reply jghn 21 hours agorootparentAgain, 100% agreed. But for someone wondering \"why do we pay these people?\", this is the answer. reply nullc 15 hours agorootparentprevStack blocks or some other completely pointless activity: TSA isn&#x27;t just worthless, by massively slowing down air travel and making it less enjoyable it provides negative value.

Some of it could be due to international travel, but I don&#x27;t think that explains departure security.In the US, there&#x27;s basically nothing different. I did fly NL to Germany, and back, and it was the same (obviously still international, but within EU). It seems not that many people fly domestic in NL, and there&#x27;s little reason for relaxed security (who cares if they got stabbed in NL instead of Germany?)So I don&#x27;t understand what would be cut. If the freaking dutch are doing most of the same B.S., are we really out of order? Sure we can&#x27;t have liquids, but isn&#x27;t this only mildly bizarre and annoying? reply wand3r 22 hours agoprevAdjacent&#x2F;Off Topic: It&#x27;s really time we disband or seriously curtail the TSA. Plane travel in the US is absurd. I understand that it is s jobs scheme&#x2F;work program welfare, but this makes air travel extremely difficult. At a minimum policy should be reworked around shoes & liquids and the TSA itself should be used to optimize efficiency. reply radicalcentrist 22 hours agoparentCalling it a jobs program is overly generous. It&#x27;s broken windows fallacy. Considering the ineffectiveness of the TSA as shown by multiple audits, opportunity cost of waiting in security lines, lost revenue to airlines, and increased road fatalities due to flight aversion, it&#x27;s a massive net loss to the economy for no actual benefit to safety. reply anigbrowl 21 hours agorootparentExtremely relevant, albeit somewhat dated by now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brown.edu&#x2F;Departments&#x2F;Economics&#x2F;Faculty&#x2F;Glenn_Lo...I don&#x27;t know why nobody has maintained this line of inquiry in the nearly 20 years since this was published. reply Aloha 22 hours agoparentprevWhat do you replace it with?Before you answer - consider the Status Quo prior to 9&#x2F;11, it was private security, run by individual airlines or groups of airlines as needed. It was not (always) centralized and often was only done at the gate point.Is the issue with TSA or TSA policies?I think we can relax TSA policy some, certainly at least on shoes - though many travelers will still need to remove shoes before the shoe has an internal metal support. reply something168581 21 hours agorootparent9&#x2F;11 was not a result of lax security in airports, but lacking security measures onboard planes themselves which have since been addressed with reinforced locking cockpit doors being sealed before departure, etc.It&#x27;s been proven time and time again even by other government agencies that it is trivially easy to sneak \"dangerous\" things (including knives and firearms) through TSA checkpoints onto planes. The current state of airport \"security\" in the USA is 110% theatre which taxpayers and travelers pay through the nose for. reply Aloha 21 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not even gonna go into if lax security was at the root of 9&#x2F;11, I think it was certainly contributory but definitely not causal.That does not answer my question - we dismantled the previous system and subsumed private sector expertise in airline security into TSA - so if not TSA, who should be doing it and how should it be done?Like I think we could just as well have TSA doing it with policies returned back to 2000 (though I&#x27;m skeptical of rolling back the clock that much)?Like, I don&#x27;t disagree with the idea that TSA is about 50% theatre - it is, its meant to make Bob and Eileen from Cedar Rapids who fly twice a decade feel safe. reply KerrAvon 21 hours agorootparentThe two things that have made airplane travel safer since 2001:1. reinforced cockpit doors2. widespread knowledge among passengers that you have to actively fight the hijackers instead of letting them alone (previously, the assumption was that they just want to fly to Cuba or something and it was safer to let them do that and get off the plane)That&#x27;s it.TSA screening is worth nothing, costs taxpayers and businesses enormous amounts of time and money, and is a gigantic abuse vector. Dissolve it and replace it with a simple metal detectors and X-ray machine regime to check for obvious cases of idiots carrying firearms onto the plane; anything more than that is a waste of taxpayer money. reply Aloha 21 hours agorootparent(Edited) Right, okay, but who should operate those things? reply petsfed 20 hours agorootparentI would be supportive of a smaller, better selected, better trained, better compensated cadre of TSA agents. I think a lot of the reason why the TSA is so ineffective, and why so much of the airport experience is just theater, comes down to the fact that it is just a jobs program for people who could not get a job guarding the local mall. reply Aloha 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t actually think TSA can shrink by a substantial amount and still carry out even the reduced mission we&#x27;ve discussed here. You still need roughly the same number of people operating X-Ray and Magnetometers that you have operating body scanners and X-Rays now, it would go somewhat faster, but not vastly faster, the flow thru say, PreCheck and Regular TSA is within 15% of each other.I think there is an assumption here that the &#x27;theatre&#x27; component adds lots of people to TSA, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, just from my own observations - and having some understanding of how you move volumes of people thru a space.For efficiency - I&#x27;m gonna make the assumption that we&#x27;re still gonna keep a distinction between the airside and landside, and not put ID check back on the airlines at the gate.Lets look at the staffing of a single TSA checkpoint -1) Before the queue, you have a guy filtering precheck vs not - that guy could prolly go away. so -1 here.2) At the end point of the queue, you have the guy doing ID verification and boarding pass check, that step is probably still needed here. So 0 - no change.3) Pre Magnetometer Assist - This is the person helping pax put their belongings on the belt for going thru the magnetometer, its not always present, but usually is when they&#x27;re busy. So 0 - no change.4) X-Ray Operator, the person operating the X-Ray. So 0, no change.5) Team of two people operating the magnetometer. I see no way to reduce this, you need someone to do a pat down for those who fail the magnetometer, so it&#x27;s usually a pair of men and women. Again 0 - no change6) 1-3 people to perform hand inspections of bags that look questionable on the X-Ray. You maybe could reduce this? it depends on the particulars of the details of the inspection.7) Supervisor. Even in an ideal world, you still need a supervisor, plus the supervisor probably helps give breaks and fills in missing coverage on the short term when people are late.Now while I can believe that the people at the checkpoints are just the tip of the proverbial TSA iceberg, This is the part that seems even harder to reduce, in any meaningful way.The long and the short of this, is I don&#x27;t think TSA can reduce its size in any meaningful way, airlines used to do all this threat analysis themselves in some level of isolation. Now its all centralized, without a probable meaningful level of change in employment. reply petsfed 17 hours agorootparentI wonder if there&#x27;d be fewer abuses by the TSA (especially theft, but also assault and harassment) if they had the resources to hire better people. Maybe there is still an opportunity to reduce staff if the quality of the staff still increases. reply Aloha 17 hours agorootparentI wonder what the actual incidents of these are, I suspect it&#x27;s very low - figure that ~2m people fly in the states every day. Also, its not just TSA that has the chance to steal, airline employees do too, because they ferry the bags to the inspection and from it.The issue for me isn&#x27;t that TSA does bad things, it&#x27;s like the whole debate over LE in the US - Law Enforcement Agencies cannot be held to reasonable account when their employees do bad things. Thats the real issue at hand here. reply Ridj48dhsnsh 13 hours agorootparentprevThe airlines, either themselves or through contracted private security. replyanigbrowl 21 hours agorootparentprevThere was one - count it - case of an attempted shoe bombing, which failed dismally. Billions of travelers have had to take off their shoes and have them scanned by x-ray ever since. This is wildly, pathologically irrational. reply Aloha 21 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree with the idea that TSA is about 50% theatre - it is, its meant to make Bob and Eileen from Cedar Rapids who fly twice a decade feel safe.my shoes must be removed anyhow, because they will cause the magnetometer to go off.Generally I agree with you - like we don&#x27;t make people with PreCheck take them off - so why make everyone else? reply sentientslug 21 hours agorootparentI think the logic is that precheck requires a background check and interview. I don’t have it so I’m not certain. reply Aloha 20 hours agorootparentThere is no interview, its just a fingerprinting. reply toast0 21 hours agorootparentprevThe OP called for disbanding or curtailing. Allowing for a single agency to carry out the 9&#x2F;10 status quo would be curtailing. And I think that would be sufficient.Or you could phase back into airport authorities running the security, but allow for centralized policies and audit. Having local authority subject to central audit and consequences might be a lot better than central authority subject to central audit and no effective consequences. reply Aloha 20 hours agorootparentI flagged on disband, not on curtail and was questioning that - but its clear some of the parallel commenters do want disband - not just curtail.Yeah, I&#x27;m fine with getting rid of the millimeter wave body scanners, the rules on liquids, all of that noise. I think it should be a little more stringent (meaning still centralized scanning, and you can&#x27;t go thru unless you can go thru a magnetometer clean or get a pat down) than pre-9&#x2F;11 - but much less than the theatre we have now. reply macinjosh 21 hours agorootparentprevNothing? reply Aloha 21 hours agorootparentSo, something different than the pre-2001 status quo? reply rolph 21 hours agorootparentprevno joke intended, some peoples shoes are so beyond nasty, that i would anticipate removal would trigger a chem hazard, or pathogen alert. reply nh23423fefe 22 hours agoparentprevbut have you considered terrorism? how will we fight them at the airport instead of american streets? reply rolph 22 hours agorootparentim not trying to roast you, but i cant find any indication that TSA procedures, policies, or persons, have stopped any terrorist incident.if you have, please share, as it looks like TSA in the present form is used for something other than transport safety, and duplicates many CBP functions. reply justrealist 21 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m strongly in favor of massively de-scoping the TSA, but let&#x27;s be real — if you could blow up a passenger plane by mailing a bomb, with no screening whatsoever, it would have been tried a few times. It&#x27;s silly to discount the deterrent effect.There are not terrorists lurking behind every door, but there are certainly disgruntled people who would do damage if there were no consequences or inhibitions. reply rolph 20 hours agorootparentthe war probably had a major deterrent effect as well. reply throwbadubadu 21 hours agorootparentprevIs this irony? reply P_I_Staker 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve yet to see much differences in my travels.

Despite the article clearly being written to make it sound like the agents are also free from consequences this is solely about the agency itself.That said every time they have made their sovereign immunity claim it has been resoundingly rejected at the federal circuit level so it would be the decent human thing to do to just acknowledge culpability rather than constantly fighting it. reply macinjosh 21 hours agoparentprev [–] On the one run by American military and security empire. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Not bad at all! ST INTERNALS Before writing the tool, I considered relying on time(1) and strace(1). However I was not completely satisfied with them. If time(1) invoked via /usr/bin/time -v could retrieve child processes stats and show peak RSS, I wanted PSS. Also, I wanted to see PSS over time. Likewise, strace -f could follow child processes but it had a tremendous performance overhead and did not show the command invoked by clone upon fork/thread creation. In the end, I wrote my own tool and called it st (for space-time). The data sources are as follows. CPU time/ Kernel time relies on waitpid(2) and getrusage(2). PSS over time relies on sampling proc(5)(/proc/PID/smaps) on a regular interval. Following process/thread creation is done via netlink(7). WORKING WITH NETLINK Following processes lifecycle via netlink proved more challenging than expected, mainly because of poor documentation (maybe because netlink needs root anyway?). If I managed to dig out process-events.txt from a mailing list and found a working sample exec-notify.c, there wasn't much more around. One series of articles did stand out. Natan Yellin's blog[4][5][6][7]. is a gem. Among many excellent insights, he clarified[8] the less than intuitive values provided by netlink for parent-gid and parent-pid which saved me a lot of time. Hopefully, st's(source code) will add a little extra clarity to netlink.

With C&#x2F;C++ allowing separate compilation, the compiler invocation that creates the entrypoint doesn&#x27;t know about all of these static constructors.- Therefore Collect2 pretends to be ld; when invoked, it tries to call the real ld and examines its output- It creates a c file with a table containing any constructor symbols it finds, then compiles that- Finally it links the program again, together with the new object file¹: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gccint&#x2F;Collect2.html reply o11c 54 minutes agoparentI&#x27;m pretty sure the documentation actually lies though.Yes, `collect2` exists, but with the existence of all the modern linker sections and scripts, it simply forwards everything to `ld` unchanged.

After years of constant updates and neverending new features, the modern desktop operating system has evolved into a slow, complex mess. Let's try something different. Efficient with resources. Essence will happily run on low-powered hardware. It can take less than 30MB of drive space, and boot with even less RAM. No tasks run in the background, giving your applications all the space they need. Open source. All the code is made available under the MIT license. You can browse through the source on the GitLab repository. If you're interested in contributing, join our Discord server to discuss ideas with other developers. October ’21 demo. Watch a demonstration of the system running on real hardware. Recorded in October 2021. This demo was aired at Handmade Seattle 2021. You can watch it on their website, at media.handmade-seattle.com/essence. Amazing performance. Essence starts up in seconds and shuts down instantly, even with old hard drives. You'll wonder how you ever put up with anything else. Breathtaking. The user interface is completely vector-based, so it looks great on any monitor. All styling information is kept in a separate file, which can be replaced with a custom theme. Essence is still in development. There are many things that need work, and there's lots that can change. If you're interested in the project, join our Discord server, or directly support development on Patreon. Made, primarily, by nakst. My homepage. Images from Unsplash and Anthony Boyd Graphics.",

Other distros put in loads of work too, but it just feels more consistent, like a KDE distro with all the KDE bells and whistles (KDE is a good example of what I&#x27;d like to see, an OS with default apps that all really blend together and feel like a part of one OS).Funnily enough, you don&#x27;t get this \"unity\" or whatever you want to call it that I&#x27;m describing with Windows at all. They have random legacy ways of doing things, Windows is starting to look like a hacked together Linux OS with how inconsistent the main OS apps tend to be.Edit:Maybe if Microsoft stopped letting Marketing Teams dictate what goes on Windows, and focused more on polishing their OS.

They still don&#x27;t. Elementary OS turned down numerous funding opportunities, numerous partnership opportunities. They made a really really great OS. But the business aspect was just atrocious.The \"Pay what you want\" model could have worked for their store. But just having a store in the beginning they didn&#x27;t want one and then they pivoted to having one way late. There was big internal strife in the eOS Community amongst the developers for years, and very little conflict resolution on their part.I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re an example of a failed funding model.

On the other hand, once a drawing API is available, it is easier to map some form of vector graphics encoding which calls corresponding drawing instructions. At the same time, this would also solve scaling issues. reply TkTech 1 hour agoparentprev> Are UI components in an OS usually programmed and not created in an image editor and then tiled?These days, it&#x27;s almost always vector graphics.

If the BCM didn&#x27;t boot, the doors wouldn&#x27;t unlock nor would the key or PTS start the engine.The user-facing infotainment crap is not necessary for the \"car\" part to function. You could physically remove it and the car would still be drivable. reply pmarreck 1 hour agorootparentprevThere should be a key you can hold down which would mean \"skip all enumeration and assume everything is exactly as it was the last time you booted\" (with a brief warning to the user about the possible risks introduced by this) reply yjftsjthsd-h 1 hour agorootparentIf we&#x27;re going that route, I&#x27;d like a bootloader-supplied kernel option that defaults to enabled (ideally with the GRUB&#x2F;whatever menu having am option to disable it. reply TkTech 1 hour agorootparentprevIf you turn off quiet boot, you&#x27;ll see an impressive list of things getting started up, many of which the kernel isn&#x27;t in full control of.

In the long term a seamless form of virtualization similar to Parallels Coherence could be explored as a way to run foreign apps on their host OS. This would be a short-medium term solution to the &#x27;no apps&#x27; problem that dogs any new OS effort.(2) Limit hardware support scope by targeting a few target platforms. I&#x27;d suggest Linux-oriented laptop vendors like System76 and Framework, the Raspberry Pi, and a few other familiar things with related ethos.(3) Look at using foreign drivers such as those from Linux or BSD via a compatibility API.

Brian Merchant’s new book, “Blood in the Machine,” argues that Luddism stood not against technology per se but for the rights of workers in the face of automation. By Kyle Chayka September 26, 2023 Illustration by Nicholas Konrad / The New Yorker; Source photographs from Getty On December 15, 1811, the London Statesman issued a warning about the state of the stocking industry in Nottingham. Twenty thousand textile workers had lost their jobs because of the incursion of automated machinery. Knitting machines known as lace frames allowed one employee to do the work of many without the skill set usually required. In protest, the beleaguered workers had begun breaking into factories to smash the machines. “Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken,” the newspaper reported. In response, the government had garrisoned six regiments of soldiers in the town, in a domestic invasion that became a kind of slow-burning civil war of factory owners, supported by the state, against workers. The article was apocalyptic: “God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin.” The workers destroying the lace frames were the group who called themselves Luddites, after Ned Ludd, a (likely fictional) knitting-frame apprentice near Leicester who was said to have rebelled against his boss by destroying a frame with a hammer. Today, the word “Luddite” is used as an insult to anyone resistant to technological innovation; it suggests ignoramuses, sticks in the mud, obstacles to progress. But a new book by the journalist and author Brian Merchant, titled “Blood in the Machine,” argues that Luddism stood not against technology per se but for the rights of workers above the inequitable profitability of machines. The book is a historical reconsideration of the movement and a gripping narrative of political resistance told in short vignettes. The hero of the story is George Mellor, a young laborer from Huddersfield who worked as a so-called cropper, smoothing the raised surface of rough cloth with shears. He observed the increasing automation of the industry, concluded that it was unjust, and decided to join the insurgent Luddite movement. A physically towering figure, he organized his fellow-workers and led attacks on factories. One factory owner who was targeted was William Horsfall, a local cloth entrepreneur. Horsfall threatened to ride his horse through “Luddite blood” in order to keep his profitable factories going, hiring mercenaries and installing cannons to defend his machines. In the background of the story, figures such as the ineffectual Prince George, a sybaritic regent for his infirm father, George III, and Lord Byron, the poet, who voiced his sympathy for the Luddites in Parliament, debate which side to support: owners or workers. Byron exhorted the workers in his poem “Song for the Luddites” to “die fighting, or live free.” Merchant ably demonstrates the dire stakes of the Luddites’ plight. The trades that had sustained livelihoods for generations were disappearing, and their families were starving. A Lancashire weaver’s weekly pay dropped from twenty-five shillings in 1800 to fourteen in 1811. The market was being flooded with cheaper, inferior goods such as “cut-ups,” stockings made from two pieces of cloth joined together, rather than knit as one continuous whole. The government repeatedly failed to intervene on behalf of the workers. What option remained was attacking the boss’s capital by disabling the factories. The secretive captains of the Luddite forces took on the pseudonym General Ludd or King Ludd, which they used to write public letters and to sign threats of attacks. The spectre of violence led some factory owners to abandon their plans for automation. They reverted to manual labor or closed up shop completely. For a time, it seemed that the Luddites were making headway in empowering themselves over the machines. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Swift Justice: A Taliban Courtroom in Session The book offers plenty of satisfying imagery for the twenty-first-century reader experiencing techlash. Merchant argues that the message of Luddism is just as relevant today, as our lives become increasingly enmeshed with digital platforms, from TikTok to Uber and Instacart, that translate our labor and attention into profit, “overlaying a sort of psychic factory onto its workers’ lives.” (Who hasn’t at times wished to take a hammer to their MacBook?) The Luddites sought revenge against the innovation that was holding them hostage. In Merchant’s telling, they were activists, punks, and masked celebrities standing up for the skilled working class, the successors to Robin Hood, another product of Nottingham. “Luddite” by that measure sounds like a compliment. “Blood in the Machine” is being published just as we are facing a new wave of technological automation centering on artificial intelligence—which some, including the consulting firm McKinsey, have labelled the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Merchant uses anachronistic terms like “startup” and “tech titan” to describe early factories and entrepreneurs, seeking to draw parallels with the present. (The book’s analytical sections are weaker than its narrative ones.) The “labor-saving technology” of today threatens new categories of jobs: customer service is being performed by chatbots; Amazon is selling e-books written by ChatGPT. Designers and illustrators are losing jobs to image generators; translators are being asked to “clean up” transcripts generated by A.I. The profusion of dubious A.I.-generated content resembles the badly made stockings of the nineteenth century. At the time of the Luddites, many hoped the subpar products would prove unacceptable to consumers or to the government. Instead, social norms adjusted. Both the mass-manufactured products and the regimented jobs that produced them quickly became entrenched. The Luddites watched as sprawling factory buildings rose over their rural towns, concentrating labor that had traditionally been performed independently in the home or small workshops. The working conditions in those factories, often staffed by children, were execrable; the horror stories that emerged, of mangled limbs and bodies, eventually helped encourage reform. The victims of automation today are less immediately obvious. ChatGPT users can’t see the low-paid content moderators in countries such as Kenya who undergird the program’s output, performing an onerous psychological task that studies have shown can induce P.T.S.D. There is no single machine that can be smashed to disable artificial intelligence. If the physical server farms that host A.I. programs were attacked, the software could simply be hosted elsewhere. What’s more, the foundation of A.I. is the raw material that humanity has already labored to produce: reams of text and images that programs process into patterns and then remix into fresh “content.” Unlike the machines of the first Industrial Revolution, A.I. does not necessarily need more input; it can sustain itself. “Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” Sam Altman, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, recently told The Atlantic. The tragedy of the Luddites is not the fact that they failed to stop industrialization so much as the way in which they failed. In the end, Parliament “sided decisively with the entrepreneurs,” as Merchant writes, and frame-breaking was made a capital offense. Dozens of workers were executed for Luddite activities, including, in January of 1813, fourteen in one brutal day. George Mellor, the Luddite captain, was eventually convicted of assassinating Horsfall, the factory owner, and was hanged, at the age of twenty-three. Human rebellion proved inadequate against the pull of technological advancement. “Blood in the Machine” suggests that although the forces of mechanization can feel beyond our control, the way society responds to such changes is not. Regulation of the textile industry could have protected the Luddite workers before they resorted to destruction. One proposal suggested a tax on every yard of cloth made by machine. After a pro-worker bill failed to pass in the House of Lords, Gravener Henson, a frame knitter turned advocate and historian, led an association of workers that demanded higher wages and labor protections, though such “combination” was outlawed at the time in the U.K. Eventually, Luddism faded into a more general political movement. By the late nineteenth century, the majority of Nottingham’s lace production had been mechanized. In the era of A.I., we have another opportunity to decide whether automation will create advantages for all, or whether its benefits will flow only to the business owners and investors looking to reduce their payrolls. One 1812 letter from the Luddites described their mission as fighting against “all Machinery hurtful to Commonality.” That remains a strong standard by which to judge technological gains. ♦ New Yorker Favorites A hookup app for the emotionally mature.

    "commentBody": "Rethinking the LudditesHacker NewspastloginRethinking the Luddites (newyorker.com) 219 points by Hooke 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite473 comments klik99 3 hours agoI heard Brian Merchant on 99% Invisible and this take is slight historical revisionism, but I&#x27;m ok with that.It&#x27;s revisionist because he&#x27;s conflating the earlier movement when workers tried to negotiate with factory owners and organize with the Luddite movement. True - the failure of the first movement led to Ludditism out of desperation, but the groups are separate. Luddite literally is named after Ned Ludd smashing machinery, so it cannot be the name of the movement that was around organizing and negotiation because they only turned to smashing when organizing was made illegal. Basically workers tried to negotiate, were stymied, and a bunch of frustrated people started smashing machines, which caused a positive reaction from people so it started spreading and others started smashing stuff too.When I first heard of Ludditism it was with more nuance that it&#x27;s used today - to be a Luddite was to rage against technology with the art of a bull in a china shop. It wasn&#x27;t a blanket term against \"anti-progress\" like it is now, but rather a dumb approach to dealing with change. Of course now it is used just to shut down people who don&#x27;t like technology, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ok with some amount of revisionism, since the way it&#x27;s being used currently is revisionist itself.The only danger in conflating these legit concerns about automation with a violent movement is this implication that violence is the only way to bridge this gap, and I can see a strong argument that is was true back in those days, due to the Crown literally making any organizing and collective negotiation illegal, I strongly don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true today. I believe a violent reaction today would cause more harm to workers rights than help. reply creer 12 hours agoprevThe luddite example is one of suddenness: The owners see the massive advantage of mechanization and move in fast. The workers are blindsided - they don&#x27;t have the time and spend all the time they do have in a ludicrous war. The regions are somewhat mono-industry which completes in making a giant mess. All in all the exact quandary not to get caught in. Now that they have demonstrated it, long ago, do we really have to fall in the same problem again and again? Just because it didn&#x27;t happen in the US, or in this century, doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t learn from it.People at all level should do better using the time there is. For the ones (workers) to move up or away in their skills. For the others (businesses) to recognize a looming availability of human workforce which might be useful for some (other) business opportunity. For the third (governments) to - just in time - organize or encourage re-training at scale and in time. Trying to impose on each business to manage this whole world by itself is idiotic - normal business is tough and precarious enough. Trying to let each worker manage their own training is also insufficient: few people can optimally manage their own career at the same time as everything else.An example in this direction is, I believe, Denmark&#x27;s \"Flexicurity\". Firms can adapt to follow their needs; while workers can in general principle retain earnings while they retrain; while the state orchestrates availability of training (which itself can be a big industry sector). No doubt not perfect for anyone, but the general idea sounds solid. reply xorcist 4 hours agoparentYour comments fall into exactly the trap the article talks about. The luddites were painted as being against automation. That&#x27;s only partially true, at best. Destroying machines was not the point. It was just the only thing that hurt and got remembered.It was not layoffs that caused the revolts much worsening working conditions. They wanted things like getting paid in the promised time frame, and not having their children killed. It seems the protests were sprawling and later integrated every disappointment under the sun.The other side took that as an opportunity to paint them as being generally anti progressive and against all forms of mechanization, but from what I understand there&#x27;s not much to suggest that was actually true. Yes, machines were broken but so were a lot of other things as the protests turned violent.Our lesson from the luddies should be that winners write history, we should not reiterate a centuries old smear campaign. reply creer 3 hours agorootparent> It was not layoffs that caused the revolts much worsening working conditions.I read the article (twice - it&#x27;s interesting), and I wrote \"spend all the time they do have in a ludicrous war\".For the workers of the time it looked probably like a fast combination of things. Which the author kinda summarizes as \"the inequitable profitability of machines\". Things likely included: at first a boom in employment: the factories started at the same time the old, somewhat distributed production method mostly continued - but probably with minimal worker freedom of choice as to who went to which. Then layoffs as the old method just about disappears and more factories start or fail in seemingly (to the workers) random occurences. Then working conditions as factories no doubt did not start safe or comfortable. Then like you say every complaint under the sun.I don&#x27;t think it matters actually: the workers reacted to upheaval and probably felt they had no time to be heard. That&#x27;s the complaint we hear now: \"The current jobs are going and that&#x27;s not right\". That&#x27;s the point of my response: \"How does that help anything or anyone?\".

Let&#x27;s remember that the earlier machines were very crude, safety was absolutely not in their design, and a worker life&#x27;s also didn&#x27;t have much weight. So, the early days of machine assisted production were in inhumane conditions, people losing limbs, kids getting killed in them (less skills needed also meant kid labour was a viable option) etc.So yes, regulation on how the machines work, how much they get introduced, how the workers are impacted, trial periods to see the impacts etc. should help a lot in all respects.

The benefit for the businesses are astronomical as all those jobs get turned into direct profit. Meanwhile the workers get the change to... upskill? Yeah, so they just have to “upskill” forever while the businesses get free profit because they sit on the means of automation. (Remind me how the businesses have to put in work, here?

The overruling theme being a well connected, organized minority will always rule over a disorganized and disinterested majority.Machiavelli too had many interesting ideas, in particular how the elite moved through the various forms of government. A monarch decays into a despot and is eventually overtaken by an aristocracy of nobles which decays into democracy over a few generations which has a very short life and takes on the darker side of “rule by few” as an oligarchy. Eventually they become so decadent that a populist government (rule by many, the darker side of democracy) overtakes them and soon after a new prince, or monarch “of the people” is born and the cycle continues possibly over many hundreds of years.Looking at America I think we are in the oligarchical phase and pushing hard towards a populist whom will reform the government dramatically. reply shanusmagnus 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m really interested in these views that view these human systems almost as physical systems, with semi-legible dynamics and complex (but comprehensible) interactions, and even implications.

Without explicit end goals and objectives that when met will trigger the dissolution of the program&#x2F;agency&#x2F;project as having successfully completed their mission, they end up existing to find reasons to exist. We see it everywhere today.For example, at one point 50 years ago it was decided that we needed to do things to get more females into universities - a noble goal. So we set up a variety of things that made it more accessible to females and the things we did were successful. The way we did this is questionable (lower standards for females, in part) but they accomplished the goals. But we still have these systems setup and the people who run them have become entrenched and organized and any motion to dismantle them is met with aggression. You can extrapolate this well beyond females.So we end up in a situation where more and more people find a prime mechanisms of elite credentialism (elite universities) as unfair and meaningless. And our pool of elites are weaker and unable to defend themselves against the rise of populism since so many of them aren&#x27;t actually elites in reality, even if they pretend they are or believe they are being oblivious to all the artificial mechanisms that put them there in the first place.Anyways, the book \"The Machiavellians\" is a good read. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Machiavellians-Defenders-Freedom-Jame... replysunday_serif 15 hours agoparentprevWe have already introduced so many automations into our lives in the past century.

I feel that this is basically what you and others are doing when you compare writing or illustration to digging holes. You&#x27;re seriously misunderstanding the economy of these fields. Productivity has almost nothing to do with the market for art or writing. What matters is the quality of a work (very hard to measure and deeply ingrained in our psyche) and the attention a work receives (Software engineers should be more familiar with this. It is the \"algorithm\" people love to disparage). We had more than enough productivity already in these spaces. Does giving people a content firehose actually do anything to these markets? Have you read any books written using AI? Do you know and follow any AI artists? Is anyone besides Nvidia and OpenAI making money here?I understand the appeal of the models, and as a software engineer I&#x27;ve gotten at least some use out of them. But even in that space I have to wonder if producing more code is a net positive. There&#x27;s a lot of drawbacks to producing more code. There&#x27;s more chances to write bugs, more you have to document and maintain, and you&#x27;re potentially overlooking simpler and more elegant solutions.I guess all I&#x27;m trying to say is when you say this is just a hole digger, you&#x27;re glossing over a lot of nuance. reply dale_glass 5 hours agorootparent> Do we measure software engineers in terms of their lines of code per day?

A more properly commercial version of the above. From my limited experience there&#x27;s demand to pump out work quickly and as cheaply as possible. Eg, a book may need a cover or a few illustrations, or an ad might need something drawn on it. In many cases the client is basically looking for a hole to fill. The cases where somebody wants to have something truly beautiful that lots of effort went into seem vanishingly rare.

    "originBody": "Arena allocator tips and tricks September 27, 2023 Over the past year I’ve refined my approach to arena allocation. With practice, it’s effective, simple, and fast; typically as easy to use as garbage collection but without the costs. Depending on need, an allocator can weigh just 7–25 lines of code — perfect when lacking a runtime. With the core details of my own technique settled, now is a good time to document and share lessons learned. This is certainly not the only way to approach arena allocation, but these are practices I’ve worked out to simplify programs and reduce mistakes. An arena is a memory buffer and an offset into that buffer, initially zero. To allocate an object, grab a pointer at the offset, advance the offset by the size of the object, and return the pointer. There’s a little more to it, such as ensuring alignment and availability. We’ll get to that. Objects are not freed individually. Instead, groups of allocations are freed at once by restoring the offset to an earlier value. Without individual lifetimes, you don’t need to write destructors, nor do your programs need to walk data structures at run time to take them apart. You also no longer need to worry about memory leaks. A minority of programs inherently require general purpose allocation, at least in part, that linear allocation cannot fulfill. This includes, for example, most programming language runtimes. If you like arenas, avoid accidentally create such a situation through an over-flexible API that allows callers to assume you have general purpose allocation underneath. To get warmed up, here’s my style of arena allocation in action that shows off multiple features: typedef struct { uint8_t *data ptrdiff_t len; } str; typedef struct { strlist *next; str item; } strlist; typedef struct { str head; str tail; } strpair; // Defined elsewhere void towidechar(wchar_t *, ptrdiff_t, str); str loadfile(wchar_t *, arena *); strpair cut(str, uint8_t); strlist *getlines(str path, arena *perm, arena scratch) { int max_path = 1item = pair.head; tail = &(*tail)->next; } return head; } Take note of these details, each to be later discussed in detail: getlines takes two arenas, “permanent” and “scratch”. The former is for objects that will be returned to the caller. The latter is for temporary objects whose lifetime ends when the function returns. They have stack lifetimes just like local variables. Objects are not explicitly freed. Instead, all allocations from a scratch arena are implicitly freed upon return. This would include error return paths automatically. The scratch arena is passed by copy — i.e. a copy of the “header” not the memory region itself. Allocating only changes the local copy, and so cannot survive the return. The semantics are obvious to callers, so they’re less likely to get mixed up. While wpath could be an automatic local variable, it’s relatively large for the stack, so it’s allocated out of the scratch arena. A scratch arena safely permits large, dynamic allocations that would never be safe on the stack. In other words, a sane alloca! Same for variable-length arrays (VLAs). A scratch arena means you’ll never be tempted to use either of these terrible ideas. The second parameter to new is a type, so it’s obviously a macro. As you will see momentarily, this is not some complex macro magic, just a convenience one-liner. There is no implicit cast, and you will get a compiler diagnostic if the type is incorrect. Despite all the allocation, there is not a single sizeof operator nor size computation. That’s because size computations are a major source of defects. That job is handled by specialized code. Allocation failures are not communicated by a null return. Lifting this burden greatly simplifies programs. Instead such errors are handled non-locally by the arena. All allocations are zero-initialized by default. This makes for simpler, less error-prone programs. When that’s too expensive, this can become an opt-out without changing the default. See also u-config. An arena implementation An arena suitable for most cases can be this simple: typedef struct { char *beg; char *end; } arena; void *alloc(arena *a, ptrdiff_t size, ptrdiff_t align, ptrdiff_t count) { ptrdiff_t avail = a->end - a->beg; ptrdiff_t padding = -(uintptr_t)a->beg & (align - 1); if (count > (avail - padding)/size) { abort(); // one possible out-of-memory policy } ptrdiff_t total = size * count; char *p = a->beg + padding; a->beg += padding + total; return memset(p, 0, total); } Yup, just a pair of pointers! When allocating, all sizes are signed just as they ought to be. Unsigned sizes are another historically common source of defects, and offer no practical advantages in return. Case in point exercise for the reader: Change each ptrdiff_t to size_t in alloc, find the defect that results, then fix it. The align parameter allows the arena to handle any unusual alignments, something that’s surprisingly difficult to do with libc. It’s difficult to appreciate its usefulness until it’s convenient. The uintptr_t business may look unusual if you’ve never come across it before. To align beg, we need to compute the number of bytes to advance the address (padding) until the alignment evenly divides the address. The modulo with align computes the number of bytes it’s since the last alignment: extra = addr % align We can’t operate numerically on an address like this, so in the code we first convert to uintptr_t. Alignment is always a power of two, which notably excludes zero, so no worrying about division by zero. That also means we can compute modulo by subtracting one and masking with AND: extra = addr & (align - 1) However, we want the number of bytes to advance to the next alignment, which is the inverse: padding = -addr & (align - 1) Add the uintptr_t cast and you have the code in alloc. The if tests if there’s enough memory and simultaneously for overflow on size*count. If either fails, it invokes the out-of-memory policy, which in this case is abort. I strongly recommend that, at least when testing, always having something in place to, at minimum, abort when allocation fails, even when you think it cannot happen. It’s easy to use more memory than you anticipate, and you want a reliable signal when it happens. An alternative policy is to longjmp to a “handler”, which with GCC and Clang doesn’t even require runtime support. In that case add a jmp_buf to the arena: typedef struct { char *beg; char *end; void **jmp_buf; } arena; void *alloc(...) { // ... if (count > (avail - padding)/size) { __builtin_longjmp(a->jmp_buf, 1); } // ... } bool example(..., arena scratch) { void *jmp_buf[5]; if (__builtin_setjmp(jmp_buf)) { return 0; } scratch.jmp_buf = jmp_buf; // ... return 1; } example returns failure to the caller if it runs out of memory, without needing to check individual allocations and, thanks to the implicit free of scratch arenas, without needing to clean up. If callees receiving the scratch arena don’t set their own jmp_buf, they’ll return here, too. In a real program you’d probably wrap the setjmp setup in a macro. Suppose zeroing is too expensive or unnecessary in some cases. Add a flag to opt out: void *alloc(..., int flags) { // ... return flag&NOZERO ? p : memset(p, 0, total); } Similarly, perhaps there’s a critical moment where you’re holding a non-memory resource (lock, file handle), or you don’t want allocation failure to be fatal. In either case, it important that the out-of-memory policy isn’t invoked. You could request a “soft” failure with another flag, and then do the usual null pointer check: void *alloc(..., int flags) { // ... if (count > (avail - padding)/size) { if (flags & SOFTFAIL) { return 0; } abort(); } // ... } Most non-trivial programs will probably at least one of these flags. In case it wasn’t obvious, allocating an arena is simple: arena newarena(ptrdiff_t cap) { arena a = {0}; a.beg = malloc(cap); a.end = a.beg ? a.beg+cap : 0; return a; } Or make a direct allocation from the operating system, e.g. mmap, VirtualAlloc. Typically arena lifetime is the whole program, so you don’t need to worry about freeing it. (Since you’re using arenas, you can also turn off any memory leak checkers while you’re at it.) If you need more arenas then you can always allocate smaller ones out of the first! In multi-threaded applications, each thread may have at least its own scratch arena. The new macro I’ve shown alloc, but few parts of the program should be calling it directly. Instead they have a macro to automatically handle the details. I call mine new, though of course if you’re writing C++ you’ll need to pick another name (make? PushStruct?): #define new(a, t, n) (t *)alloc(a, sizeof(t), _Alignof(t), n) The cast is an extra compile-time check, especially useful for avoiding mistakes in levels of indirection. It also keeps normal code from directly using the sizeof operator, which is easy to misuse. If you added a flags parameter, pass in zero for this common case. Keep in mind that the goal of this macro is to make common allocation simple and robust. Often you’ll allocate single objects, and so the count is 1. If you think that’s ugly, you could make variadic version of new that fills in common defaults. In fact, that’s partly why I put count last! #define new(...) newx(__VA_ARGS__,new4,new3,new2)(__VA_ARGS__) #define newx(a,b,c,d,e,...) e #define new2(a, t) (t *)alloc(a, sizeof(t), alignof(t), 1, 0) #define new3(a, t, n) (t *)alloc(a, sizeof(t), alignof(t), n, 0) #define new4(a, t, n, f) (t *)alloc(a, sizeof(t), alignof(t), n, f) Not quite so simple, but it optionally makes for more streamlined code: thing *t = new(perm, thing); thing *ts = new(perm, thing, 1000); char *buf = new(perm, char, len, NOZERO); Side note: If sizeof should be avoided, what about array lengths? That’s part of the problem! Hardly ever do you want the size of an array, but rather the number of elements. That includes char arrays where this happens to be the same number. So instead, define a countof macro that uses sizeof to compute the value you actually want. I like to have this whole collection: #define sizeof(x) (ptrdiff_t)sizeof(x) #define countof(a) (sizeof(a) / sizeof(*(a))) #define lengthof(s) (countof(s) - 1) Yes, you can convert sizeof into a macro like this! It won’t expand recursively and bottoms out as an operator. countof also, of course, produces a less error-prone signed count so users don’t fumble around with size_t. lengthof statically produces null-terminated string length. char msg[] = \"hello world\"; write(fd, msg, lengthof(msg)); #define MSG \"hello world\" write(fd, MSG, lengthof(MSG)); Enhance alloc with attributes At least for GCC and Clang, we can further improve alloc with three function attributes: __attribute((malloc, alloc_size(2, 4), alloc_align(3))) void *alloc(...); malloc indicates that the pointer returned by alloc does not alias any existing object. Enables some significant optimizations that are otherwise blocked, most often by breaking potential loop-carried dependencies. alloc_size tracks the allocation size for compile-time diagnostics and run-time assertions (__builtin_object_size). This generally requires a non-zero optimization level. In other words, you will get a compiler warnings about some out bounds accesses of arena objects, and with Undefined Behavior Sanitizer you’ll get run-time bounds checking. It’s a great complement to fuzzing. In theory alloc_align may also allow better code generation, but I’ve yet to observe a case. Consider it optional and low-priority. I mention it only for completeness. Arena size and growth How large an arena should you allocate? The simple answer: As much as is necessary for the program to successfully complete. Usually the cost of untouched arena memory is low or even zero. Most programs should probably have an upper limit, at which point they assume something has gone wrong. Arenas allow this case to be handled gracefully, simplifying recovery and paving the way for continued operation. While a sufficient answer for most cases, it’s unsatisfying. There’s a common assumption that programs should increase their memory usage as much as needed and let the operating system respond if it’s too much. However, if you’ve ever tried this yourself, you probably noticed that mainstream operating systems don’t handle it well. The typical results are system instability — thrashing, drivers crashing — possibly necessitating a reboot. If you insist on this route, on 64-bit hosts you can reserve a gigantic virtual address space and gradually commit memory as needed. On Linux that means leaning on overcommit by allocating the largest arena possible at startup, which will automatically commit through use. Use MADV_FREE to decommit. On Windows, VirtualAlloc handles reserve and commit separately. In addition to the allocation offset, you need a commit offset. Then expand the committed region ahead of the allocation offset as it grows. If you ever manually reset the allocation offset, you could decommit as well, or at least MEM_RESET. At some point commit may fail, which should then trigger the out-of-memory policy, but the system is probably in poor shape by that point — i.e. use an abort policy to release it all quickly. Pointer laundering (filthy hack) While allocations out of an arena don’t require individual error checks, allocating the arena itself at startup requires error handling. It would be nice if the arena could be allocated out of .bss and punt that job to the loader. While you could make a big, global char[] array to back your arena, it’s technically not permitted (strict aliasing). A “clean” .bss region could be obtained with a bit of assembly — .comm plus assembly to get the address into C without involving an array. I wanted a more portable solution, so I came up with this: arena getarena(void) { static char mem[1<< 28]; arena r = {0}; r.beg = mem; asm (\"\" : \"+r\"(r.beg)); // launder the pointer r.end = r.beg + countof(mem); return r; } The asm accepts a pointer and returns a pointer (\"+r\"). The compiler cannot “see” that it’s actually empty, and so returns the same pointer. The arena will be backed by mem, but by laundering the address through asm, I’ve disconnected the pointer from its origin. As far the compiler is concerned, this is some foreign, assembly-provided pointer, not a pointer into mem. It can’t optimize away mem because it’s been given to a mysterious assembly black box. While inappropriate for a real project, I think it’s a neat trick. Arena-friendly container data structures In my initial example I used a linked list to stores lines. This data structure is great with arenas. It only takes a few of lines of code to implement a linked list on top of an arena, and no “destroy” code is needed. Simple. What about arena-backed associative arrays? Or arena-backed dynamic arrays? I have simple, fast, easy solutions for each, but that’s the subject for my next article! c Have a comment on this article?

Often I can just pass a bump pointer allocator or a stack-based allocator and do not care about deallocation of individual objects. I also wrote a simple unit testing framework to test out-of-memory conditions because it&#x27;s easy to do when you&#x27;re in control of allocators. Basically I inject an allocator which calculates how many allocations are done when a unit test is run, and then unit tests are later rerun again by injecting OOM at every known allocation point. A lot of bugs and crashes happen when an OOM is encountered because such paths are rarely tested. The idea of my pet project is a very resilient HTTP server with request-scoped allocations and recovery from OOM without crashes. reply habibur 4 hours agoparentAdding that when many linux distributions face OOM, a killer daemon steps in and might kill your service even if you were handling the situation properly. reply amalcon 4 hours agorootparentInterestingly (confusingly), Linux&#x27;s OOM killer is invoked for a different notion of OOM than a null return from malloc &#x2F; bad_alloc exception. On a 64-bit machine, the latter will pretty much only ever happen if you set a vsize ulimit or you pass an absurd size into malloc. The OOM killer is the only response when you actually run out of memory.If you want to avoid your program triggering the OOM killer all on its own, you need to set up a vsize such that you&#x27;ll get an application level error before actually exhausting memory. Even that isn&#x27;t completely foolproof (obviously anyone with a shell can allocate a large amount of RAM), but in practice -- if your program is the only significant thing on the system -- you can get it to be very reliable this way.Add in some cgroup settings and you should be able to keep your program from being OOM killed at all, though that step is a bit more complex. reply gpderetta 49 minutes agorootparentI wonder if it is possible to avoid OOM by making sure that all allocations are done from a named (on disk, not shm) memory file. This way in principle is always possible to swap to disk and never overcommit.I guess in practice the kernel might be in such dire straits that it is not able to even swap to disk and might need to kill indiscriminately. reply kgeist 1 hour agorootparentprevThe idea is that the server must have a known allocation budget, similar to Java&#x27;s max heap size. There&#x27;s a tree of allocators, i.e. a temporarily created arena allocator needs initial memory for its arena, so it can grab it from the root allocator. And the root allocator ultimately must be fixed-size and deterministic. Sure if there are other processes in the system allocating without concern for other apps, then the OOM killer can kill the server. But if there&#x27;s no such process, I think it should be pretty stable. reply olodus 4 hours agoparentprevOh wow that is a really interesting test solution. That would be an interesting thing to add to all zig tests (I know they already have the testing allocator and good valgrind support but I don&#x27;t think that tests&#x2F;simulates oom).I love things like these that use existing tests and expand the to just test further thing in already covered flows.

PS2 Linux makes full use of it.But the default TLB configuration from the BIOS is just a single static 31MB page (the other 1MB is reserved for the BIOS) and the SDK doesn&#x27;t provide any tooling for dynamic pages.And this is MIPS, so it&#x27;s a software managed TLB with 48 entries. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some games did have dynamic paging, but they would need to provide their own TLB exception handler. reply varispeed 7 hours agoparentprevI recently needed to write a memory allocator and being lazy asked ChatGPT for help.

I have a project with a similar arena allocator, so I&#x27;ll definitely be taking some of these tricks. One thing my allocator does do is organize arenas into a linked list so that you can grow your size dynamically. However I really like the article&#x27;s point that you&#x27;re always going to be living within _some_ memory budget, so you might as well allocate everything up front into a giant arena, and then divide the giant arena up into smaller arenas.Also I&#x27;ve heard that you can save an instruction when checking if your allocator is full by subtracting from the top, and checking the zero flag. It seems to complicate alignment logic. Does that ever end up mattering? reply saagarjha 8 hours agoparent> However I really like the article&#x27;s point that you&#x27;re always going to be living within _some_ memory budget, so you might as well allocate everything up front into a giant arena, and then divide the giant arena up into smaller arenas.That depends. If you’re running on e.g. a video game console where you’re the sole user of a block of pretty much all memory, go ahead. On a system with other things running, you generally don’t want to assume you can just take some amount of memory, even if it’s “just the free memory”, or even “I probably won’t use it so it will be overcommitted”. Changing system conditions and other system pressure are outside of your control and your reservation may prevent the system from doing its job effectively and prioritizing your application appropriately. reply galangalalgol 5 hours agorootparentYeah, profiling is your friend. I forget if it&#x27;s called a sharded slab or a buddy allocator, but the one where you have different preallocated buffers chunked at different sizes. Any time you allocate you are given the smallest chunk that will hold what you asked for. Profiling gives you optimal size boundaries as well as the number of each. Add a safety margin and off you go. Super fast allocation and guaranteed no fragmentation. In a c++ codebase overloading std::new to do this is probably the easiest way to get your allocation performance back and avoid fragmentation. reply maccard 2 hours agorootparentprev> If you’re running on e.g. a video game console where you’re the sole user of a block of pretty much all memoryGames consoles haven&#x27;t been that for a long time.

If you do one big malloc Windows will grow the page file to ensure it can page that much memory in if you start writing to it. That&#x27;s fine if you allocate a couple megabytes, but if your area is gigabytes in size you want to call VirtualAlloc with MEM_RESERVE to get a big contiguous memory area, then call VirtualAlloc with MEM_COMMIT as needed on chunks you actually want to use. reply matheusmoreira 7 hours agoprevExcellent article.> While you could make a big, global char[] array to back your arena, it’s technically not permitted (strict aliasing).Aren&#x27;t char pointers&#x2F;arrays allowed to alias everything?I used that technique in my programming language and its allocator. It&#x27;s freestanding so I couldn&#x27;t use malloc. I had to get memory from somewhere so I just statically allocated a big array of bytes. It worked perfectly but I do disable strict aliasing as a matter of course since in systems programming there&#x27;s aliasing everywhere. reply gpderetta 7 hours agoparentchar can alias everything, i.e. you can deference a char pointer with impunity, even if the actual dynamic type[1] of an object is a different type. The reverse is not true: if the dynamic type of an object is char, just by using the alias rules, you can&#x27;t deference it as an object of a different type.In C++ you can just use placement new to change the dynamic type of (part of ) a char array (but beware of pointer provenance). In C is more complex: I don&#x27;t claim to understand this fully, but my understanding is you can&#x27;t change the type of a named object, but you should be able to change the type of anonymous memory (for example, what is allocated with malloc) by simply writing into it.In practice at least GCC considers the full alias rules unimplementable and my understanding is that it uses a conservative model where every store can change the type of an object, and uses purely structural equivalence.[1] of course most C implementations don&#x27;t actually track dynamic types at runtime. reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparent> The reverse is not true: if the dynamic type of an object is char, just by using the alias rules, you can&#x27;t deference it as an object of a different type.A limitation like that simply makes no sense to me. Everything is a valid char array but I can&#x27;t place structs on top of one? Oh well, nothing I can do about it. I&#x27;ll just keep strict aliasing disabled. If we&#x27;re writing C, it&#x27;s because we want to do stuff like that without the compiler getting clever about it.> you should be able to change the type of anonymous memory (for example, what is allocated with malloc) by simply writing into itWell, in my case, I&#x27;m the one writing the malloc and the buffer is the anonymous memory. I remember months ago I scoured the GCC documentation for some kind of builtin that would allow me to mark the memory as such but there was nothing. I did add some malloc attributes to my allocation function just like TFA suggested but apparently its main purpose is to optimize based on aliasing nonsense which I disabled anyway. reply gpderetta 5 hours agorootparentAt some point you need to get the memory for your pool from somewhere, for example from malloc [1], hence you can safely set the type of the raw memory by writing into it. You can also change that type to some other type, by writing other stuff (so you can reuse the memory). You can also write metadata to it between uses. What you cannot do is having overlapping lifetimes for different types.Making sure that you respect all the underspecified, obscure, and often contradicting rules is not easy, so if you prefer to disable strict-alias, you have my sympathy. For the most part is useful for high performance numerical code, and less advantageous for typical pointer chasing stuff.From the practical point of view, the safest way to implement a custom allocator is to make sure that the compiler can&#x27;t see through it, so separate compilation and no LTO and&#x2F;or launder your pointers through appropriate inline asm.[1] but other &#x27;anonymous&#x27; sources, like mmap, would also work in practice. reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparent> For the most part is useful for high performance numerical code, and less advantageous for typical pointer chasing stuff.Yeah.

I&#x27;ll just keep strict aliasing disabled.Well, yeah. Strict aliasing is less about the incidental values of memory addresses and more about the actual semantics of what you&#x27;re doing. Where writing a struct into the middle of a char array makes no sense because you have no guarantee in the type system that the array is properly sized or aligned to contain that struct. reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparentThe compiler knows the size of statically allocated buffers and can be told about alignments with: __attribute__((aligned(N))) __builtin_assume_aligned(P, N)Is this information sufficient for correct code generation? reply LoganDark 2 hours agorootparentStrict aliasing doesn&#x27;t allow the compiler to magically decide that someplace you are writing happens to be in a statically allocated buffer. Strict aliasing says you have a pointer of some type and what you do with it has to agree with the type of that pointer. replydellorter 7 hours agoparentprevIf you overlay a struct in your (char) buffer and dereference a pointer to it you would be accessing something with a different type than its declared type(char* as struct something *), it’s strict aliasing violationTo do stay in the rules you could set up a void* to suitable region in a linkerscript reply matheusmoreira 6 hours agorootparentWelp.

I always thought it was called \"bump pointer allocation\" since all you do is add to (bump) a pointer. One useful trick when designing a bump allocator is to allocate word size bytes (8 on 64-bit) extra to store object headers in. For example, if you store objects&#x27; sizes in the header you can iterate all allocated objects and you can often also reallocate objects in the middle of the arena without having to free every object. reply yelnatz 8 hours agoprevDidn&#x27;t know these were called Arenas, this technique is prevalent in game development. reply TickleSteve 8 hours agoparentalso called a \"bump\" allocator... because all it does is bump a pointer.nice to use when you have a nicely ordered order of execution where you are guaranteed to always come back to a known position where you can free the entire heap&#x2F;arena at once. (i.e. a typical main message handling loop). reply yxhuvud 7 hours agorootparentYou can however use bump allocation for things that are not arenas. There are some GC allocators that use the technique. reply dgb23 6 hours agorootparentThe JVM GC has a generational model.It first allocates objects into an arena like structure. In a second step, it moves (evacuates) long lived objects into a compact region. The first region gets deallocated at once after.Roughly speaking this leans on a heuristic that most objects are short lived. So it has arena like characteristics, but is of course managed&#x2F;dynamic.This might be one reason why managed languages like Java&#x2F;C# get such good out of the box performance. You really need insight in your program and how it executes to beat this. reply neonsunset 5 hours agorootparentThis is correct. In .NET Gen 0 heap, if there is sufficient space, the allocation is just getting a heap address from threadlocal, bumping an offset, writing object header and methodtable, and returning the pointer (reference). reply naasking 2 hours agorootparentprevAlso called \"regions\". reply bajsejohannes 7 hours agoprev> Typically arena lifetime is the whole programSome other good cases for arenas are rendering of a frame in a video game and handling of a http request.

This sort-of expects that object destruction is a no-op (e.g. no destructors need to be called).The general idea being that you don&#x27;t need to track granular &#x27;per-object lifetimes&#x27;, but only a handful of &#x27;arena lifetimes&#x27;, and all objects share the lifetime of the arena they&#x27;ve been allocated in.Of course it&#x27;s also possible to manually call a destructor on an object in the arena without recycling its memory, but I heavily prefer using plain POD structs without owning pointers and which can be safely &#x27;abandondend&#x27; at any time without leaking memory. reply sixthDot 9 hours agoprevThis globally good, two remarks however:> you don’t need to write destructorsI think this is not accurate. Destructors are not deallocators, they are supposed to set the object field in an invalid state. Now truth is that both are often called together, e.g `delete`.> Typically arena lifetime is the whole program, so you don’t need to worry about freeing itA technic I use is to increment a counter on `arena.alloc` and decrement it on `arena.dealloc`, and then free the memory (if it&#x27;s on the heap) accordingly. reply MathMonkeyMan 9 hours agoparent> > you don’t need to write destructors>> I think this is not accurate. Destructors are not> deallocators, they are supposed to set the object field in> an invalid state. Now truth is that both are often called> together, e.g `delete`.If the object manages some resource other than memory, and if the object&#x27;s lifetime is intended to guard the resource, then a destructor is needed.But if the object manages memory only, as is often the case, and all of that memory came from the arena, then you really don&#x27;t need to call any destructors.This is the approach taken in one C++ [library][1] I&#x27;ve worked with, where objects represented scalar values to be used en masse for spreadsheet-like applications. In those applications (especially in 32-bit mode), being able to omit an allocator pointer and neglect a destructor call made things smaller and faster.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloomberg.github.io&#x2F;bde-resources&#x2F;doxygen&#x2F;bde_api_pr... reply flohofwoe 6 hours agoparentprev> Destructors are not deallocators, they are supposed to set the object field in an invalid state.A typical arena allocator would just reset an offset to zero when the arena is &#x27;freed&#x27; without calling any object destructors, and the allocator wouldn&#x27;t actually have any type information about the objects allocated in the arena (of course you could also write an allocator which registers a destructor function with each allocation, and which would be called before the arena is reset): bla_t* bla = arena_alloc(arena, alignment, size, destructor_func);For C++ style RAII it probably makes more sense to use placement-new, and call the destructor manually to &#x27;invalidate&#x27; the object without recycling its memory (the memory would only be recycled once the arena allocator is reset). reply sylware 6 hours agoprevI tend to avoid to work with data types which require to have a stable virtual address, namely a dynamic base with an offset. Because, mremap.That said, it really depends on the data usage semantics, and one could write a much less costly allocator for such specific data. Virtual address stable generic allocators have a tendancy to be technical abominations based on statistical usage assumptions. Namely, their cost could be not worth for the improvment, even if there is a significant one. reply vinay_ys 3 hours agoprevEither use a full-fledged library like tcmalloc or jemalloc with profiler and debugger capabilities built-in or do tooled generated code that&#x27;s ensured to be bug-free and usually tied to lifecycle of request&#x2F;response or connection etc (or game level, scene, session etc). Hand-rolling like this in 2023 is neither necessary nor optimal. reply londons_explore 5 hours agoprev [–] Having to decide ahead of time how much memory to allocate to the arena is... crap...The vast majority of programmers don&#x27;t want arbitrary &#x27;out of memory in arena&#x27; errors just because the user inputted slightly more things than expected. Yes, I know that modern OS&#x27;s don&#x27;t actually allocate memory till you use it, but when you make widespread use of that functionality, typically your reuse of address space is poor and free&#x27;d stuff will be neither reused nor returned to the OS.Likewise, not being able to free things within the arena is also crap - I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of times the system is running low of RAM, but hundreds of applications have thousands of arenas, all half full of never-to-be-used again items that the OS can&#x27;t reuse. reply flohofwoe 1 hour agoparentThe actual point to understand is that a general purpose allocator is usually \"mostly crap\" because it requires an incredible internal complexity to meet all requirements. It&#x27;s often better to use specialized local allocators, and write code which expects an allocator to be provided instead of calling into global allocator functions. Such specialized allocators can often be a lot simpler, while being at least as fast general purpose allocators like jemalloc or mimalloc.Very often you don&#x27;t actually need to track or manage the lifetime of individual objects, since related objects are often created and destroyed at the same time. For instance when parsing a JSON file you might end up with many individual nodes which can all be discarded at the same time once the parsing result has been consumed. With an arena allocator, you just throw away the memory for all those nodes at once, instead of calling a free&#x2F;deallocate&#x2F;delete functions tens- or hundreds-of-thousand times. reply eschneider 5 hours agoparentprevThis...depends on your application. With a lot of small memory&#x2F;embedded applications, deciding how much memory you need ahead of time is how you do things and normally you don&#x27;t malloc at all. Because you absolutely need to know the memory bounds of your app. In that sort of environment, this approach can be useful. reply vidarh 5 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s straightforward to make this slightly more dynamic by keeping a linked list of arenas and just add new one when you run out of space. You get most of the benefit with only a tiny increase in complexity.That doesn&#x27;t fix your second objection, but where you want to use this tends to be where you know object lifetimes are similar anyway.E.g. way back we loaded fonts for an embedded device using t1lib, which on loading a font made hundreds of tiny malloc calls, all of which were freed at the exact same time when the font was freed. Adding an arena allocator both sped it up, reduced memory use (less malloc overhead), and it didn&#x27;t matter at all that we couldn&#x27;t free things within the arena because they&#x27;d always be freed at the same time anyway.So the takeaway from that might be that arena allocators aren&#x27;t always right, but you&#x27;d be surprised how often you can predictably group allocations into sets with similar enough lifetimes it doesn&#x27;t matter much. A key to this is often the trick showed in the linked article: Don&#x27;t just lump everything into the same arena; use different arenas for different lifetimes. You might well find you&#x27;re left with so few allocations that don&#x27;t seem to fit that you can afford to just keep those around in a single long-lived arena as well. reply galangalalgol 5 hours agoparentprevYou aren&#x27;t the target audience I think? The main two reasons to use custom alloctors, or the two I run into at least, is when memory allocation profiles as a significant portion of your flamegraph, and&#x2F;or there is a real probability of memory fragmentation preventing new allocation even when there is plenty of space left. That latter is often the case with embedded. The former can be, and is also pretty common any time you are cpu bound as in gaming or signal processing. reply logicchains 5 hours agoparentprev [–] > Having to decide ahead of time how much memory to allocate to the arena is... crap...A nice solution in many cases is to just keep a bunch of std::vector (or equivalent) around for the types you need, and .clear() them all at the start of each request&#x2F;frame&#x2F;message&#x2F;whatever being processed. Calling push_back on a vector will only allocate when the vector&#x27;s already reached its capacity, which will happen very rarely after the first few runs, so the hot loop will usually be allocation-free, but without needing to allocate a fixed amount of memory ahead of time. reply Const-me 3 hours agorootparent [–] Generally, std::vector not going to work for allocator backend.The issue being, std::vector relocates all elements every time it increases the capacity. Therefore, adding an element to std::vector may invalidate addresses of all previously added vector elements.You gonna have to adjust your higher-level data structures which use that allocator, replacing pointers with offsets relative to the start of that std::vector. This introduces another level of indirection, adds complexity, and in some edge cases may even ruin the performance. reply danhau 1 hour agorootparentstd::vector is fine if you access elements by index, instead of pointer, which can be a perfectly fine approach. Of course this kills the general purpose allocator aspect, since you&#x27;re not getting back pointers, only offsets.However, if you combine that with generation numbers, you can make yourself a very handy container with stable and safe references. slotmap [1] comes to mind.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;slotmap&#x2F;latest&#x2F;slotmap&#x2F; reply logicchains 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, that&#x27;s true if you need higher-level datastructures, but if your functions are just taking vectors&#x2F;spans of stuff as input then it works out fine. reply gpderetta 42 minutes agorootparentprev [–] std::deque, although it would be nice to use an implementation where you can control the block size. reply Const-me 33 minutes agorootparent [–] Here’s a simple non-standard allocator for C++ I used a few times in the past: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;CollectionMicrobench&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...The block size is controlled with a template argument, the number must be a compile-time constant. reply Applications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Functional Interfaces Handling InterruptedException Why wait must be called in a synchronized block See all Java articles The most copied StackOverflow snippet of all time is flawed! by Andreas Lundblad, 2019-12-02 In a recent study titled Usage and Attribution of Stack Overflow Code Snippets in GitHub Projects, an answer I wrote almost a decade ago was found to be the most copied snippet on Stack Overflow. Ironically it happens to be buggy. A Long Long Time Ago… Back in 2010 I was sitting in my office and doing what I wasn’t supposed to be doing: code golfing and chasing reputation on Stack Overflow. The following question got my attention: How do you print a byte count in a human readable format? That is, how do you format something like 123,456,789 bytes as “123.5 MB”. The good ol’ 2010 look, courtesy the Wayback Machine. The implicit spec here is that the resulting string should have a value between 1 and 999.9 followed by a suffix with an appropriate magnitude. One answer had already been posted. The code in that answer was based on a loop. The idea was simple: Try all magnitudes, going from the largest (EB = 1018 bytes) down to the smallest (B = 1 byte) and use the first one that is smaller than the number of bytes. In pseudo code it looks something like this: suffixes = [ \"EB\", \"PB\", \"TB\", \"GB\", \"MB\", \"kB\", \"B\" ] magnitudes = [ 1018, 1015, 1012, 109, 106, 103, 100 ] i = 0 while (ibyteCount) i++ printf(\"%.1f %s\", byteCount / magnitudes[i], suffixes[i]) Usually when there’s a correct answer posted that already has a positive score, it’s hard to catch up with it. In Stack Overflow lingo it’s referred to as the Fastest Gun in the West Problem. In this case the existing answer had a few flaws, so I still saw an opportunity to top it. At the very least, the loop based code could be cleaned up significantly. This is Algebra, I know this! Then it hit me. The kB, MB, GB, … suffixes are nothing but powers of 1000 (or 1024 in IEC standard) which means it should be possible to compute the right suffix using logarithms instead of a loop. Based on this idea, I posted the following: public static String humanReadableByteCount(long bytes, boolean si) { int unit = si ? 1000 : 1024; if (bytes = Math.ceil(Math.pow(unit, exp) * (unit - 0.05))) exp++; With this change the code works well all the way up until the byte count approaches 1 EB. Even More 9’s Given the input 999,949,999,999,999,999 the result is now 1000.0 PB while correct result is 999.9 PB. Mathematically the code is accurate, so what’s going on here? At this point we’re running into the precision limitations of a double. Floating Point Arithmetic 101 Due to the IEEE 754 representation floating point values close to zero are very dense, and large values are very sparse. In fact, half of all values are found between −1 and 1, and when talking large doubles, a value as large as Long.MAX_VALUE means nothing. Literally. double a = Double.MAX_VALUE; double b = a - Long.MAX_VALUE; System.err.println(a == b); // prints true See Bits of a Floating Point Value for a deep dive. There are two problematic computations: The division in the String.format argument, and The threshold for bumping exp. We could switch to BigDecimal, but where’s the fun in that?! Besides, it gets messy anyway because there’s no BigDecimal log function in the standard API. Scaling down intermediate values For the first issue we can scale down the bytes value to a range where the the precision is better, and adjust exp accordingly. The end result is rounded anyway, so it doesn’t matter that we’re throwing out the least significant digits. if (exp > 4) { bytes /= unit; exp--; } Adjusting the least significant bits For the second issue, we do care about the least significant bits (999,949,99…9 and 999,950,00…0 should end up with different exponents) so this issue calls for a different solution. First we note that there are 12 different possible values for the threshold (6 for each mode), and only one of them ends up faulty. The faulty result can be uniquely identified by the fact that it ends with D0016. If this is the case we simply adjust it to the correct value. long th = (long) Math.ceil(Math.pow(unit, exp) * (unit - 0.05)); if (exp = th - ((th & 0xFFF) == 0xD00 ? 51 : 0)) exp++; Since we rely on specific bit patterns in floating-point results, we slap on strictfp to ensure it works regardless of the hardware running the code. Negative input It’s unclear under what circumstances a negative byte count could be relevant, but since Java doesn’t have unsigned long, we better deal with it. Right now an input such as −10,000 results in -10000 B. Let’s introduce absBytes: long absBytes = bytes == Long.MIN_VALUE ? Long.MAX_VALUE : Math.abs(bytes); The complicated expression is due to the fact that -Long.MIN_VALUE == Long.MIN_VALUE. Now we perform all computations related to exp using absBytes instead of bytes. Final Version Here’s the final version of the code, golfed and compacted in the spirit of the original version: // From: https://programming.guide/worlds-most-copied-so-snippet.html public static strictfp String humanReadableByteCount(long bytes, boolean si) { int unit = si ? 1000 : 1024; long absBytes = bytes == Long.MIN_VALUE ? Long.MAX_VALUE : Math.abs(bytes); if (absBytes = th - ((th & 0xFFF) == 0xD00 ? 51 : 0)) exp++; String pre = (si ? \"kMGTPE\" : \"KMGTPE\").charAt(exp - 1) + (si ? \"\" : \"i\"); if (exp > 4) { bytes /= unit; exp -= 1; } return String.format(\"%.1f %sB\", bytes / Math.pow(unit, exp), pre); } Note that this started out as a challenge to avoid loops and excessive branching. After ironing out all corner cases the code is even less readable than the original version. Personally I would not copy this snippet into production code. For updated code that is of production quality see separate article: Formatting byte size to human readable format Key Takeaways Stack Overflow snippets can be buggy, even if they have thousands of upvotes. Test all edge cases, especially for code copied from Stack Overflow. Floating-point arithmetic is hard. Do include proper attribution when copying code. Someone might just call you out on it.

So I tried to answer some questions so that I could get enough points to comment. But when looking at the new questions, it seemed to be mostly a pile of “I have a bug in my code please fix it” type stuff. Relatively simple answers to “What is the stack and the heap?” had thousands of points, but also already had tons of answers (though I suppose one of the reason why people keep answering is to harvest points). I was able to answer a question on an obscure issue that no one had answered yet, but received no points.Then I saw that you could get points for editing answers. OK, I thought, I can get some points by fixing some bugs. I found a highly upvoted post that had code that didn’t work, found that it was because one section had used the wrong variable, and tried to fix it. Well, the variable name was too short to meet the necessary 6 characters to edit the code (something like changing “foo” to “bar”).I went to see what other people did in these situations, and they suggested just adding unnecessary edits in order to reach the character limit.At that point, I just left the bug in, and gave up on trying to contribute to Stack Overflow. reply kevin_thibedeau 1 minute agorootparentYou need to focus on niche tags to find worthwhile unanswered questions.

But I don&#x27;t practice gun safety while watching television on my couch because the gun is locked away. I practice gun safety when I&#x27;m actually handling the thing that is dangerous.And yes, I realize it being locked away is technically gun safety, it&#x27;s an imperfect analogy, please roll with it. reply prosqlinjector 15 minutes agorootparentprevI think I agree with your coworkers. If the data is predefined constants, then you don&#x27;t need to worry about injection. All functions have preconditions which must be met for them to work. As long as that&#x27;s specified, that&#x27;s acceptable.Imagine the internals of a database. An outer layer verifies some data is safe, and then all other functions assume it&#x27;s safe.The example you&#x27;re sharing is a bit of straw man. It&#x27;s just as easy to use the parameter, so of course that&#x27;s the right thing.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I use StackOverflow to give me a head start on solving a problem in an area I&#x27;m not as familiar with yet, but I&#x27;ve never just straight copied code from there. I don&#x27;t do that because rarely does the snippet do exactly and only exactly what I need. It requires me to look at the APIs and form my own solution from the explained approach. StackOverflow has pointed me in the direction of some niche APIs that are useful to me, especially in Python. reply JimDabell 59 minutes agoparentI once worked with a developer who wouldn’t let anything come between him seeing an answer and copying it into his code. He wasn’t even reading the question to make sure it was the same problem he was having, let alone the answer. He would literally go Google => follow the first link to Stack Overflow he saw => copy and paste the first code block he saw. Sometimes it wasn’t even the right language. People had to physically take the input away from him if they were pairing with him because there was nothing anybody could say to stop him, and if you tried to tell him it wasn’t right then he’d just be pasting the second code snippet on the page before you could get another word out. He was freakishly quick at it.Now he was an extreme case, but yes, there are a lot of developers out there with the mindset of “I need code; Stack Overflow has code; problem solved!” that don’t put any thought at all into whether it’s an appropriate solution. reply vidarh 41 minutes agorootparentA hiring round nearly two decades ago we realised something was off with the answers to the usual pre-phone interview screening questions. They were simple, and we asked people to only spend like 20 minutes on them. We knew people would \"cheat\", but they were only there to lighten our load a little bit, so it was ok if they let through some bad candidates.But for whatever reason, in one hiring round the vast majority had cut and pasted answers from search results verbatim (we dealt with a new recruiter, and I frankly suspected this new recruiter was telling them this was ok despite the instructions we&#x27;d given).These were not subtle. But the very worst one was one who did like the developer you described: He&#x27;d found a forum post about a problem pretty close to the question, had cut and pasted the code from the first answer he found.He&#x27;d not even bothered to read a few comments further down in the replies where the answer in question was totally savaged by other commenters explaining why it was entirely wrong.This was someone who was employed as a senior developer somewhere else, and it was clear in retrospect looking at his CV that he probably kept \"fleeing the scene of the crime\" on a regular basis before it was discovered he was a total fraud. We regularly got those people, but none that delivered such obviously messed up answers.For ever developer like this, you&#x27;re probably right there will be a lot more that are less extreme about it, and more able to make things work well enough that they&#x27;re not discovered. reply siva7 53 minutes agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not software development.

Instead, I try to make sense of the solution, and if I have to, I&#x27;ll hand-copy it down line-by-line to make sure I properly understand and refactor from there. I also rename variables, since often times there are so many foos and bars and bazes that it&#x27;s completely unreadable by a human.Also if I come across the problem a second time, I&#x27;ll have better luck remembering what I did (as opposed to blindly copying). reply sp332 1 hour agoparentprevYes, and it happens more for things that feel out of scope for the part of the program that I&#x27;m interested in. After all, we import library code from random strangers into our programs all the time for the parts we consider \"plumbing\" and beneath notice. If I wanted to dig in and understand something, I would be more likely to write my own. But if I want this part over here to \"just work\" so I can get on with the project, it&#x27;s compiler-error-driven development. reply jtolmar 21 minutes agorootparentSame, and even more so if it&#x27;s something that feels like it should be in the library code in the first place.My most copy-pasted code is projecting a point onto a line segment. I end up needing it all the time, it&#x27;s never in whatever standard library for vector math I&#x27;m using, and it&#x27;s faster to find on SO than to find and translate the code out of whatever my last project that needed it is. Way faster than re-deriving it.Your vector math library is probably already code imported from random strangers, likely even imported by random strangers, so adding one more function from a random stranger feels entirely appropriate. reply ahoka 1 hour agoparentprevYes, people do that. After looking at a huge number of incorrect TLS related code and configuration at SO, I’m now pretty sure that most systems run without validating certificates properly. reply tialaramex 21 minutes agorootparentThis was more true when libraries and tooling defaulted to not checking.Somewhere in my history is a recent HN (or maybe Reddit) post where somebody insists Curl has been 100% compatible from day one, and like, no, originally curl ignores certificates, today you need to specify that explicitly if it&#x27;s what you want.I think (but don&#x27;t take my word for it) that Requests (the Python library) was the same. Initially it didn&#x27;t check, then years back the authors were told that if you don&#x27;t check you get what you didn&#x27;t pay for (ie nothing) and they changed the defaults.Python itself is trickier because it was really hard to convince Python people that DNS names, the names we actually care about in certificates, aren&#x27;t Unicode. I mean, they can be (IDNs), but not in a way that&#x27;s useful to a machine. If your job is \"Present this DNS name to a user\" then sure, here&#x27;s a bunch of tricky and maybe flawed code to best efforts turn the bytes into human Unicode text, but your cert checking code isn&#x27;t a human, it wants bytes and we deliberately designed the DNS records and the certificate bytes to be identical, so you&#x27;re just doing a byte-for-byte comparison.The Python people really wanted to convert everything messily to Unicode, which is - at best if you do it perfectly - slower with the same results and at worst a security hole for no reason.OpenSSL is at least partly to blame for terrible TLS APIs. OpenSSL is what I call a \"stamp collector\" library. It wants to collect all the obscure corner cases, because some of its authors are interested. Did the Belgian government standardise a 54-bit cipher called \"Bingle Bongle\" in 1997? Cool, let&#x27;s add that to our library. Does anybody use it? No. Should anybody use it? No. But it exists so we added it. A huge waste of everybody&#x27;s time.The other reason people don&#x27;t validate is that it was easier to turn it off and get their work done, which is a big problem that should be addressed systemically rather than by individually telling people \"No\".So I&#x27;d guess that today out of a thousand pieces of software that ought to do TLS, maybe 750 of them don&#x27;t validate certificates correctly, and maybe 400 of those deliberately don&#x27;t do it correctly because the author knew it would fail and had other priorities. reply PhilipRoman 55 minutes agorootparentprevTo be fair that might be partly the fault of TLS libraries. There should be a single sane function that does the least surprising thing and then lower level APIs for everything else.

    "originBody": "TimDbg About - Tags The art and science of debugging. And other stuff like that. From a former developer on WinDbg and the VMware hypervisor. Writing a Debugger From Scratch - DbgRs Part 5 - Breakpoints Sep 26, 2023 12 min read (New to this series? Consider starting from part 1) At the end of the last post, we started to get some interesting functionality with the ability to resolve addresses to names in a module. This was the last functionality missing before we could implement breakpoints! This part adds the ability for DbgRs to set hardware breakpoints. The code for this post is in the part5 branch on github. You can also view the changes from part4. If you see any mistakes or ways to improve the code, feel free to create issues on the GitHub repo or submit a PR. First, some cleanup I’ve been trying to keep DbgRs as simple as possible, avoiding extra architectural layers to keep the concepts as clear and concise as possible, but now that it has grown a bit, we need a little bit of cleanup to keep things easy to understand. I’ll just cover these changes briefly and then we’ll get to breakpoints. The biggest change is that I moved all of the code dealing with WaitForDebugEventEx into a new file, event.rs. A single public function allows waiting for the next debug event, and returns a new DebugEvent enum instead of the raw win32 DEBUG_EVENT type. pub enum DebugEvent { Exception{first_chance: bool, exception_code: i32}, CreateProcess{exe_name: Option, exe_base: u64}, CreateThread{thread_id: u32}, ExitThread{thread_id: u32}, LoadModule{module_name: Option, module_base: u64}, OutputDebugString(String), ExitProcess, Other(String) } pub struct EventContext { pub process_id: u32, pub thread_id: u32, } pub fn wait_for_next_debug_event(mem_source: &dyn MemorySource) -> (EventContext, DebugEvent) { //... } As a result, the main_debugger_loop function is a bit smaller and can focus on the core debugger loop logic. The other change is that I’ve added a file called util.rs which has some common helpers for win32 structures, including a thin AutoClosedHandle wrapper for HANDLE and the AlignedContext struct that wraps the win32 CONTEXT. Additionally, this includes some constants that are missing from the windows-rs crate. #[repr(align(16))] pub struct AlignedContext { pub context: CONTEXT, } pub struct AutoClosedHandle(pub HANDLE); Evaluating symbols When setting a breakpoint, it’s expected that you can use the name of a function, and not just the address. So to start, we need to add the capability for resolving a name to an address. Previously, we had the resolve_address_to_name function in name_resolution.rs, so we’ll add the corresponding resolve_name_to_address function there as well. pub fn resolve_name_to_address(sym: &str, process: &mut Process) -> Result { match sym.chars().position(|c| c == '!') { None => { // Search all modules Err(\"Not yet implemented\".to_string()) }, Some(pos) => { let module_name = &sym[..pos]; let func_name = &sym[pos + 1..]; if let Some(module) = process.get_module_by_name_mut(module_name) { if let Some(addr) = resolve_function_in_module(module, func_name) { Ok(addr) } else { Err(format!(\"Could not find {} in module {}\", func_name, module_name)) } } else { Err(format!(\"Could not find module {}\", module_name)) } }, } } For now, we’ll take only the fully qualified name in module.dll!functionName form, and allow only exact matches. Using this function, we can add symbols to our evaluation grammar in command.rs #[rust_sitter::language] pub enum EvalExpr { Number(#[rust_sitter::leaf(pattern = r\"(\\d+|0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\", transform = parse_int)] u64), Symbol(#[rust_sitter::leaf(pattern = r\"(([a-zA-Z0-9_@#.]+!)?[a-zA-Z0-9_@#.]+)\", transform = parse_sym)] String), In order to evaluate symbols, the evaluate_expression function now needs a context that it can use to evaluate symbols against. For this, we’ll just pass in a structure with a reference to the Process. pub struct EvalContext { pub process: &'a mut Process, } pub fn evaluate_expression(expr: EvalExpr, context: &mut EvalContext) -> Result { Note that it also returns a Result now because the name resolution can fail. Most of the function is unchanged besides passing the context through, and it now handles EvalExpr::Symbol by passing it to name_resolution::resolve_to_address. match expr { EvalExpr::Number(x) => Ok(x), EvalExpr::Add(x, _, y) => Ok(evaluate_expression(*x, context)? + evaluate_expression(*y, context)?), EvalExpr::Symbol(sym) => { resolve_name_to_address(&sym, context.process) } } } We can verify this is working by simply evaluating a symbol to an address and making sure it resolves back to the same symbol. > ? ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 = 0x7FFE7360F154 [11254] ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 > ln 0x7FFE7360F154 ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 [11254] ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 Success! Keeping track of breakpoints With the new functionality in the expression evaluator to evaluate symbols, we can add the commands for setting, clearing, and listing breakpoints. First, we add the breakpoint commands to the command grammar in command.rs SetBreakpoint(#[rust_sitter::leaf(text = \"bp\")] (), Box), ListBreakpoints(#[rust_sitter::leaf(text = \"bl\")] ()), ClearBreakpoint(#[rust_sitter::leaf(text = \"bc\")] (), Box), The implementation of these commands need something to talk to, so we’ll create a new structure called BreakpointManager that keeps track of the breakpoints that should be set in the process, and create this at the start of the main_debugger_loop fn main_debugger_loop(process: HANDLE) { let mut breakpoints = BreakpointManager::new(); We’ll get to the implementation of BreakpointManager in a minute, but first we can just see the simple implementation of bp, bl, and bc calling into the breakpoint manager. let cmd = command::read_command(); //... match cmd { //... CommandExpr::SetBreakpoint(_, expr) => { if let Some(addr) = eval_expr(expr) { breakpoints.add_breakpoint(addr); } } CommandExpr::ListBreakpoints(_) => { breakpoints.list_breakpoints(&mut process); } CommandExpr::ClearBreakpoint(_, expr) => { if let Some(id) = eval_expr(expr) { breakpoints.clear_breakpoint(id as u32); } } The BreakpointManager contains the list of the breakpoints that have been requested by the user. It has functions for adding a breakpoint at a specified address, removing a breakpoint given its ID, and listing the breakpoints for the user. struct Breakpoint { addr: u64, id: u32, } pub struct BreakpointManager { breakpoints: Vec::, } impl BreakpointManager { pub fn add_breakpoint(&mut self, addr: u64) { self.breakpoints.push(Breakpoint{addr, id: self.get_free_id()}); self.breakpoints.sort_by(|a, b| a.id.cmp(&b.id)); } pub fn list_breakpoints(&self, process: &mut Process) { for bp in self.breakpoints.iter() { if let Some(sym) = name_resolution::resolve_address_to_name(bp.addr, process) { println!(\"{:3} {:#018x} ({})\", bp.id, bp.addr, sym) } else { println!(\"{:3} {:#018x}\", bp.id, bp.addr) } } } pub fn clear_breakpoint(&mut self, id: u32) { self.breakpoints.retain(|x| x.id != id) } We can test these commands to make sure breakpoints are tracked correctly, although we still need to apply the breakpoints to the target process before they’ll do anything. Command line was: '\"C:\\git\\HelloWorld\\hello.exe\" ' LoadDll: 7FF7E7420000 hello.exe [5A70] 0x00007ffdaed4aa40 > g LoadDll: 7FFDAECF0000 ntdll.dll [5A70] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > bp ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart [5A70] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > bl 0 0x00007ffdaed4aa40 (ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart) [5A70] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > bc 0 [5A70] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > bl [5A70] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > Applying breakpoints Finally, we can get to the fun part where we apply the breakpoints to a process. There are two types of breakpoints, software breakpoints and hardware breakpoints. Of the two, hardware breakpoints are less complicated, so we’ll start with those. On x86 processors the hardware breakpoints are controlled via the “Debug Registers”. There are four hardware breakpoints available on current CPUs. Debug registers DR0 through DR3 are used to specify the address of the breakpoint. Register DR6 is a status register to determine when a breakpoint is hit. And DR7 is a control register to specify the attributes of each hardware breakpoint. Note that there are a number of fields packed together in DR7, so we’ll use a little helper to set these fields. // Helper function to set a value at a specific bit offset. fn set_bits(val: &mut T, set_val: T, start_bit: usize, bit_count: usize) { // First, mask out the relevant bits let max_bits = std::mem::size_of::() * 8; let mask: T = T::max_value() > (max_bits - 1 - start_bit); let inv_mask = !mask; *val = *val & inv_mask; *val = *val(set_validx { // The DR7_* variables are a set of constants with the correct offsets and sizes for each // field of DR7. set_bits(&mut ctx.context.Dr7, 0, DR7_LEN_BIT[idx], DR7_LEN_SIZE); set_bits(&mut ctx.context.Dr7, 0, DR7_RW_BIT[idx], DR7_RW_SIZE); set_bits(&mut ctx.context.Dr7, 1, DR7_LE_BIT[idx], 1); The appropriate DR0-DR3 value will be set to the address of the resolved breakpoint. match idx { 0 => ctx.context.Dr0 = self.breakpoints[idx].addr, 1 => ctx.context.Dr1 = self.breakpoints[idx].addr, 2 => ctx.context.Dr2 = self.breakpoints[idx].addr, 3 => ctx.context.Dr3 = self.breakpoints[idx].addr, _ => (), } Finally, we’ll make sure to disable any breakpoints that we are not using. Note that the code assumes that the debugger “owns” the debug registers and that the target process is not using them in any way. This is typically true, but there are cases where the target process will be using the debug registers for its own purpose, or are manipulated as an anti-debugging technique. To keep things simple, we won’t worry about that and just clear the local enable (LE) bit. } else { // Disable any breakpoints that we aren't using. set_bits(&mut ctx.context.Dr7, 0, DR7_LE_BIT[idx], 1); break; } } This new function, apply_breakpoints, will be called from the main_debugger_loop right before we call ContinueDebugEvent. That will ensure that we set up all thread contexts with the correct breakpoint state. Note that because Windows sends a debug event for thread creation, we’ll have an opportunity to set the breakpoint state for all new threads that are created. breakpoints.apply_breakpoints(&mut process, event_context.thread_id, mem_source.as_ref()); unsafe { ContinueDebugEvent( event_context.process_id, event_context.thread_id, continue_status, ); } Handling breakpoint exceptions When the CPU tries to execute an instruction that is marked with a debug register, it generates a debug exception (#DB) as a fault (It’s important to note this is a fault, and not a trap. More on that later). Windows delivers this to a debugger as an exception event with exception code 0x80000004. The thread context will also have a flag set in DR6 indicating which breakpoint was hit. We’ll add some code in the exception event handler letting the breakpoint manager check if a breakpoint was hit. match debug_event { DebugEvent::Exception { first_chance, exception_code } => { //... if let Some(bp_index) = breakpoints.was_breakpoint_hit(&ctx.context) { println!(\"Breakpoint {} hit\", bp_index); // It's important to use DBG_CONTINUE with ContinueDebugEvent or else the breakpoint will be treated // as an exception to be handled by the target process. continue_status = DBG_CONTINUE; } //... The breakpoint manager will just check DR6 to see if any of the bits were set that correspond to a hardware breakpoint triggering. pub fn was_breakpoint_hit(&self, thread_context: &CONTEXT) -> Option { for idx in 0..self.breakpoints.len() { if get_bit(thread_context.Dr6, DR6_B_BIT[idx]) { return Some(idx as u32); } } None } Remember how I mentioned that hardware breakpoints trigger debug exceptions as a fault? That’s important because a “fault” exception triggers before the instruction has a chance to execute. That lets us examine state before the instruction executes, which is what we want for a debugger. But since it is a fault, resuming the execution of the program just causes the program to break in again! On some architectures, this might be complicated to get past, but on x86 we simply have to set the “resume flag”, which is one of the bits in the EFlags registers that often gets overlooked. The resume flag causes the processor to ignore instruction breakpoints for a single instruction execution. It is set back to 0 right after the debug registers would have been checked, which makes it a convenient tool for resuming execution. We’ll set this flag on whatever thread caused the debugger to break in, regardless of whether the breakpoint has hit or not. (Some debuggers will only set RF when a breakpoint was hit). We’ll set the resume flag inside the apply_breakpoints function, since it’s already manipulating the register contexts of all threads. if *thread_id == resume_thread_id { set_bits(&mut ctx.context.EFlags, 1, EFLAG_RF, 1); } Testing it out Now that we can set a breakpoint, apply a breakpoint, and handle a breakpoint exception, we’re ready to test out the new breakpoint functionality. To do that, we’ll just continue execution until kernelbase is loaded, and then set a breakpoint on kernelbase!GetLastError, which is a very frequently used function that should get called almost immediately. Command line was: '\"C:\\git\\HelloWorld\\hello.exe\" ' LoadDll: 7FF7E7420000 hello.exe [5CF8] 0x00007ffdaed4aa40 > g LoadDll: 7FFDAECF0000 ntdll.dll [5CF8] ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart > g LoadDll: 7FFDAD6E0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNEL32.DLL [5CF8] ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 > g LoadDll: 7FFDAC0A0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll [5CF8] ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 > bp kernelbase.dll!GetLastError [5CF8] ntdll.dll!NtMapViewOfSection+0x14 > g Breakpoint 0 hit [5CF8] C:\\Windows\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll!GetLastError > It works! It’s almost starting to feel like a real debugger. A few very important things are left though. To start with, we can’t see the functions that are on the call stack. Viewing the stack is probably the single most important analysis feature of a debugger. So that’s likely where we’re going next. I hope you found this post interesting and informative! Have a question or suggestion? Let me know! You can find me on Twitter, Mastodon, and Bluesky. Footnotes This isn't actually sufficient to uniquely identify a symbolic name. You can have multiple versions of a module with the same name loaded into the same process. This is why WinDbg will sometimes add a disambiguation in the form of \"module_baseAddress\". For data breakpoints, the length can be used to specify a 1, 2, 4, or 8 byte range. This lets us set breakpoints appropriate to the data being monitored. For instruction execution breakpoints, however, only 1-byte ranges are allowed. Any value besides 0 in the LEN field is considered undefined. Whether a breakpoint exception is delivered as a fault or as a trap is dependent on a number of conditions (described by a decent-sized table in the Intel processor manual). But the short version is that most debug exceptions are actually traps instead of faults. Only hardware breakpoints where the RW flag is set to 0 (execute) are treated as faults. Which is a good thing, because it's way more useful to break before an instruction has a chance to execute.",

So you could, naturally, run the debugger in one process and attached it to another process which, just so happens to be another instance of the debugger.As with all things, while doing this they encountered bugs in the debugger that, well, needed to be debugged.He said there was a certain epiphany when they realized, because of the multi process nature of OS&#x2F;2, that they could debug the debugger debugging the debugger.I would imagine this took a bit of focus.

Which is based on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tree-sitter.github.io&#x2F;tree-sitter&#x2F;. I&#x27;ve been hearing about Tree-sitter a lot recently, so I dug into it.Tree-sitter is a tool for generating fast, incremental parsers. In particular, the algorithm is suited towards writing \"language servers\" for IDEs, which re-parse code incrementally as the user works. These kinds of incremental parsers have historically been a huge problem. It looks like Tree-sitter is an enormous practical advance in this area.And discovering that there&#x27;s a way to use Tree-sitter from Rust is fantastic. From the post: #[rust_sitter::language] pub enum EvalExpr { Number( #[rust_sitter::leaf( pattern = r\"(\\d+|0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\", transform = parse_int )] u64 ), Symbol( #[rust_sitter::leaf( pattern = r\"(([a-zA-Z0-9_@#.]+!)?[a-zA-Z0-9_@#.]+)\", transform = parse_sym )] String ), &#x2F;&#x2F; ...Getting easy access to fast, incremental parsing is a huge win.

This will cause the process to trap and the OS will then let the debugger process know about out somehow, e.g. via the SIGTRAP signal on Unix.The debugger then replaces the int 3 opcode (which is a single byte conveniently) with the first byte of the original instruction so that the execution can continue. reply hinoki 7 hours agorootparentIf you revert the int 3 to the original instruction’s byte, when do you put it back? The breakpoint could still be active.In a trivial example, the breaking instruction could be a jump to itself, which you’d expect to immediately break into the debugger again.I thought the debugger had to emulate the instruction instead, but it’s not like I’ve ever implemented one… reply i_don_t_know 7 hours agorootparentI believe when you resume the debugger, you can tell the process&#x2F;thread to single-step over one instruction. So it&#x27;s something like this:1. Overwrite instruction with int 3.2. When you hit the breakpoint, restore the original instruction.3. Single-step over the original instruction by changing the thread&#x27;s EFlags (Intel).4. Restore the breakpoint with int 3.5. Resume normally. reply timmisiak 56 minutes agorootparentprevYes, software breakpoints are difficult to get correct (the main reason why I started with hardware breakpoints). It gets more complicated with kernel debugging, where a single step (trap flag) could get pre-empted by an interrupt handler. And you can&#x27;t always single-step a CPU and leave all other CPUs frozen. reply ithkuil 7 hours agorootparentprevEmulation is an option, rotating hardware debug registers is another option, detecting self-jumps is another option.I really only implemented a debugger for the esp8266 and it was just good enough for me and my team to get our job done so it didn&#x27;t handle many edge cases like that reply vinge 6 hours agoparentprevOthers have already mentioned software breakpoints where the instruction is replaced, another option is to run the code in an emulator that supports a virtually unlimited set of breakpoints.

SEP 21, 2023 Rose Garrett The idea of mutton leaves a bad taste for many US consumers—most of whom have never even tried it. Shropshire sheep are raised primarily for their meat. Photography by Shutterstock. “Why can we only get lamb in the US, as opposed to mutton?” That’s what Bobbie Kramer, a veterinarian near Portland, Oregon, was wondering when she responded to our recent call for reader questions about where their food comes from. “As a meat eater, I enjoy the flavor and texture of lamb. But I’d love to try mutton. I know that in other parts of the world, lamb and mutton are more economical and popular to raise than cattle,” she writes. “I’ve traveled a fair bit (Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Great Britain) and have friends from parts of the world where small ruminants such as sheep and goats are raised for meat and fiber. My good friend from South Africa tells me how she and her husband miss cooking with mutton, which they find more flavorful and satisfying than lamb. What happens to the mutton-aged sheep here?” It’s true that it’s difficult, if not impossible, to find mutton—defined as meat from a sheep over two years old—in American grocery stores. “Mutton is not an accessible protein option in the US,” says Megan Wortman, executive director of the American Lamb Board, an industry group aimed at expanding the market for domestic sheep products. If you’re looking to get your hands on some mutton, “you’d have to go through a specialty butcher shop or directly to a special-order processor,” she says. Mutton has less tender flesh and a stronger flavor than lamb, which comes from sheep that are less than a year old. (Meat from sheep aged one to two years is generally called “yearling” in the US, and “hogget” elsewhere around the world.) That stronger flavor lends itself to curries, stews and “value-added” products such as spiced sausages, says Wortman, “so most of our mutton goes into value-added products or into specialty ethnic markets at this point.” Some mutton is exported to Mexico, where it’s braised low and slow, barbacoa-style. Mutton is also often sold at butcher shops that serve communities that have brought a taste for the meat with them from elsewhere, such as new immigrants from Africa, Central America and the Middle East. (Wortman notes that the majority of US lamb and mutton is halal processed.) And in western Kentucky, a tradition of barbecued mutton still holds, although no one is quite sure why. “There are consumer segments that would raise their hand and say ‘yes, I would prefer a stronger flavor,’ but we just don’t market it in mainstream grocery stories,” says Wortman. “There’s definitely a general hesitation that the minute you label it ‘mutton’ the average consumer has negative connotations with that product.” So, how did mutton, a widely consumed protein around the world, come to be unmarketable to most Americans? Sheep were first brought to the southwestern US by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, and flocks grew with the influx of European settlers, who utilized sheep locally for their wool and meat. With rising demand for wool in the 19th century, sheep farming became more industrialized, but the primary focus was on the wool, not the meat. Simply put, mutton was a byproduct of wool production. Mutton was slaughtered, sold and canned locally, but no large-scale infrastructure arose to source and process sheep meat. “The simplest story is that no commercial meat industry developed around mutton,” says Roger Horowitz, a historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. “It seems to me that it was very rural in character.” He points to a can of roast mutton in his collection, dating from the 1890s, as emblematic of the time: It advertised that its contents were both slaughtered and canned “on the range” in Fort McKavett, Texas. A man shearing a sheep at the San Emigdio Ranch in Kern County, CA in 1890. (Carleton E. Watkins/Library of Congress) That’s not to say that mutton wasn’t consumed at the dinner table. Mutton chops were featured in cookbooks and restaurant menus from the late 19th and early 20th century, as the population grew and urbanized and demand for protein rose. Lamb was a seasonal product served at Christmas, and for a time, sheep meat was seen as a food for the upper classes. Even first-class passengers on the RMS Titanic were served grilled mutton—for luncheon and breakfast. Sheep numbers in the US peaked in 1884 at 51 million head. But with the advent of synthetic fibers in the 20th century, wool production began to flag, and sheep numbers—and the availability of mutton—declined. (In 2016, there were five million head of sheep in the US.) Lamb consumption began to dwindle, too: Americans consumed five pounds of lamb per person in 1912. Today, that number is about a pound per person annually. Pork, Horowitz notes, was more convenient. “Everybody had pigs, and pigs are a lot better to raise for meat because they eat anything.” And when it came to grazing animals, cows just made more sense: They provide far more meat per animal, and demand for beef was—and remains—high. This woman does not want to cook mutton. (Photo: Ethan/Flickr) By the end of World War II, mutton had come to symbolize everything that Americans wanted to leave behind. Men returned from the war swearing they’d never eat another bite of mutton after stomaching tinned army rations that included the notoriously unappetizing “Mutton Stew with Vegetables.” Women were enjoying new appliances that allowed them a modicum of freedom from household chores. Modernity and convenience were all the rage, and mutton, which requires dry aging and long, slow cooking times to become tender, was neither modern nor convenient. If mutton ever really had a heyday, by midcentury, it was over. “I joke sometimes that I do lamb by day and sheep by night,” says Cody Heimke, who, in addition to managing the Niman Ranch lamb program, raises a heritage breed of Shropshire sheep on his property in south central Wisconsin. The flock of about 50 head are raised primarily for breeding, but Shropshires were at one time the most popular sheep in the world, primarily because of the quality of their mutton. “[The] breed of sheep doesn’t really matter when it comes to the flavor of lamb, but it does when it comes to the taste of mutton,” he says. Heimke does “a little bit” of direct lamb and mutton sales when he has sheep to harvest, selling middle cuts to a restaurant in Madison, and utilizing the rest for sausages in varieties such as Bavarian-style, Merguez and spicy Berbere. He acknowledges that there isn’t a lot of demand for mutton. “I got a call this year, somebody looking for mutton, which is rare. I don’t usually get those calls.” His advice for would-be mutton eaters? “Find somebody at a local farmers market that’s selling lamb. You really gotta find somebody that’s raising sheep and doing direct marketing, and ask them if they’re doing any mutton.” For his part, Heimke says he enjoys mutton in sausage form. Last year, one of his wholesale clients was looking for ground lamb, but he didn’t have any in stock. “I’m like, ‘Well, what about ground mutton?’ And we [sold] one-pounders of ground mutton,” he says. “I tasted that before I sold any of it, and it was as good or better than any ground lamb I’ve ever had.” Have you ever eaten mutton?

Lamb and mutton are for different types of recipes. As a french guy selling and importing high end food in South East Asia, I&#x27;ve tasted quite a wide array of lambs.The best lamb is young, but not too young. I&#x27;m not a fan of milk-fed lamb where I feel there is quite no taste. The right balance is slaughtered at around 90 to 150 days old. Agneau de Sisteron is a gem. You don&#x27;t need to be highly skilled to cook it. For cutlets, just pan sear until pink inside. For roast and leg, oven, basted with salt olive oil, some garlic cloves inserted inside the meat. It&#x27;s truly magnificent.The older the animal, the bolder the recipes it needs. The best lamb&#x2F;mutton I&#x27;ve ever had was in Marocco, a slow roasted lamb in honey and almonds. So tender it was served from the bone with a spoon. You&#x27;ll notice that mutton is always cooked in a way to counter balance the strong muttony flavour and sublime it with contrasts. Mutton curries are also delicious for the same reason. reply c_o_n_v_e_x 16 hours agoparentWhen I was working construction in Singapore, I used to get mutton biryanis with my field guys.

Our neighbour raises mountain sheep (mainly because they are hardier and don&#x27;t need as much help to give birth) that are smaller than commercial sheep. As a result, they weren&#x27;t really big enough to eat as lamb but were very tasty as hogget.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salterandking.co.uk&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;news&#x2F;what-is-hogget reply clan 4 hours agoparentprevWhile I do agree that mutton requires more hardy recipes I strongly disagree about the subtle esthetics of western cusine as such.If that was the case we would all crave goat. A young goat is very tender and delicate.It can probably be found but I have personally never seen it in a shop. I only tried it because a family member keeps them as pets.Another case could be made for the horse. It used to be a working animal and we would happily eat it.

It&#x27;s the cooking esthetic of Cantonese cuisine (eastern), Japanese food (specifically Kaiseki), French food and Teo Chew cuisine to a lesser extent (more seasoned than Cantonese cuisine). It&#x27;s also seen in other countries in Europe but less so (more often as part of the fine dining which has been influenced by the legacy of French cuisine)Note that while I, personally, mostly tend to like \"tasty but subtle\", it doesn&#x27;t mean that I criticize or dislike other cuisine which have their own advantages.And, lastly, as a kid living in a French rural area, I had my share of mutton (which I absolutely detested back then but now can appreciate)... reply justinator 4 hours agorootparentIt has a changed quite drastically but I (n=1) was raised on Julia Child cookbooks, so tasty (and rich!) but subtle could probably still describe my palette.

What changed here ?In my personal experience, mutton is not common in contemporary Australia. My local supermarkets (Woolworths and Coles) stock lamb, but I don’t remember either of them ever selling mutton. Maybe some specialty butchers might stock it, I don’t know, there isn’t much culture of eating it among the younger generations. That said, I imagine if I went back in a time machine to the 1950s or earlier, it would be much easier to find mutton in Australia.Only time - that I can recall - ever eating “mutton” was in India - and I’ve been told that a lot of Indian “mutton” isn’t actually mutton, it is goat. You can buy goat meat here, most supermarkets don’t, but I’ve seen it in specialty butchers reply gravelc 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s common enough in sheep grazing areas.I grew up in Australia with mutton making up 90% of my meat intake, as we slaughtered our own merino wethers (so not the breeds of lamb raised for eating).The local butchers would also have a decent stock of different cuts, particularly things like neck chops for stews. Numbers of sheep around are lower now, so that may have limited things a little.I also think hogget is equally as or more common than lamb in city butchers. Some of those chops are huge and have a nice tang. reply reddit_clone 11 hours agorootparentprevCan confirm.Most part of southern India, &#x27;mutton&#x27; refers to goat meat.

Looking at goat in french, Chèvre, that is used quite regularly to describe goat&#x27;s milk cheeses, but I&#x27;ve never heard it or a derivative to refer to goat meat.

So lamb cooked to pink is quite delicious. But if you want it cooked all the way through, you have to go for a very long time to get back to a nice texture.And of course eating meat that is pink is a luxury of having very high level of hygiene from the farm all the way to the table. This is difficult and expensive, so even in the highest income countries it has only become common in the last few decades.Here in Scandinavia our traditional dishes involving lamb are also based on boiling or steaming the meat for many hours.

Leg and shoulder usually need slow cooking. reply cookie_monsta 6 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a problem with most undercooked or even raw meats as long as I trust the supply chain (I can imagine how this would be problematic in India). The latest trend of medium-rare pork is a bit too daring for me, though. reply bregma 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s because there is a difference between trichinosis from undercooked pork and E. coli from the unhygenic handling of cut meat in general. E. coli mostly infects just the surface of cut meat so as long as it&#x27;s cooked well on the outside, the insides can still be quivering and ready for action.

As I was reading the article, I was pretty surprised as it continued to not mention the vastly different labeling laws in the U.S. vs the rest of the Anglophone world. In the U.K., for example, meat labeled \"lamb\" legally must come from a sheep that is less than a year old. Meanwhile, U.S. \"lamb\" is typically 12-14 months old [1], since the U.S. has no standards on sheep meat labeling, and permits all sheep meat to be labeled as lamb. Much of the sheep meat sold in the U.S. wouldn&#x27;t be legally considered \"lamb\" in the U.K., Australia, or New Zealand.Meanwhile India has its own, wildly different meaning for mutton: it means goat meat.

I think it&#x27;s because of some pop-science cooking channel on the internetWhile I will not pretend to know all the reasons in fact that this practice has reached such common use, washing your cast iron pan with soap won&#x27;t strip the seasoning that is already set, but it will strip all of the unset oils left over from cooking that are on the surface. If you spend tons of time maintaining cast irons, you will find that the single most important practice to building a smooth surface that never sticks is leaving a thin (towel dry &#x2F; buffed, leave too much and it turns sticky) film of oil on the surface of the pan after every use. If you need to or want to use soap to remove the (again, unset non-seasoning) layer of oil on the surface, you can dry off the pan, add some oil and buff it with a towel before storing. Using some heat during this process, but not smoking the oil is necessary to expand the pores of the pan (or make the oil more viscous and better fill the static surface of the pan, whichever mental model helps you sleep). This process takes extra time and effort to achieve the effect you already have with a well seasoned cast iron after cooking: Food debris washes right off with some light scrubbing and water, leaving a clean surface with a thin layer of oil on the top that has nicely filled all the cracks on the surface. reply paulcole 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is a fantastic take.

This is part of the reason I&#x27;ve been so disappointed with the rise of vegan menus at the expense of vegetarian stuff in restaurants.

Generally the &#x27;working muscles&#x27; like legs tend to be the toughest and have the most connective tissue. However, in long-duration low-temp cooking methods the connective tissue breaks down and provides great flavor and mouth-feel.If you&#x27;re in a hurry, the lamb rack is great. For pretty much any other cut, you want a minimum two hour cook. A pressure cooker helps but it&#x27;s not magic. The main thing is that you can&#x27;t just put it in for X minutes and call it done, no matter what the recipe says. Just keep cooking until you achieve fork-tenderness.If you struggle with the flavor of lamb, avoid the fat, which has most of the \"lambyness\". But then you might as well just eat something else. reply thom 4 hours agorootparentIt isn&#x27;t really the flavour of lamb (I will smother it in any and all condiments available to me), it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t turn to liquid as I chew it, and slowly all the actual tasty stuff dissolves away and you&#x27;re left having to force yourself to swallow. I understand that you and others in this thread will say it&#x27;s been cooked incorrectly, but we seem as a nation committed to having it this way.

I think many people don&#x27;t like lamb (and can&#x27;t stand mutton) simply because of the way it tastes. My one-time fiancee grew up on a (meat) sheep farm in Manitoba. With her, I&#x27;ve toured sheep stations in Australia and New Zealand. I&#x27;ve been offered and eaten it as a local specialty all around the world---I just don&#x27;t like the flavor.Sure, a preparation can make it taste less like lamb, but (for me) I don&#x27;t think it can make it taste good. I&#x27;ll always prefer beef. The closest I&#x27;ve come to liking it is Gyro meat, and that&#x27;s usually half beef, and even then, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d like it more without the lamb. Just last month I had to force myself to finish some homemade golubki (cabbage rolls) made with half lamb and half pork that I otherwise would have found fantastic.One theory is that it depends on what you grew up with, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true either. I grew up eating primarily (deer) venison, and never came to like it either. Later in life I&#x27;ve tried a whole lot of other big game meats, and haven&#x27;t really liked them either. The major exception was (black) bear, which I first had as an adult and thought would be terrible, but it turned out to be incredibly delicious. Whale can be pretty good too, but I don&#x27;t feel right eating it.I personally think the correct theory is that some people are sensitive to the flavors of different proteins, and that those who are most sensitive are least likely to like lamb. A competing theory is that everyone tastes it but some simply like that flavor. It would be interesting to arrange a dilution test to see which of these hypotheses is closer to true.

Consequently, I grew up primarily on a diet of BBQ and roasted pig. However, after moving to Spain, I developed a penchant for the tender piglets from Segovia. Initially, mutton and other lamb dishes were a challenging taste for me due to their robust flavor. However, with time, I’ve come to appreciate and even relish it.Currently, we own a small flock of sheep, which we mainly keep to graze on our property’s grass. This not only ensures a well-maintained lawn but also provides us with financial benefits. We offset the cost of their upkeep by selling the yearlings. Moreover, a local resident benefits from their milk in exchange for assisting in their care.Having said that, over the years, lamb has grown on me significantly. Now, whenever I host a BBQ, mutton is the star of the show. Guests never stop singing praises and eagerly anticipate the next gathering. However, one aspect of cooking mutton that I find challenging is the lingering smell. It necessitates thorough personal hygiene measures, especially for my children and dogs. Cleaning the BBQ after use is essential to prevent the overpowering aroma from lingering. For those with beards, the scent of mutton can stick around for days. My solution?

Literally everything that Americans eat today is a byproduct of the marketing of industrial food producers. If they don&#x27;t want you to eat it, you won&#x27;t see it.

Make sure you get a really good colour on the mutton before you stew it. reply andrewstuart 18 hours agoparentI love curry but can&#x27;t help feeling that meat as delicious as good lamb or fish is wasted in the strong flavor of the curry - better to have a vegetarian curry and enjoy the curry flavors on their own, cook the lamb separately.Well cooked lamb is so delicious it - in my opinion should be eaten only with gravy or a tiny dab of mustard or tiny dab of mint sauce. reply huytersd 17 hours agorootparentThere’s an assumption that ingredients taste good on their own in the west. Most Asian cuisine relies heavily on creating a fantastic spice mix that the meat provides a background flavor to. Texture also matters a lot. The background flavor is not interchangeable.For instance I love fish curries but can’t stand regular roasted&#x2F;steamed fish lightly flavored with salt, dill, butter etc. reply Onewildgamer 5 hours agorootparentprevPlease try Rogan ghosht if you have not. That recipe when done right is the perfect mutton curry ever made. This is a recipe from North India, then there&#x27;s South Indian mutton curries that tastes quite good, particularly the ones in South of Tamilnadu. reply jrochkind1 15 hours agorootparentprevThe main point I got from the OP was that mutton (meat from sheep over 2 years old) and lamb (meat from sheep younger than 1 year) have pretty different taste and other culinary qualities as meat. In particular, that mutton is much stronger flavored and tougher, lamb more tender and delicately flavored.Yet the comments section is full of people treating them interchangeably, replying to someone who talked about mutton by talking about lamb, or vice versa, or talking about \"lamb&#x2F;mutton\". I&#x27;m not sure if the commentors disagree with the OP and think it&#x27;s over-stating the difference? Or just aren&#x27;t really paying attention.I (who live in the USA) have had plenty of lamb, but have never had mutton. So I can&#x27;t say from personal experience.But this is one of those HN articles where the comments section seems entirely divorced from the article. reply masfuerte 17 hours agorootparentprevI make curry out of lamb neck chops with the bones in. It&#x27;s delicious and what else are you going to do with them? reply nmcfarl 17 hours agorootparentIn addition to curries I make a New Mexican style posole stew with my necks - it is also delicious. reply selimthegrim 17 hours agoparentprevA lot of times mutton in Indian subcontinental recipes is synonymous with goat reply TomMasz 4 hours agoprevMy uncle was a Marine in the Pacific in WWII and he was one of those subjected to the canned mutton mentioned in the article.

I thought it was going to be gross, turns out it&#x27;s delicious. It does seem a shame its not more common in the west. reply azemetre 21 hours agoparentNever had mutton myself but other meats I like that are uncommon to find in US grocers are duck, quail, and goat. Duck has gotten easier to find I suppose, the whole foods near me will sell both whole and breasts. I don&#x27;t remember this being the case 3 years ago.But finding goat is very hard. I don&#x27;t tend to go to butchers since there are none near me within walking distance.When I lived in Florida I&#x27;d routinely eat at Caribbean or Dominican or other tropical cuisine restaurants that would all serve goat. Some of my favorite meals I&#x27;ve ever had were in those small hole-in-the-wall places. reply stouset 20 hours agorootparentI honestly can&#x27;t believe duck isn&#x27;t more popular in the US. Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than chicken but part of that (I suspect) is its rarity. But unlike lamb (which I love) being something of an acquired taste, duck is unambiguously delicious.My only real guess is that both duck and lamb–to me–seem more sensitive in general to preparation. Beef, chicken, and pork are less enjoyable when they&#x27;re not cooked well but they&#x27;re still alright. Duck and lamb seem significantly less enjoyable when they&#x27;re prepared badly. reply chungy 17 hours agorootparent> Beef, chicken, and pork are less enjoyable when they&#x27;re not cooked well but they&#x27;re still alright.I get that you don&#x27;t really mean \"well\" in the steak sense, but I still can&#x27;t help but to think of how I love medium rare.

Different strokes for different folks? reply azemetre 19 hours agorootparentprevDuck is absolutely great, there&#x27;s a Thai restaurant near me that makes a great tasting fried duck breast with a peanut sauce. Incredibly crispy, incredibly delicious. Highly underrated meat as you said. reply ajmurmann 13 hours agorootparentprevTo me the surprise is the popularity of turkey over duck and goose. Turkey is cheaper, but needs to be prepared really well in order to be mediocre. A badly cooked duck or goose is much better than a perfect turkey. The ceiling for goose is high and even higher for duck, but the floor is already pretty high. reply timc3 9 hours agorootparentTurkey is much much cheaper to raise in quantity than duck or goose.

Yes I&#x27;ve had it deep fried, baked, smoked, you name it, still hate it.We switched to duck instead a few years back and it&#x27;s positively wonderful. Anyone who eats with us admits it&#x27;s way better than turkey.I have no idea why it&#x27;s not more popular... reply timc3 9 hours agorootparentI posted this above, but its because its much much cheaper and turkey can be farmed on a scale which is very difficult to do with duck or geese.Its not banned from our table, but it would get the same reception from my family as if I had heated up some microwave meals. But we grew up on farms and had good access to better alternatives.BTW, if you like duck, try Goose for thanksgiving, and make sure you use the fat if making roasted potatoes. reply silisili 8 hours agorootparentThanks. Never even thought of trying a goose, I&#x27;ll try to source one this year. reply ajmurmann 13 hours agorootparentprevI think it falls in the same trap as lamb, mutton and goat. Americans don&#x27;t like food with a lot of flavor.

It&#x27;s definitely not all of \"The West\". In Europe (UK, France, Belgium), mutton is pretty common. reply ssl232 21 hours agorootparentActually, in the UK, mutton tends mainly to be eaten by members of Asian, Middle Eastern and Caribbean communities. It&#x27;s not widely sold in supermarkets all over the country, unlike, say, lamb. And where it is sold in a supermarket it tends to be one product line where there might be several for more common types of meat like beef, pork and lamb. reply downWidOutaFite 21 hours agorootparentIs there really much difference between mutton and lamb meats? reply a2tech 21 hours agorootparentYes. Mutton is the meat of the adult sheep, lamb is the meat of a juvenile sheep. The flavor is different, but in a volume-ish way. If you think of the flavor of lamb as being a 4, the strength of the mutton flavor is like a 7-8. It&#x27;s the same flavor, there&#x27;s just way more of it. reply kbash9 21 hours agorootparentprevMutton is really goat. Lamb is just lamb meat. IMO, lamb is sometimes harder to cook because of the smell - you need the right spices to get rid of the smell. Easy to get mutton in most urban areas in the west - just look for a Halal meat shop. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentIn the UK lamb is cooked mostly unspiced - maybe a touch of rosemary and garlic. Mint sauce is used as a condiment. reply a2tech 21 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never seen &#x27;mutton&#x27; be goat.

In Ontario, you can&#x27;t sell meat from game. (You can&#x27;t even give it away, technically, unless it was inspected and butchered by a licensed butcher.)So any venison in the store will have come from farm-raised deer.

DAN GOODIN - 9/26/2023, 10:40 AM Enlarge 57 WITH GPUs from all six of the major suppliers are vulnerable to a newly discovered attack that allows malicious websites to read the usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by other websites, researchers have demonstrated in a paper published Tuesday. The cross-origin attack allows a malicious website from one domain—say, example.com—to effectively read the pixels displayed by a website from example.org, or another different domain. Attackers can then reconstruct them in a way that allows them to view the words or images displayed by the latter site. This leakage violates a critical security principle that forms one of the most fundamental security boundaries safeguarding the Internet. Known as the same origin policy, it mandates that content hosted on one website domain be isolated from all other website domains.

ADVERTISING Optimizing bandwidth at a cost GPU.zip, as the proof-of-concept attack has been named, starts with a malicious website that places a link to the webpage it wants to read inside of an iframe, a common HTML element that allows sites to embed ads, images, or other content hosted on other websites. Normally, the same origin policy prevents either site from inspecting the source code, content, or final visual product of the other. The researchers found that data compression that both internal and discrete GPUs use to improve performance acts as a side channel that they can abuse to bypass the restriction and steal pixels one by one. Advertisement “We found that modern GPUs automatically try to compress this visual data, without any application involvement,” Yingchen Wang, the lead author and a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in an email. “This is done to save memory bandwidth and improve performance. Since compressibility is data dependent, this optimization creates a side channel which can be exploited by an attacker to reveal information about the visual data.” For GPU.zip to work, a malicious page must be loaded into the Chrome or Edge browsers. Under-the-hood differences in the way Firefox and Safari work prevent the attack from succeeding when those browsers process an attack page. Another requirement is that the page linked to in the iframe must not be configured to deny being embedded by cross-origin websites. The security threats that can result when HTML is embedded in iframes on malicious websites have been well-known for more than a decade. Most websites restrict the cross-origin embedding of pages displaying user names, passwords, or other sensitive content through X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers. Not all, however, do. One example is Wikipedia, which shows the usernames of people who log in to their accounts. A person who wants to remain anonymous while visiting a site they don’t trust could be outed if it contained an iframe containing a link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page. Enlarge / Pixel stealing PoC for deanonymizing a user, run with other tabs open playing video. “Ground Truth” is the victim iframe (Wikipedia logged in as “Yingchenw”). “AMD” is the attack result on a Ryzen 7 4800U after 30 minutes, with 97 percent accuracy. “Intel” is the attack result for an i7-8700 after 215 minutes with 98 percent accuracy. Wang et al. The researchers showed how GPU.zip allows a malicious website they created for their PoC to steal pixels one by one for a user’s Wikipedia username. The attack works on GPUs provided by Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Arm, and Nvidia. On AMD’s Ryzen 7 4800U, GPU.zip took about 30 minutes to render the targeted pixels with 97 percent accuracy. The attack required 215 minutes to reconstruct the pixels when displayed on a system running an Intel i7-8700. Advertisement All of the GPUs analyzed use proprietary forms of compression to optimize the bandwidth available in the memory data bus of the PC, phone, or other device displaying the targeted content. The compression schemes differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and are undocumented, so the researchers reverse-engineered each one. The insights yielded a method that uses the SVG, or the scalable vector graphics image format, to maximize differences in DRAM traffic between black and white target pixels in the presence of compression. While their paper discusses GPU.zip as it applies to iGPUs, or internal GPUs, the technique applies equally to standalone or discrete GPUs as well. In their paper, the researchers wrote: We demonstrate that an attacker can exploit the iGPU-based compression channel to perform cross-origin pixel stealing attacks in the browser using SVG filters (the latest version of Google Chrome as of April 2023), even though SVG filters are implemented at constant time. The reason is that the attacker can create highly redundant or highly non-redundant patterns depending on a single secret pixel in the browser. As these patterns are processed by the iGPU, their varying degrees of redundancy cause the lossless compression output to depend on the secret pixel. The data-dependent compression output directly translates to data-dependent DRAM traffic and data-dependent cache occupancy. Consequently, we show that, even under the most passive threat model—where an attacker can only observe coarse-grained redundancy information of a pattern using a coarse-grained timer in the browser and lacks the ability to adaptively select input—individual pixels can be leaked. Our proof-of-concept attack succeeds on a range of devices (including computers, phones) from a variety of hardware vendors with distinct GPU architectures (Intel, AMD, Apple, Nvidia). Surprisingly, our attack also succeeds on discrete GPUs, and we have preliminary results indicating the presence of software-transparent compression on those architectures as well.

It applies a filter over the webpage and measures how long it takes to draw.

I wouldn&#x27;t call it beautiful, it&#x27;s more like a well-considered thorough engineering tour-de-force. I&#x27;m horrified but applaud the team.Here&#x27;s how it works: a stack of SVG filters is created. These filters are constructed so that they will tend to be faster processing a dark pixel than they will be processing a light pixel.An iframe is loaded up by the attacking site, pointing at, say, a banking site or some other target of interest. I couldn&#x27;t find exact details, and my HTML skills are rusty, but I assume the iframe is a 1x1 pixel iframe, and given a pixel offset.The SVG stack is loaded onto the iframe using CSS, then unloaded, then loaded, etc. a whole bunch of times, and average timing results are assessed. Based on these average times, the pixel is marked &#x27;dark&#x27; or &#x27;light&#x27;. Repeat for each pixel.Average time per pixel is in the 1-2 second range. Per pixel. So, this is a slow attack. It could probably get an order of magnitude faster with a sort of combo of zooming and greyscale heuristics that resolves over time, though.They have a number of cool graphs showing the broad spread of times, and it does look easy to distinguish; their success varies by architecture, but it&#x27;s over 96% for almost every architecture they test. They show it works while multiple videos and other things that tax the GPU are playing.Proposed fix: let browsers tell the GPU they need some variant of constant-time processing for an iframe. Which is super, super gross.Safari and Firefox don&#x27;t currently allow cross-site iframe injection, so the attack only works on Chromium-line browsers.Again, eww. And, wow! reply twelvechairs 17 hours agoparentWhy isn&#x27;t the proposed fix \"don&#x27;t allow cross-site iframe injection\"? It is surely a security risk that other browsers have taken that stand on no? reply Asraelite 8 hours agorootparentSite permissions are already a thing for e.g. video and location access. I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;re not extended to all these other attack vectors: WebGPU, WebRTC, canvas, Web Audio, iframes, precise timing functions, WASM etc.Most sites don&#x27;t need any of these features so why not make them opt-in and per-site? reply nicce 8 hours agorootparent95% of the people have no idea what they mean and just click yes. reply kevingadd 17 hours agorootparentprevdisabling CSS&#x2F;SVG filters for cross-site content also seems like a pretty reasonable thing to do reply chatmasta 16 hours agorootparentYeah, it seems like that would mitigate most of the issues. At the very least, Chrome could introduce and respect a CSP flag on the iframed site that indicates it can be iframed but not with SVG filters. That wouldn&#x27;t sacrifice backward compatibility but would at least allow sites to opt out of the behavior (and into extra security protection). (And I say \"Chrome,\" not \"browsers,\" because it&#x27;s the only browser that satisfies the three prerequisites of the attack, one of which is adding SVG filters to iframes, as described in the site&#x2F;paper).On the other hand, it would be more effective in reverse, i.e. to require iframed sites to opt-in to allowing host sites to apply SVG&#x2F;CSS filters to them. Sure, this would break backward compatibility. But who cares? What is the reason for the strong attachment to SVG filters on iframes? Is this a common use case? When is it beneficial?For the other described prerequisites of the attack, like allowing embedding iframes with third-party cookies inside them, I understand the use case (although if we&#x27;re being honest this is mostly because of Google wanting to retain YouTube tracking). But SVG filters on iframes? Really? reply wolpoli 17 hours agorootparentprevDoes anyone know the use case for cross-site CSS&#x2F;SVG filters and who would need even need it? reply drug-freedom 16 hours agorootparentFor example you want to display a small blurred thumbnail of an iframe. reply taberiand 13 hours agorootparentPerhaps some things we just shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do replykfarr 17 hours agoparentprevI love 3d graphics on the web but man it seems to be an infinite security hole reply kevingadd 17 hours agorootparentIn this case it&#x27;s SVG and not WebGL or CSS 3D that is the problem here. Even without hardware acceleration the SVG filters would still probably expose timing data reply chatmasta 16 hours agorootparentTechnically it&#x27;s the use of the GPU for rendering the SVG that&#x27;s the issue. Perhaps even without GPU rendering there&#x27;d be similar side channels available, but at least they&#x27;d be \"software visible\" (to use the words of the paper) rather than \"software transparent.\"Something I didn&#x27;t understand from my skimming of the paper, though: does this side channel only apply to windows&#x2F;iframes within the same browser? Why couldn&#x27;t it apply to windows of different apps? If the GPU rendered a frame buffer somewhere on the screen, then is that exposed by the attack, regardless of whether it&#x27;s within the browser? e.g. could Chrome.app identify some pixels from a PDF open in Preview.app? reply kevingadd 14 hours agorootparentNormally pixels belonging to other processes aren&#x27;t visible to you. There have been incidents in the past where (usually due to a driver bug) processes could grab pixels from other processes&#x27; textures&#x2F;render targets, but normally you&#x27;re only supposed to be able to get those pixels by asking the OS (usually its compositor specifically) for them.I think this side channel partly relies on being able to stack the iframe on top of attacker-controlled image content. Preview.app will be at an unknown position on the screen, and the Chrome.app window could also be at any position and move, so it&#x27;s much harder to imagine a way to apply this attack in that scenario. reply autoexec 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not the first time SVG has caused problems.

The paper explains how the GPU stores pixels in memory in a losslessly compressed format in order to speed up data transfers. And the filter stack is designed so that a dark pixel input produces an all-black output (very compressible), while a light pixel input produces noise as output (very incompressible).Link to original paper:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hertzbleed.com&#x2F;gpu.zip&#x2F;GPU-zip.pdf reply Waterluvian 14 hours agorootparentprevNot sure.

Perhaps this should be framed as another chromium-based exploit rather than a GPU issue. reply kevingadd 19 hours agorootparentIn this case it&#x27;s because Chrome supports a relatively obscure use case (GPU-accelerated CSS filters on a cross-origin iframe), it&#x27;s not really a bug or a vulnerability in the browser. reply djbusby 18 hours agorootparentSeems like the root reason for wanting accelerated CSS on cross-origin iframe is for flashy&#x2F;fancy embeds...like, IDK, ads or something? reply kevingadd 17 hours agorootparentAt the point where you&#x27;re rasterizing, the distinction between same-origin and cross-origin is not necessarily present. It&#x27;s possible this just works because it happened to work, and nobody ever went out of their way to implement it.i.e. the display list for the page has some boxes for iframes, and those boxes are identical to the rasterizer regardless of what origin they&#x27;re from, so it happily applies filters to all of the iframes. reply vimax 17 hours agorootparentprevYou seem knowledgeable on this. Why is only chrome supporting this feature and other browsers aren’t? Was this feature pushed by the chrome team?As for your second point, how is this not a vulnerability in the browser? The security intent is clear, a page should not be able to inspect an iframe. I can’t take a screenshot and read the pixels of the iframe. The fact the chromium supports a published standard is irrelevant. The browser exposes information it is not supposed to and is vulnerable to attack.The intent of the css feature was not to allow reading iframe pixels. If that cannot be avoided, then the feature is insecure and any browser implementing it has a vulnerability. If it can be avoided then chrome has an insecure implementation. reply kevingadd 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have any reason to believe that the Chrome team pushed for this use case specifically. In the past when I experimented with SVG filters their feature support was already very different across Trident Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, as was their implementation (hardware accelerated vs not). SVG filters are very powerful and also very slow, and not necessarily constant-time, so they&#x27;re a good target if you&#x27;re trying to execute a timing attack. (For whatever reason, my old JSIL project actually happened to use SVG filters to accelerate a specific use case...)I think it would be fair to call it an oversight that Chromium allows cross-origin use of the features involved in this attack, but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like a vulnerability in the traditional sense to me - everything is working as intended&#x2F;specified AFAIK. It just happens to expose a timing attack. The reality is that tons of things are potential timing attacks and if every single feature that might get used for one was disabled in advance the web platform would be pretty useless.There are various constraints you could apply to make attacks like this harder - i.e. limiting filter stacks to say 4 items, limiting use of filters cross-origin - but I find it understandable that such things didn&#x27;t happen. This functionality is probably also quite old so it&#x27;s possible nobody was taking timing attacks quite as seriously back then. reply c22 16 hours agorootparent> The reality is that tons of things are potential timing attacks and if every single feature that might get used for one was disabled in advance the web platform would be pretty useless.I feel like the web platform would be much more useful if I didn&#x27;t have to constantly worry about drive-by attacks leveraging bugs in a giant stack of \"web technologies\" that are only getting more complex with each passing year. reply beebeepka 17 hours agorootparentprevInteresting points. However, I think the reasons are much simpler: why wouldn&#x27;t you want accelerated CSS in your browser, including cross-origin iframes?Browsers have been making use of GPUs for a long time. It&#x27;s faster than the CPU and saves battery reply kevingadd 17 hours agorootparentYes, between the device with hardware accelerated rendering and the device without, the user is likely going to prefer the former because software implementations are much slower and much more power-hungry.

    "title": "GPU.zip: side channel attack that exposes visual data processed on the GPU",
    "originLink": "https://www.hertzbleed.com/gpu.zip/",
    "originBody": "GPU.zip PaperQ&A GPU.zip is a new type of side channel that exposes visual data processed on the graphics processing unit (GPU). This channel exploits an optimization that is data dependent, software transparent, and present in nearly all modern GPUs: graphical data compression. We present the first security-centric analysis of this optimization and demonstrate that it can be abused to leak visual data. For example, using GPU.zip, a malicious webpage can leak pixels from another webpage in the latest version of Google Chrome, violating the browser security model. Research Paper The GPU.zip paper will appear in the 45th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (San Francisco, 20-23 May 2024) with the following title: GPU.zip: On the Side-Channel Implications of Hardware-Based Graphical Data Compression You can download a preprint from here and the BibTeX citation from here. The paper is the result of a collaboration between the following researchers: Yingchen Wang (University of Texas at Austin) Riccardo Paccagnella (Carnegie Mellon University) Zhao Gang (University of Texas at Austin) Willy R. Vasquez (University of Texas at Austin) David Kohlbrenner (University of Washington) Hovav Shacham (University of Texas at Austin) Christopher Fletcher (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) Questions and Answers Am I affected by GPU.zip? Likely, yes. We tested integrated GPUs from AMD, Apple, Arm, Intel, and Qualcomm and one discrete GPU from Nvidia. We have at least preliminary results to show that all tested GPUs are affected. I am a website developer. How do I protect my users? If your website displays sensitive information about users, you should configure your website to deny being embedded by cross-origin websites. For more information on how to do this, we refer to this web.dev article. I am a user. Should I be worried? Under most circumstances, probably not. Most sensitive websites already deny being embedded by cross-origin websites. As a result, they are not vulnerable to the pixel stealing attack we mounted using GPU.zip. However, some websites remain vulnerable. For example, if a user who is logged into Wikipedia visits a malicious webpage, that webpage can exploit GPU.zip to learn the user’s Wikipedia username (as we demonstrate in Section 5.4 of the paper). What makes GPU.zip different from prior compression side channels? GPU.zip exploits software-transparent uses of compression. This is in contrast to prior compression side channels, which leak because of software-visible uses of compression and can be mitigated by disabling compression in software. For a more detailed explanation, we refer to the paper. What exactly is GPU graphical data compression? GPU graphical data compression is a feature of modern GPUs used to save memory bandwidth and improve performance without any software involvement. Specifically, modern GPUs compress graphical data losslessly even when software does not request any compression. Interestingly, the algorithms used by GPUs for graphical data compression vary across vendors and microarchitectures. Check out the paper for a reverse engineering of several proprietary compression algorithms used by Intel and AMD. When did you disclose GPU.zip? We disclosed our findings and proof-of-concept code to GPU vendors (AMD, Apple, Arm, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm) and to Google in March 2023. Do GPU vendors plan to patch? As of September 2023, no GPU vendor has committed to patching. Does Chrome plan to patch? As of September 2023, Google is still deciding whether and how to patch. What about other browsers? Chrome is vulnerable to the pixel stealing attack demonstrated in the paper because it satisfies the following three criteria: It allows cross-origin iframes to be loaded with cookies. It allows rendering SVG filters on iframes. It delegates rendering tasks to the GPU. Other browsers, like Firefox and Safari, do not meet all these criteria and are therefore not vulnerable. Can I use the logo? Yes. The GPU.zip logo is free to use under a CC0 license. Download logo: SVG, PNG Download logo with text: SVG, PNG Did you release the source code of GPU.zip? Yes, you can find the source code at the link: https://github.com/UT-Security/gpu-zip Last updated on September 26, 2023. This website was inspired by the DROWN attack website, which was designed by Sarah Madden and is free to use under a CC0 license.",

It’s stupid that such bugs occur, but occur they do. GPU drivers especially have historically been mindbogglingly badly implemented, though most of the worst problems are fully ironed out now. But what’s being reported here is far more subtle, a side-channel attack based on data compression. reply planede 7 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think this was the same vulnerability that you saw happening. I think many operations in shaders produce \"unspecified\" pixel values, which in practice often just manifests in getting pixel values from some previously freed buffer that is not yet overwritten.I believe webgl should remove these kind of side channels, but implementations could have bugs.Also GPU vendors should consider multi-user usage anyway and make these side channels impossible outside of webgl too.

And then went on to destroy that model with threads... but I digress. This process isolation culture was probably born from shared systems where each user needs to be isolated from each other. but has served us well with in providing robust single user systems. and has proved critical with the move back to shared cloud computing.Graphical processing units hove no concept of memory isolation. and have no culture of wanting it. They were high performance units for a single user only. At this point trying to introduce isolation levels would probably be a lost cause. Many people would be very unhappy at the performance hit that would be required.But yeah a GPU in a shared environment spooks me as well. reply kimixa 14 hours agorootparentAll modern GPUs have isolated memory contexts and full CPU-like virtual memory address space and page tables for each user context.

As far as I can tell from what you&#x27;re trying to say, your comment is completely incorrect about GPUs not supporting that.From the description given, I assume this is using timing differences to tell the size of each compressed tile, which gives you info on it&#x27;s contents. This is certainly not helped by the ability for an apparently untrusted iframe to apply a transform to a target that the security model would normally disallow reading pixels from, amplifying the data from this side channel. Without that it&#x27;s \"just\" another sidechannel attack. reply somat 12 hours agorootparentAh, consider myself corrected then. I have not done much gpu programing(i guess it shows). I was under the impression there was no virtual memory and any illusion of an isolated process was solely due to driver trickery. reply heavenlyblue 8 hours agorootparentSo you wrote something completely wrong with no experience in it as if it were a fact? reply NotCamelCase 8 hours agorootparentYeah, I had to check if it&#x27;s one of those bots.

Maybe the memory access pattern and the compression used by the GPU drivers combined with the sensitivity of the information being transferred make the GPU drivers an attractive target for this attack vector.But in principle this attack vector could be present for other processes without the GPU being involved at all, couldn&#x27;t it?

You need to either a) have an answer for \"what happens if you get hit by a bus?\" or b) create a product for customers to whom that doesn&#x27;t matter. In general, people really _like_ being able to chat with the founder directly (lean into that! it&#x27;s a superpower!) but feel very anxious about committing $X0,000&#x2F;yr to you.2. It will be somewhere between \"vanishingly rare\" to \"non-existent\" to feel like you are moving as fast as you should be. Instead of setting milestones and thinking about metrics, _especially_ in the early goings I&#x27;d focus on just spending as much time as you can on critical-path work (chatting with customers, chatting with prospects, improving core flows.)3. This does not matter. I moved from Seattle to Richmond, VA last year and literally nothing changed about my business.4. This is a very broad topic that is hard to answer concisely, but the closest answer I can give is \"figure out how your first five users found your product and then figure out how to find more people like them\".5. Venture capital is a tool by which you exchange agency for large sums of money. There are a lot of great businesses that require more time, energy, and money than can be provided by a single engineer working for an indefinite amount of time; there are a lot of great businesses that can be built without those things. I would not take a lot of stock in any prescriptive answer that says you HAVE to take VC or you HAVE to bootstrap; it depends on the type of company you want to build and what you consider a successful way to spend a decade or so of your life. reply ye-olde-sysrq 20 hours agoparentVC can be a great way to break into markets that just have inherently large moats or barriers to entry. Stripe is an example: you can code all you like but you literally can&#x27;t move money without going through a ton of very annoying (to devs, anyway) footwork to get cozy with the existing financial institutions. The connections your VCs give you can matter as much as the money.They can also literally kill your company. VCs have a very specific strategy: they give some money to 1000 companies knowing that 990 of them will return 0% in the hopes that of the remaining ten, 9 of them return %X000 and one returns %X0000. Given this, they are going to have very little interest in finding a company that will return even \"good\" results. They&#x27;re going to push you to shoot for huge growth or die trying. And given the choice between \"grow modestly and safely\" and \"grow faster but risk exploding\" they will push you to pick the latter, because in their business model they can&#x27;t even count low enough to measure returns that are just 10x. reply chadash 20 hours agorootparent> They can also literally kill your company. VCs have a very specific strategy: they give some money to 1000 companies knowing that 990 of them will return 0% in the hopes that of the remaining ten, 9 of them return %X000 and one returns %X0000. +1 to this.There are definitely different models for VCs, but in general, the big \"brand name\" VCs are in the unicorn business. This tweet [1] does a succinct job of explaining why.The result of this is that as a founder, if you own 49% of your company and big-VC investors own 51% of your company and someone comes along offering to buy your company for $100m, your investors are likely to turn it down. For you, that would likely be a life-changing amount of money. For a big-name VC, it doesn&#x27;t move the needle. In most cases, they&#x27;d rather roll the dice and end up with $0 then get their share of a $100m exit.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jasonlk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1670021902612549632?ref_s... reply user_7832 18 hours agorootparent> There are definitely different models for VCs, but in general, the big \"brand name\" VCs are in the unicorn business.Slightly naive question, but does this include YC? The wording on their page makes it sound like joining YC would help most startups but is that just for show? Or does this apply much more when the VC owns >50% of the company? reply chadash 14 hours agorootparentTake a look at the second chat at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jaredheyman.medium.com&#x2F;on-the-176-annual-return-of-a.... The vast majority of returns for YC are for the companies at the tippy top of that chart (Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox and a few others).YC certainly provides a nice package to founders.

There is an exception if they want to make a token investment, like helping the poor or disadvantaged will get them a badge in their social circle or they need it for PR.People run their business on their own mostly because they don&#x27;t have money to hire a team that will \"survive\" owner being hit by a bus.So if a potential investor asks that question, it&#x27;s better to politely turn them down.

They just want to know what will happen in that instance. Most companies derisk this by hiring other people, even though that drastically reduces profits. Telling people why they should feel patronised by reasonable questions is not going to help them navigate reality.> In reality the rich look for business run by someone with generational wealth or someone who already made it and they don&#x27;t trust the poor.This just isn&#x27;t the case.

They have a history of screwing small companies.Small companies often seem to imagine this will solve all their problems. It seems to be the business equivalent of the fantasy of winning the lottery and then having it made in the shade. In reality, winning the lottery frequently doesn&#x27;t end well and landing a big contract early on often doesn&#x27;t either.I used to imagine I would keep a file of such stories but never did. It&#x27;s been challenging to find examples when I want them. But it also seems to be common knowledge in some circles.Feel free to bite off more than you can chew and view it as a growth opportunity, but be aware that getting too much of your revenue from one client makes you their bitch. It&#x27;s like all the downside of being an employee plus all the downside of running a business.Best of luck. reply Klonoar 20 hours agoparentI ran into this early on and it’s a very tight rope to walk. You’re early and trying to keep the big fish so you over-extend and then you’re stuck with that level until you figure out how to reset the expectations - which can be tricky to do.It blocks you from doing other more critical things that, while they might not make you revenue today, will potentially make you revenue later.I’ve never been a fan of VC money but if you’ve gone through this kind of bootstrapping you can certainly appreciate some of what it solves - tho the grass is always greener and all that. reply dmuso 18 hours agoparentprevYeah this happened to me and it killed my business. I didn’t have enough time to expand the business and I didn’t charge the first customer enough to scale it up with employees.It was really the stress that killed it. Being in that situation was not fun and I ended up burning out and telling my big customer to go jump. They threatened to sue me and I was done so I just said “give it your best shot”. Nothing came of the threat in the end. The experience has left a lot of scars and after 15 years not all of them have healed. reply GabeIsko 20 hours agoparentprevLanding big contracts as a small company - it&#x27;s not all bad. They can bring in a lot of revenue, for not that much sales effort. And if you have good processes down, they can also be much easier to deliver on. At least in the US, contract law can be very fair, financing options to facilitate large contracts are plentiful, and most large businesses act in good faith.So it isn&#x27;t so much landing a big contract is bad, but landing a big contract that you can&#x27;t deliver on is very bad. Determining what you can and can&#x27;t do, how much you need to invest into your internal processes and capabilities - that is the challenge of running a business.Usually, in successful businesses I have worked at (or business units), I see a split. Ideally it would be 50-50 large contracts to small accounts, but usually realistically is is more like 60-40. Probably depends on the industry too. reply withinboredom 25 minutes agorootparentHow does “I want x feature for $y or I terminate the contract according to our terms” bring contract law into the equation. Most often you have a single person in the big org as your champion. If they leave, you leave.There are many ways to be their bitch. Many, many ways. reply jrockway 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you are getting a lot of money and probably a great case study for your marketing material. On the other hand, you are probably going to be asked to move your product in a direction you wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise taken it. Sometimes that&#x27;s great, sometimes you&#x27;re just a contract software engineer for much less money than you&#x27;d get doing that explicitly. You can be wary or you can be excited, every case is different. reply no_wizard 18 hours agorootparentRollout clauses can help with this.For instance, don&#x27;t draw up a contract blindly, mandate an install base and training as part of the package, and that contractually, it must be installed, training complete, and in process for X number of days, and in that time period requests are limited to direct support (IE, actual bugs or user questions). You should be meeting with users as much as possible during this time, if you can. Make it clear that you only want and will listen to their feedback and make changes in that respect.Then, schedule a meeting with the users at the end of the specified period, to get a sum of all the positives and negatives of the product, and have a separate with management about whats next, what your roadmap with them looks like (if applicable) etc.This keeps the relationship in control in a positive way, usually for everyone.I&#x27;ve seen clauses like this before in enterprise contracts. If you can everyone to agree to it, they turn those fears into assets real quick, and helps manage the burdensome spam of support requests for X or Y feature. reply gnicholas 20 hours agoparentprevI can see how this might happen, but it&#x27;s also a very good way to establish credibility with other customers (and funders, if you&#x27;re looking to go that route). IME, it all but eliminates questions about \"are you too small?\" if you&#x27;re already doing business with a big, well-known company.You should try to ascertain whether they are likely to be aligned with your other customers in terms of feature development, and seek to find other large-ish customers so that you&#x27;re not totally dependent upon that one. You should also try to make the dependence bilateral — make it so that you&#x27;re delivering tons of unique value to them, so that they can&#x27;t say \"add X feature or we&#x27;re dropping you\". reply DoreenMichele 20 hours agorootparentI looked around and found one or two articles that essentially said \"If one customer is more than x percentage of your revenue, time to diversify. Start actively drumming up new business.\"If you are so small that you can&#x27;t actively look to take on more customers because they take up all your time and you don&#x27;t want to gamble on hiring more help when you don&#x27;t really need it, you have a problem.This seems to be partly a self created issue. Small businesses seem to think \"We&#x27;re friends!\"No, you aren&#x27;t and big businesses know that having dealt with enough assholes themselves already.No one can make you work only for them but the reality is if you want to stay a one-man operation and not hire more people and this one customer is 80 percent of your revenue, the tendency is to feel like \"This works!\" -- until it suddenly doesn&#x27;t and they have you over a barrel. reply gnicholas 20 hours agorootparentYeah, if you&#x27;ve got 80% of your revenue coming from one customer, that&#x27;s not great. But it all depends on how you work with your customers. In my business, things are pretty hands-off, and we have calls only a couple times a year, largely to talk about promoting our work together (our tech is a customer-facing differentiator for them, so we give joint talks at conferences and such).I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s some magic percentage, over which you need to diversify. You should always be looking to get other customers, and if you have one big one then it should be easier to get other big&#x2F;medium-sized ones. reply hermitcrab 17 hours agoparentprevIn my experience it&#x27;s not so much that they are out to screw you. It is just there is a mismatch when a big company buys from a small company. Big Co has long sales cycles, needs a lot of paperwork done, wants training, may need consultants onsite etc. Small companies are not generally well set up for this. Also your income is more predictable if you average 1000 customers paying $100 per year, than if you average 10 customers paying $10,000 per year. Also a few big paying customers can push you around in a way that lots of smaller customers can&#x27;t. reply DoreenMichele 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I didn&#x27;t say they set out to screw them, just that it does happen.I had a corporate job. People have trouble seeing big companies as having the same cash flow issues etc they have. They imagine they are sitting on a fortune, not that a lot of those assets are needed to just run the company.I remember reading one story about a small company waiting to get paid by BigCo and BigCo ran into issues and then tried to stiff them on payments by saying something like \"This is for the latest thing we ordered and we no longer owe you those old payments cuz (legal loophole)\" and the small company updated its language to counter such claims and insist \"Payment is for the oldest thing we did for you...etc\"They probably weren&#x27;t trying to kill the small company. They were just trying to survive their own financial downturn.It&#x27;s why I used to think \"I should collect such stories when I see them.\" Small businesses tend to be \"The new kid\" who learns this the hard way and may not survive the lesson. I would like this issue to get more publicity so small businesses get better at managing such things realistically. reply Cpoll 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve seen this firsthand. If the relationship isn&#x27;t well managed, all resources go to niche big-customer use-cases, and the product stagnates. reply ozim 18 hours agorootparentYou can also just accept that is \"best what you can earn\" with the product and earn that money on BigFish and move to the next project.It is also perfectly fine option. I just wanted to add that it never is so clear cut and one might be having \"going to the moon\" ideas where product is basically in BigFish niche and no other company will really use it as much and especially other BigFish2 wont hop on the bandwagon because they are competitors and will never take risk of having some part of their business in the same pot as the other.Even if technically it is super cool or whatever. reply varispeed 20 hours agoparentprev> Feel free to bite off more than you can chew and view it as a growth opportunity, but be aware that getting too much of your revenue from one client makes you their bitch. It&#x27;s like all the downside of being an employee plus all the downside of running a business.One mistake is charging the client with thinking that you will be able to service the contract yourself, but fee being not enough to hire a capable employee and have nice profit on top of that.Rule of thumb - if the client doesn&#x27;t want to pay you enough so that you can hire someone or even a small team, with everything that goes along - office space etc and you can&#x27;t have a profit on top, then this is not really a client, but employer who wants an employee without having to be actually responsible for one. It&#x27;s not a business relationship. reply DoreenMichele 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s probably a big part of it.If you undercharge on some small, one-time job, afterwards you go \"Whoopsie! Time to adjust my fees. No big.\"You undercharge on some big, ongoing contract and it can feel like you can&#x27;t make any real changes. And now you&#x27;re stuck in this bad deal. (Or at least feel stuck.)People tend to not know how to \"fire\" a bad client and the idea that you can choose your clients, at least to some degree via market positioning, is alien for many people. reply jacquesm 21 hours agoprevJust you is also a plus: nobody to convince, 100% focus on the product. If you can hack it for a while like that until you need to bring in more people it may work to your advantage, unless you don&#x27;t like working alone. One thing it will save you from is co-founder trouble (which is pretty common). One thing where you&#x27;ll be week is criticism of your ideas and implementation, try to find people to have these roles for you in your network, this can be completely remote.Save. Whenever you can. Make sure you have plenty of money in the bank once you have some surplus, one day you&#x27;ll need it and the size of your bankroll will determine whether or not your first crisis will be your last.Other than that: where you are can be an advantage if the cost of living isn&#x27;t high.Marketing: make sure your customers are happy first, then ask if they can be used as references, plenty of them will go to bat for you if your product is good. They might even give you referrals. Good and happy customers >> marketing budget.As for fundraising: unless you have a very solid plan I wouldn&#x27;t bother for now, first get your stuff established a bit and then when you have more substance if you are still interested in raising funds you could do it but make sure it is an option and not a must because otherwise you will hand control to your investors before they&#x27;re even on board (and they are pretty good at detecting that).best of luck! reply jedberg 21 hours agoprev> It is just me - is that a red flag? Some people have asked me about my team and I told them it was just me. I got the feeling that it may have turned them off because the conversation kind of ended right there.Solo people and even small teams are a huge risk to enterprises. They will have to dedicate time to negotiating with you and integrating your solution. If you just disappear after that, that&#x27;s a huge problem for them.Fog Creek talked about this a long time ago, where they priced their B2B product just below the typical limit for an engineer to expense, so that engineers could just buy their product online with a credit card and expense it.

I sell bits over the internet, my marginal costs are zero!\" I mean the cost of either your time managing an enterprise sales cycle yourself or hiring somebody to do it so you can actually work on your product, times many many potential clients (because most will fall out of the sales funnel, so you need to have lots in flight to get some in the door by the end of the month).It can be untenable to price a product anywhere between $500&#x2F;mo (or whatever the cutoff is) and $20k&#x2F;y. reply gnicholas 21 hours agoprevRegarding (1), are you selling B2B or B2C. I&#x27;ve found that B2C customers typically don&#x27;t care that much, and if anything they are happy to be communicating with the founder. This is true once you have something built. It may be different when you&#x27;re still at the idea phase, and thinking about building.B2B customers will definitely care. Some will ask you to have millions in insurance and source code in escrow before they&#x27;ll work with you. But there are some out there that are more flexible, or who just don&#x27;t think about it that much.Regarding (3), it&#x27;s good to be in a big city for networking purposes, but these days it doesn&#x27;t really matter that I&#x27;m in SV. I go to meetups only occasionally, and most of my networking happens at conferences. If you&#x27;re finding it&#x27;s hard to talk with customers remotely, then I guess it would be worth it to consider relocating. But I&#x27;d prioritize keeping the burn rate low, which means your small town is going to win out over a big city. reply solo_prono 21 hours agoparentThanks! I am selling B2B. However I guess it is more like Figma or Notion or some of these apps, where anyone can use it (individuals or companies). reply BoorishBears 21 hours agorootparentSolo founder works for B2C2B, and I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking to do based on what your examples.Notion is actually the poster child for the strategy: you target a group of people who have the job title that&#x27;d use your product, but build something that appeals to them on personal level as consumers.You don&#x27;t bother with typical B2B messaging, no enterprise-y sales pitches, and you lean into community building.That way your users will want to share it with their friends (who tend to be other people with similar job titles), want to bring it into their company for semi-personal-use, and eventually push for their employer to adopt it officially (and you charge them more for it as business users).By the time you&#x27;re face to face with the \"Business\", they&#x27;ve already established there&#x27;s value in what you&#x27;re selling and the signal is coming from the people they trust most. reply avarun 8 hours agorootparentFor further context, this strategy is known as Product Led Growth (PLG). reply BoorishBears 6 hours agorootparentTechnically I&#x27;m advising them to go more towards Community Led Growth, but it&#x27;s rooted in a similar place as Product Led Growthhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amity.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;duolingo-figma-notion-and-hubspot-... replytakinola 21 hours agoprev1) As mentioned by another comment, B2B customers may care about the size of your team if you are doing something business critical. From their perspective, they don&#x27;t want to depend on a product that may not be there if one guy gets sick, takes a vacation, flakes, etc. One approach I have seen some people take is to answer something like \"the team is under 10 people\" which is technically true (ish)2) A startup is about risk management. At the beginning, there are ALL the risks (can you build it, are you building something people want, can you find those people in a scalable and economically efficient way, will those people pay enough for the product, etc?). Your goal as a founder is to quantify and reduce those risks in a methodical way. Your milestones should be tied to that goal. For instance, to address the first risk listed, you can set a milestone for developing a prototype. For the second, you can set a milestone for getting the first live customer, and so on and so on. My suggestion is to prioritize risk and set your milestones to address the biggest first (hint: it almost always is figuring out whether anyone even wants what you are building). Another thing to consider is the psychology of progress. Momentum feeds on itself so it is a good idea to set aggressive timelines.3) Theoretically, no one cares where you live. Practically, it may help to be in a tech-dense area for networking, hiring, etc purposes.4) Not doing enough (any?) marketing is probably going to be why most technical founders fail. The problem for the most part if not whether or not you can build a thing, it is going to be whether or not you can get enough (any) people to buy and use the thing. You should be doing twice as much marketing as coding as a rule of thumb.5) Fundraising is a tactic, just like any other tactic available in building a company. There are some ideas that are capital intensive (eg high customer acquisition costs) and would be hard to execute without fundraising. If you do decide you need&#x2F;want to fundraise, you should understand the implications for you and your company and plan accordingly. For some reason, lots of people seem to form their identity around bootstrapping or VC. I don&#x27;t think this is a useful way of thinking about the topic. It is better to think about it as a tool and decide if that tool is what you want or not. reply sjducb 21 hours agoparent#4 is so critical.

I remember a startup where we rented offices on 3 floors. Top floor was one tiny room with the MD in it, bottom had the business development guys and the middle had 12 engineers.

Then they’d usher the prospects to the big shared meeting room.They got loads of deals done and the company grew big enough to need its own building. reply dgudkov 19 hours agoprev1. It&#x27;s definitely not a red flag. Solopreneurs can be successful and grow businesses to non-trivial levels of revenue and income. I myself went that path, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I&#x27;d even argue, being solo should be the default option rather than an alternative.2. There are 3 phases for your business: - Verifying product-market fit (this includes getting at least 1 paying customer) - Finding a way to get a more or less stable stream of new customers - Building up an organization3.

Have at least a newsletter and a referral program - they cost little but work. reply wutwutwat 21 hours agoprevDesign tools shouldn’t be hard to sell if they are useful to others. The product should very much do the sales for you. These people know of your product, you’re exchanging emails and getting beers, and yet those people aren’t coming to you and asking how can they get access. Design tools specifically don’t require rubbing elbows with folks over beers to sell, not if it’s useful. Designers will have zero hesitation jumping on something that saves them time or makes their workflows less tedious.No offense intended but if other people found value in it you’d be making sales and they’d be praising it to their designer friends. Design products that people want are easy sells. This is a smell you don’t have product market fit. But, that’s ok, because it’s a thing you built for you, so if it doesn’t solve anyone else’s problem you’ve still solved your own. If your product has competition, how are they able to sell to folks? Are they small? Maybe it’s niche and there’s just no market to penetrate.Why the b2b targeting? Aim it at b2c and skip the enterprise bs. Again, if it is valuable to designers, they will purchase for themselves personally and use it at both work and at home, and that is frictionless compared to contract negation and vetting, snail paced security audits, and nonsense terms and scope creep added to sign a deal. It’s not needed here imo and it’ll force you to sell your souls to get deals and your passion project will morph into a monster you don’t even like. reply vsareto 20 hours agoparentYou probably still need a decent sample size when finding a market fit, so I wouldn’t write it off as not being useful unless there’s been 10-20 impressions. reply wutwutwat 19 hours agorootparentDesigners know what will help them when they see it. They don’t need sold on things that make their job easier, the way good dev tools don’t need to sell&#x2F;convince developers to use them. They provide an obvious value, and people want them because of the value they can see and use firsthand. If you have to talk someone into using a dev tool or design tool over multiple emails and madmen style nights on the town, you’re trying to convince someone to see value in something with no obvious value. People don’t need marketing or convincing to buy things they see clear benefit from. Designers are a rare type who might not know what they are missing or what exactly they need, but when they see it in front of them, if it helps them, they will instantly want it and not need to be sold on it. If there is no interest from even 5 designers I’d say it’s not going to scale out to a good conversion rate. Designers are a rare type where I would argue it only takes 3-5 to say nope to know you’re not hitting any real pain point. A plugin that automates tedious photoshop workflows sells itself.

Along the way I&#x27;d track who you try to sell to in a spreadsheet (including those that just drag on and never close) and I&#x27;d score them across the behaviors&#x2F;things you would expect your target audience would have in common. This will help you create an Ideal Customer Profile - which you can then target more and more heavily (where you do marketing &#x2F; what you build next and so on in future).

My main business is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pubexchange.com, an platform that helps publishers exchange traffic with other sites, as well as buy&#x2F;sell traffic. My answers below are related to that, but I&#x27;ve also launched https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forourschool.org, a free fundraising platform for schools, as well as a few other small sites.1. It is just me - is that a red flag?It has never been an issue for me, but I also had that concern in the beginning. I try to be VERY responsive to emails and quickly address any issues that come up, so that usually helps address their concerns if they have any. I sometimes refer to the business as \"we\" (e.g. \"we are rolling out new functionality\"), so it may not be obvious at first that it is a one-person company, but I never deny it, and most publishers I work with and have spoken with know that it is just me.I&#x27;ve worked with major publishers like Huffington Post, Aol, CNN, Time&#x2F;Meredith, Yahoo, etc. Some have required approval by their information security team, which can take a very long time. There are always small issues that crop up, but being a one-person team has never stopped me from getting approved.2. How do I set appropriate milestones for me to reach? Do I think about reaching 100 customers before reaching 5 recurring customers for example?I never really had defined milestones. I was happy to leave that behind when I left my corporate jobs. In the early years, I had so much excitement for the business and its potential that any time another publisher said that they were interested in using the platform, it gave me more motivation to spend time on it and grow it. I guess if no one said they were interested in using it, I would have questioned continuing, but it never came up.For reference, it took about 3 months for the first publisher to dip their toe in the platform and 6 months for a full integration (god bless them for trying it!). If you are interested, the first sites to sign up were Upworthy, Refinery29, POPSUGAR, Fashionista, and Remodelista (3 of them still use it!).3. I&#x27;m in a small town in PNW.

They take too much time and don&#x27;t provide much incremental value. I also have not had an in-person meeting since the pandemic started. So no, I don&#x27;t think it matters.4. What are some ways to do marketing? Should I even think about that before I have a few customers who are using my product consistently?I have never spent any money on marketing. I send cold emails pretty often (which is mostly ineffective), but other than that, my business grows through word-of-mouth (it works like a social network, so there is a benefit to publishers to tell their friends, so that they can easily work with them). I also partner with some networks that work with many sites (such as ad yield management companies) who then sends their clients to me.5. I&#x27;ve been inspired by the Startup School videos. Honestly though I&#x27;m not sure about fundraising and all these things, it seems very intimidating to me. What&#x27;s the difference between those things and starting a company and slowly building it up?I&#x27;ve never fundraised so can&#x27;t help here. Unless you absolutely can not survive without outside fundraising, it would be stupid to even consider it as a 1-person company. Way too much of a distraction. That being said, if your plan to quickly build out your team, then sure, go for it. reply eappleby 21 hours agoparentSince other people are mentioning the red flags working with business critical 1-person businesses, I thought I would share a small story. When I was first starting out, I connected with Huffington Post who were very excited about using PubExchange since they were manually managing most of their traffic partnerships. For many sites, traffic partnerships can be a large source of referrals, but HuffPo took it to another level. They partnered with everybody and would link out from their homepage, so they could send a very significant amount of traffic. After a few meetings (I don&#x27;t think infosec got involved), they decided to integrate PubExchange throughout all their verticals. We met in person, so they were fully aware that it was just me, but they were&#x2F;are a very nimble company so they were ok moving forward. Unfortunately, because they were implementing it so quickly and using it in different ways than had been used before, the first night they implemented it, it broke, and unfortunately, it also broke all links (internal and external) across HuffPo. They took down the code, and called me that night. I fixed the issues right then (I think it took me 10 minutes) and the next day they added everything back. Never had any issues again and worked with them for many years after that. reply zengid 20 hours agoparentprev> I avoid in-person meetings as much as I can.

A company takes a lot of work besides a few good ideas, and most people just can’t afford to risk sweat equity. Asking software&#x2F;engineering people to work for “free”&#x2F;”shares of nothing” sours most conversations pretty quickly. People with skills usually get scammed once or twice before they learn this lesson.2. How do I set appropriate milestones for me to reach?You are currently in the independent-contractor or owner-operator class. If you plan to self bootstrap, than don’t enter into a public market without a war chest over $500k. You will need to hit hard and fast in a very lucrative&#x2F;narrow niche, then bail-out of the sector before an army of losers show up to compete. A small team of 5 can do a lot, but focus on hard small problems if you want to survive. Recall people don’t make money writing software, but rather reselling the same product&#x2F;services many times over.3. I&#x27;m in a small town in PNW.No, your product in hand at a trade-show is all that matters, and a small office for meetings is like $600&#x2F;month. Again, think about disposable-products and services as you can’t protect anything yet. Strategic truth means not volunteering information that can harm your position. The only difference between a bum in a cheap suit and a CEO is money.4. What are some ways to do marketing?Trade-shows and related events where in-person meetings are more probable, and listen to what customers are shopping for at first. Each event is usually worth about 5 months of online marketing in terms of sales leads.5.

Here are my thoughts on your concerns:1. If you communicate that you&#x27;re in the early stages of building an exciting new business and wanting to get feedback from early-access customers, there should be businesses that are OK with you being solo. They will adapt to that risk, and you won&#x27;t be able to sell to everyone, but it shouldn&#x27;t exclude you from everyone either. You might just not be talking to the right customers yet.2. For milestones (and fundraising) you should think about your goals - what are you trying to get out of this? Do you want to build and scale a big team, serve giant amounts of customers, etc. Or do you just want to augment or replace your income? Or something in-between? You can think about this from different angles: team size, revenue, geographic scope, your personal exit or income, etc.Here are a couple of examples from my journey in case they&#x27;re helpful:In my prior business (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigleaf.net) my first milestone was to get a working product. I didn&#x27;t feel as though just talking about it would be convincing enough (and it wasn&#x27;t), but once I could demo an MVP then it really wow&#x27;d customers. Along the way I added a milestone to get a technical co-founder since I got burnt out doing it myself. Those 2 major steps took just over a year. The next milestone was getting our first revenue (took just a month or so after the MVP), then milestones just kept being added from there logically based on the strategic path we chose to be on at that moment.In my current business (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.companycraft.ai) I had a mix of some early milestones. I wanted to talk to potential customers (entrepreneurs) to ensure the problems I wanted to solve matched up with pain they had, and I also wanted to build an MVP ASAP. I completed those in about 3 months, with many other smaller steps and goals along the way. My current milestone is to do a full \"v1\" public launch in November.So you just set some milestones that are logical based on where you are and where you want to be in the coming months and years, then hold yourself accountable to them (or ideally be connected with a peer or mentor who can be an accountability partner of sorts).3. On location, I go back to your team goals. If you&#x27;re going to stay solo then no, location shouldn&#x27;t matter. If you want to build a fully remote team then it shouldn&#x27;t matter much (though being near-ish to a decent airport would be valuable for visiting the team and customers). If you want any local team members then you should think about where you&#x27;ll gather and what the talent pool is like in your area.4. It sounds like you&#x27;re already on a good track here - talking to people who have the pain you&#x27;re solving and gathering their emails. If that has you on the right track I&#x27;d just keep doing that. However you mentioned below that you&#x27;re selling this B2B...so in that case you may want to consider if you&#x27;re actually talking to the buyer of your product. Are the people you&#x27;ve met the people who would approve the purchase of your solution? If not, try to connect with those people. Identifying a list of them on LinkedIn and cold reaching out could be one method.5. Fundraising goes back to your goals as an entrepreneur :) If you want to grow this to IPO or a really big exit, have a team of hundreds, and build a market-changing or world-impacting offering, then you probably need to raise outside funds at some point. However, if your desired scale is smaller and&#x2F;or you see a path to profitability without fundraising then you get to keep control of your destiny, which is great. If you can afford it and you don&#x27;t sense the market is going to run away without you, I&#x27;d advise continue building, talking to customers, and close your first deals; don&#x27;t rush into raising money. If&#x2F;when you know that you can&#x27;t succeed at your goals without raising money, then dive into that path. reply onetimeuse92304 18 hours agoprev [–] Hi.1) I am same as you, I like to work alone. Working with another is irritating, to say the least. I always think I can move faster when I don&#x27;t have to communicate with anybody else.But. Doing business is less about doing stuff well and more about avoiding really stupid shit. Having other people to work with and especially a cofounder is one of the best ways to get feedback for really stupid stuff you could do.It is all about reducing the time and cost between when you become wrong and when you stop being wrong. For some reason it is very hard to do it on your own.2. Don&#x27;t set milestones. Understand the problem you are trying to solve for your customers. Do your best solution of the problem, the best way you can. The customers are just validation of your idea -- if they come you might be onto something and if they are not coming you are doing something wrong.3. No. It is up to you. If you are asking this question you haven&#x27;t thought this solopreneurship thing yet. The whole point of doing it solo is to be able to make those decisions yourself.4. The best way is to make a good product&#x2F;service. The customers will come. Don&#x27;t focus on the customers, focus on the best service you can. The more customers you have the harder it will be to focus on the service, so cherish the ability to move fast while you have no&#x2F;few customers yet.5. You want to slowly build it up. Financing is a hack that should only be used by people with experience -- not you, at least not yet.Your goal for your first business should be to avoid getting killed financially (don&#x27;t get into debt!). As long as you do that, you have ability to iterate. Most of successful people I know have started multiple businesses before they finally succeeded. That assumes ability to start another business after the first one fails. Bankruptcy will very likely put an end to your career as an enterpreneur.Also, slowly building it up gives you time necessary to learn, to transform yourself. And build a product. It takes time to think all those things and integrate it into your experience and trying to hack it will just leave you woefully unprepared.Also, when you get financing it suddenly puts a timer on your business. It puts a pressure that makes it difficult to focus and make your own decisions. Everything from now on is a compromise. And, at least in my mind, this conflicts with trying to build the best product you can.Also, when you get financing, the cost of that financing will depend on how risky the investment is (I am kind of expert when it comes to risk). You don&#x27;t give loans for nothing, you want to earn some money. And the riskier the investment, the more you want to earn. And as a first business with an unexperienced founder, running solo, you are as risky as it can be. If you ever get somebody to invest money in your business it will necessarily come at an exorbitant price and you are also very possibly get abused by somebody with much more experience than you. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
