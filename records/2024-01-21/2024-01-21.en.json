Please be aware that this is not a \"spotify client\" per se. It gets the data from Spotify, and plays the audio from YouTube. It's an interesting invention, and worthy of the first page, if you ask me. reply dang 15 hours agoparentOk, we've put that in the title now, along with the project name. (Submitted title was \"Open source Spotify client that doesn't require Premium nor uses Electron\") reply jackjeff 15 hours agoparentprevI see. What I really want is a converter from Spotify abomination to standard podcasts which I can read from any podcast client. Last I checked the podcasts are DRM encumbered. So you’d have to spin up a client pretending to be chrome and use the Wivedine extension to decrypt every mp3 frame. No hacking required. But Life is too short. So instead I refuse to listen to fake podcasts on Spotify. reply CharlesW 15 hours agorootparentMe too. Spotify may have successfully killed the \"open medium\" promise of the words \"podcast\" and \"podcasting\" as part of their embrace/extend/extinguish strategy, but there are many great podcasting clients that continue to support opencasting, and very few shows exclusive to closed audio platforms like Spotify. reply Spivak 4 hours agorootparentHuh? Does Spotify have any exclusive podcasts worth bothering with? Because I haven't seen the death of open podcasts since every podcast is still on Apple Podcasts. reply input_sh 2 hours agorootparentSpotify pretty much backtracked on paying huge sums for exclusivity about a year ago, and the list of Spotify-exclusive podcasts has definitely gotten a whole lot smaller since then. reply mr_mitm 1 hour agorootparentprevI've seen a few German productions.

I don't ship public API keys with my apps. reply prmoustache 14 hours agoparentprevOn the other hand, why would you choose to use spotify API for a start? Spotify doesn't have nearly the quantity of available music that Youtube has. So many times when I try to find some music on my partner's spotify account it is just not there, and I give up and we listen to it via newpipe or freetube. reply Larrikin 5 hours agorootparentI would find it pointless to make music playlist on Youtube. Stuff gets taken down too easily, skits are prevalent, and theres so many accounts that just rip off music from other people. If it can't be on Spotify, I'm better off finding it on Soundcloud. reply iamacyborg 11 hours agorootparentprevThat was my experience when I used to use last.fm for radio as well.

I try to download my Spotify playlists from YouTube Music because its easier but half the stuff isn't there or incorrect versions etc. reply erk__ 13 hours agoparentprevThis was the trick used by bots on Discord that played music (before they pretty much all got disallowed) It would simply get the title from the Spotify API and then look it up on YouTube to play. At some point I actually had set up a rather awful hack where I had a Discord bot that could play webradio and then pointed it towards my own Mopidy server which used the Spotify plugin to have a webpage such that multiple people could add songs and such.

I'd have tried it, but I pay for good audio quality so I won't :) reply thaumasiotes 22 hours agorootparentIs there a difference in audio quality between Spotify and YouTube? reply anotheryou 22 hours agorootparentyes, I think so. And youtube is mixed quality, especially for older uploads. Newer youtubes are \"opus (251)\", which I think is 128kbps 48KHz Opus (WebM standard). - Spotify at least used to be ogg vorbis and claims to be \"320kbit/s [mp3] equivalent\" I think the 128kps Opus is still considered quite lossy¹ and 320kpbit/s mp3s I know I can hear the difference to wav on some tracks in a blind test, but generally don't find them better or worse. ¹ from some google test: https://i.imgur.com/odPogeR.png via https://www.opus-codec.org/comparison/ reply Thorrez 21 hours agorootparentI don't think that imgur link is a good example. The only opus 128 there is heavily optimized for low latency (5ms frame size). If you remove that optimization, and instead optimize for quality, opus does better than mp3 at the same bitrate. https://www.opus-codec.org/static/comparison/quality.svg reply anotheryou 21 hours agorootparenttoo bad that diagram stops at 128, as I want to compare to 320 mp3 no question opus is the more efficient codec reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 18 hours agorootparentprevEven disregarding which codec Youtube uses, there's also the question of what codec was uploaded(unless it's an official upload), which in many cases was probably a lossy codec in the first place. So often you're listening to some lossy codec, reencoded to another lossy codec. reply thaumasiotes 18 hours agorootparent> Even disregarding which codec Youtube uses, there's also the question of what codec was uploaded(unless it's an official upload) Hm? What codec was uploaded if it's an official upload? reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 16 hours agorootparentPresumably a lossless one. As opposed to some mp3 ripped off a scratched CD in some guy's drawer. reply jamiek88 1 hour agorootparentAaah Napster. You changed my life. reply thaumasiotes 53 minutes agorootparentprev> Presumably a lossless one. Why? For example, there are many songs on YouTube listed as \"Provided to YouTube by CDBaby\". (Here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxHpQ668gzA ) CDBaby only provides one format, which is mp3. They'll accept uploads in any of four formats, of which one is also mp3. So you'd need to answer two questions: 1. Is the file that CDBaby distributes to YouTube the same file they distribute to everyone else, or is it the same file they receive from the artist? (Note: if the answer is #1, that is likely to save CDBaby a bundle on storage!) 2. What did the artist upload to CDBaby? And then you'd also need to answer analogous questions for the other major providers of official music on YouTube; there are tons and tons of them. CDBaby appears to be unusual in that, in addition to providing your music officially to YouTube, it will also sell it to consumers. Most of these services don't appear to offer anything but official distribution to major websites. reply bayindirh 21 hours agorootparentprevLossless still beats MP3@320CBR audibly, but you need a pipeline which can render that difference. I’ll not rewrite details here, one can search my comment history if more details are required. reply Tarq0n 18 hours agorootparentSome of the best recordings I've heard (NPR) are only on YouTube. This leads me to believe recording quality is orders of magnitude more important than encoding, as long as a decent bitrate and encoding scheme were used. reply bayindirh 17 hours agorootparentThe quality ceiling for any recording you have is the quality ceiling of the weakest link in your audio pipeline. This means, to be able to get a good sound from any system, you have to feed it a good signal, and that path starts with recording. Current audio codecs are great from a psychoacoustic point of view. A good encoder can create an enjoyable file at modest bitrates (192kbps for MP3, and 128kbps for AAC IIRC), and retain most of the details. The audible residue when you subtract a MP3 from a FLAC is not details per se, but instrument separation and perceived size of the sound stage. People generally call this snake oil, but I have the same amplifier for the last 30 years, and I can say how different qualities of audio render through the same pipeline. A good recording stored losslessly can bring the concert to your home, up to a point. MP3 re-encodings of the same record will sound flatter and smaller. Lastly, it's not possible to completely contain the sound of a symphony orchestra in a stereo recording. That's not happening. So there's always a limit. If you have the time, there's a nice ABX test: http://abx.digitalfeed.net/ reply hunter2_ 16 hours agorootparentA reduction in soundstage/width is likely due to using \"joint stereo\" or \"intensity stereo\" encoder modes, which do things such as mid-side (M-S) conversion (which isn't itself the culprit) in order to give more bits to M (which results in better quality for sounds with high L-R correlation, like vocals) and fewer bits to S (which results in less quality for sounds with low L-R correlation, like a drum kit stereo miked). If using plain old \"stereo\" mode instead, this problem doesn't occur, but you need a higher overall bitrate for correlated sounds to come through at the same quality, so it's rarely used at modest bitrates and instead tends to be reserved for only the highest bitrates. Thus, comparing mp3@192 with mp3@320 often actually means comparing mp3@192joint with mp3@320stereo and therefore the listener will find very little if any improvement in the quality of mono-miked center-panned sounds (vocals, etc.) but a decent improvement in the quality of wide sounds (cymbals, reverb, string sections, etc.) since the 320 will have only a few more bits for \"mid\" but way more bits for \"side\" so to speak, relative to the 192. reply bayindirh 14 hours agorootparentThanks for the technical details, I didn't know how intensity/joint modes work, however I never use them. The tests I have done is all encoded by myself. I have purchased 24bit WAV of Radiohead's OK Computer Remastered. I encoded it to FLAC, and 320CBR Stereo with LAME. I still can feel the difference on soundstage, and can create a audible residue file by subtracting MP3 from FLAC version. I agree that current iteration of encoders create very good audio, however given that your audio system can render high resolution audio, the difference is still audible. reply NavinF 15 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, how can I check if a file was encoded with joint stereo? I've never seen those keywords in ffprobe output Is this only an issue for mp3 or do other codecs also use fewer bits for the difference between channels? reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparent\"file\" command outputs the encoding used, alongside details. Usage: \"file test.mp3\" Rsult: test.mp3: Audio file with ID3 version 2.3.0, contains: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 320 kbps, 48 kHz, JntStereo reply _joel 16 hours agorootparentprev> Lastly, it's not possible to completely contain the sound of a symphony orchestra in a stereo recording Thank god we have more than 2 ears. reply bayindirh 15 hours agorootparentThe problem is not the number of ears we have, but the amount of air moved by the instruments themselves and how they interact with each other. A symphony orchestra is miced per group normally (2 for violins, 2 for trumpets, etc.), but if you're around 60 people, you can mic every instrument individually. To reproduce the sound 1 to 1, you need to mic every instrument individually, and playback them with speakers matching the frequency response and air pressure . So you need speakers equal to the number and characteristics of instruments themselves. On top of that you need to record them ideal microphones and store them loslessly in the process. Otherwise, you can't create the sound by recording 100 people with 20 microphones, and downmixing them to two channels. It's not possible. I played in double bass in an orchestra, listened countless orchestras, listened the recordings of our own concerts. The gap is enormous. reply empiricus 16 hours agorootparentprevThank god they recorded the concert using binaural mics on an identical copy of your head :) reply kjqgqkejbfefn 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat's your take on audio systems that deliver vibrations. I have a nuraphone and a subpac. Great for listening to trap music or iranian experimental. reply bayindirh 13 hours agorootparentI genuinely have no opinion. I like to use a vintage amplifier with a couple of beefy bookshelf speakers. I run a couple of Heco Celan GT302s with an AKAI AM-2850. It's a very well balanced system for my needs and room size. That's a pretty nifty setup for me. reply qingcharles 15 hours agorootparentprevIn one of my previous lives I built an encoding platform for all the major record labels. Part of this involved listening to hundreds of tracks to try and optimize the encoder settings. It's not necessarily the quality of the original recording, but simply the type of audio. For instance, the absolute hardest, IMO, were \"unplugged\" albums, e.g. solo singer, acoustic guitar. Lossy compression would shit itself on those. reply anotheryou 21 hours agorootparentprevYes, at least for my setup it makes a difference, but for me not in quality. reply redcobra762 16 hours agorootparentprevHe says as he plays his music over Bluetooth… :) reply anotheryou 15 hours agorootparentme? I got good wired speakers reply tills13 16 hours agoparentprevNot really suggesting Spotify pays their artists well but surely YouTube is worse, right? reply judge2020 16 hours agorootparentSupposedly \"between $0.001 and $0.003\" from [0], but then this site[1] claims: > Plays on YouTube Music will gain on average $0.008. Although neither have sources. I imagine YouTube Premium plays match or beat Spotify on average. Of course, for anything, if you block ads AND refuse to pay for the premium subscription, the artist makes $0 from your listening. Hopefully you can support them off-platform via merch or even purchasing their albums (e.g. iTunes which provides DRM-free versions), but then you're still not paying for the platform if you continue to use one with an ad blocker. 0: https://www.lalal.ai/blog/music-streaming-payouts-2023/ 1: https://routenote.com/blog/how-much-music-streaming-services... Although this doesn't take into account reply NJRBailey 14 hours agorootparentMy colleague has his music on both Spotify and YouTube Music, and he has said in the past that one YouTube listen is worth 2x as much as one Spotify listen. reply jpalawaga 15 hours agorootparentprevis that true? presumably youtube still has to pay the artist for reproducing/streaming the song, even if you didn't watch an ad. I'm suspicious that the licensing agreement YouTube says \"we'll pay you for the right to stream your music, unless if they use an ad blocker, then too bad.\" reply lxgr 14 hours agorootparentIn the countries where Youtube has an agreement of that form with music rights holding agencies like Germany's (in)famous GEMA I'd assume that to be the case. For monetized videos, where Youtube directly pays the channel owner, I've heard a few times now that they really don't pay anything when neither ads are successfully displayed or the viewer has Premium. reply monsieurbanana 23 hours agoprevFor something that puts \"not using electron\" so prominently I didn't expect it using flutter. I admit I don't really have much experience with it, I thought it was like react-native (but better?), still far from truly native apps. Im here to being told I'm wrong. I would love to, specially since we can transpile clojure to dart reply rubymamis 22 hours agoparentYep. This app uses 230mb of RAM on my machine compared to Spotify that uses 208mb. But it's definitely more performant than my hideously slow Electron Spotify client. I'm really done with Electron. I hope this shaming of Electron apps continue because I can't stand this degradation of software. The only Electron app of recent that had good performance is Notion Calendar (used to be Cron). Although, Notion itself is painfully slow. This is why I'm building a Notion alternative in Qt C++ and QML[1]. [1] https://www.get-plume.com/ EDIT: Is the app down? It doesn't load the \"Browse\" content for me. reply chaxor 12 hours agorootparentYeah, electron is so over. Now tbe modern tech stack is to build a bash+python app in an env, add a touch of R, some js, and bundle it into docker container, then make that docker container into wasm with container2wasm, and give that out as the executable. It's wonderful honestly. You can get just about anything working with stitching together stuff, and then serve your 10GB executable to anyone :). So MuCh BeTtEr ThIs MoDeRn WaY! reply dv35z 6 hours agorootparentSerious question: What's the feasibility of local web apps in containers, which appear to the user to be a \"regular\" app. E.g. Django + SQLite, running in a Docker container, and run by a Mac app shortcut. How would you recommend setting up and running that stack? Better ideas? reply icy 21 hours agorootparentprevPlume looks so sick. Looking forward to it. A Vim-like modal editing mode would be so cool, I think. reply rubymamis 21 hours agorootparentThanks! I heard many requests for this, so I'll consider it, but if I do get to that it will be at a later stage. reply prg318 17 hours agorootparentprevTo respond to your edit, yes - it seems like the app is down - nothing seems to load at all on the Browse tab or anywhere else... reply olah_1 16 hours agorootparentprevPlume looks nice! How does the sync work? Local first rocks, but I do want some redundancy as well. Are there plans for multiplayer or sharing? reply rubymamis 16 hours agorootparentThanks! One of the next features we'll on work will be support for arbitrary folders (basically all notes will be plaintext inside folders, currently they are all plaintexts but inside a local database), so you could sync your notes with any cloud provider (e.g., Dropbox). We'll also provide our own built-in sync option. There are plans for sharing notes, but not quite for real-time collaboration, if that's what you mean by \"multiplayer\". There are plans for collaboration in the future, but not real-time - I just don't think real-time collaboration is good for text-based formats. reply jhatemyjob 16 hours agorootparentprevComing from AppKit/UIKit I tried to learn Qt and it was just awful. I hated how tightly coupled with C++ it was. Everything was based around subclassing and overriding methods, there was no way to just have a dumb UIView and set its frame and add a bunch of subviews to it. There was also no clean way to expose a C ABI to use a scripting language (with an FFI) to configure the UI easily All of the Qt apps I know about (Ripcord, Dolphin) are fast but the aesthetics of the UI was just terrible. So I gave up on learning Qt. But this thing you made, Plume, actually looks good. If there isn't a monstrosity of hacks and boilerplate underneath this UI I might give Qt another shot. Otherwise I think I might just build my own thing from scratch on top of OpenGL or something.... reply jwells89 10 hours agorootparentI know what you mean. Would love to just have AppKit/UIKit with some platform integrations (e.g. correct widget themes) on other platforms. Closest that exists to that is GNUStep, but it’s stuck on an old version of Objective-C (no Swift) and targets something like OS X 10.6 with API compatibility. Outside of the that the next closest I’ve tinkered with is GTK, but since version 3 it kinda gave up on looking right running under anything but GTK/Qt-based desktops. It’s easy to make idiomatic bindings for which is nice though. reply rubymamis 15 hours agorootparentprevI feel ya! I thought the same, until I discovered the world of combining Qt C++ and QML. QML is extremely easy to learn (I studied all the basics in one day using this Udemy course[1] (not affiliated, just love his work). BTW, he has many free awesome YouTube videos for Qt C++. Creating an aesthetically pleasing app in any framework takes a lot of effort (it's mostly about being focused on what necessary and then creating a lot of white space around it, haha). It's so easy to create beautiful, fluid UI with QML. I've created a short video that demonstrate what I'm working on currently[2] - a Kanban view inside my block editor (kinda buggy now, still WIP). Hopefully, this does inspire you that it's possible. And it's actually pretty easy to write the C++ code. I don't really use custom sub-classing much. I use Qt's QtObject which allows me to create C++ object that work beautifully with QML. Bryan's course doesn't delve deeper as that, I had to do a lot of searching to figure it out. I hope to open source some of Plume's components to inspire others to do the same. Another point regarding aesthetics, it really takes effort, but Qt can be extended using community libraries. For example, if you want your app to look native on macOS and Windows with a sexy frameless border with a transparent window, then you could use the awesome qwindowkit[3]. Another example, I wanted to position the window buttons on macOS (the traffic light buttons) differently, but couldn't figure it out, and obviously this can't be done using Qt alone, so I looked at Electron's source code and saw how they do it there in Objective-C and incorporated it in my app (ChatGPT-4 wasn't very helpful at that). Now I really want to have these buttons' fill color transparent like Things 3 does, so I'm looking at how to achieve that haha. I already got some ideas. If you need any further help, let me know![4][5]. EDIT: A cool feature of combining Qt C++ with QML is that you get the performance of a compiled language like C++ with the reactivity, ease-of-use, fluid and easy animations (and more) of QML. You can see on Plume's website that it's 4x faster than the fastest comparable native app on macOS.

Man... this sounds like too much for me. Oh well. Guess I'll use AppKit for now and if I wanna add Windows/Linux I'll bring in Qt. Definitely will come back to this comment if/when that happens. reply rubymamis 15 hours agorootparentNo problem mate, let me know if you need any help. Good luck with AppKit! reply subtra3t 21 hours agorootparentprevWeird, it takes up ~150MB while having a 500+ song playlist loaded. reply denysvitali 20 hours agoparentprevFlutter, from experience, works really well on Android. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the web (see for example [1]). I think that if these performance issues were to be solved, Flutter would see a bigger adoption. In any case IMHO Flutter >>>>> Electron [1]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/56257 reply lxgr 14 hours agorootparentFlutter on the web is absurd: At least when I last checked, it's been rendering UI widgets into an HTML canvas by default, using its own low-level drawing library. That sounds about as good of an idea as the old Java desktop GUI framework that used to (poorly) imitate native UI elements of Windows and macOS: Everything always looked three major versions behind and felt extremely janky. reply denysvitali 13 hours agorootparentI wouldn't care less if it worked in a performant way - in the end Flutter apps are using their own design (Material 2 / 3) - so rendering them in a Canvas is OK-ish. The problem is that, on the web, the performance is extremely poor, so Flutter is still not worth being used there (IMHO). reply jwells89 19 hours agorootparentprevLast I knew it had significant performance issues on iOS (framerate drops/stutters), which dampens its cross platform appeal somewhat and is part of why I’ve heard of apps using Flutter for the Android port of their app, but nowhere else. reply stolsvik 11 hours agorootparentHow old is that info? We’re using it, and it is buttery smooth on both phone platforms. reply fngjdflmdflg 7 hours agorootparentNot that old. Only when Impeller was enabled by default last year did Flutter become usable on ios. reply devjab 22 hours agoparentprevI’m sort of surprised it’s considered a good thing. Some of my favourite programs use electron, like visual studio code. I haven’t used Spotify though, so maybe that is one of the many electron apps that suck? I was very unimpressed by flutter when we PoC it at work, but that was years ago, so maybe it’s gotten better since. reply amomchilov 19 hours agorootparentVSCode couldn't support multiple windows until just recently, entirely because of a limitation from the early days of Electron. When \"multiple windows\" is a feature to be announced (as if weren't trivial on any native stack), you know it's a sad state is affairs. reply diggan 16 hours agorootparent> VSCode couldn't support multiple windows until just recently, entirely because of a limitation from the early days of Electron. That sounds like Microsoft deflecting blame. You've been able to do multiple windows for a very long time in Electron, I remember being able to do so in 2019 at the very least, and the book \"Electron in Action\" (https://www.manning.com/books/electron-in-action) even have a chapter dedicated to it, a book which was released in 2018. reply tredre3 15 hours agorootparentVSCode always could have multiple windows. You can open multiple projects and they all share the same process(es), so clearly Electron supports multiple windows. What it couldn't do, though, was to have a single workspace span multiple windows (ie \"detach\" tabs). Whether or not this was caused by an electron limitation or a design flaw in VSCode, I can't say. Though I find it hard to believe that it would have been impossible to implement had they really wanted to. reply badgersnake 15 hours agorootparentprevDon’t understand all the fuss about VSCode.

Although similar to something like React Native - Flutter does paint the screen. Personally I see it as a potential Electron replacement in the future. From what I’ve seen Impeller is also a big help on iOS. Screen jank was pretty bad for us when Flutter was using Skia as a rendering engine, although when I last messed with Flutter (~6 months ago) Impeller felt almost production ready but iirc there were still a couple small things, not sure if they are better now. Personally I’ve become a big fan of Flutter, especially for back-office/utility type apps. We would follow all the Material Design 3 guidelines and when it comes to time spent, if you need to develop the same app on more than 1 platform, it’s worth consideration. I’ve found some people will say: “But it’s hard to get it to look like a native app in Flutter” but for me I’ve always seen that as more of a skill issue. You are literally painting the screen, you can get whatever pixel perfect design you want, if it can be Figma’d it can also be Fluttered and to be fair there are Cupertino widgets and you absolutely can get the best of both/many worlds if you want. Just like how on the web you can do a transform based on device width to switch between the mobile or web view, if you desire you can have different widgets show up for different platforms and give everybody a native feel. I personally still think that’s easier than writing/maintaining multiple individual apps. I think the biggest downside though is that search engines don’t do well with Flutter Web. It isn’t the nice easy to crawl HTML, and it’s really hard to get a flutter app indexed or to give it good SEO. There’s also silly rules that search engines have about how the content displayed to the user vs crawlers has to have the same data. (I.e. when the web-crawler asks for your page, you are supposed to give it a page with the same data you would give the user.) The best we could do to improve SEO was to make the landing page a page that in the background ran all the same queries and shoved the data into HTML tables, with a popover that said “this is a page for robots that had a button that said “Take me to ABC.com” and a check box that said “automatically redirect me next time” that we stored in a cookie. It was hacky and not a good user experience. For now, whenever I need to do anything GUI I will use React for the web and Flutter for everything else, but it would be nice to truly be able to only use 1 framework for every platform, which to be fair I’ve used Flutter web and it isn’t all to bad if it weren’t for the issue with search-engines web-crawlers. For apps that don’t need SEO.. Flutter is a great choice. I suspect we’ll see a lot more SaaS apps building in Flutter in the next few years. I think it’s on the cusp of being mature enough to be seriously considered for production scenarios. I’m just mostly worried about the ecosystem. Google chose Dart for flutter after the results of a lot of research that only Google scale companies can do and to be honest although it IS a lesser known language it isn’t a bad one. It’s AOT and JIT so the hot reload is amazing. It reads like “insert most language you know” here. If you know how to code nothing in Dart should be drastic or surprising. If anything I’d almost say Dart is boring, which I like boring things. I’ve experience with a handful of languages, and for me Dart ranks highly in terms of usability/ergonomics. But there’s a not unsubstantial risk that Google could decide to drop the ball and Flutter could become kind of like the Windows phone. Really great, but canned because people didn’t build enough things for it. If I were on the Flutter team I’d be most focused on figuring out how to deal with SEO issues. (assuming impeller does indeed provide a full fix for the screen jank, I’d assume it’s gotten better in the past few months, can anyone comment as to if it’s “there” yet or not?) reply fngjdflmdflg 7 hours agorootparent>can anyone comment as to if it’s “there” yet or not? It's enabled for ios by default. Android probably in two more releases if I had to guess. If you were doing a lot of custom stuff you may run into issues with Impeller on some CPU bound tasks regarding tessellation but for a regular flutter app it will almost always outperform Skia especially around previous pain points like scrolling and animation. reply linsomniac 17 hours agoprevSomewhat related: A month ago I migrated from Spotify to YTMusic (Youtube), and published the scripts I used to do it. People have kind of come out of the woodwork: reporting issues, starring the repo, asking questions, last night I found someone has written a GUI for it. https://github.com/linsomniac/spotify_to_ytmusic The biggest reason I ditched Spotify is that their shuffle play of playlists is laughably bad. I like listening to just a shuffle of my favorite music, but their player seems to \"stick\" on just a few of them. I ask it to shuffle a few thousand \"liked\" songs, during my shower every day, and I'll hear the same song 3 times in a week, for example. There was a \"bug\" open in their support forum since 2017 that they replied \"maybe we'll look at it eventually\". It has hundreds of pages of replies. And they just laid off a significant portion of their workforce, so I figured it'd never get resolved. And for a company doing music playback, it just seems like they can't get one of the basics right. Since going to YTMusic, I've been hearing songs from my playlists that I haven't heard in years. reply mkobit 17 hours agoparentThey wrote an interesting blog some time back about how \"random shuffle\" isn't necessarily what people want, and how their algorithm works (https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/how-to-shuffle-son... ). That was a decade ago, so maybe their approach has changed or that it does not perform well under certain conditions (like the one you mention). It works well for me on most playlists on the order of 10s. reply linsomniac 17 hours agorootparentI agree with you that it seems to work fine on playlists of less than 50 or 100 songs. The problem seems to be that on larger playlists they will only use 50-100 of the tracks to shuffle through. Most times I'm listening to music I just want to put on a shuffle of all my favorites and listen. It's been that way since I got my first CD changer. Maybe that's a super unusual use case, but it's my primary one, and I get really tired of hearing the same songs repeatedly over a week. YMMV, my wife for example likes listening to the same songs every day. As I mentioned above: I copied my Spotify playlists to YTMusic and am doing the same \"shuffle my liked songs\" and I'm literally hearing songs Spotify hasn't played for me in years. Usually the algorithm complaint in music players is that they are using random rather than shuffle, but even in that case I'd think that 2K songs over 2-3 years, I'd be hearing SOME of those songs that YTMusic is playing but Spotify is not. The cynic in me figured that they were prioritizing the songs by the ones that made them the most money, or from artists that paid for placement. But something about their shuffle is just totally off. reply achairapart 15 hours agorootparentYes, it looks like there is some artificial placement. This may be driven by malice (some sort of paid or more lucrative placement, like you said), but also by stupidity (algo prioritizing songs already in the client cache, to save some egress bandwidth perhaps?). So I started clearing the Spotify client cache more often, and it looks to me there is more diversity, at least on the auto-generated \"recommended songs\" playlists. But still, no hard proof of this. reply linsomniac 13 hours agorootparentThe \"recommended songs\" playlists seem to have more diversity, but also seem to be fairly short (they'll repeat in a couple hours it feels like; I rarely listen to them when I'm working because they'll start repeating, and I don't usually listen to music for a large fraction of the day, so I'm guessing 1-2 hours). My best guess is that they are assuming no playlist is more than 50-100 songs, and are limiting the shuffle to that number, so that a shuffle doesn't consume too many resources (memory, database hits, CPU cycles). Maybe someone, possibly in the distant past had a large playlist that caused service problems. And because of that they clamped WAY down to prevent it. reply linsomniac 13 hours agoparentprevAnother option is to use a tool that shuffles your playlist: https://spotifyshuffler.com reply fermentation 16 hours agoparentprevI wanted to like ytmusic, but their ios client is somehow worse that spotify.

I had a friend that worked on Google Play, and he said it would have been much better if the labels hadn't gotten involved, in the form of demands made...

If you use the service that pays the artists below the value, you are endorsing that underpayment. You're literally voting with your wallet that underpaying the artists is fine. Pirating doesn't support the artists, but it's also not weakening their expected rights for future business contracts, which supporting services like Spotify does; after all, if all these other artists are getting paid 'x' much, and all these consumers think this is what it's worth, how is anyone but Beyonce or Swift or Kanye gonna have any hope of arguing against that? There is no way to inform Spotify that you don't endorse their business practices, except to not subscribe. Subscribing is an endorsement.

This is false. And I mean, dramatically. > Even if you only listen to one artist, 8 hours per day, 365 days a year, they will earn a whopping... 100 bucks from Spotify. It's roughly 200$. Number of songs per hour: 60 minutes / 3 minutes per song = 20 songs Total listening hours per year: 8 hours/day * 365 days = 2,920 hours Total streams per year: 20 songs/hour * 2,920 hours = 58,400 streams Total earnings: 58,400 streams * $0.004 (average pay rate) = $233.60 How high do you think that number should be, to be non-\"whopping\"? I am seriously confused about what or who anti-streamers think they are zealoting for, what alternative fantasy they are defending.

You can start a personal crusade to combat that, but as long as you do not actually make it work (and I think there is good reasons rooted in what Spotify does well over Bandcamp and the service the former provides that the later won't), this is what is actually factually true. Let's just skip the part, where we imply it's somehow okay to circumvent fair use, because nobody is making money off of streaming anyway or any such nonsense. Streaming as intended is fine for now. People can just use Spotify, or any of the alternatives, as they are intended and that's fine and on the whole better than anything we had before. reply drewdevault 21 hours agorootparentI didn't actually make that argument, though. I said that a user who circumvents ads on Spotify and buys albums from Bandcamp is more profitable for the artist than someone who just listens to Spotify ads, and I believe that this is factually true. A quick review of Google will turn up endless testimonies from artists who make more money from Bandcamp, usually by an order of magnitude or more. Spotify may be better than anything we had before (I don't believe this is true, but assume it for the moment), it is not better than anything that came after. For the record, I am steelmanning a position in which abject piracy is a social negative, which I do not actually believe, but if we take that at face value my arguments still hold. reply blowski 21 hours agorootparent1. If you _really_ like an album, buy it on Bandcamp, because it gives more money to the artist. 2. If you just listen to the occasional song, listen to them on Spotify. Artist gets _some_ money, but nowhere near as much as #1. 3. If you don't care about the artist getting anything at all, then use workarounds like this tool, or download on torrents. Most people used to do #3, and are now doing #2. #1 is just not going to happen, because there's too much friction. reply rglullis 20 hours agorootparent0.

Not that I believe it's good or bad either way, it's just cumbersome. People want easy solutions.

If they see an account doing that, they'll flag it. Assume the album has 10 songs, is one hour long and costs $20. Ten songs means they get $0.04 each time you listen to it. So, you need to listen to the album 500 times for the artist to be paid for the album. I mostly listen in the car; call it under 2 hours a day, but lets assume 4 hours a day of listening to Spotify. A Spotify subscription is $11 a month. I can fit 4 non-fraud plays of the album into each day, so that's 4 * 30 = 120 streams. It'd take 4 months of listening to nothing but this one album for the artist to break even, and it'd cost me $44. Bandcamp + bittorrent would give the artists about twice as much money on average. Buying merch also pays artists more, assuming the cost of the item plus shipping is under half what they charge. reply zelphirkalt 15 hours agorootparentprevThat creation of a new class of musicians is not due to their ads model though, but due to offering a platform for discovery and distribution. reply switch007 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the median payout? i.e. is it skewed by some very high earning artists? reply hedora 18 hours agorootparent$0. 13,400 bands (not artists) got paid over $50K by spotify in 2020: https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/how-many-artists-are-...

The fact that every creative endeavour or sport is a mix of a few pros and a lot of amateurs (in the sense that they do not make a living) is not an issue. The value of Spotify and the like to most artists is enabling them to publish to everyone for basically free, no matter how fringe or bad, and to do it all the time. I think that's wonderful. reply hedora 17 hours agorootparentThey don't break down the distribution of how many artists got paid at all, but it looks like they're probably close to the estimated 15K bands that got non-trivial payments from Spotify this year: https://bandcamp.com/about > In the past year alone, they’ve spent $194 million on 14.2 million digital albums, 10.4 million tracks, 1.75 million vinyl records, 800,000 CDs, 350,000 cassettes, and 50,000 t-shirts. Note that $194M is less than 10% of Spotify's revenue.

I feel like pretending that you're supporting your favorite artists by listening them on Spotify is a bit more of an appropriate comparison. reply pcthrowaway 21 hours agorootparentYou're supporting the artists you listen to more uniformly (via spotify) though. If you and I listen to 1000 artists over the course of a year, and you spend $1000/year on album purchases (let's say $10 each) while I subscribe to spotify, I pay $90 a year while supporting all of the artists I listen to, loosely based on how much I listen to them, while you much more significantly support up to 100 of the artists you listened to. I think what you're doing is better, don't get me wrong, but I can only afford $90 a year anyway. In your case though, you could support all the artists you listen to by paying for a spotify/itunes/whatever subscription and using that as your primary listening service, while also purchasing their music via bandcamp. You probably won't feel the additional subscription price. And I think most people who can afford $1000/year for music are not going to be using YouSpot, so I'm not sure why you're pointing out that people can leech off of spotify and then support the artists directly, when the above person said \"please also support the artists\" > You're better off listening to music however you please and buying albums on Bandcamp to support the artists; Yes, but most people can't afford this. It's good that YouSpot is available for people who can't even afford spotify (no one upthread said otherwise), and many people aren't going to be able to pay bandcamp $1000 per year to support maybe 10-50% of the artists they listen to. So please save your thesis for somewhere it's relevant. For the average person who can maybe comfortably afford $90 per year, a subscription service is a much more viable way to support the musicians they listen to than buying 4-9 albums reply etaweb 19 hours agorootparentYou say that it is better to pay 90$ for 1000$ worth of goods than to pay nothing. This is a false dilemma, there is a third choice that is paying only what you can afford. Paying only 9% of a physical good wouldn't make anyone less of a robber. A lot of people here would rather blame those who steal better than they do, than question the industry that allows artists work to be sold off. Furthermore, I would say that most people using Spotify and alike services do it only for convenience, but certainly not to \"support the artists\". reply pcthrowaway 18 hours agorootparentThese aren't physical goods, and (my issues with the categorization of piracy as theft aside) given that we're talking about legally listening to music you have access to through a service you pay for, I don't even know how to engage with the suggestion that this is theft (on the part of the consumers anyway). If you have the means and inclination to pay more I strongly urge people to pay more also. There are issues with the intermediaries, but there is no practical way for people who can't afford $1000/yr to support the artists they like legally, while still being able to listen to them. So if your suggestion is that someone who can afford $90/year should only have access to the albums they can afford to purchase through bandcamp because those support the artists more directly, I strongly disagree. This just further creates a wedge between the wealthy and regular working class people. Are you suggesting poor people make do with the few albums they can purchase from bandcamp and then whatever they can listen to on the radio? On youtube? Because I fail to see how those are any less 'theft' than just paying spotify and listening there. edit: I'm actually legitimately confused about what your idea is here and I'd like to understand. It seems like we're both coming at this from an anti-capitalist perspective, but your idea that poor people should have reduced access to the arts doesn't seem to align with any anti-capitalist ideology I'm aware of. Or are you just opposed to the consolidation of the distribution channels which exploit the working class (artists in this case) but somehow haven't drawn the connection that this is a condition of late-stage capitalism? If so, I'd recommend listening to some content by the wonderful Cory Doctorow reply hedora 18 hours agorootparentAlso, if, once a year, every spotify listener picked one band they liked at random, and paid them the amount of an annual Spotify subscription ($132), there'd be a hell of a lot more money in artist's pockets than there is currently. There are 8 million artists on Spotify, and 551 million monthly active users. That's $9000 per band on average per year. The 99.9th percentile band on Spotify makes $50K, and the 80th percentile artist makes $0. If we split the money across the 20% currently making any money at all, that's $45K per year per band. Therefore, the \"pirate + directly pay one band at random\" strategy would fund ~100 times more artists then Spotify does. Also, if Spotify went bankrupt tomorrow and 100% of their users switched to pure piracy, we'd only lose roughly 15K below-minimum-wage jobs globally. There are currently 36,000 Spotify listeners for every band being paid what would be a median income for one person. If a tiny fraction of them decided to go to concerts or donate to appropriate non-profits, etc, it'd be a net gain of jobs for artists. Note: There are only 220M premium subscriptions, so my numbers are a bit inflated. Ignoring the 330M ad supported listeners would lead to numbers that are too low. Also, I assumed people would pay for a spotify subscription which is more than the assumed $90. Maybe divide everything I said by two? Link to subscriber numbers: https://www.statista.com/chart/15697/spotify-user-growth/ reply pcthrowaway 17 hours agorootparentI think you're missing a few relevant things: An annual spotify subscription in the U.S. is $99 (possibly less with boxing day deals and such), but I'd assume the majority of subscribers are outside the U.S. where prices are lower across the board. But 6M of those artists may be AI-generated filler content, possibly published by bots. I don't think the correct idea is to divide the potential money people can spend by the number of artists. There should be some connection with what people are actually choosing to listen to, anything else would reward opportunistic publishers of low-effort, uninspired music (and encourage people to do even more of this). Which then brings up the problem: If people were to fund one artist they listen to (lets say an artist they choose to listen to rather than an artist they accidentally listened to a song by once), are they going to choose at random from their list of such artists? How do they then get that list to pick from? How do they discover new music to potentially listen to more of in the first place Apps like Spotify, (or OSS like YouSpot that piggybacks on Spotify) are both valid answers to those questions. Then you have the dilemma of who's paying the cost of the bandwidth, and the development costs. If you want to be fair, I think people should be encouraged to pay what they comfortably can with their budgets. They're using the infrastructure and platform of spotify (or similar) for discovery, so Spotify or similar should reasonably expect some money to cover costs and pay their devs. Then they can also pay any number of random artists whenever the mood strikes them. If they can't afford spotify, they can still use YouSpot, kick the YouSpot devs one or several dollar per year, and then purchase music from their preferred artists up to the amount comfortable for them. Using YouSpot is the closest actual thing to 'stealing' btw, because they're actually consuming a resource (bandwidth and server time) that's intended for subscribers, from a company that pays for it. Add to that, by using their software (and spotify's upstream), if they're not financially supporting the YouSpot devs and the Spotify devs for the work they're consuming then we're back to the initial claim (which I already said I disagree with) that consuming something that can be 'copied' ad infinitum without paying the producer is theft. But I think any of the above are reasonable options for people who want to maximize the support of creators of the things they consume while staying within their means reply hedora 17 hours agorootparentI mostly listen to long-tail artists, so if I were to pick one at random, it would probably be in the 80-99.9th percentile group. (Assuming 80% of Spotify's catalog is spam -- that could be, but I don't use Spotify, and have never encountered spam any of their competitors). This would pull some revenue away from the > 99.9th percentile artists, but that's OK with me. I'm more worried that, even if we count jobs that are way below minimum wage, Spotify is only supporting 15K bands worldwide. That rounds to zero when compared to their listener base and their revenue. Anyway, I pay more than just a streaming subscription annually, but I went with an estimate of what's going into just Spotify for my calculations. I'm not convinced there'd be much societal impact (in terms of artists not being paid) if they disappeared tomorrow. reply pcthrowaway 15 hours agorootparentThen you're probably the rare exception who would likely benefit independent artists more by just randomly picking a few every year. If everyone just pirated and picked a few musicians to support directly every year, the overwhelming majority of people would pick from the 16,000 in the 99.8th percentile on spotify, and the majority of the hundreds of thousands of artists in the 80th - 99.8th percentiles would see no income whatsoever from digital distribution. reply etaweb 16 hours agorootparentprev> These aren't physical goods, and (my issues with the categorization of piracy as theft aside) given that we're talking about legally listening to music you have access to through a service you pay for, I don't even know how to engage with the suggestion that this is theft. It being legal doesn't do much about its unfairness. > For the average person who can maybe comfortably afford $90 per year, a subscription service is a much more viable way to support the musicians they listen to than buying 4-9 albums The option that you describe as the best for people who can't put more than 90$ a year on music (which is perfectly fine), is going through a subscription service, because even if a lesser amount of that money goes directly to artists, more of them get to see a bit of it. I disagree with that, because you don't know for sure where your money is going, as all of this distribution system around streaming services is pretty opaque. As far as I know, the money from subscriptions on Spotify is not equally distributed among the artists that a user listens to. Bigger artists tend to get more per play than smaller ones. The other option would be to spend that same amount on buying albums each year on a service like Bandcamp, which is known to distribute the money in a more direct and transparent way, and where artists actually have more control over what and how they want to sell. It definitely means making a choice about what to buy, but it is still better than letting an obscure algorithm make that choice for you. We should also consider that we can favor artists who are in need over those who are already earning large amounts. This is the opposite of what streaming services seems to be doing. > your idea that poor people should have reduced access to the arts This is not my idea and I didn't say that. I criticize those who waste their time chasing the \"theft\", who they blame for being the origin of the artists being poorly paid, when the subscription model being proposed as the best solution is actually far from it and could also be considered as theft when you put out the numbers of how much artists are asking for their work. reply pcthrowaway 15 hours agorootparent> This is not my idea and I didn't say that. I criticize those who waste their time chasing the \"theft\", who they blame for being the origin of the artists being poorly paid, Oh well if this is truly the point you wanted to make, then we're in agreement. Earlier I was responding to: > > jsnell: In the plan where you buy music and only listen to the music you bought you don't need [YouSpot] at all. > drewdevault: I feel like pretending that you're supporting your favorite artists by listening them on Spotify is a bit more of an appropriate comparison [to not supporting the artists] I wasn't saying either of these things are better, simply pointing out that paying for spotify is going to support a broad selection of artists a little bit, while paying through bandcamp is going to support a narrow selection of artists a lot, and that both are desirable: > You're supporting the artists you listen to more uniformly (via spotify) though ... you could support all the artists you listen to by paying for a spotify/itunes/whatever subscription and using that as your primary listening service, while also purchasing their music via bandcamp. Aka both is better than just buying the music of a few artists through bandcamp while listening to everyone through piracy or YouSpot. That doesn't mean I disagree with anyone choosing to go the piracy + focused bandcamp patronage route. You jumped in with: > Paying only 9% of a physical good wouldn't make anyone less of a robber. Which I took to mean \"no actually, just paying Spotify is theft\". If the 80% of people with a limited entertainment budget pick their top 5 artists to support every year, the virtuosos of music are going to benefit, while the \"B-tier\" and \"C-tier\" artists who people still like to listen to are going to suffer a lot more. Paying for Spotify, or more aptly, Tidal (which seemingly pays artists the most) is probably the most realistic way that's accessible to a lot of people, to support the artists they listen to in a way that tracks their actual listening preferences. Yes, buy music in addition to that if you can, but if everyone chooses a few artists to support directly, it's still going to result in many musicians getting unfairly compensated despite lots of people enjoying their music, so I disagree with the idea that it's better to spend $90 on bandcamp in a year vs. $90 on spotify in a year, if it is a choice of one or the other. Better in some ways sure, because you're disintermediating the streaming platforms, but worse in equitable distribution, which will disproportionately impact artists who are liked by many but \"top-10\"ed by few reply jsnell 22 hours agorootparentprevI meant the generic \"you\" of an user of this app. I'm sure you specifically don't actually use this app, and just listen to the music you bought. But the main selling point of this app, i.e. the actual submission, is to get the music for free and no ads. The target market of it is not going to be paying a cent, because the entire reason the app exists and was submitted is to avoid paying much smaller amounts for music than what you're paying. reply drewdevault 22 hours agorootparentThis is perhaps true (but I'm not sure it is), but consider the context of this thread: we're specifically making arguments to an audience of people who care about artists being paid. reply andrepd 21 hours agorootparentprevThere's also the artist's point of view in this thread, multiple people saying they made many times more money from Bandcamp than steaming services. reply apwell23 18 hours agorootparent> multiple people saying they made many times more money from Bandcamp than steaming services.

The \"buy on Bandcamp\" advice only works if one likes to listen to the type of artists (typically indie) that happen to release on Bandcamp. On the other hand, if music listeners want the mainstream stuff (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Rolling Stones, etc)... they're only on the big tech music streamers like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc. reply FirebornX 18 hours agorootparentI think the \"buy on Bandcamp\" advise extends to any other of a large number of marketplaces you can purchase popular artist albums from.

The labels are the ones not paying artists. It’s crazy to expect all the music in the world on demand for $12 a month or whatever. Spotify can probably do better in some ways but I don’t see how any of this justifies not giving the artists the pennies your mentioning. reply 9dev 22 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn’t paint the full picture, though. Artists get something from Spotify in return - exposure to listeners (even those that wouldn’t traditionally listen to an artist or never discover them otherwise), global and immediate distribution, marketing, and simple payment handling. Today, artists don’t need most of the services traditional record labels provide, which treated them way worse over the last half century. And that’s a good thing. Not to say I think it’s fair how little streaming services pay to musicians, but this is more nuanced than just Spotify exploiting artists. reply petesergeant 22 hours agorootparentprev> Direct your passion for getting musicians paid to Spotify and the distribution system Spotify pay 70% of their revenue back to the rights holders, leaving 30% for operating costs and profits. What percentages would you recommend, and what are you basing it on? reply gitaarik 7 hours agorootparentIf you would pay $0.01 per song on Spotify. Then if you listen to an artist's album of 10 songs for a 100 times, so 1000 song plays of $0.01, that is $10. Spotify takes 30% cut, then the artist gets $7 and Spotify gets $3. Now if 10,000 people listen to the album a 100 times, the artist gets $70,000 and Spotify $30.000. What the artist needs to do for this is come up with the songs, work them out, practice them with a band, record, produce, mix, artwork, release, promo. For Spotify to release the album on their platform, they just need to sign a deal with the artist and add the album to their library. And this process is obviously largely (if not fully) automated. Of course they have some infrastructure and costs for this, but I think they're much better off than the artists. reply drewdevault 22 hours agorootparentprevI would not recommend a different revenue split, I would recommend a different business model.

Fortunately, however, there is equally years of some of the smartest minds on the planet working to bypass Chinese censorship, so there are some great OpenVPN alternatives. I really encourage you to look into something like Shadowsocks which Chinese people have found great success in using over the last several years. In your case, however, it's worth mentioning that if you can't connect at all then it's likely they've blocked the commercial IPs of the VPN nodes.

So if they want to get you, they’ll find some law to get you on, and if they don’t, they won’t go after you for using a VPN or other minor offenses. So I wouldn’t really worry about it. reply d0mine 15 hours agorootparentAre there any other types of countries? Note: you don't need to put something into law to silence someone.

Only ones that tilt more to one or the other. So like China might be a 35 and the states might be a 65. reply cracrecry 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, they are. There is a world of difference. In the West you normal people have so much power they do not even realise. You see that when you live outside it. In the West there is a long History of institutions(like cities) that went against the abuses of the people in charge. You were a servant, you entered a city(burg) you became free, the city protected you. This happened for centuries. In China something like that happened at specific periods, but eventually the Emperor took all the power. In China the Emperor or the Tzar in Russia could do anything. In Russia those that wanted freedom lost every single time. If a servant entered a city and the city did not deliver the fugitive, the Tzar will burn the city. The same happened with the Soviets. You want your own food? We will kill you all and send your children and wife to Siberia. Everybody else(not the Emperor) were servant. Now Xi or Putin are the new emperors, like Lenin, Stalin or Mao were. I have lived in China as a privileged engineer/expatriate. Basically most people have no idea what a country without rule of law(like China) is. >If necessary anyone can be canceled. Or you can cancel them.

If you want to have some fun understanding this better, call up (for example) Verizon and have them send you the data they have on you. It's surprisingly detailed, including timestamped logs of every DNS query (in addition to specific profiling data, like \"how likely you are to buy a new phone\" or \"household income\", etc). https://www.verizon.com/support/download-and-view-vpd-file/ After doing this myself, I always (at a minimum) use a privacy centric DNS and never the ISP's default. reply michael1999 15 hours agorootparentprevStream-downscaling, ad injection, etc. US isp shenanigans. reply polski-g 11 hours agorootparentprevComcast intercepts and rewrites your DNS queries to their own servers.

At least shadowsocks was well researched in the past, I'm not sure about v2ray. reply EasyMark 11 hours agorootparentprevIf I was in Russia I would be a lot less afraid of USA/Britain/Germany MITM than I would of Putin's agents catching wind of the free flow of information and coming for me and my family and throwing us off the roof or putting polonium in our water supply. reply bbarnett 1 hour agorootparentInteresting. I said 'state actor' not 'western actor'. The state, any state, often employs such tactics to make people believe they are protected, and therefore said people will act more openly. There are a myriad of such known cases, in fact the examples are endless. So if one is in Russia... beware, for ways to get around blocking which work, may be ways secretly controlled by the Russian state. An example is a VPN service which is secretly run by the state, regardless of where it is incorporated or physically located. Another example is blocking products which are effective, but letting products which are easily MITM by the state to \"work\", thereby providing the illusion of security and safety. These tactics are thousands of years old, the employment of such methods is all that has changed. Make those which you distrust, use methods you control to organize. An example; the pub which is uses for meetings, is actually owned by state sympathizers, who claim otherwise. reply KomoD 17 hours agoparentprevv2ray is a great alternative reply EasyMark 11 hours agoparentprevI imagine that is something that is not \"top secret\" that Xi can easily share with Putin and something that could be applied almost immediately to routers in Russia.

Over here they have been blocking all WireGuard connections for a long time. OpenVPN seems to be blocked selectively depending on the host. The government and commerce must need it more than WireGuard. It isn't consistent. Different ISPs block different hosts and protocols at different times.

In the interest of anonymity I am not going to respond to your questions. reply cracrecry 14 hours agoparentThey called the Chinese to help with their experience like 6 months after the start of the war as they realised some young people could access news outside the official channels.

Their description of the situation is not nearly as rosy as yours. The war (which, for the Donbass, started in 2014) has devastated an immense amount of territory. Ukraine had Europe's lowest fertility rate even before the war, and now millions of working-age men are dead, wounded our have left the country, which makes prospects of a quick recovery slim. Also, Ukraine's government is extremely corrupt, and while less autocratic than Russia it is very far from a model democracy (was even before the war, and war tends to make countries more corrupt and authoritarian). The best thing for GP to hope for would likely be peace, as soon as possible, and which side of the armistice line they fall on won't make much difference for them. reply Const-me 9 hours agorootparent> not nearly as rosy as yours Ukraine is at war, nothing rosy about that. Still, living conditions of people north of Kyiv, north of Kharkiv, or in Kherson is dramatically better than GP’s situation.

In Russia, it seems to be promoted a culture of ratting those who are against the government, which is also very common in these regimes - and that has a very deep scarring in societies that go over it. I'm from Portugal and to this day there's still a cultural undertone of not ratting anyone to authorities, even if it is something that's hurting you or everyone, all because of the disgust and hate towards those who ratted people to the government police. During our dictatorships, there were also the same theatrical displays of polling, voting, having opposing candidates approved by the state, etc. Salazar was always the man of course.

If they are independent, then presumably it's true that most Russians are nationalists and Putinists. That doesn't seem implausible; as far as I can tell, a majority of voters in the USA are nationalists and Trumpists. I've never visited a country while it was under the fist of a dictator. And in a way, Russia is special; in Russian history, autocracy and tyranny have been a constant, except for the ten years after the collapse of the CCCP.

Also, it hardly fits the definition of a \"failed state\", the current authoritarian (verging on totalitarian) Russian government has been pretty effective at maintaining political stability and had (and generally still has) very effective control over its people (more so than successful democratic, not that it's really comparable) over the last 20 years. The same applied to the USSR during most of its history. reply xtian 17 hours agoparentprevRussia produces more container ships by tonnage than the US with a fraction of the population, to pick just one example of many. Before SpaceX, the US was dependent on them for rides to the ISS. They produce some of the most formidable and battle-tested military-technical systems in the world. How exactly is that a failed state? Seems like you want other people to make the same decision you did since maybe you’re unsure that it was the correct choice. reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agorootparentTwo out of the three of those are heavily military-based, and thanks to the cold war, the US and Russia have been heavily investing in the military for over half a century. So maybe that's not a fair comparison to make. Besides manufacturing capability, I think determining whether something is a \"failed state\" or not, you need to look at other things, focusing more on social details. Is the government truly democratic? Is the law applied more-or-less fairly and equally? Is the press free, and are people able to discuss things without fear? Aside from manufacturing exports, how is the internal economy - are people able to afford the basics, and things that might be considered luxuries? How's education, how's the ability to travel both internally and externally, how's economic and social mobility? I don't think container-ship-tonnage is a great metric of whether something is a failed state or not. reply WhatsTheBigIdea 16 hours agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state https://www.britannica.com/topic/failed-state https://www.dictionary.com/browse/failed-state Russia does not appear to qualify as a failed state by the definition published in any of these three sources. reply cat_plus_plus 16 hours agorootparentprevStalin managed to kill more Russians and Ukranians than Germany did during both world wars combined.

That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.\" He could just as well be telling the rest of Ubisoft (and the games industry) that in order for customers to be comfortable you need to not delete things and allow people to keep what they invested in the game, and that if you take things away from them then people won't be comfortable. reply rdedev 17 hours agoparent\"One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect… you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game. \"I still have two boxes of DVDs. I definitely understand the gamers perspective with that. But as people embrace that model, they will see that these games will exist, the service will continue, and you'll be able to access them when you feel like. That's reassuring\" This is the longer context. I understand where he is coming from but people like to own things so that they can enjoy them later without getting the company involved again. Sure the save files are there but if the company changes their terms and services it just straight up stop offering them in their subscriptions what good are they? The guy claims that they support multiple mediums now but at the end of the day that's a business decision and they could decide to not sell DVDs or things like that anymore. reply zdw 16 hours agorootparentThe difference here is that Game makers they want the video model - entirely DRM encumbered on DVD or BluRay (trivially broken, but still...) or streamed with an ongoing cost, as opposed to the audio model where you have the option of downloading DRM-free content from multiple sources (Bandcamp, Bleep, Qobuz, etc.) or buying it without DRM on CD. There are some DRM-free gaming - GoG for example, and while Valve still has DRM, Steam hasn't been caught up in forcing people to go to perpetual streaming models. From a preservationist standpoint, I really want media available in ways that will last through corporate shenanigans, and platform DRM limited or streaming-only isn't it. reply highwaylights 16 hours agorootparentI see both arguments here. Games just aren’t the same as music or video - when an album or a movie is finished, what you get can be frozen in time and still work without the film or record company again. Games used to be entirely this way, and some still are, but any manner of live-service game can’t realistically work in that model for an indefinite period of time like movies and music can. This is also true to a lesser extent for patches and DLC, although they shouldn’t be necessary (but day one patches are a thing, I imagine the games companies aren’t unhappy about this, as there’s an incentive to release a broken game with a day-one patch as a future copy protection measure). reply worble 16 hours agorootparent> but any manner of live-service game can’t realistically work in that model for an indefinite period of time like movies and music can I'm not sure why you think that? A \"live service\" game is just a game that's updated a lot and is backed by a server. So whenever they stop updating it, that's the finished product. The main issue is that they then turn off the servers without any alternative method of playing and tell players to go f themselves when they want to continue to play it. reply highwaylights 14 hours agorootparentWell yes that’s what I was saying above. Selling you a product one time for a fixed fee isn’t going to fund keeping servers supported and online forever, and even if it did, the games company has no incentive to do so once you’ve already paid and they’ve met whatever legally mandated warranty periods exist in that country. reply Jensson 14 hours agorootparentBut why can't them let the players host it themselves? It isn't like hosting a game server is expensive, plenty of people have done so with unofficial servers for games. reply xg15 15 hours agorootparentprevThat's moving the goalposts. That may be true for a small fraction of games, e.g. MMOs, but for the vast majority of games, they could easily be frozen. reply zdw 16 hours agorootparentprevLive service games are closer to social media, IMO - they're a version of Twitter/FB with better graphics and things to do, and as you say that can't be turned into a static product. There are plenty of folks trying to reverse engineer the protocols used for older live gaming environments - for example the Dreamcast/Gamecube Phantasy Star Online has a fan-run server here: https://schtserv.com/ , but that's the exception, not the rule. reply piaste 14 hours agorootparentWhen internet infrastructure was much less advanced, the server application used to be part of the delivered product so you could host it yourself at a LAN party. I understand that packaging, documenting and supporting an additional application is a cost that the company would rather avoid if possible. But upon shutting down a game's servers, it would cost them nothing to provide the discontinued app code \"as is\" with no warranty or support, to let fans figure out how to run or improve it themselves. I doubt most game companies have any incredibly valuable and cutting-edge networking code worth protecting. reply charrondev 6 hours agorootparentOne issue here is that the game servers may be encumbered by 3rd party, proprietary licensed code. The company can’t just give up functional source code if it’s built on top of some licensed tech. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentprevEven standalone games can have operating system and hardware dependencies. Not all of course. A few years ago, I went through a few months when I tried getting back into some older Windows games. They ran--mostly, often with patches--but it was all too flaky and crash-prone to be much fun and I mostly gave up. reply sho_hn 16 hours agorootparentBtw, if you are ever in that situation again, Linux + Wine/Proton is now often the better stack to run old games than newer versions of native Windows, both in terms of backward compatibility and performance. Not always, but often. This is a perplexing situation as Microsoft used to be the queens and kings of backward compat (due to true invested engineering effort), but even they had to let go of some things, gimp an API or two by quick-porting them to newer infra, etc. due to finite resources. On the other hand perhaps not that surprising. Just as with projects like MAME or ScummVM or Dosbox, preservation activities are perhaps best placed in the community, the Commons, vs. a commercial business with commercial pressures of the present-day market. But then it's important the community has the legal conditions and stability to do the work, of course. reply ethbr1 16 hours agorootparentprevThe implied length of the service, and rights that ownership confers after it's terminated, could be a lot less murky. \"How long do you expect to run the necessary online components for me to be able to use this?\" \"What will you do when you turn off the online components required for me to be able to use this?\" Are important questions that most services haven't provided clear answers to. Getting a global right-to-jailbreak after service is terminated by the owner would go a long way towards making me comfortable. reply ang_cire 15 hours agorootparentAnd as tech folks, we all know how insane it would be in the B2B space to suggest that the service provider can end their service at any time, not refund you anything, and have no liability. We should have MSAs with defined SLAs and contract terms for consumer SaaS (like video games and streaming) as well. reply ethbr1 13 hours agorootparentExactly, and equally critically -- the death provision. Given we're on the first generation to purchase licenses-instead-of-physical, it will be some years before this starts to snowball. But when it does, I expect the mismatch between customer expectations and company policies are going to make for some bad PR. \"Grandmother left me her collection of music, and then Amazon took it away\" isn't a rosy headline. And I refuse to believe that most streaming media/game services don't already have actuaries in their pricing departments, and so have already thought very hard about this. reply cbm-vic-20 16 hours agorootparentprev> They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection GenXer here: I'm not comfortable not owning my CD collection. I still either buy CDs, or at least high quality DRM-free digital files that I can archive. Unfortunately, some bands that I really like don't issue CDs in thr US anymore, or sell good quality files, so I've had to buy CDs from outside the US and have them shipped here. reply E39M5S62 13 hours agorootparentDiscogs is a godsend for that. I end up getting a lot of CDs shipped from France/Germany/Japan - all for very reasonable prices. reply hamandcheese 16 hours agorootparentprev> \"They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection.\" This isn't what happened at all. People got used to streaming services which is a different product entirely. Many people stopped buying movies and music altogether, and those that still do are rightfully outraged when, say, Sony deletes a movie from their library. reply yndoendo 16 hours agorootparentprevCurrent consumer protection laws are lacking in the digital world. Purchase should mean ownership. Rent and lease should mean non-ownership. We still don't have a quality definition of ownership. Example would be that the ability to edit the OS \"hosts\" file to prevent a device from accessing say \"twitter.com\" should be a requirement in ownership. Owned / purchased content should not be able to be revoked. Such as Ubisoft locking your account and preventing you from playing the games you purchased. Rental and leased content would fall into the account locking ability by Ubisoft. reply ufocia 15 hours agorootparentThere is a misunderstanding among consumers, be it individuals or corporations, that by purchasing a physical medium you simultaneously purchase a perpetual license. While in gross majority of consumer cases that was true, or at least implied, it certainly was not true in the commercial space where plenty of software was licensed for term. The SaaS model only made that more apparent/transparent. While I personally loathe the general corporate subscriptionism, it does have its benefits and drawbacks which in most cases can be addressed by market forces. The ultimate pressure on video games publisher's subscriptionism may be to touch the grass. reply barrysteve 12 hours agorootparentprevIt will likely take centuries to reinvent digital ownership. The top-down influence is too strong to have nice things. reply ryandrake 15 hours agorootparentprev> One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. \"Needs to happen\" is a pretty strong statement. Why does it \"need\" to happen? Are current customer behaviors/preferences some kind of existential threat to humanity? Nothing needs to happen. The company might want it to happen, but that's different. Companies talking about a mass [and profitable] shaping of population behavior as being \"necessary\" should alert our antennas a little. reply cortesoft 16 hours agorootparentprevThere is also a difference between games and movies/tv shows… if a streaming service removes a movie I like, I can either buy it or get it from a different streamer and I have lost nothing. If a gaming service removes a game, will I be able to keep my save history when I buy it from somewhere else? reply ufocia 15 hours agorootparentWe should get away from using the term buy with respect to media. What you're actually doing is licensing in. Why not just say the latter, even if it sounds awkward? At the very least it will build awareness of the actual nature of the transaction. reply ndriscoll 13 hours agorootparentNo, we should continue to use the term \"buy\", and clarify in the law that copyright shenanigans don't trump purchase rights and consumer protection obligations. In the meantime, since the law is wrong and makes a mockery of its legitimacy, people should treat it as optional and follow it to the extent they personally feel fair and appropriate. Everyone knows it would be absurd if you bought a chair, and then you opened the box and there was a piece of paper inside that said actually you're just renting it indefinitely and the manufacturer has the right to take it back at any time. Likewise if the outside of box said you get an indefinite \"license\"; the expectation would be that the seller is acting in good faith and that that's the same thing as perpetual. Taking the chair back would be called a scam. Any government that goes along with the scam is a clown show and deserves the contempt of its citizenry. reply _the_inflator 16 hours agorootparentprevI see your point. On the other hand, modern games usually max out any DVD or even Blu-ray. While I cannot image C64 games in the cloud, I also cannot imagine modern games on a DVD. Even with physical access to a device, there are hurdles. Who still owns a C64? A 386 with floppy drive? It is tricky. reply optymizer 16 hours agorootparentprev\"The service will exist\" Bull.shit. I call bullshit. Will it exist after the company goes bankrupt? What an idiotic thing to say to people. It's one thing to have a company do this, but to argue that an entire industry will make sure that their services will exist in perpetuity is madness. You know what can exist for a long time though? A disc with a game that you own. reply ufocia 15 hours agorootparentYou own the disc, you don't own the game. reply dangus 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s weird about this statement is that gamers on platforms like Steam and PS Store already have that confidence. No Steam customer is worried about losing their library. PlayStation gamers see a PS3 store that is still functional and have confidence in buying PS5 games digitally. (Granted, Sony almost disabled purchases on the PS3 store, but came to a good compromise by moving payment processing off of the platform). It’s only shitty, badly run stores like UPlay and Nintendo’s always-shutting down console-specific stores that make customers lack confidence. reply ang_cire 15 hours agorootparentI think GOG disproves this somewhat. A decent number of my coworkers who game buy their favorite games again on GOG to get the offline installers. Trust, but verify. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentWell, that’s an anecdote among people working at a tech company right? Steam distributes 75% of all PC games. So obviously the DRM-free offline installer (which is nice and I appreciate) isn’t something that most people prioritize for their purchase decisions. reply Eisenstein 6 hours agorootparentprevGabe can't live forever. Once Steam changes hands anything goes and if confidence gets harmed there goes a generation of gamers. reply chrisan 17 hours agoparentprevIsn't the fear that the game will go away and unable to be played? I'm not super interested in if a game is rented or not, but the argument I've always heard was \"online services shut down and unable to play - or requires internet connection\" never whether or not the save progress would still be there reply Glant 15 hours agorootparentYes, such as the Ubisoft game \"The Crew\" which will have its servers deleted on March 31st and can never be played again. reply magicalhippo 16 hours agorootparentprevThat would be my fear. My Steam library has over a dozen titles which can no longer be bought. Thankfully Steam still provides them for those who have purchased it before they were pulled from the store. Though IIRC some have been fully removed (with refund). reply bbradley406 6 hours agorootparentWhile I definitely like (and mostly trust) Steam, there are some issues like songs being removed from GTA games due to licensing that make me want to hang onto pirated copies, just in case. reply ptx 15 hours agoparentprevUsers will lose what they non-bought eventually if they don't own it. It's just a matter of time. Even if the company earnestly believes, at this time, that they will continue to provide access forever, circumstances will inevitably change in the future and might cause a change of plans. Or the company might be acquired by another with different ideas, or bring in new management that decides to refocus on different business opportunities. Or the technology they use to lock down the product will fall out of support. Or they just go out of business. Something will inevitably happen, and users will lose access. reply bobmaxup 16 hours agoparentprev> this is being widely misinterpreted It sounds like Ubisoft wants their streaming and subscription services to grow, but reality doesn't line up with their vision. They are purchasing long term streaming rights from other companies like Activision Blizzard. \"Ubisoft recently announced the completion of the transaction with Activision Blizzard giving Ubisoft the perpetual cloud streaming rights for Call of Duty and all other existing Activision Blizzard Console and PC titles as well as those releasing over the next 15 years. These rights will further strengthen Ubisoft’s content offering through its subscription service Ubisoft+ as well as allowing Ubisoft to license them to third parties.\" It seems they are betting on a speculative market. They assume people will treat owning games like owning DVDs in the past. From what is said in the article, it sounds like they are probably worried about losing a lot of money on this bet. They reported a net loss of nearly half a billion euros last year. reply Volundr 17 hours agoparentprevAs much as I hate to defend Ubisoft on basically anything... Yeah reading that article it's very clear he's discussing this in the context of their subscription service. It's no crazier than someone wouldn't own their games through acquired via Ubisoft subscription than movies via Netflix or music via Spotify. Is the trend of non-ownership a good thing? I don't think so. And yet I also begrudgingly admit that I listen to a much wider variety of music via streaming than was ever available in my cd/mp3 collection... reply devjab 17 hours agorootparentI don’t mind steam, but it’s not like you really “own” your library even on that platform. So it has probably been a while since most of us actually owned a video game the way it was 30 years ago. Sure, the subscription services are taking it even further, but as long as you’re not in total control of the stuff you own, it’s not really yours. At least in my opinion. reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentAs a practical matter, if I had a 30+ year old game still up in my attic, it would probably take more time/knowledge/money in many cases to get it running usefully than most people would reasonably put in. reply pierat 17 hours agorootparentThat would be in the realm of Total Annihilation (middle 1990s). I installed that a few weeks ago from the CDs provided on archive.org It took a few minutes to download AND install. What it really boils down to is the ever-downward trend to destroy ownership by converting as much as possible to a service or hidden rental. Me? I prefer to own games that work now or 30 years from now. reply robinsonb5 15 hours agorootparent> What it really boils down to is the ever-downward trend to destroy ownership by converting as much as possible to a service or hidden rental. The phrase I use for that is \"erecting toll-booths\". reply bobmaxup 16 hours agorootparentprevNot if you still had the original system as well. I imagine it is not the norm though. reply worble 16 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, as talking about \"ownership\" in terms of the law I find to be an argument that just goes round in circles. Like yes, you don't own the game because the EULA says so, but no EULA's aren't legally binding, but yes because they can revoke the game without recourse, etc etc. What's more interesting is ownership in practical terms, in my opinion. And I don't think you can really blanket all the game in Steam under one rule here - some have absolutely 0 DRM and you can back them up and run them just fine anywhere and some have Steam DRM which is trivial to crack; these games you practically own. And then there are games which use Denuvo or other DRM means, where unless its one of the rare games that get a crack. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that, regardless of anything else, digital ownership to me boils down to \"Can I copy these bytes to a hard drive, and then 20 years later still use them?\" reply ufocia 15 hours agorootparentYou're really talking about digital possession not ownership. reply tokai 16 hours agorootparentprevYes you do. You can backup and run (most[0]) games without steam. [0] when you can't its because of publishers purposefully blocking it. reply TillE 16 hours agorootparentYeah tons of games on Steam have zero DRM, many have trivially weak Steam DRM, and a handful have serious third-party DRM. Whatever the specific license may say about your rights, it's usually easy to make a completely portable backup. reply jstummbillig 17 hours agorootparentprev> Is the trend of non-ownership a good thing? I would argue, on average, it actually is. Because it's not that we are getting nothing in return: We are getting stewardship. Let us at least acknowledge this part of the equation: Hosting things securely and reliably is only naively easy and cheap, and on top only like drawing a picture is easy, if you are Picasso. Sure, you can put those years of professional devops experience to use to maintain a private data haven – but that's not something that will work for most people and it is fairly obvious that, on average, our collective data would be a lot less safe if rolling hosting became everyones favorite passion project. reply howenterprisey 16 hours agorootparentThat is certainly a convenience that is gained by renting something, but (1) the significance of that convenience is minimal compared to the threat of the company taking away what you've bought, intentionally or not, and (2) paid backup services exist. It is far from obvious that people renting things instead of owning them makes our collective data a lot more safe. It seems to me that the data would be a lot more vulnerable to companies deciding to make (more) money. reply jstummbillig 16 hours agorootparent> It is far from obvious that people renting things instead of owning them makes our collective data a lot more safe. You would probably reconsider if you spent more time around the, to this day, ocean of outdated and unmaintained-until-physical-failure-windows-2000ish-servers sprinkled throughout fairly touchy parts of our society, connected to the, gasp, internet. > It seems to me that the data would be a lot more vulnerable to companies deciding to make (more) money. If I have to chose between Google and a free ticket to built vast botnets on perpetually legacy, unmaintained infra, I will, until further notice, gladly have the former every time and let legislation take it from there. reply howenterprisey 16 hours agorootparentI'm confused. We're talking about video games and other digital media. You would put those on an external drive or similar. Why would the vulnerabilities of such a solution have any overlap with windows 2000-era servers used for infrastructure? What does infrastructure have in common with personal backups? reply ang_cire 15 hours agorootparentprevExcept that I can control whether the server I run is up to date, or internet-connected, or has appropriate NACLs, whereas I know firsthand that most large companies do not meet patching SLAs, or have properly-configured security controls. This is a tech space; if you work around security, you know that someone's home computer is going to usually be harder to hack than a big corporation that has an attack surface a million miles wide. Maybe I can phish you and get on your machine, but maybe not. But I can definitely phish at least one person at a big company, and usually many more. Your home machine doesn't have an ssh key buried in a git repo's commit history, or in a public S3 bucket, etc. Most large-scale botnets running on consumer machines target either IoT or routers, both of which are difficult for consumers to patch, so that's more bad business security once again, than bad consumers. > choose between Google and a free ticket to built vast botnets on perpetually legacy, unmaintained infra My god, what a false dichotomy. Yes, every computer not run by Google is running freshly-installed, never-been-updated Windows 95, but Google is totally absolutely positively doing better than all the others in the same space. /s reply uhoh-itsmaciek 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's a false dichotomy. Bandcamp will sell me music I can download _and_ let me stream it. But separately, I don't want stewardship for my data to rest with whoever I transact with to acquire that data. Why not a digital locker standard, where you sign in with your digital locker when purchasing digital content, and that content is saved to your locker, with whatever metadata? You can then search and play your purchased content through whatever client you like, regardless of where you got it from. You can sort of do that today (to the extent that you can still purchase digital content--there's music that's available to stream that I have not been able to find for purchase) with files, but you lose the stewardship and it's a lot of work. You can argue that the subscription model pays for the stewardship in a way purchases would not, but surely digital content is easier to work with than CDs and DVDs. I think most consumers don't really care, though, and I'm guessing content platforms don't really see the point of supporting something like that. reply palata 16 hours agorootparentprev> It's no crazier than someone wouldn't own their games through acquired via Ubisoft subscription than movies via Netflix or music via Spotify. Which doesn't say it is not crazy :-). > Is the trend of non-ownership a good thing? At least with movie/audio it's easy to download. I tend to be okay paying their subscription if I can download it on BitTorrent later. For games it may be a bit harder?

Every time I try to buy an MP3 I hit a bunch of anti-patterns trying to get me to click on get this with a subscription.

But musically for my \"daily driver\" playlist I want to go way down a particular rabbit hole and find new stuff. It is less good for that. I am happy streaming exists. On PC I am totally digital download. Consoles, I am more of a collector, so I prefer physical games which I actually own. Eventually having a disc will be the only legal way to play those games if you did not download them. (Some not even then like Destiny) reply ufocia 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a non-ownership tend. There never was ownership of the content. It was a dillusion. Content was licensed.

I understand the rationale for these companies to push for subscription models to pump their PE ratio and get that predictable revenue bump. Adobe famously went from a $15 billion to $400 billion market cap by switching to subscription/“own nothing be happy” services rather than selling CS licenses. But as a counter-party? No thank you. Two decades on (and particularly seeing this as a docent at the Media Archeology Lab in Boulder working with 50+ year old media) I think it’s rational to push for digital ownership enforced by a community and not a corporation because otherwise the outcome is predictable.

Adobe famously went from $15 billion to $400 billion by switching to subscription services rather than selling CS licenses. For Adobe it makes sense. Like, the full CS suite is 50-60€ a month... that was probably 10k worth of purchases before. Even as a student, you can usually afford a CS subscription, whereas you all but had to pirate it under the old model. Personally I would prefer something like the IntelliJ license model - subscribe for 12 months, and you get the last version you had permanently if you cancel the subscription. For games though? For the calculation to make sense even remotely, the monthly subscription game would need to be in the cents, maybe a dollar a month. Everything else is just a ripoff. reply DaiPlusPlus 16 hours agorootparent> For Adobe it makes sense. Like, the full CS suite is 50-60€ a month... that was probably 10k worth of purchases before Nah - the big-box Creative Suite Master Collection was $2300 in 2012 (link below) and it's a perpetual license, and (as far as I've personally tested it) Adobe's main titles (Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat) dating back to version 7.0 (circa 2001) work perfectly fine on Windows 10 (obviously things like high-DPI support is lacking). ...wherewas my Creative Cloud sub is costing me $65/mo now ($780/yr), and I've been a paying subscriber for 10 years now, so Adobe has gotten at-least $6,000 USD from me, even though I only use the base functionality we've had since the late-1990s - so I'd be $3000+ better-off right-now if I had the foresight to buy a big-box of Master Collection right-before Adobe discontinued it. https://web.archive.org/web/20120112103643/http://www.amazon... reply jokethrowaway 14 hours agorootparentFor the basics you can just use alternatives.

Being able to subscribe for a month or two once a year means I can check out their latest titles released this year for less than the price of a single game. Many of their games don't have much replayability anyway and there's no point in \"buying\" it. When Steam first came out, people made a big bruhaha about how digital licensing (no right of first sale, etc.) isn't the same as owning the game. True, but so what? Steam completely changed the PC games industry on that model and created an indie explosion. People like to complain about the lack of ownership rights, but the convenience is what really matters, especially coupled with a generous refund policy that we never had in the physical media days. A subscription service is a logical continuation of this model. Now, a couple decades later, games have become super commoditized, and frankly it's hard to tell apart one title from another, much less remember them years later. For every Baldur's Gate 3, there's a hundred no-name RPGs that are entirely adequate but ultimately forgettable. They're not very different from an average show on Netflix or a song on Spotify. Subscription services are a lot cheaper for most people than renting or buying individual titles, and is the only sane way to explore a marketplace that has more content than you could reasonably consume in a lifetime. If Steam offered a subscription service I'd give up my whole library (hundreds of games, mostly bought on sale) overnight. It's not just Ubi, EA, Microsoft, Playstation all do it, along with Google and Apple on mobile, and it's wonderful. Now for $30 a month split between GeForce Now and PC Games Pass, you can play hundred of games on a 4080 on a Chromebook. Games have never been as affordable or accessible. This is a good thing for gamers, enabling fixed-cost gaming that's easy to budget for and much cheaper a month than games used to be. Even if you have two or three subscriptions from different companies (which can vary month to month). There are more games coming out every day than a person can consume. It's not the 90s anymore, no reason to clutch on to treasured old titles when a similar game will be out in a few months anyway. reply thfuran 17 hours agoparent>People like to complain about the lack of ownership rights, but the convenience is what really matters Yes, and ownership provides many conveniences that limited and revocable licenses do not. reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentTo each their own, I guess?

And lately I've also stopped using Steam (directly) as much as just streaming from GFN, because I don't have to manually update games or my hardware anymore.

Remember when Ubisoft was the king? reply dageshi 17 hours agorootparentWell here's the thing, the people who think they might want to go back to play a six year old game are probably buying it, the people who play most games once and never go back are just going to get a better deal with this kind of subscription. So long as there's always a choice to \"buy\" the game then I really don't see it as a problem. That's certainly Microsoft's approach with gamepass, I assume they and ubisoft both will happily let people give them $70 for a game if that's what the customer prefers. reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentYeah exactly. It's an option for those who prefer the old ways, but since they offered the subscriptions, I haven't bought any more Ubi or Gamepass games. Starfield was a bullet dodged due to Gamepass, lol. Talk about throwaway games... These days only the indie studios are making the actually good titles. The AAA ones are just high production interactive movies with little actual gameplay. They fit the play once subscription model quite well. reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentprev> what happens when you want to play the game in 6 years and they removed it? Best case, the subscription model incentivizes them to keep updating games so they'll keep working on newer systems. Plenty of old games are available but unplayable without emulation. Worst case, the market fragments into a dozen different game streaming services that have cyclical catalogs like we see with movies and shows already. That would suck, but even then, games by their nature tend to consume way more time and attention anyway, so you would rarely need more than one or two subs at a time and you can cycle between them as you finish certain titles. If games are altogether removed, well, that happens now too. A few of my favorite games have disappeared from Steam. Happens on Kindle too. But you know what? I don't think it's really a big deal. A moment of nostalgia maybe, sure, but then five minutes later I'm sure I can find a similar enough game to scratch the itch. I can always watch old videos on YouTube or see if it's on an abandonware service or GOG. Most publishers would probably still license out their old titles to different marketplaces. Even Ubi, for now, still give you the option to buy their individual games. > it doesn’t help that Ubisoft games after 2010 are just throwaways anyway. Remember when Ubisoft was the king? I still subscribe to Ubi once in a while, but honestly, I think most games anywhere are throwaways these days. Of my library of hundreds of titles, probably fewer than a dozen have more than 2 hours of playtime. I didn't refund the rest because I think the developers deserve to get paid, but I'd much rather just pay a single fee and let the system figure out how much to pay each developer. reply up2isomorphism 17 hours agoparentprevWhat you are saying is “I don’t need now”, which is very hard to be interpreted as” it is very nice”. reply solardev 17 hours agorootparentI don't need what now, sorry? reply mmsc 18 hours agoprevI did my bachelors degree on this topic but have been interested in this problem since years before university.

(AI results were awful and downright misinformation by the way) Early copyright law didn't explicitly cover music and audio recordings, because the technology did not exist or was not widely available at the time. However, I suspect that they may have been covered by early copyright laws. Copyright Act of 1790 in the United States primarily focused on protecting written works, such as books, maps, and charts, while Early recordings were created in the 1870s. Herbert v. Shanley Co., 242 U.S. 591 (1917), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held hotels and restaurants that perform music must compensate composers, even if the venue is not separately charging patrons to hear the music. From this, I infer that music during this time was copyrightable, so commercial production of it via wax cylinder would also be infringement. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_v._Shanley_Co. reply ufocia 14 hours agorootparentLook up the Statue of Anne. reply jumpman500 17 hours agoprevI think the games industry is just to competitive for subscriptions to work.

Would you say that’s not theft because it’s not a loss of value? reply TrueDuality 17 hours agorootparentYour analogy falls down because the act of taking a physical good deprives the current owner of that good without recompense. That is the definition of stealing. Software and digital content piracy does not deprive any other owner of anything else, this is isn't stealing in the legal sense. It may be financial harm or copyright abuse but those are both separate crimes from theft. Piracy isn't legal, but it isn't theft either. reply agilob 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you could do piracy to my car, but my car would still be in my garage, I would be perfectly happy with it. reply dartos 17 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to really be splitting hairs here. reply dathinab 16 hours agorootparentnot at all it's a huge difference when you consider how it will affect how people see and what people think is okay to prevent privacy (people including law makers and judges) reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that if piracy were legal, the financial damage would become very real. Therefore it has to be made illegal. The fact that it’s not technically stealing is a side issue. reply Levitz 16 hours agorootparentIt's very much not a side issue, it's powerful players completely warping the discussion by abusing their power in order to emotionally load their argument.

But a major question is what is acceptable (practically, legally) to prevent piracy. And by framing piracy as stealing it is much easier to convince law maker and the general public that very much not reasonable solutions are acceptable. So that it's not technically stealing is really important for proper law making. reply hedora 17 hours agorootparentprevI bought a Ubisoft game, and got to play zero times (it won't run). I can't get a refund. Is it legal to sneak into the movie after buying the ticket and being refused admittance without cause? Probably not. Would a jury convict? Probably not. reply samch 17 hours agorootparentprevI would think the analogy is more akin to Netflix vs owning a copy of a movie. In many cases, consumers have a choice. They can spend a bit more and always have access to a copy of a movie that they own or they could hope that it’s available on one of their streaming services (the availability being beyond the control of the consumer and subject to arbitrary decisions). This is setting aside the fact that subscription-based access almost always requires an Internet connection and DRM protections which can be viewed as an invasion of privacy. reply sircastor 17 hours agorootparentprevFor what it’s worth, theaters see it slightly differently.

It’s a ridiculously difficult task which is ridiculously costly to maintain, at the expense of taxpayers. If you consider that the state shouldn’t intervene, or shouldn’t intervene in this way, then it’s not immoral. For example, the state could say “DRM and if anyone can break the DRM, they’re free to use the game” or it could say “Any software becomes open-source after 20 years” (which, at least, would have the benefit of being useful). Same goes for songs or other artistic work, it will be much less monetizable but maybe it will restore the “art” part in “art”. reply morelisp 17 hours agorootparentprevNobody has ever been sued for copyright infringement for failing to buy a ticket. reply RichardHesketh 18 hours agoparentprevThere’s a popular view that piracy is not theft.

Actually, it leads more towards the idea that overpricing hurts legal consumption far more. And lost sales are not theft anyway, neither is copying a file. https://torrentfreak.com/eu-piracy-report-suppression-raises... reply sashank_1509 17 hours agoparentprevNo, I will have to strongly disagree. Years worth of effort for hundreds of people go into a AAA Game, just like a blockbuster movie. The agreement then is, you pay somehow for the right to consume their effort. You pay directly to the game, or you pay a subscription service that then distributes its pot to the game according to their agreement, but you have to pay. That’s the social agreement. If you don’t, then you’re breaking the social agreement and you’re stealing, there’s really no justification for it. Let’s say you somehow find that you pirating does not matter in the grand scheme of things, or might indirectly increase sales. It still does not matter. You are a part of an agreement that you should honor, not break, they didn’t hire you to market the game or to improve their sales. Personally when I was a teen, I used to pirate games because my parents did not buy me any. Then I became a software developer. Now I can only sympathize for piracy if it’s for educational resources that uplifts you, kind of like Sci-hub. For games/ movies you need to think, do you deserve to consume years worth of effort that they put into it? Do you deserve to be entertained by their effort? In my eyes you only do if they willingly give it to you, which only ever happens if you buy or subscribe to a game. reply tuhriel 16 hours agorootparentWhile I also disagree with the 'memefied' version of the quote, the publishers where first to break the social contract, when they removed stuff from libraries which where 'bought'. The wording in the stores is 'buy' not 'rent'. yes they have some clauses in the 20 pages long AGBs, which makes it legally ok, but imho it's still a break of the (social) contract. So, if I 'buy' product A on platform Z and it gets removed without any money returned and they expect me to 'buy' it again on platform Y, I wouldn't have any issues pirating product A Or if I bought product B v 3.0 with an unlimited licence and they suddently stop the licence server tell me I can't use B 3.0 anymore but I can get B 5.0 as a subscripton, I'd be mad as hell. I personally have issues where the publishers suddenly alters the deal afterwards. (and tell you that you should be happy they don't alter it further...) reply ndriscoll 16 hours agorootparentprevThe justification is that there is no social agreement. It's quite clear that the direction is moving away from even the possibility of ownership, and because of obscure reasons you don't care about, the original often becomes unavailable (e.g. music in a game or show being removed, or some aspect being censored, or the controlling entity loses interest in old material, or people lose track of who even holds rights). The law has been corrupted to last so long that if you wanted to share parts of your childhood with your descendants, you'd have to go through gatekeepers until your great great great grandchildren (i.e. never). No one agreed to that any more than they agreed not to use marijuana. They were born into a world where others use violence to coerce them. As a software developer, I'd be quite happy if the law required all source to be put in escrow to receive copyright and then released into the public domain after 10-15 years, along with bans on technological measures to prevent people from modifying software. Likewise with putting masters in escrow for sound/video. Maybe even give them a full generation of protection (~25 years) since their work doesn't become obsolete and unusable like software. But the important thing is to receive a monopoly from society, you should need to give something as your part of the trade (e.g. source materials for the next generation to be able to use and add their own flavor to), and the goal should be to create cultural wealth for future generations, not to keep it from them. We can trade our rights to enable that, but not theirs; our children's rights are not ours to trade. Given that things are so one-sided, I can't imagine begrudging people at all for ignoring the \"agreement\". reply madsbuch 16 hours agorootparentprevThen call it what it is: A lease or rent. reply tranceylc 16 hours agorootparentprevThose hundreds of people do not get commission. reply pyridines 15 hours agorootparentprevHere's my two cents, not directed towards you, but to the discussion in general. If someone wants to lease a product to you, and you would rather they sell it, that doesn't give you the right to pirate it. When the only way to buy a thing is to \"buy\" a misleading lease, piracy becomes more \"permissible\", as in people will blame you less for pirating it, but that doesn't make it morally good. It's obviously a bad thing for the publisher to make it seem like you're buying something, then pull the rug out from under you. It's extremely misleading, maybe it should be illegal. It's definitely a bad thing, even if it's all technically there in the fine print that nobody reads. Pirating the thing in response to this is a situation where two wrongs don't make a right. It's debatable, sure, but it's morally gray at best. No matter how you slice it, you're still depriving the creators/publishers/etc of the money they ask for in return for the thing you want. Maybe you don't like the publisher, maybe you think the platform is evil, but you are still taking what doesn't belong to you. A big reason it's bad is the plain ol' categorical imperative. If everyone did it, there would be no more music, movies, games, etc, because the people making them wouldn't get paid. That's true regardless of how the thing is sold. If you don't like how they're selling it, boycott it. That's fine. It's not like we're talking about essential goods like shelter or food. Most of the time, the discussion is around entertainment. TL;DR Pirating is morally gray at best, but it is not 100% morally good, and I wish people would be honest about that. reply ndriscoll 10 hours agorootparentThe idea that there would be no more creative works without copyright is pretty obviously false for music (so many people enjoy making music that the only way it could disappear is if we evolve to no longer have ears, and even then it will probably exist in the form of deep bass that you can feel), and most likely false even for things like movies and video games. It may be the case that high budget works become extremely rare, but things like short films would continue to exist, and the existence of things like Spring or various total conversion mods show that even video games would continue. It is definitely false for things like business software, where people will pay for professional services to make their business more efficient. On the other hand, there are plenty of interesting creative works (e.g. mashups) that are illegal today, and obviously they're being made without monetization. With new tools we even have people making things like Plankton from Spongebob singing Tool songs[0]. There would still be plenty of creativity in the world without copyright. It's not obvious that we should prioritize the ability to easily fund high budget works over the ability of people to freely share their remixes and mashups, for example.

They are in the money making business, not in the make people happy and still able to play great memories with their kids 20y down the road, occupation. They want to get used to getting paid more overall. It's about the same lately with most products at the grocery store. Big brands know they wouldn't be able to charge more for the same thing, so they charge about the same for less of the same thing. Your 180g 2 bucks chocolate biscuits box is now a 150g. Sometimes they push the envelopes and up the price just a bit. Because they feel they can. And they do. I highly doubt their tactics will work much longer, people learn and are starting to see, and angered by the squeeze. Brands would have to invest even more effort to find new ways to successfully trickery, diminishing even further value put in the product itself. Good on GoG.

Their demo works on my switch, but the paid game can't log into their cloud and is unplayable (my ISP uses a CGNAT, and the IP address was banned). Of course, I bought it from the Nintendo Store, which means no refund (a charge back would get me banned from the Nintendo Store, nuking unrelated purchases). They've definitely trained me to not buy their games.

They said they don't allow refunds, but as a one-time exception they would refund my game. Others online have had this happen too. I think this must be an internal script they must have. You can refund a digital game, but only once ever. You could try doing that for your Ubisoft game and see if it works. Although, the refund came in the form of store money; my card didn't get anything back. reply Fartmancer 17 hours agorootparentI've contacted Nintendo on the phone three times in the past and have received three full refunds for digital purchases and every time they said it was a one time thing, so that part is just a script the phone agent is required to say.

At least if you buy it physically, e.g., at Walmart, you can get a refund, or resell the game if not. It's a less risky purchase if you buy it physically. reply WolfeReader 17 hours agoparentprevThere's three parties at fault here: 1. Your ISP, for blocking access to a game server 2. Ubisoft, for requiring a cloud connection to play a game 3. Nintendo, for not allowing refunds for digital goods. Seems odd to focus your blame on just one of the three. (Instead of blaming anyone, you should get your Switch to talk to a VPN and then enjoy your game.) reply hedora 17 hours agorootparentThe ISP didn't block the game server. Ubisoft blocked the entire ISP, so there are only two parties at fault. Presumably, they also block VPNs. Either way, switching to emulation is cheaper / easier.

Corporations want people to be slaves to external will. It seems like a minor issue, like with the example of paying for a subscription to Xbox’s Game Pass, but what this really says about ownership in the ultimate sense is that you have chosen to believe that you don't own anything. That has a big negative impact on society because it moves us further and further way from whats good for the public when it comes to private ownership for individuals. It's an ideological position that doesn't benefit you, but only benefits organizations that are hijacking free will and ownership.

That means if you are breaking even normally with 1MM of developer costs, the government will tax you as though you made 800k. Because it says 80% of the code they write is a long term investment and therefore needs to be written off over time like a company car or a drill press. For mature companies, it all evens out, because you write off the costs over 5 years and it's just a blip. You can just borrow that money as a corporate bond, creating a real but manageable cost. For growing companies, it's forcing you to set aside money now (in the form of a tax deduction) you won't get back until year 5. So your burn rate is going up. And, unlike a mature company where the cost decreases over time (by year 5 it was a one time blip), that's only to the degree your salary costs have been stable for five years. Every time you scale up engineering staff, it puts you more in the hole for another five years. reply adrr 8 hours agorootparentIt’s not five years. It’s whatever the useful lifespan of the software. Web dev we usually did 2 years since that was the average lifespan of a web page. For public companies, they are incentivized to amortize over longer period because it hides expenses and can boost earnings that boosts stock price. reply rgbrenner 6 hours agorootparentTCJA actually says 5 years for domestic research and 15 for foreign. reply moron4hire 7 hours agorootparentprev> 26 US Code Section 174, paragraph D - Treatment upon disposition, retirement, or abandonment If any property with respect to which specified research or experimental expenditures are paid or incurred is disposed, retired, or abandoned during the period during which such expenditures are allowed as an amortization deduction under this section, no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such expenditures on account of such disposition, retirement, or abandonment and such amortization deduction shall continue with respect to such expenditures. reply rgbrenner 6 hours agorootparentThis means something different than adrr is asking about. The IRS has depreciation schedules for different asset classes. For example, trucks are 5 years; real estate is 39 years; but you can under some circumstances use an Alternative Depreciation Schedule (ADS).. the depreciation schedule should match the usable lifetime of the asset. But if the typical lifetime is 5 years, but you use an ADS of 2 years... you are not disposing or abandoning the asset if you keep it for 2 years. 2 years is the expected life time of the asset, and at the end of year 2, the asset has a value of $0. If you depreciate over 5 years, but then on year 2 decide you don't need the asset anymore, then you'll dispose of it. The asset is valued at 3/5ths of the original price. The paragraph you're quoting applies to this scenario. ADS doesn't apply here though, because TCJA requires 5 years for domestic and 15 years for foreign research. reply adrr 6 hours agorootparentprevI don’t get.

It's a shitty change, one hundred percent, and I'm glad to see folks like Wyden trying to unwind it. At the same time, I've owned small software businesses before, and I've started/not started new ones based on whether I thought it would work out. Where I am unclear is what sorts of business plans, on day zero, would be suddenly nonviable when it was viable before, so suddenly overwhelmingly difficult, as to cause such discouragement. Is there a good chance of recategorization pushing a very marginal business off the cliff? Sure--that Twitter thread, where there are enough details to read in, has a lot of examples of marginal businesses having trouble (mostly because of not being able to plan in the change, which really sucks). But you don't have that on day zero, and going in with the aim to be that very marginal business is probably not the best of ideas. It's not a day-zero problem, and I am struggling to see where a small business with a business plan that was previously worth executing on is now not worth it because of this change. reply jandrewrogers 11 hours agorootparentIt fundamentally changes the cost structure and investment risk profile of business plans without changing anything about the intrinsic economics of the business by requiring much more capital to achieve the same outcome. A perfectly reasonable business plan can suddenly become non-viable if there is a huge new overhead to doing business. Suddenly needing to pay $1M to the IRS on \"profit\" for a company that is barely making money is rather large change to the financial assumptions that make the business viable. Affected small businesses suddenly need to increase revenue or cut costs by 20% just to keep their business solvent. Most small businesses do not have the structural elasticity or capital reserves to absorb that, nor do many business plans. In the very long term it notionally all evens out but most small businesses don't survive that long and these large new costs of doing business will reduce the survival rate even further. reply pcai 11 hours agorootparentprevimagine in year 1 you grossed 100k, spent 200k on salaries, but the new irs rules say you owe taxes on 60k of profits.

For a clearer picture on this it’s helpful to include the actual tax amount. With a corporate rate of 21%, the tax would be about $12K. Now that’s not zero, but it better shows the actual cost born in year one under this plan. The later years are important as well. As profits continue to flow in, the rest of the cost can be deducted from it. So it doesn’t disappear. Though you do lose a bit from the nature of present nominal being inherently worth more than future nominal amount. With todays higher rates, that’s an even larger factor. reply eropple 7 hours agorootparentRight, this is exactly why I'm confused about the all-is-lost framing of this. $12K isn't nothing. It's a pretty shitty thing to have drop on you and I think it should revert. But if you're starting a software business that isn't a solo shop--so you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll--I would expect a $12K difference to not be the needle-mover between \"start a business\" and \"don't\"; we're not talking a hot dog stand here. reply pcai 7 hours agorootparentI understand where you’re coming from but the thing to understand is: most startups are incredibly marginal to begin with. If you tilt the field such that the entire distribution is now ~5-6% lower expected value for any given outcome, you can easily wipe out 80%+ of the startups that might’ve been “worth trying” but don’t make any sense now on a risk-adjusted basis.

Here’s a simplified example of this works: Let’s say you’re a four person software dev startup. Everybody is making, say, $125K to get by. That’s $500K in salary expense which normally you can write off as expenses against revenue/funding. For this example, let’s say somehow you also generated $500K in revenue/funding, i.e. you just broke even. Currently, you would (of course) owe zero taxes. Under the new tax rules, you couldn’t write off those R&D salaries as expenses, only amortize them over 5 years. That is, your salary expenses for this year is only ~ $100K, and this you made a $400K ‘profit’ (!!) on which you owe taxes ($100K). reply matsemann 14 hours agoparentI don't get it. How is this not just $500k salary? How is it R&D? reply PeterisP 11 hours agorootparentIt is salary, but it goes not into operational expense (that applies directly creating the things you sell right away) but into building a capital asset that helps you generate future revenue and can depreciate over a number of years.

In this case you \"just\" need another $100k in revenue. After all, you are throwing out theoretical revenue numbers anyway. So it just moves the needle somewhat for you to still break even. You could game it just a little if there's revenue at end of year that you can book in the following quarter instead -- companies do the reverse of this all the time. Perhaps you can shift some of the expenses as well. Note that in year 2, you get 20% of the year 2 salary expense, plus 20% from year 1. So the impact is less. By year 5 you are \"caught up\". Indeed the first years are harder. reply pcai 11 hours agorootparentThis is wrong because you are speaking on an accrual basis but you have to consider cash. The cash (salaries and taxes) is paid out in year 1 regardless of what year you try to book it in your p&l statements reply BenFranklin100 14 hours agorootparentprevCompanies don’t do “this all the time”. In your hypothetical example, you”d have to essentially forge the quarterly 941 reports to shift the salary R&D expenses. Also ‘gaming’ which quarter revenue occurred is technically tax fraud, certainly if one is on an accrual basis. And it doesn’t mean one is ‘caught up’ by year five.

I remember awhile back when I was visiting Ireland one of the tours mentioned that modern whiskey and beer in Ireland came about because of taxes. I wish I could remember more details but the story went along the lines of each time a new tax on some type of alcohol happened the producers would reclassify their beverage or change the method which produced it to avoid the new taxes. I assume this will be the same in the US, software R&D is now some other title with less taxes. When the small companies do it the IRS isn’t going to care but then big ones will do it and the tax law cat and mouse game will continue. reply kevindamm 10 hours agorootparentThe difficulty with this is that §174 counts \"all such costs incident to the development or improvement of a product.\" This makes it hard for you to reclassify the researcher role as any kind of software development role because software development is still R&D. The fact that it includes payments to third parties for R&D also means you can't even just split your software dev house into a nonprofit or something. What can you do? Claim prompting an LLM is not software development even if it produces code? It's just search then, right? reply tchock23 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, that's what I'm guessing many smaller companies will do. Does the developer talk to customers or do customer success/support? Great, they are now \"Sales Engineers\" for tax purposes.

Essentially, the default tax treatment of expenses is basically to take the expense same as you would treat it under GAAP, but some people (I am one of them BTW) think that we should put a finger on the scales for the case of legitimate R&D. Now though I happen to think accelerating it is a good idea, everybody thinks their particular loophole is a good idea. To say that removing the special treatment is a policy mistake is a reasonable position to take, though opponents have a reasonable position as well (as I said I'm in favor of the special benefit). But to call this change unfair is, IMHO, unreasonable. It's also bogus to plead ignorance as the twitter poster did: \"as they'd never had to amortize software development before, and didn't think of the work they do as R&D.\" Their accountants sure did, because otherwise it would not have qualified for the R&D exemption. And their accountant would have to tell them what to do to make it qualify. reply cj 8 hours agoparentI don’t understand why businesses can’t just say that their engineering department is a cost center (COGS) instead of classifying engineer salaries as R&D expenditures. I guess one downside would be not qualifying for the R&D tax credit. The majority of software engineering is the equivalent of janitorial work… keeping servers online, fixing bugs, maintaining services, upgrading and refactoring code, etc. It’s difficult for me to tell how much of this issue is just people making a fuss about the literal interpretation of the tax code compared to how it will, in practice, impact their business. Nearly all accountants try to operate in the gray, in that accountants know how to tweak the numbers just enough to not get in big trouble with the IRS but enough that the business can slide through various loopholes.

The point I was making is that software engineers don’t need to be classified as R&D. Why can’t a company lump engineers in the same category as technical support? (Which doesn’t need to be amortized) reply gumby 7 hours agorootparentBefore the 2017 change you could and should have if they were not engaged in actual R&D. But people used to lump them into R&D anyway because of the preferential tax treatment (you also used to get special treatment for NOL, which you can't any more). Software development doesn't generally follow GAAP's model because unless you're IBM or Oracle the same people sometimes fix bugs and sometimes develop new features. The GAAP rules aren't insane: if your company buys a HQ building it's assumed to last 40 years. And since each year you \"get some value\" (e.g. you don't pay rent to someone else) you split the value of that purchase over 40 years. If you buy a computer you amortize it over 3 years because you're likely to \"use it up\" and replace it after that. And so if you're a car mfr you might have some people developing a new automatic transmission. You expect to then put those things into new cars for some time to come. So GAAP says the R&D that went into the new transmission is amortized while the cost of making one and sticking it into a car you sell is indeed COGS. If you're an early stage pharma startup almost all you do is R&D for quite a long time. For a software startup you can say the same thing: even if you ship your MVP, every bug you fix is turning it into the \"real thing\" (unlike Oracle, above, who can split maintenance and development into two buckets). So I favor accelerated recognition of R&D costs for startups. Not sure about established companies. reply cj 7 hours agorootparentI own a company with millions in payroll expense. All of payroll is lumped into 1 line item when submitted to the IRS. (I’m only somewhat simplifying for sake of argument) We would have to go out of our way to split out R&D.

In other words, I’ll be taxed as if I made $140k of profit, despite me not having any actual money left over. You can see how if this was 5 years, then I could deduct 1/5 and I would be taxed on $120k profit, which is still bad, but not nearly as bad. reply pcthrowaway 11 hours agorootparentI don't think it will stop foreign hiring for R&D, since the cost differential is often greater than the tax obligation would be. E.g. if you pay $150K for local research, you expense $15K (10%) the first year (and 30K the subsequent year). You pay taxes on $135K of 'profit'. Let's say that's $45K (I have no idea what's realistic here. Alternately you pay $130K for a dev from Canada, expense $4,333 (1/30) the first year, and pay tax on the remaining 'profit' of $125,666.

The easy example is a car company, like Ford. If they buy a car factory, that is a capital asset, and the cost needs to be amortized over x years. If they decide to instead BUILD a car factory...they still end up with a capital asset, and the costs (including wages) need to be amortized over x years. In most cases this is what companies want - they'll have revenues over x years and matching costs over x years is generally better for everyone. reply brianwawok 19 hours agorootparentprevThis isn’t like a loan where the longer the term the smaller the payments. It’s the reverse. You essentially pay taxes now on income, and can’t deduct costs for 5 or 15 years. So it’s kind of like pre-paying taxes and not getting the money back for 5/15 years. Say that you need to go borrow cash to cover the shortfall. Is it cheaper to borrow money for 5 or 15 years? reply phkahler 17 hours agorootparentHah I'm still trying to understand how software developer pay should be a deduction at all. reply alwa 17 hours agorootparentAs far as I understand it, it’s normal to deduct most all kinds of payroll as an operating expense, and historically that’s included software developers too. The way it was explained to me, the tax man gets his bite when the people receiving the paychecks pay their own income taxes. The recent changes mean you can still do that for most staff EXCEPT developers, even if the devs are doing operational work instead of work that feels more conventionally like R&D. So you have to come up with a bundle of cash now to pay tax on most of the developers’ salaries, even though they’ll give it back to you over 5-15 years. Essentially you making a free loan to the government for a decade or whatever, except the money’s probably not free to you. Of course I can think of situations where the development effort really was more R&D than operational, and the revenue stream matched: the first few years operated at a loss already, and the deductions might have more been useful in 5 years when the revenues were flowing in from a mature product.

You need to have contributed for at least a year in the past 2 years before you're eligible.

Here in Virginia, the max, regardless of how much you made, is $378/wk, for a max of 12 weeks. You can't claim it if you're also receiving a severance, and you also have to record at least 4 job applications each week, but the documentation required needs to include information like the hiring manager's full contact information, which usually means the company needs to have replied to your application within that week. I got laid off back at the end of April last year. I got a month of severance, so I couldn't claim UC in May. In June, I was able to do some online sleuthing to figure it out for a few applications out of the dozens I was making in a week, but there were some weeks I wasn't able to scrounge together even 4. I ended up with 2 UC checks for a total of $756 gross (yes, had to pay taxes on it). I don't remember exactly how much, but I do remember I calculated it was less than 20% my original take home pay for a month. Luckily, by the end of June I had a good line on a job and started in July. I got lucky that we could bridge a month of basically \"no\" income from me.

However, it's very different from European companies where these processes are (often) driven by laws. In the US there are no employee protection laws (aside from protected classes) so even if the company has a rigorous internal process, they could at any second override it if someone high up says so and you'll be fired in the blink of an eye. reply brianwawok 19 hours agorootparentprevOwn a small startup in US.

My understanding was that instead of deducting the costs of paying software devs the year it happened, it will be spread over 5 years. Which leads to a bigger tax bill now, and benefits bigger companies with deeper pockets as opposed to smaller businesses which have to raise moneny to pay taxes (or lower costs, potentially lower hiring).

What about every new hire? That's the part I don't understand. It seems to discourage companies from increasing their headcount. Also, what happens when an employee leaves after 2 years? The company paid 2 years of salary but expensed only 35% of year 1 and 15% of year 2. Update: Now thinking about it, it doesn't matter if an employee leaves, since the company will expense their salary portions that they haven't expensed yet in their future tax bills. reply the_mitsuhiko 17 hours agorootparentYou already have such amortizations for a lot of things. In some cases this even gives you possibilities to improve your tax burden. It just means that you cannot deduct it all in one year. If you downsize a company to zero employees you still get to subtract salaries for a few more years against your profits. It will set different incentives wiring wise and I’m not convinced they are good ones, but from this rule some people will benefit so they might fight the rollback. reply wait_a_minute 10 hours agorootparentWould this cause more intentional hiring? In other words, since everyone's already 1/5th into it this means that anyone who was hired in the last year since all those layoffs was hired intentionally with more of an expectation of betting on them for the longer term. reply dang 15 hours agoprevRelated.

But if the U.S. is anything like Canada, you can pay yourself a much lower salary, and then pay yourself through dividends as well. reply jdksmdbtbdnmsm 11 hours agoprevWhy would I be on the side of someone willing to go through all this trouble just to avoid paying American wages?

Let's just say I started a company last year. I sell software and made $100k revenue this year. I hired someone for $100k to help build that software. I have zero dollars left in the bank at the end of the year. According to 174 I can only amortize that $100k over 5 years, not all at once. So now I have to pay taxes on $80k profit. I have no money in my bank account, how can I pay any taxes at all? It's not like I'm going to fire my engineer, he does feature and maintenance work. Let's say that next year my business stays the same. 100k in 100k out. I still have no money in the bank and have to pay taxes on $80k profit, again? What??

This was done under the presumption that Congress would never actually let something so insane and detrimental to American innovation and competitiveness go into effect, and would obviously roll it back before 2022.

The risks of that are massive, especially in a setting that is more prone to conflict as of late. This would increase the risks of losing your IP entirely. If ownership and development move overseas, then you'd be giving what you have away to someone else to entrust them with the entire thing to avoid paying a bit of tax. Software has its own supply chain too, and if you lose your product or platform due to doing this then that's going to be too bad...USA protections means USA presence and USA taxes. reply Steven-Clarke 8 hours agorootparentTL;DR: Engaging with decentralized organizations and open-source communities allows access to global talent and diverse perspectives, fostering innovation and resilience. This approach, focusing on collaboration over ownership, offers potential benefits in R&D and innovation, outweighing traditional models that prioritize geographical and IP constraints. 1. Global Talent and Diverse Perspectives: DAOs and open-source projects, by their nature, often operate without geographical boundaries. This allows them to hire and collaborate with talent from all over the world, bringing in diverse perspectives and expertise that can be crucial for R&D and innovation. The traditional model of keeping all operations within a single country might limit access to this global talent pool. 2. Decentralization as a Strength: Decentralized structures can offer resilience and flexibility. In a world where geopolitical tensions and conflicts can disrupt traditional business operations, a decentralized model, with no single point of failure or control, might actually reduce certain risks. Intellectual property, in this case, isn't concentrated in one jurisdiction but is part of a global network, which could mitigate the risk of loss due to regional conflicts or regulatory changes. 3. Innovation and Experimentation: The open-source and DAO model is fundamentally about experimentation and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology and organizational structures. By embracing these models, companies can participate in cutting-edge developments and explore new ways of working that might not be possible within the confines of traditional corporate structures. 4. Intellectual Property Considerations: While there are legitimate concerns about IP protection, decentralized and open-source models often operate on a different paradigm regarding IP. The focus is less on ownership and more on collaboration, community, and building upon shared knowledge. In many cases, the value generated isn't from the IP itself but from the community and ecosystem that develops around it. 5. Regulatory and Tax Implications: It's important to acknowledge that regulatory and tax environments are significant considerations. However, for some organizations, the benefits of global collaboration and access to decentralized structures might outweigh the simplicity of operating within a single jurisdiction. example/ Optimism $100 Million for Developers - Announcing RetroPGF Round 3 Recipients https://optimism.mirror.xyz/37Bgum6MfTJWDuE41CH9RXSH5KBm_RCL... reply wait_a_minute 7 hours agorootparentI'm a fan of DAOs for some things, but giving the legal ownership of the IP and the keys to running the entire platform to a subsidiary is not the same conversation as \"here's how DAOs work.\" reply WalterBright 8 hours agoprevTaxing a startup on non-existent \"profit\" is a really bad idea. reply dboreham 7 hours agoparentYou have to have income in order to be taxed. So there is no taxing non-existent profit. There has to be actual profit. What people must be complaining about is that they can't take all the income from product X in year Y and say it was spent on developing product X so no profit was made. Instead they'd need to have spent that income on marketing supporting and maintaining that product. Then they'd be making zero profit and no tax owed. reply Gormo 7 hours agorootparentIf you paid 100k in salaries and earned 100k in revenue, then you broke even, and no actual profit was made. Under the rules being discussed here, however, the 100k you spent in salaries has to be amortized over five years, meaning that even though you actually spent 100k this year, only 20k is deductible from this year's taxes. The IRS then taxes you on the 80k of \"profit\" you made, which doesn't actually exist, so you don't have the funds to pay the taxes, and your business becomes insolvent. This is absolutely about taxes being charged against non-existent profit. reply jandrewrogers 7 hours agorootparentprev> You have to have income in order to be taxed. That “income” is being legislated into existence by disallowing the deduction of customary primary operating costs that are allowed in any other business. In effect, it becomes a tax on revenue in the early years of a software company. Taxes tied to revenue are notorious for creating unhealthy and perverse market incentives, which is why very few jurisdictions use them. Many small software businesses are now in the position of potentially literally paying more income tax to the IRS than the profit + asset value over the entire life of the business. It is pretty messed up to make small business owners pay “income” taxes out of their own pocket in the absence of offsetting profit. It is yet another indefensible and unique perversion of reasonable policy under US tax authority. reply WalterBright 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you spent $100k on salaries and generated $60k of revenue, you'll owe tax but you lost $40k. reply ultra_nick 11 hours agoprevNow my managers have even more reason to rush out broken \"features\" and use bugs to \"fix\" them later. reply exabrial 18 hours agoprevWe need temporary relief, immediately.

Then we don’t have to flog small businesses to death to feed the massively inefficient and wasteful machine!? reply PaulDavisThe1st 16 hours agoparentThese changes came about as part of the Trump administration & Republican efforts to reduce taxation. Because you can't trivially just cut taxes (as was done in 2017) without showing how you will either make up the missing revenue or reduce spending, they threw in a time-deferred measure - the new Section 174 that \"demonstrated\" how the tax cuts in 2017 would be paid for in the future. It was all sleight of hand, but what's new? Republicans have been talking about shrinking the size of the federal government for decades. They routinely fail to come up with substantive cuts in spending that would not set off a disaster for them at the polls, or for the country economically, or both. There is this perception that the federal is full of wasteful spending, but this perception is false (there is waste, it's not a large percentage of the huge overall federal budget). This means that to actually cut the revenue needed will require truly substantive cuts to the services provided and performed by the federal government. Maybe you could be more successful at proposing what those cuts would be than any Republican has for 50 years, but it seems unlikely. reply thinkerswell 13 hours agorootparentWhat the recent Argentinian president had proposed for his country would be a good start for the US reply PaulDavisThe1st 12 hours agorootparentUS voters have consistently rejected such policies for nearly a century, if not longer.

Higher taxes on the money printing ventures (Google ads etc.), lower taxes on start-ups and companies developing new products. That would be besides all of the other benefits like preventing profit-shifting. Maybe if Silicon Valley wasn't so intensely ideological it would have backed the right horse when it came to tax policy. I have very little sympathy here because I think most software developer salaries really are 'development', the problem isn't the classification of developer salaries, it's that the current corporation tax is dumb. reply paulmendoza 9 hours agoparentSection 174 software changes was designed to punish blue states in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy so their budget would balance. reply baazaa 7 hours agorootparentYes and I'm talking about the original 2016 house-republican DBCFT proposal which would have eliminated tax on investment in general. Section 174 is a hack to fix a moronic tax that would have been replaced if not for the left. There shouldn't be a section 174 to even amend. And as I said, software development clearly is development, the change makes perfect sense. If you want R&D to be taxed (even with deductions which get amortized), and you work in R&D, you don't get to whinge when a loophole gets closed so you get taxed like other R&D expenses.

So why just software and not all fields that produce durable intellectual property? reply mindslight 6 hours agoparentThat's a fantastic point! Also it made me think about the converse, which might be interesting - libre software. Assuming a company has no plans of dual-licensing, ownership of the actual copyright of libre software is independent of how that software gets used to generate income. Anyone else could come along and use a copy of the software to create a business without any license payments to the owner. Or alternatively the original company could donate said software to a nonprofit steward (eg FSF or Apache) and be in a similar position. So accounting wise, it would seem that amounts spent on developing libre software could be more appropriately classified along with things like recruiting, advertising expenses, or even charitable donations, rather than the creation of an income-producing asset. Setting up that software to work on the company's production infrastructure would still be a development expense requiring amortization.

There are two possible arguments here to try, and I have only ever seen people lobbying against this change use the one, less persuasive argument. That argument is what I will call the \"incentives\" argument: that change in the rule provides bad incentives against doing R&D. This argument goes along the lines of \"this will cost jobs for R&D workers\" or \"this will reduce the competitiveness of the US.\" The other possible argument (that I have not seen cited) is that \"R&D\" work can be operational, and that forcing capitalization of R&D expenses is a bad accounting practice. This Twitter thread only argues the former. The glaring problem with the incentives argument is that it gives up the point that the ability to operationalize R&D work is a subsidy for technology and software companies. This is equivalent to asking for a subsidy at a time when startups can pull $100 million with no product and other technology companies are reaping record profits. That is not a particularly persuasive argument, and it triggers bad emotional reactions from people. If not for the SBIR companies getting absolutely shafted, the responses to this argument I have seen from non-tech people range from \"fuck you\" to \"deal with it.\" The accounting argument is boring and sort of technical, but also a lot harder to argue against and doesn't trigger a negative emotional reaction. All of the people making the rules will understand it, and the IRS could even make the clarification on what is and isn't \"R&D\" on an accounting basis without an act of congress. They have kind of done this, but have not been pushed nearly far enough. reply tracerbulletx 17 hours agoparentHaving been an accountant early in my career before becoming a software developer, I'm amazed that this isn't the primary argument. reply pclmulqdq 16 hours agorootparentI (shamefully) have an MBA, and I learned a lot about accounting during that process.

    "commentBody": "Amazon has taken down the Sad Bastard Cookbook (wandering.shop)323 points by Kye 22 hours agohidepastfavorite172 comments zillanovikov 19 hours agoZilla here (one of the Sad Bastard Cookbook authors). Thanks so much for your support ... I'm lowkey dropping \"front page of Hacker News\" when I talk to Amazon Service reps now, in the vague hope they have any power to actually help me. I think I've reached at least one real person, but in the days of AI voice chat, who can tell? Many of you asked why we use Amazon as the exclusive printer/distributor of the print edition. Variations of this happened to basically every self-pub author I've met, so why didn't I use another platform? 1) Reach. As Ma8ee pointed out, there's literally dozens of people buying books online but not on Amazon. If I want readers to find it, I need to be on Amazon. Bonus, one of the most important controlling factors in new people finding your book is whether the Amazon promo algorithim suggests the book to them, so any sale off Amazon doesn't contribute to building an avalanche. The game's rigged, but it's the only game in town. 2) Money/quality. Last time I checked (few years back, things might have changed), Draft2Digital print books were bad quality. Ingram print books are decent quality but their calculation for printing fees and royalties means they usually don't pay out at nearly the same rate. I've not compared directly for the Cookbook, but for Instant Classic, it's the difference between making a couple dollars or a couple cents. We did it for Instant Classic as a service for people who despise Amazon, but the royalties from the Cookbook are a substantial factor in \"eating\" and \"making rent\" for one of the Cookbook team, so there's a limit to how much I want to give away the print edition of the Cookbook. Especially if \"giving it away\" involves the reader paying Ingram, just not us. If anyone knows a print-on-demand distributor who pays out enough in royalties for authors to make money, please respond to this. 3) Distribution. We're small fry self-pub, without a big publishing house behind us. I've looked around for places which will take us on self-pub books and distribute them, and the options are pretty limited. I'm convinced we'd sell in brick-and-mortar stores, but that's typically not an option for self-pub unless you approach the owner of an independent bookshop on an individual basis. (We approached a couple proper distributors who accept query letters from non-traditionally published books, but they focused on specific genres and we weren't the right fit.) Basically, if you're not traditionally published, you're looking at Amazon, Ingram, or Draft2Digital to print and distribute your books. If anyone knows of other printer/distributors which take self-pub books, PLEASE tell me. ETA: people are informing me that Ingram can make money, and that Lulu exists. I am investigating. reply wishfish 16 hours agoparentI've had good luck with Lulu. My experience was short-runs. I sometimes like to make custom notebooks for myself and friends. But the quality was good. Lulu will print spiral fold flat editions. Might come in handy for a cookbook. I've also had good luck with Blurb. They do high quality photobooks. Which isn't what you're selling, but I'm mentioning them because they will offer your book for sale, print-on-demand, via their site. And wouldn't be surprised if they have a way of selling via Amazon. They wouldn't be a bad choice if you wanted to sell a $50+ coffee table edition of your cookbook. Or a bit lower for a paperback edition. reply zillanovikov 16 hours agorootparentOh thank you, I'll look into that! reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentI'll second both LuLu and Blurb for photo books though it's been quite a while since I used either.

Among the numerous frustrations that publishers and sellers report when dealing with Amazon, automated lockouts are near the top of the list. Inability to get a clear explanation or knowledgeable human support are close behind. I always tell other publishers that Amazon's seller tech is like a rickety roller coaster with lots of kludged together components - built to go fast, but with lots of loose bits that rattle and sometimes cause the system to fail. Technology glitches, bad UI design, poor communication, and complex policy requirements lead to a huge support burden. Even if you can get a good Amazon support agent, they are not always able to diagnose certain problems, let alone provide a fix. The parts of the company facing small publishers and third-party sellers is extremely siloed, which makes things even worse for sellers trying to get through complex issues touching multiple services. Reporting something like \"I can't get Amazon Advertising to connect with my KDP account\" can lead to runarounds that require multiple tickets or are never solved. Regarding distribution: I don't use a distributor owing to the lead time required and the huge commissions involved, but a few I know work with IPG (https://www.ipgbook.com/). If you have a track record of sales, that can open the door to distribution and potentially help get through the Amazon problems you are experiencing as they have direct contacts with back-end Amazon staff. reply Aloha 12 hours agoparentprevHad I known bout this book before it got removed, I would have bought a copy. reply perihelions 22 hours agoprevAlso available here, https://nightbeatseu.ca/works/the-sad-bastard-cookbook/ https://traumbooks.itch.io/the-sad-bastard-cookbook - \"We made it legal with Creative Commons (4.0 attribution non-commercial), but if you get a thrill from breaking the law, you can pretend it’s not.\" reply coolandsmartrr 21 hours agoparentI love the copyright description.

Core Ingredients & Supplies: - Mason jar or other heatproof receptacle. - Boiling water. - The only requirement here is rice noodles. Why? Because they cook fast. Preparation: - Put all ingredients in the jar. - Boil some water. - Pour into jar to cover ingredients. - Shake it up a bit (not right away, otherwise you'll burn your hands and get more depressed). - Let it sit for a few minutes. - Enjoy??? Variations: - Remember those takeout packets of hot sauce and soy sauce? This is a good time to use them. - Frozen or fresh vegetables. Wilted is absolutely fine here. International readers may call them \"wilty\" vegetables. Reader, you are now bilingual. - Any kind of spices. We particularly suggest garlic or ginger powder, but seriously, anything will work. - If you have tofu or some other protein to use, go for it. reply fsckboy 17 hours agorootparentput boiling water in a jar and then shake it up? Ouch! when you agitate hot water, it evaporates a lot faster, bringing the pressure in the jar to great heights.

If you've used it for any amount of time you'll know this. Sure, it's a great time-saver, and if you use it wisely it can remove a lot of tedium. But if you're a developer, one thing you'll know is that it cannot replace developers. You still need to structure your whole project yourself, figure out what the data schema needs to look like, and direct the AI tool to do small sections of the work. And you should be ready to sanity check and debug anything it spits out. Similarly with AI image stuff, if you have a bunch of old black & white photos that were taken on a shitty camera in the 1940s, you can get it to upscale, repair, clean and colourize. But if any living person knows any of the subjects in the photographs, be ready for them to laugh their heads off (or get extremely angry) that grandpappy's eyes are not grandpappy's eyes, that they have lost all family resemblance and look more like expertly stuck-on googly eye stickers. Also the colour palettes are wrong for the time, their teeth get magically straightened, their fob-watch chain gets turned into a rope etc. Some of these un-guided AI effects are as bad as their non-AI counterparts, like Affinity Photo's \"magic inpainting\" that's supposed to let you easily paint out unwanted items in a photo. They look like magic when removing a seagull from a cloudless sky, but they'll make an absolute hames out of anything remotely complex. For example, removing a person from a busy street. Instead of inventing some plausible background to replace them with, it'll just auto-clone their surroundings into the vacuum so you end up with very obviously duplicated features (door handles, street signs etc). This is something that you would never do as a photography professional. So can it save you a bunch of time? Sometimes. Can you rely on it to work without a human in the loop? You're havin' a laugh! Something that all AI tools need to build in is the ability to override their learned data and to curb their enthusiasm for inventing completely wrong detail that was never there. While AI has gotten impressive, I wouldn't trust it to do anything remotely important without a competent human driving it. The biggest problem with AI is that companies that adopt it think that they can fire a bunch of staff and let AI tools run amok. reply wegfawefgawefg 19 hours agorootparentIt's blunt if youre using it for dumb shit in the same way that a hammer is a blunt instrument if used to break peoples stuff.

They tick all the boxes in a curriculum and demonstrate a basic grasp on syntax, but they're hot garbage. Your first encounter with an editor as a professional or advanced hobbyist burns that away and reveals the foundation of your true form as a writer. LLMs are in desperate need of something that bridges that gap if they're to do anything more than help people cheat in college and annoy editors. At least for the purpose of producing writing for use.

You are not required to disclose AI-assisted content. https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200672390 I personally know someone who published about a dozen AI-generated Kindle books before being notified of this policy, and none of it has been removed. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentThat policy still seems clear as mud if you're using, say, generative AI within Photoshop to help design components of a cover design. I'm also not sure how that's really different from using CC or public domain imagery as part of a design. \"AI-generated: We define AI-generated content as text, images, or translations created by an AI-based tool. If you used an AI-based tool to create the actual content (whether text, images, or translations), it is considered \"AI-generated,\" even if you applied substantial edits afterwards.\" My reading of that is that, if you use AI to create any image even in part, that's AI generated. reply SoftTalker 11 hours agorootparentprevWTF is the difference between AI-generated and AI-assisted.

In order to do this, we need to submit a bunch of screenshots, preview videos, and text. The images and videos, we hand-crafted. A lot of folks automate this, but I think that it's better to hand-craft, if possible, because we need to ensure that specific contexts and whatnot are reflected, and that user privacy is respected. For the text, we developed a fairly dry blurb, and then I asked ChatGPT4 to rewrite. I hit \"refresh\" a few times, and wrote up a text document with the results, and shared that with the team. We then picked the parts we wanted, and wrote some of our own. None of the ChatGPT-generated summaries was sufficient, on its own merits. We had to cut-and-paste (sometimes changing the order, and changing to make sure that there was consistency), and add our own content, as well. reply jruohonen 22 hours agoparentprevThat would be my guess too.

You corrected the word \"whitelist\", not \"blacklist\". Ok, here's where I think we are. Correct me if I'm wrong. \"whitewashing\" is ok, because its etymology has nothing to do with race.

Your zealotry in demanding that I change my speech is overbearing and likely damaging to your cause. I also notice you’ve twice called other posters cowards, asserted that another should “educate themselves”, and said that you don’t have time for people who “aren’t interested in making the world a better place”, defined as such, of course, by you. Not only are you deciding for others how they should be thinking and speaking, you’re also aggressive about it. I’d encourage you to re-assess your authoritarian attitude.

I guess I still figure small things we can do to help redress the balance in terms of celebrating (rather than disparaging) blackness are worthwhile. reply perihelions 18 hours agorootparentprev- \"Blacklist/whitelist DO reinforce the notion that black = bad and white = good\" I'll bite. What's wrong with perpetuating the notion that the color black is evil and ruinous? Would humanity be kinder if we'd mourn our dead wearing colors other than black? (Would it be prosocial to start educating people about this issue at funerals?) Surely that's a much bigger concern than obscure jargon usage like \"blacklist\". If (accepting the premise for discussion) semantic overloading the word \"black\" actually harms people, then, I think associating black with people literally-dying should harm far more people, more seriously, than server configuration files. If we're serious about this—if we mean what we say—we should prioritize the high-emotional-impact stuff, because that's logically where the heaviest sociological damage comes from. Death, disease, devils—all these classic associations. Not some anodyne computer pass/deny lists. Let's start talking White Sabbaths, and Light Satanic Mills. (I think I agree with the intention behind these kinds of language ideas; I just don't think they can lead anywhere constructive). reply lwhi 17 hours agorootparentI appreciate your line of thinking. Yes some societies celebrate death and wear bright colours to 'mourn'. And yes, there are benefits associated. As to whether this is more or less of a concern than language usage; I'd argue the biggest problem with society today is absolutism. More than one thing can be—and usually is—true at any one time. We rarely need to decide one or other .. and using this as a line of argument doesn't amount to much. I think there's a simple way these language ideas can benefit society. Allowing young people with darker skin to grow up in a society that celebrates, rather than disparages blackness. reply perihelions 17 hours agorootparent- \"Allowing young people with darker skin to grow up in a society that celebrates, rather than disparages blackness.\" The link you're making here is something I don't understand. If I'm black, and I'm at a funeral and everyone is wearing the color black, am I being disparaged? Or if I'm reading some code and the comment's talking about \"blacklists\"? Is that subjectively disparaging? Is that something I'd even notice at all, consciously or not? I'm unreasonably confident the answer is a universal \"no\". For the same reason that as I'm writing this HN comment, at no point has imagery of mothers and fathers crossed my mind—even though the word \"parent\" is right there in the commenting toolbar*. Is it different for other people? *( parentcontexteditdelete, etc.) reply lwhi 17 hours agorootparentI don't think wearing black at funeral is signalling anything other than respect? reply malermeister 17 hours agorootparentprevThe term blacklist comes from the term black book, which originated in the 1400s as a reference to \"a list of people who had committed crimes or fallen out of favor with leaders\". It is called that because King Henry VIII used a literal black book. Not everything is about skin color. Not everything is about American racial dynamics.

Put yourself in the position of a parent having to explain to your child why their skin colour is associated with negatives throughout their language. How would you go about explaining this?

Terms like \"white lie\", \"white label\", \"white flag\", \"white whale\", \"whiteout\", \"blackmail\", \"black ice\", \"Black Friday\", \"black humour\", \"blackout\", \"in the black\".

However, most sellers have a hostile attitude towards their own customers, whether the seller is a business or individual. They won't make a decent webpage, they won't make an acceptable and smooth buying experience, and they won't match price or give a better price than the platforms. So, naturally customers will go to who they trust. reply ryandrake 17 hours agorootparentExactly--as a customer, I would love to buy elsewhere! Amazon is such a shitty company and I trust their listings so little, that they are the store of last resort for me. It would be super awesome if when I wanted a product, I could just... go the the manufacturer's web site and buy it. And there should be no mark-up because there is no middle-men. Instead of that, one of these usually happens: 1. The manufacturer doesn't sell its own products! This is usually the case. Often they will helpfully list \"dealers\" where you can go find it (which all charge more than Amazon). 2. The manufacturer sells the product but their purchase and checkout experience is brutal (and/or it doesn't accept my desired form of payment) and I drop out of the funnel in frustration. 3. The manufacturer sells the product but it is inexplicably 25-50% more than Amazon and 50%-100% more than used on eBay. They might say they dislike Amazon but they seem to be doing everything they can to push their customers to them. reply dageshi 22 hours agoparentprevAll the customers are there and the company has perhaps spent more time than any other figuring out how to sell books to people.

I really did like going into town to do various shopping, in particular bookstore (new and used) browsing, once or twice a month.

Which isn't true if you can reasonably expect the product to last longer (if it is an expensive one). In my case the battery was damaged due to bogus firmware update and they refused to deal with it, citing warranty with seller is exhausted (untrue). They said I should go to the manufacturer instead. I got \"lucky\" there: they couldn't repair it and replacement would take 3 months so they proposed sending me a newer revision for an extra price of a little bit over 100 EUR.

    "title": "The Animators' Plight: Low Wages and Overwork in the $25B Anime Industry",
    "originLink": "https://hitregbroke.com/anime/",
    "originBody": "Anime: A Slave Industry Anime is a $25 billion industry that pays its animators pennies. Why. How. What??? Reaching the heights of almost $25 Billion dollars, anime is a market that has exploded in the past decade, outputting some of the most stunning stories, animations, and visuals the world has ever seen. However, for so much success - for so much fanfare - the anime industry itself is shrouded in a fog; not because it's actually mysterious, but because people just don't particularly care enough to look through the glass. This article expands on my documentary piece that explores how anime became an industry that pays its workers $5/day - apathetic workers that don't seem to care about the plight they're in, to a world that's ignorant, whether out of choice or not. So - assuming you've watched the video already (or went and watched it, this article will still be here after you're done!) - let's briefly discuss some of the finer points that, for the sake of not overcomplicating an already 30 minute video with an 8 month production span, like Questions like, well - Did A1 actually get off scot free? Surely employee suicide would make some headlines? Yes. Well - technically no, if any form of consequence is included A1 definitely did not get off scot free. The sheer amount of news headlines that the suicide made was not something to be scoffed at, even enough to make headlines in the English websphere - which is saying a lot. Beyond that A1 did face legal repercussions, though probably not what you're expecting and/or hoping. The family of the deceased managed to get \"workers compensation benefits\" (whatever that means), and A1 was explicitly implicated in the case, but that's about it. At the onset of this implication A1 said the following: If this decision is true, it is unexpected and we cannot comment because the reason for the judgment is unclear. which is up there with being one of the most corporate responses to a tragedy they caused as I've ever seen. In fact, I think it's made even worse when you discover this: 過労死ライン The Japanese Government's Official and Legally set \"Death Line\" Japan is well known for being one of the harshest countries to work for - the saying goes if you're going to live in Japan, make sure you have a way to make money that's not actually working in the country. Karoshi (過労死) is officially translatable to \"Death by Overwork,\" something that happened to our unfortunate animator at A1 alongside many others working in manga, anime, and etc. Hearing this, the first thought that probably comes to your head is that, well, \"The government should do something about this, right?\" Lucky for you, the government did do something about it. Though the obvious solution to solving the overwork problem (making it illegal) was not deployed; and admittedly would've been pretty much impossible to deploy anyways seeing how much the country seems to work. Instead the government set up a set of guidelines that outlined exactly what constituted excessive overwork, or as it's labeled - the \"Death by Overwork line\" While I am not good enough at Japanese to decipher the finer details of Japanese Law, the line in principle is not actually there as an automatic weapon to implicate any companies caught red-handed for working their employees over this line, but more simply there to help establish a causal relationship between overwork and bodily symptoms of disease. Through the use of a satisfactory amount of overtime hours (typically 45-100+) in a certain period (typically 2-3 months) before the development of a disease (like cardiovascular or otherwise) an implication can be made - but nowhere I read actually said that the line can be used to implicate death or suicide. Though to be fair, I probably just missed it since I was reading summaries of the thing on wikipedia and not the actual document itself. Needless to say though, if death/suicide wasn't included in the original law, there would be enough loopholes that exist that the chain of logic of overwork -> depression -> suicide could be cut before the final act as the law doesn't explicitly state any connection there could be made. This would probably explain why even though A1 (and later MADHOUSE) were in gross violation of this Karoshi Line, that none of them actually got any significant consequence from it beside just some headlines and some money they effectively had to throw at the victims' families to make them and the courts get off their back. Getting back into my lane and out of the world of a foreign country's politics, this would probably explain the quote of an anime director Daiki Nishimura who said that \"A-1 Pictures is not at fault... the current state of the entire business world that includes A-1 Pictures is at fault. To denounce A-1 Pictures alone is a mistake.\" Which, is true. The entire Japanese business world is at fault here for building a system that allows this kind of stuff. But I wonder what part of denouncing A1 pictures is a mistake? This feels like a complicated way of saying \"oh but he's doing it too!\" Change starts gradually after all. And I know that I said I'd stay out of the lawyers hair, but one more twist of irony - the Japanese Labor Laws set in 1947 state that Working conditions shall meet the needs of workers to lead a worthy life. Working unpaid overtime (any amount, let alone 100s of hours) doesn't seem like conditions that meets the needs to lead a worthy life do they? Anyhow, let's move on. Of course, none of this is legal advice, go consult an actual Japanese lawyer and not some random guy across the Pacific Ocean. And as I said before, this isn't my lane anyways, so let's move our focus from the Japanese parliament to a few (many) blocks down to: Osamu Tezuka - is he actually at fault? Being a bitch doesn't mean he's guilty. Right? In any conversation about the topic of working in anime, one of the main problems that comes up is that there simply isn't enough time to produce an anime a week constantly into perpetuity. And so a lot of people, understandably, decide that whoever came up with it must be the villain here. And trace your way back through a few links and you'll find that the godfather of animanga himself - Osamu Tezuka - was the one that came up with this whole upload schedule. Though to be fair, Tezuka was no angel either - he was not very nice to work with in Toei (pretty much ignoring management and everyone else's input and concern in favor of his own opinions as a manga artist on how animation should be made), and even in his own studio he was known to slack off and make his employees pick up all his slack just for Tezuka to swing down and take credit for all of it. But for all the bad rep the guy gets, is his pushing of anime production to one a week really the catalyst for everything wrong with the industry? It didn't take a genius to realize that anime was a powerful export, regardless of whether or not Tezuka pushed the industry to its weekly upload schedule - in fact, this weekly upload schedule might have been the very thing that pushed anime to the heights it's at now. Imagine if suddenly the entire anime industry told us that in order to treat their workers more fairly, they were cutting down to uploading once or twice a month? How do you think the general public would react? The issue that stonewalled what could've potentially been a thriving and prosperous industry for higher ups and workers alike may very well have been due to the situation Japan had caught itself in in the years prior and after Tezuka's propping up of Mushi Pro. Beyond the fact that unions weren't particularly viable because of a general culture against it that still permeates today, Japanese workers tended to be used to working for very long hours because of an economic situation that the country found itself in the immediate aftermath of WWII As you can see, Japanese GDP dropped by nearly half in the years of and following the WWII. This kind of ginormous economic downturn is, to put it simply, not easy to deal with, for everyone involved. In this period of misfortune Japanese companies and Japanese workers seemingly formed an unsaid agreement with each other in terms of employment stability. The workers would work their asses off - and I mean work their asses off - in exchange for the company more or less guaranteeing the workers' job security. In this way the company didn't have to worry about losing its workforce, and the workers didn't have to worry about losing their job. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. This systematic trade off still somewhat permeates the country today. And with the entire culture revolving around the principle of working hard for your company like it's your family, it's unsurprising that the nascent anime industry also caught some of this principle in its workforce - though after a while, the company end of the bargain seemingly vanished while the workers still kept their half up. Why? Well you already know why: Outsourcing A necessary evil? Outsourcing work isn't some kind of foreign concept to anyone who's thought of scaling anything before, and it's very likely that a lot of smaller scale domestic outsourcing was present in the anime industry before international mass outsourcing anyways. And while I mentioned that Mobile Suit Gundam was one of the anime that was marked as a pioneer in this sense, you can be damn sure that a lot of studios were looking to outsource to decrease their labor costs - it just happened that Sunrise had either the capital or network to do so. So in a way, this development was as inevitable as tech companies outsourcing tech support to other countries. Though, the dominant wave of hiring people as independent contractors instead of employees didn't actually show up anywhere in my research. Certain sources allege that political developments like the devolution of what was previous government responsibilities to private sector companies during the Junichiro Koizumi cabinet inspired this employment shift away from permanent employees to independent contractors. Junichiro Koizumi,. former PM of Japan However, I'm skeptical. For one, Junichio Koizumi was elected in 2001, which was well after outsourcing first became popularized thanks to Mobile Suit Gundam and just a general realization by corporations that if they did that they wouldn't have to pay as much to employees. And as shitty as it sounds, well, if your only sole focus was increasing the bottom line then it's not an illogical plan. And does what the government do really set that much precedence for private companies? Anyways, the point is beyond me as well since I don't live in Japan, nor do I know anything of its politics (or particularly care to know to be honest). Even if it was true that Koizumi's cabinet influenced this shift, I am not the person to be confidently affirming this claim - leave that to the politicians and historians, or at least someone that lived their life in the country. But wait - didn't I mention a political figure in the video? What was his name again...? Taro Aso And the Parliamentary League I mentioned in the ending credits that Taro Aso \"formed\" the Parliamentary League for Manga, Anime, and Games (colloquially and hereafter referred to as MANGA). And while everything said on that slide was true, including Hideaki Anno coming to speak at its inaugural conference, whether or not the former Prime Minister now Finance Minister of the ruling party did it out of any sort of love for MANGA is yet to be determined. In fact, it's likely that this was (as expected, to be honest) a maneuver based more on politics and economic reasons alone. Japan was already quite aware of the fact that the components of MANGA was amongst one of its strongest cultural soft power exports (and I mean, it's kind of obvious). So why wouldn't the Finance Minister want to prop up the industries that, let's be frank, made Japan famous in the public eye? In fact, this movement of exporting cultural soft power, known as Cool Japan, was a movement that was induced by the government to literally do this exact thing all the way back in the 1980s, focused on disseminating Japan's image of \"being cool\" to the global markets through anime, manga, video games, JPOP, etc, etc, etc. And I think it goes without saying that it definitively worked. On you. On me. On everyone. Whether or not this Parliamentary League actually did anything I don't know. Cursory searches across the web suggest that they wanted to give tax breaks to people working in anime/manga/etc to help relieve some financial burden and also restart the bungled International Media Art General Center initiative (I think that's the link?) that was shelved when the LDP (the party Taro Aso belongs to) was defeated. Whether or not any of this actually resulted in relief all the way on the ground is yet to be discovered. For now though, more and more stories keep coming out about overwork, underpay, etc. etc., so it's safe to say that the league's job is not done yet. Though, is it even part of the league's job in the first place? Its mission is statement is simply to advance these arts in the national interest of Japan. You have to wonder if the national interest of Japan and the interest of the workers match up - hopefully they do, but there's been plenty of times where the government's goals and the plights of the people actually working don't line up completely. Speaking of the people working on anime, what about the people that came up with the story in the first place? Manga Artists What's their role in all of this? This portion is going to be short, because at the end of the day manga artists, while the original creators of their stories, don't hold any power over how animators are treated. And why would they? They're the creators of the story, not the people who contributed money to the actual production - they're very different things. If some mega rich manga artist successfully contributed his money to an anime's production directly, then he would be given the ownership share accordingly. But manga artists don't have time for that. In fact, even with final power over how any creative portion of an anime should look, in the majority of cases it's the publishing company (in Jump's case, Shueisha) that makes decisions on behalf of the manga artist. Why? Well, manga artists have their own things to go tend to. Like making manga. Of course, it's the manga artist's choice to dedicate his limited precious free time to going to tend to the anime - and in many cases they do - but it is impossible for them to pay it 100% of their attention all the time. And if they do go in with final arbiting power, the people who actually funded the anime want to (if not have their own way) at least an honest discussion about it. But with so many companies funding the thing, just the discussion of it would drag out so long that it's not worth it. Better the manga artist stay in his metaphorical lane, and the people producing the anime stay in theirs is the thought. The manga artist has no time, the companies funding the anime would rather not deal with bickering with the manga artist, and the general production system has nary a second to spare for these kinds of things since it's already so time-starved anyways. And if the production system is so tight on time all the time - why in the world would anyone come up with the idea of having to double the workload just to get VAs their stuff earlier? VAs Clearly they should give the animators a break right? While I've done research into manga, anime, and how the two link, the third foggy branch of anime by the name of VAs is something I have done no research into. Absolutely none. I had a thought of making a trilogy on the topic, one concerning anime, one concerning manga, and one concerning VAs, all based on how fucked up it is to work in all three but that is a discussion for another time. That being said, the doubling of workload to give VAs their portion first is more of a thing in the animators' ballcourt rather than the VAs. In fact, through my research it doesn't seem like the VAs had any influence at all over this seemingly superfluous doubling of workload - this was all just another thing the animating world did and another thing it shot itself in the foot with and the VAs said \"Oh, uh... ok?\" The principle behind this though is, as always, benign. The \"two shoot system\" as it was called was started to actually draw in animators to work. Because more work means more pay - and everyone wants more pay right? Nevermind the fact that you could just pay your animators fairly, that'd make too much sense. As you read this, you've probably thought that there was no way such an ineffective fix could've actually made it through without some other benefit - surely I'm leaving something out? Nope. That was it. In exchange for paying animators more (by doubling their workload), episodes would cost 500K yen more to produce, and animators would have to do the workload twice. ...wtf? And speaking of wtf - Wtf happening to JAniCA anyways? First Miyazaki, then Kon? JAniCA, retirement securing organization turned poster boy of anime unionization, was one of the closest ventures towards unionization the entire anime industry had seen in its history. Sure there was the Toei union, but as I said in the video, what is a union meant for just Toei animation gonna do for the 99.9% of non-Toei animation folks out there? There was also the first EISANRO union that consisted of a lot of movie companies (assumedly including some animation companies) in the immediate aftermath of World War II, but they only managed to do a handful of things before being shutdown by... the US military? For being too... militant about their unionization efforts? I don't know why the occupying military would be concerned about some random Movie union getting too zealous when that was their idea in the first place but history acts in weird ways I suppose. The second EISANRO union was formed in 1965 and was mainly just for film and television, moving away from animation. So with all that being said, how did JAniCA fail? It wasn't one particular company's fault, nor was it forcefully shutdown by a foreign military. In fact, at the time it seemed to the big buzz around as so many influential people seemingly finally came together to put an end to all this shit the anime was going through once and for all. While I'm not particularly well versed in JAniCA's history, I can say that as much as JAniCA was an exciting prospect for many animators, for many others it was also the opposite. For reasons that are more tied to general Japanese culture than anything else, unionization has always been a taboo topic in the workplace, especially in anime. Many people don't even want to mention they gave the idea of unionization a thought because it's just not conforming to the social norm, in a country where conforming to social norm is an almost sacred principle. However, the will for a union to work is just as important as people wanting to join it in the first place. And while the hype and hubbub about JAniCA was palpable at first (as always with any new happening), continuing that \"hype\" and actually sustaining it over the long term is an extremely difficult thing to do - especially if your founder leaves. Toyo Ashida Founder of JAniCA - and he left? While I never got any definitive answer to what caused Ashida to leave - whether it was infighting, age, or otherwise - I do know that he did leave. And regardless of whether or not the departure was adversarial or not, the fact that Ashida departed marked the beginning of the end for JAniCA, with the government it so relied on for support being voted out of power another fundamental happening that dampened JAniCA's future. And for the existing members at the time, which, since it was originally a union meant to guarantee member retire benefits, included a lot of experienced (and assumedly influential) figures in anime, those two things were pretty much the last straw. With no leader providing a clear vision and no backing by the government, most of the older folks got jaded towards the situation becoming any better and promptly left. Without government backing, without their founder (left and then deceased), figureheads (left and then deceased), and now without many influential members, JAniCA pretty much imploded. This is not to say that JAniCA doesn't still exist - it does, and if any unionization effort was to commence I'd probably give JAniCA to be the breeding ground for it - but that it's out of its prime and way out of the limelight. Some sources also said that internally JAniCA was struggling with administrative and legal stuff as articles of incorporation were muddled, but is yet to be definitive. Either way, the blaze to change anime burned out with JAniCA. Regardless of whether or not it was the union's fault that it failed, it reinforced the uselessness of unionizing and the hopelessness of the anime situation simultaneously. With so much money flowing to the top of the pyramid, it would have to take another cohort of influential animators to really revive the movement, which brings about the final, and probably most important question: The Production Committee Why? Tezuka is second to the Production Committee as the thing that ruined working in anime. And to be fair, it makes sense. They're the ones that are the controllers of the money - what would it hurt them to maybe take a million or two out of their ginormous buckets of profit to make it so animators can eat? I honestly don't see any real counter argument to that notion, and it seems like anime studios don't either and got markedly tired of it. Bocchi the Rock and Chainsaw Man were two examples of animes that were fully funded by anime studios, and achieved tremendous amounts of success. In this way the anime studio can confidently get all the credit and money from its own creation, and compensate its employees accordingly (hopefully accordingly) Does that mean every anime funded by anime studios succeeds like that? No. Not at all. And falling prey to survivorship bias is dangerous when it comes to these cases. However, the aforementioned \"studio confidently getting all the credit and money for its own creation\" is probably the most mind boggling thing for a lot of people (as well as me when I was researching the topic). How could people who worked on things like Demon Slayer not get tremendous amounts of money from such a giant success? Well, besides the fact that the Production Committee owns the \"stock\" that is anime, the more important thing they own (that was not mentioned in the video) is actually the IP itself Copyright: And studios selling it to Production Committees I'm not sure where this trend came from, and to be honest I'm not sure how it even became a concept. Through tradition, contractual obligation, or something else, most studios sell the rights to the things they create to the Production Committee. This sole action means that the studio does not receive royalties/commissions/anything else related to the success of the series. This is also combined with the fact that anime studios are often the bottom of the command chain when it actually comes to making anime in its entirety. The Production Committee is the fundraiser and therefore the legal owner, but even TV stations and media conglomerates of the sort have more power than studios as the anime will never make the light of the day unless the stations allow it to be aired. So with all that said (and much more still unsaid which I plan to cover in a livestream sometime), the ultimate question comes to bear: So... How do we fix this again? To be completely honest, the video was supposed to originally be just about anime's issues, not about any solution - and that's pretty apparent in the relative size of the sections, with over 80% of the video just detailing anime's issues. But after looking it over and then looking at the YouTube landscape in general, I thought to myself, \"Does this platform really need more pure negativity?\" The answer is no. However, even beyond that, coming up with solutions to a problem that Miyazaki nor Satoshi Kon nor Isao Takahata nor any of the other countless numbers of actual influential people in the field could actually solve, is a bit of a tall order. Though, this only refers to the practical specifics of a solution to the issue, not theoreticals. In fact, the there are only two theoretical paths that anyone could really go down in addressing the issue, the first option being: Time: You really think people will be happy with this? The problem with anime comes down to the fact that people are working too much for too little. And while now we know that Tezuka was the one responsible for setting up this weekly upload norm, who's to say that we can't change it back? Even reading that sentence likely made some of us feel uneasy, and that's for a good reason. The weekly and seasonal rotations of anime are almost synonymous with weekly uploads. That's just how things are. And as mentioned before, the general public likely would not like the fact that their weekly anime is now reduced to biweekly, bimonthly, or worse. But even beyond that, time is really the smaller of the two problems here. Investment bankers work 100+ hours a week and that's seen as completely fine. What's the difference? Money Anyone who says this show was not weird in some way is objectively wrong Investment Bankers' sometimes $100+/hour and $150K+ a year salary is not even in the same league as animators' sometimes <$1 an hour wages. Both are life-changing amounts of money no doubt, but one changes lives for the better, and the other makes people end their own. However to be clear, the money problem is not that animators don't make anything, but that it's not enough compensation. In simpler terms, the pure fact that animators are making less than $1 a day would not be an issue if the daily cost of living (food, shelter, water, etc) was $0.01. However, the daily cost of living is much more than $0.01 (as you probably already know). This is a fact that goes almost without saying - so much so that it's kind of like, well, why am I bringing this up? Because, the money path splits here accordingly into the two parts of the equation, one being increasing animators pay, the other reducing their expenses, so let's go over 1. Increasing animators' Pay Realistic? You Decide. The first path is to increase animators' pay - and to be brutally honest, this the only real solution of the two paths. This is because all the problems in anime pretty much stem from the fact that no one is paid enough. Pay animators $150K+ USD a year and I don't think anyone would bat an eye. The problem with this however, is multi-fold. And the first you can probably guess: Companies don't like giving up money. Production Committees have operated under these current anime budgets for pretty the entirety of anime's history, and the chance is so low that you'd be able to convince any Production Committee to raise enough money to pay decent wages to every animator there is on a team that the probability of it might as well be negative. And to be honest, there may just too many animators out there. The meme on animators pay that goes around (that is all too true) What the hell does that mean? Well, it's not like all animators are equal in their positions. Just like the regular corporate world, more senior and skilled artists are put in higher positions that pay more (\"more\") while more junior and inexperienced artists are the ones that are dealt the whole $5/day bs that is usually the outrage that most people see. And it is coincidentally the fact that those on the bottom of the ladder are the ones that are usually the ones that are outsourced. The actual anime production process wasn't actually covered in the video much as the specifics of it aren't particularly important in the grand scheme of the financial system that dictates what makes anime to be made; however, delving into the specifics of paying animators more does require at least a cursory knowledge of it, so let's take a brief detour (and I mean really brief) A Hyper-oversimplified view of how anime is made: If you want to know every specific detail of this this is NOT the article to read - pictures, examples, and more detailed descriptions from here To simplify the pipeline for our purposes, all we need to understand is the basic logic that drives the pipeline: What the anime looks like must be made The most important keyframes have to be drawn Every frame in between the above has to be drawn Everything must look consistent, correct, and satisfactory. So let's start from the top, beginning with: 1. Deciding on What an anime should look like The Top of the Ladder: In every form of visual media, regardless of whether it's a movie, anime, cartoon, etc, etc, the most important part is someone actually deciding what it should look like. \"What it should look like\" is much more than just what a character should look like or what colors we should use - in fact, in western media those are the jobs of the character designers, photography directors, color correctors, costume designers, scene compositors, etc, etc, etc. But even despite this, someone still has to put together the whole thing and dictate how all those environments, characters, dialogue, music, etc plays together. This is what the director is typically responsible for, and it comes in the form of a storyboard: Two pages from an almost 500+ page storyboard of WeatherING With You As you can see, there is a lot going on here - from compositional shots to where light and shadow should fall to camera movements, dialogue, music, and shot time down to the frame, all of this is the job of the director. The literal creation of an anime is not an easy job, given to only the senior and most experienced. Accordingly, the directors are compensated fairly. Well, not particularly fairly as compared to their western counterparts, but directors aren't usually the people that are struggling to make ends meet. This was the group that JAniCA was originally meant to serve: those people that had been in the industry long enough to the point that they were considering retiring. And so while anime directors' pay are very much deficient as compared to the responsibilities they shoulder, the discussion here is not particularly aimed at them. It's everybody else: \"Everybody else\" After the directors essentially create the anime, in come the people that have to actually execute on that vision - the people who actually have to draw the frames. The director in the storyboard laid out the keyframes of the anime, but those keyframes are pretty much never detailed enough to actually use straight up in the anime. After all, the director doesn't have the time, he has everything else to worry about. The storyboard is indeed just the first draft. The process of getting to the second draft involves the delegation of who will do what at what time (typically job of the administrative staff) and the people who have to go in and make the keyframes that were present in the storyboard actually usable. These \"making-keyframes-usable-for-staff\" people are referred to as the LO and the Nigen people, who are responsible for turning storyboard keyframe into a less rough keyframe and then going from less rough keyframe to detailed specific instructions on how everything should look. In practice it looks like this - the director's storyboard frames are taken from here: Your Name To here: LO from Tokyo Ghoul (Ni)Genga from Iron Saga Collectively, these two processes are known as Genga (原画). From here, the anime can actually be made - the directions from the nigen on where light, shadow, and color should go (the different colored circles and regions on the second picture) and the more general directions from the layout goes to the people responsible for making the anime look like an anime. This invokes the job of the people generally at the bottom portions of the ladder - past the storyboard (絵えコンテ), layout (レイアウト), genga (原画), and nigen (二原) and into the realm of the douga (動画). 動画 Welcome to the bottom: Douga people are the most junior people on the staff, and typically the ones that are outsourced. Sure genga, nigen, LO can all be outsourced, but those are typically key positions that need to have quality control or else the entire anime simply falls apart. And as for the director - well, as mentioned in the end of the video Satoshi Kon's movie Dreaming Machine is still incomplete, even though he made the storyboard for it and even part of the Genga. That should be a pretty good idea of how unacceptable outsourcing anime directors is. Douga though is different. After all, the douga-men are simply following instructions, whether from the LO and nigen \"more-refined-drafts\" or from the principles of animation that dictate how it should be drawn. This means that the douga-men are the ones that are outsourced en masse to the people who will do it for the lowest pay, and as a result are the ones who are dealt the $5/day treatment. But aren't their jobs important too? If the director and genga-men have to get all their stuff perfect, wouldn't a botched execution just ruin it all? And if that's the case, why is this position so neglected? Well, as you probably remember, there were not 3, but 4 points in the logic of animation production. Past all the drawings and creation of the anime, there is the extremely important facet of: Quality Control (QC) Correct, Consistent, and Satisfactory: Anime production, as you may remember from the video, isn't a case of each person finishing their job and then just leaving. If that was the case then douga probably wouldn't be outsourced at all - with no one to QC the douga people they would have to necessarily be extremely good at it, and then be compensated better than what they're compensated at time of writing. The only issue is that the system isn't like this. And honestly, it wouldn't be possible for a \"go home when you're done\" system to really work. The only person that knows how they want the anime director to go is the anime director themselves. Same with genga. Same with nigen. Douga though? Not so much. At the bottom of the chain and the most junior position, douga-men are never going to be expected to get everything perfect. In fact, everyone short of the executive producers and directors themselves is never going to be perfect. Of course, the executives are not perfect either by merit of being human, but their drawings is the reference that everyone else goes off of. LO, Nigen, Genga, Douga, whatever terms you throw around that aren't the directors and executives, will have to be checked. The Genga by the director (of genga, LO, or the executive director himself), the douga by the genga, etc., etc.. The rule of thumb here is that if someone is below someone else on the ladder, that someone will be checked. And while LO, nigen, and higher up people on the ladder may only be checked once or twice, douga people tend to be checked multiple times. By the genga people. Who now need to do their own work, check douga mistakes, and correct their own mistakes. And because of the fact that douga is outsourced en masse with QC not even close to those of the more experienced people, this means that now the more experienced people need to check douga peoples' work (often very obvious and glaring mistakes) as well do their own work, and their own checked work. This compounding chain of responsibility moves up the chain, meaning that now pretty much everyone needs to check everyone else, essentially brute forcing QC by way of repetition until perfection. The whole issue of ill-trained douga-men has seen very gradual solutions, as anime studios post guides and documentation on how they want things to be done and how things should be done in terms of following simple animation principles. But the issue still stands that there is not enough newbie training. And in the words of a friend who has experience in the pipeline but rather stay anonymous: All these people get a gig being a [douga] in an anime and they suddenly think they're hot shit, even though what they make is pretty much unusable. But they think they're hot shit, so they're terrible to work with, and their work is terrible, so... So.... wait, why did we go into this whole \"how anime is made thing again?\" (I talked to this friend afterwards and he said that he was talking about the nigen people... which means that this problem is worse than we thought) Increasing animators' pay Japanese animators' pay, as compared to western counterparts, is hilariously deficient. It's almost not comparable. However, the problem gets exponentially worse as you move down the chain of command until you reach the douga, which are the most egregious cases. The only issue with fixing the most egregious cases is that there will always be someone that would be willing to do it for less. The bottom line is the thing that companies care about after all, and so even if a certain number of outsourced animators decide they want higher pay, companies will simply go to the people who are willing to work for that pay. Typically, labor unions and collective action are the solution to this, but outsourcing ruins all of it because there is no way an international union of douga-men can function, making fixing the douga-men issue quite impossible. Up the chain, as people get less and less outsource-able, the possibility for collective action grows - though as evident by JAniCA's failure, it's still really really hard. So short of asking Production Committees and companies to \"please give animators more money because it's the right thing to do\" and shareholders and the stock market to \"stop expecting infinite growth on a planet with finite resources,\" it is unbelievably difficult to reconcile the money situation at the bottom portions of the ladder. There was never any labor union directed at douga, and likely never will be until outsourcing is stopped completely. So if increasing animators' pay is almost impossible, we must go to the second path: Decreasing Expenses While it's the temporary solution of the two, decreasing animators' expenses is by and aways easier to do than paying animators more money because of the current situation of... well, society. And to this end I don't really have anything to say since you can come up with any number of ways to decrease expenses - however the most popular way it seems (historically) is to pay for animators' living expenses. Whether it was Anime Mirai or another reincarnated version called The New Animators' Dormitory Project, decreasing living expenses has proved the easiest since you just need to get enough money to pay for a house. So if you want to, go ahead and donate to The New Animators' Dormitory Project. They didn't sponsor the video or this article or anything at all (I reached out to them for an interview but they never got back to me after I posted my questions...), but from what I see it's a genuinely good cause, managed by someone who used to be an animator himself. Personally I want to eventually find an organization like that too, but based around the concept of direct dispersion of money to animators. But I'm some random college kid in the US who has never worked in anime. So.... yeah that'll probably take a while. But if this is the solution (temporary as it may be), why didn't I mention it in the video? The Power of Exposure (art by https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/33740731) Beyond the fact that I felt like plugging in a charitable foundation at the end of a video would feel like undisclosed sponsorship and just generally feel weird (even if I did explicitly mention they didn't sponsor the video), the power of the general public knowing about a problem is not to be trifled with. Most problems in the world exist because there is not enough will to actually fix them. This goes for everything from climate change to animators being underpaid - whether lack of political will (due to whatever reason) or lack of will of the general public out of pure ignorance or otherwise, a problem needs to have a certain amount of people who want it to be fixed in order for the solution to actually come. This is why the time path of the solutions crossroad is probably infeasible - it's not because it's impossible to do (it's as simple as flipping a switch really), but there would be no support from pretty much anyone to have anime go from weekly to biweekly or monthly or whatever. Giving animators more money - well, there's not enough political will or will from companies to do so; but reducing animators expenses? Well there is a will, the will is just too small to really make a difference across the industry. This is the principle reason why I made the video - not to go into the weeds and propose a detailed solution plan to a problem that people by the likes of Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kon were ill equipped to face (let alone me) - but to try to take action on the one facet of the solution that I really can make a difference in: Letting people know about it. Because at the end of the day, letting people know about something is half the battle to creating more public will to fix something. After all, most people don't even know that they don't know what's really happening behind the scenes. And out of the entire population of anime watchers there's a very small subset of them that know enough about the absolute state of anime to the point where they're motivated to act. So at the end of the day, that video and this article serve just one purpose - exposing the issue. Only when the issue is exposed to enough people can any progress be made to reconcile this situation, because without pressure from the general public, no company or government or etc will have any incentive to change anything. So go out there. Tell people about the problem. About the video. About this article. And perhaps your word will spread to someone else, to someone else, to someone else, until enough people are in an uproar about the situation that the pressure forces things to change. And you'll be a part of the solution as well. (Bibliography)",

It’s a few very popular properties that make all the dough. If people were paid fairly, most productions would be untenable. There would be just a few anime per year instead of many. But also, how would the popular ones come to be? Every new property would be a huge gamble. As an anime and manga fan, I actually want that to happen. Pay the animators what they deserve. Give them good working conditions. People just have to accept that means the industry will shrink dramatically. So many things will just never get made. That also means far fewer people will get to become animators. They’ll have to find some other job as competition for the jobs that remain will be sky high. And that competition is what brings down the wages in the first place. There are just so many people that want those jobs. reply chasing 8 hours agoparentThe \"if we paid people fairly things would be prohibitively expensive\" argument is a terrible one, just to note. First, it rarely seems to actually be the case since the requirement that employees be paid fairly mostly just drives away low-value efforts. It's also an attitude that, if taken to its logical extreme, demands society have an underpaid underclass that suffers so the rest of us can have nice things. reply cmdli 8 hours agorootparentWhile I agree with your argument, it's not as simple as \"letting the low value efforts die\". If most anime were to stop being produced, most of the animators would also be fired and be unable to continue what is (I assume) their passion and career. The simple fact is that there isn't enough money going into the industry to pay all the animators a fair wage, so either animators get paid less or there are fewer animators. reply kmeisthax 7 hours agorootparentVocational awe is a curse. If you have an endless supply of people willing to work pennies then the industry will build itself around paying them pennies. This does not mean that this is the only way you can build an animation industry - just that this is the path Toei and Sunrise took. The amount of money that goes into the industry is not static. The original linked article specifically cites cases in which members of the production committee (often toy companies like Good Smile[0]) decided to deliberately take less money because they didn't want their control diluted. They're only able to do this because they can fleece animators into working longer for less money rather than having to get more capital in the project. As for animators having to find new work... good? The current situation is one in which animators pursue their passions, and then have their passions completely take over their life and crush their soul. If they quit en masse, that would be backpressure against productions that want animators to fall on their swords, and production committees that want shit done cheaply.

At best they'd try to be their own entrepreneur and make money that way, while gathering experience for these now-evergreen studios. At worst they give up or try another career. Paternalistic or not, almost every first world country has labor laws precisely so a job can't pay pennies to sustain its business. And governments do that because they don't want income hoarded by the managers and stifling the middle/low class economy. reply ekianjo 7 hours agorootparentprevFirst, there is no such thing as a \"fair pay\". All of it is driven by demand and supply, always, except when regulations or external factors somehow break things.

We see that all of the time in every industry. reply chasing 6 hours agorootparent> All of it is driven by demand and supply, always, except when regulations or external factors somehow break things. This is very much not true for worker salaries. For one thing, workers can not easily hop from area of expertise to area of expertise like capital can — and workers oftentimes lack the ability to take the high risk that might comes with quitting a job in search of another or attempting to switch career paths. The natural state is for owners to drive down worker compensation until it's essentially slave labor. In a \"competitive\" world for owners, competing means driving down costs which means an across-the-board destruction of worker benefits. We have some protections in this country (thank you, unions!) and full-stop rules against slavery that prevent us from actually seeing this, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't happen. And trust me: People in financial power would absolutely grind workers down to a penny an hour and still claim it's \"fair pay\" if they could. They'd say \"well, if it wasn't fair pay people wouldn't do it\" while making sure the entirety of society was arranged to prevent people from leaving their jobs. reply Arainach 7 hours agorootparentprevBusinesses do not have an inherent right to exist. If you can't pay a living wage, comply with regulations, and be profitable, your business model is not valid and your business should fail and close. Predictions of dire consequences rarely pan out. Fast food employees in Seattle are earning $15-20/+ per hour and prices did not double - in fact they're not significantly higher than in neighboring counties with lower wages.

That's nice that people have a dream to make anime for a living. I hope they get to realize it. But the world does not owe them a particular wage for what they want to do just because it's a job that they want. If you can't make enough money doing a certain job, maybe go get a different job then. reply Brian_K_White 49 minutes agorootparentThere is no job that is ok to pay nothing or as good as nothing. It doesn't matter what \"career\". If a job needs doing by a human at all, then that human does indeed deserve a reasonable baseline which allows them to exist and even do so with reasonable dignity. As time goes on and jobs are done by machines, and there are fewer and fewer jobs that require a human, then the output and ownership of those machines simply should one way or another be distributed enough to have the same effect. All they have to do to earn that is not be being a criminal right at that moment. And this extends to people who can't do anything obviously productive too. Even a sick old grandma doing nothing but telling stories to kids for one hour a week is productive, and we have no excuse not to provide for even the ones who can't even do that. Because even if \"the Earth is a life boat\", we don't exist in an environment of hardship with fixed and insufficient resources where there just isn't enough food and building material and energy to go around. There simply is no excuse for the way we treat some people. They didn't do anything wrong enough to deserve it, and it is not forced by physical limits. Talking about what value someone provides to earn their existence is just a way to rationalize taking advantage of others. None of this equates to \"I will be forced to spend 20 years learning medicine to give my time away for free to bums!\" But even if it did, why is that a bad thing exactly? Because it's what, like slavery?

That is one hell of a hand wave.

Streaming is becoming more popular, but nowhere near as prevalent as the western streaming services. And physical media... Well, feel free to look up your favorite anime's pricing in Japan.

Their economic situation is extremely different from the US which exploded (then receded, then kept rising) in those decades. reply Arainach 2 hours agorootparentAnd yet the compensation and quality of life are very poor in this industry, as described in this article. reply michaelmrose 5 hours agorootparentprevOne could reasonably define fair in terms of a nations minimum wage while discarding any nonsensical carve outs designed to appease particular industries, you could define it in turns of what it costs to live a reasonable life in the nation in question, and you could define it in turns of ratio of gross profit to income of average employee. There are so many ways to define fair we could write essays on which method was most accurate and useful. Free markets only exist in economics textbooks. Real markets unconstrained are always hopelessly broken. Bereft of rules most of the work would end up owned by a tiny number of companies who would agree what wages should be and agree not to hire each others workers. They would make access to all the most desirable work they control contingent on rules designed to strangle up and coming competitors in the cradle and gradually increase price to the absolute most the market would bear. Impoverishing the people who actually do the work would poison the pool of workers gradually destroying quality of content while companies increased prices to make up for lost profit and blamed piracy.

Per a quick Google search, at current exchange rates, it's not uncommon to see programmers with 2-3 years of experience earning $30K/year USD there, sometimes lower than that. Japan's economy has been stagnating for decades and that's reflected across the board, not just in entertainment. reply franciscop 5 hours agoparent> (It's another reason why, as a Westerner, you almost certainly do not want to try to live in Japan.) This is a really bad take, I've lived in Tokyo for 6 years. As a western developer (in IT as we say here in Japan), you will most certain improve your quality of life by moving to e.g. Tokyo vs most USA cities. While what you said it's true, there's also other truths: - As others comment, as a foreigner working in Tokyo with some experience, you can opt to much higher salaries than the local graduates (for so many reasons). It'd be easy to make 6-8M JPY in Japanese companies, and depending on other factors 8-10M JPY is not rare. Since we are in HN, I'm sure many here can even opt for 10M+ JPY. - If you can, just work remotely for US/EU while living here, or for a branch of a EU/US company, since salaries will be much higher. That is true. That way you can make 10-30M JPY easily, and with that you can live _very_ comfortable. Only issue you might have is how you manage to get a Visa. For reference, you can live well as a single guy in Tokyo with 4-5M JPY. Lifestyle is different though, so it depends on what you value, e.g. houses ARE smaller, but neighborhoods are walkable and beautiful (highly depends where you come from). If you do want to have your cake and eat to, meaning living in a \"very big\" house for Japanese standards while having everything else nice from Japan, yeah you'll need to be making 8M+ JPY for sure. reply ekianjo 7 hours agoparentprev> at current exchange rates Looking at exchange rates is the wrong way of looking at things since they vary widely in the space of 5 years or so. You need to look at purchasing power in their local currency. Like eating out in japan is WAY cheaper than in Europe for anything comparable.

Well, as a software engineer game development is among the lowest-paying jobs you can have, and you usually don't need any special training to switch to something more remunerative. As an artist, though, there's nothing hugely better you can just switch to without doing a lot of training, which is a tough bargain given how expensive art school can be. Sometimes people successfully pivot to graphic or UI design, which is generally more lucrative, but that's about it. Ironically, game dev at a medium or large studio is actually one of the more stable and lucrative careers in the art world, unlike software development where it's the opposite. > To my knowledge, there hasn’t been a successful one yet for software, but I’m ignorant of the art world; maybe they have one. Yes, animators in L.A. at many major studios (e.g. Disney) are unionized, and as a result they're among the best jobs you can get in that field. They still work long hours, but you can earn six-figure compensation with good benefits if you specialize in the right things (generally the more technical you are, the better off you are). (Source: lots of friends in that industry.) reply steveBK123 8 hours agoparentprevThis is like a collective action problem. Any industry with enthusiasts or which is itself a hobby is subject to this behavior. People need to stop being so naive as to accept poorly paid jobs because they think the subject matter is 'funner'. Game Devs are the first example I thought of here. If you love games, that's great.. but why not go work in literally any other software dev work for maybe 2x the pay and/or 1/2 the hours. As Don Draper said 'That's what the money is for'. Plenty more money and time to buy & play games. reply johnnyanmac 3 hours agorootparent>If you love games, that's great.. but why not go work in literally any other software dev work for maybe 2x the pay and/or 1/2 the hours. 1. Work is still half your waking life for decades. Why not attempt to make it quality work instead of a slog if you can help it? 2. Less money =/= barely afford rent. I was still making $160k at my last role with 7YOE, so we're not talking \"can barely pay rent\". I'm a single 20's male with no car or school payments to make, and pretty low maintenance hobbies (hiking, games, art). Even in a high CoL area, doubling my salary won't necessarily double my QoL. 3. Gamedev is still a craft, so the more time you spend honing it the better a dev you become (generally). Even if I chose to leave gamedev as hobby work on the side, it reduces my ability to progress. 4. Gamedev works on similar \"it's who you know\" logic. And the best way to connect with fellow devs in a meaningful matter is to be in the industry. If you have aspirations to open your own studio one day these connections and portfolio is priceless for selling yourself to others. 5. Playing a game is very different from making one. Just because you like playing games doesn't mean you will enjoying making one yourself. The opposite can be true as well. Gamedev digs into domains like graphics, physics, UI/UX, and even psychology in applied ways that challenge engineers, even ones who rarely play games. A graphics programmer is a wizard who will be snatched by many industries if they open up, but if you wanna home your craft, you don't have too many other places for such specific work.

It sounds like you actually have a wildly incorrect view of how unions can and do work. you may want to do some more reading and research. For example, the WGA and SAG unions do not pay based on seniority nor does everyone make the same. They do mandate minimums for certain kinds of work but that’s about it. They also have rules about what the studios can and can’t do. That being said, it probably does come at the cost of fewer people being able to find employment than the talent pool exists but it’s hard to measure / support that claim considering there’s more actors and writers now than ever before. reply sillysaurusx 7 hours agorootparentI’d be interested to learn.

Whenever someone presents something as having no downside, it’s particularly important to try to examine that.

The goals of the leaders diverging from the interests of the members, unions negotiating contracts that are harmful to the health of the business (although that’s also on the companies involved to some extent). As for rewards, look at how actors, writers, directors etc get paid - the vast majority of those professions you never hear about and only hear about the ones that are making insane amounts of money from it. The union rules also covers things like residuals and stuff but again afaik it’s all about establishing minimums - the exceptional talent can always negotiate a better deal when they are in demand. reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentprevAny sufficiently powerful group of people can make 2 + 2 = 5. In this case, the Japanese animation industry is concentrated, so they can demand lots of hours for little pay. Of course, when you make 2 + 2 = 5, there's always a -1 floating out there that someone else has to suffer for. Right now, the animation industry sets the price, so the individual animators take the hit. If the animators unionize, then they can push back on that. The market forces here are that artists cost money, but the production committees and studios don't want to pay for them, so they arrange the industry in such a way as to keep artists out of the picture. reply jimkoen 5 hours agorootparentprevwhich implies that everyone in X industry would be paid the same, or based on seniority rather than merit. You're implying that being paid by seniority isn't already the case for most of the tech industry. Last time I checked, most job adverts are looking for \"X years of experience in Y\". > Or at least, I haven’t seen particularly persuasive evidence that unions can do more than make everyone collectively equal The work culture in europe is largely based on standardized work contracts, enforced by unions. For example, the entire railway industry in Germany is collectively unionized (~40k members) and is holding negotiations right now, to renew the terms of these standardized contracts. The goal of a union is not to \"make everyone equal\", it is to enforce collective bargaining rights. This usually does lead to better employment conditions for everyone involved though. reply huytersd 7 hours agorootparentprevThat’s exactly what a union is, a way to force the market to deal with a collective and buck wage lowering market forces. It involves putting gatekeeping licensing in place and making that license a legal requirement for any work done by that collective. This prevents rogue independents from depressing wages.

But I think for professions like these, the \"they have free will\" argument is pretty compelling. If they were being exploited in a low-skill, low-status job, where there are few to no alternatives, sure, definitely an industry that needs worker protections. But no one needs to be an animator at a big anime studio to survive. They're there because they want to be, and many/most/(all?) could find gainful employment in an adjacent industry or field where they'd have better pay. To me it's similar to game development. Game devs famously get paid poorly (compared to other devs) and work under stressful conditions. They don't have to do that. They can get a job as a web developer, or an embedded developer, or... some other kind of developer, and get paid more, and experience less stress. But they want to build games, so that's what they do. I'd definitely support all these folks if they wanted to unionize. But I'm not sure I'm convinced legislation is warranted.

As a fan I can’t imagine getting upset at a longer cadence, and at the most slightly annoyed. reply johnnyanmac 3 hours agoparentIt doesn't really matter that much in terms of logistics. Animators will usually be working on episode 8-9 of an anime by the time episode 1 airs. If not outright done with the 12 episode cour. Weekly schedule is usually done for the sake of broadcast channels, which is still a bit more relevant in Japan than over in rhe West. reply asylteltine 7 hours agoprevI just learned recently there’s a lot of drama of “localizers” blatantly mistranslating or inserting their own words to push their ideologies. reply astrange 6 hours agoparentYou learned nonsense right-wing propaganda. reply charcircuit 6 hours agorootparentEven so, it is true and does happen. Though I suspect it is less about pushing an ideology and more for trying to appeal to an audience of the localizer's peers. Either way the end result is that it repulsed a demographic of the distribution platform's target audience. Beyond that official translations often don't come with honorific, don't bother explaining puns, are not literal translations, try to replace a Japanese concept with a western one, and other annoying things. I would rather there not be an official translation or localization process, but since non Japanese streaming platforms want to constantly expand their business no matter what, the desires of hardcore anime fans will not be respected as normal people outnumber us, so bad subs will continue to be produced. reply nemothekid 4 hours agorootparent>but since non Japanese streaming platforms want to constantly expand their business no matter what This exact same conversation was happening on anime forum boards 20-30 years ago before Japanese streaming platforms knew they were people interested in watching their content overseas. There are gigabytes of forum posts of_fan produced content_ arguing over whether honorifics should be included, if puns should be explained with a \"TL note\", references to japanese history, etc. Fansubs ultimately ended up on coalescing on what official subs do today (before official subs even existed), so I don't believe they are doing it because of corporate greed. People prefer somewhat localized content. Fan subs killed most honorifics and translation notes before anyone made a dime doing so. reply astrange 2 hours agorootparentThere's a TV show translation group called TV-Nihon that actually does try to preserve everything as hard as possible. Everyone makes fun of them because their subtitles have random Japanese words scattered all over. And since Kamen Rider is written for small children it's not like the story is actually hard to understand. reply astrange 5 hours agorootparentprev> more for trying to appeal to an audience of the localizer's peers Or for people who aren't already familiar with the culture. For instance if you're translating a romance novel or otome game (romance game for women) you'd want to localize the body language it describes men using, because what Japanese women like, American women think is offputting and rapey, and a romance story doesn't work as a romance if it turns the reader off. > Beyond that official translations often don't come with honorific This is a giveaway you don't speak Japanese. Honorifics are not actually important or meaning-bearing. (Last week in public in Japan I heard a woman call a boy \"Haru-chan\", something that supposedly never happens.) Actually, if audiences expect this it means translators have to start translating some honorifics you don't know into the ones you do. You probably know さん but not 氏 or ちゃま. reply Dalewyn 2 hours agorootparent>This is a giveaway you don't speak Japanese. Honorifics are not actually important or meaning-bearing. As a Japanese man, you are dead wrong. Using the wrong honorific or inappropriately not using one at all can be tantamount to shouting \"fuck you\" to someone here in the Anglosphere, an insult and offence of among the highest order. >I heard a woman call a boy \"Haru-chan\", something that supposedly never happens. That is mundane to a fault. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparent> Using the wrong honorific or inappropriately not using one at all can be tantamount to shouting \"fuck you\" to someone here in the Anglosphere, an insult and offence of among the highest order. I didn't mean it like that! I meant when you are using them correctly in a story. They're normal pleasantries and a bit of character voice, and both those things can be represented in English. America isn't a honorific-heavy society, but there are certainly people who get offended if you don't call them Dr., etc. But this is rarely a plot point in a TV show, which is what I was talking about. Meanwhile I've seen subtitles for clips of Japanese vtubers where they don't put /enough/ swearing in. First one I ever saw had Pekora saying something was 気狂い, which they definitely didn't translate right. (Means \"crazy\" but it's a really bad word, kind of like \"retarded\".) reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparentprev>This is a giveaway you don't speak Japanese. I can, but believe what you want. I don't have a need to prove it to others. >Honorifics are not actually important or meaning-bearing. This is plain wrong as there are scenes where honorifics are significant. Who uses (or doesn't use) which honorific with which people is important. Characters change the honorific they use with each other. Characters talk about what honorifics people are using. >something that supposedly never happens. Says who? >if audiences expect this it means translators have to start translating some honorifics Personally, I don't think they need to translate them. The actual meaning of it is usually not important and if it is it could be left up to the viewer or put in a TL note. An exception to this is certain usages of 殿, but this is usually handled by changing the phrasing of the rest of the sentence. >You probably know さん but not 氏 or ちゃま I do know them. reply astrange 5 hours agorootparent> Who uses (or doesn't use) which honorific with which people is important. That's just a question of character voice. You can also say a translation is inaccurate because in the original the characters were speaking Japanese and now they're speaking English. But as they say, it can't be helped. You just need to be sure readers can still distinguish who's speaking in the result by making people sound different. > Says who? Most language learning material and anime fan common knowledge? Even Wikipedia, though it has some caveats. And of course there's real life situations where people call girls -kun as well. reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparent>That's just a question of character voice. Fair, but I do feel that removing it is removing a social dynamic that can not simply be mapped just to the voice of a character. >Most language learning material. It happens in anime too, so that material is wrong and off topic from what was being discussed. reply xboxnolifes 6 hours agorootparentprev> I would rather there not be an official translation or localization process Localization isn't just bad subs though. Localization is sometimes unavoidable due to differences in language and the cultural usage of the language. Not everything can be directly translated, as that's not how languages work. Sometimes the only way to avoid localization is to not translate, and then it's no longer a translation. reply astrange 6 hours agorootparentOther reasons to do it are: * translating a joke \"literally\" makes it no longer a joke and so no longer an authentic translation * the original creators want their work to sell to people who weren't already prepared to like it reply madrox 9 hours agoprevWhen I read things like this, I think back on my experience in games and entertainment. I believe that the more generally prestigious the industry is, the more likely it is to see worker exploitation. Part of your pay is wrapped up in getting to brag that you work in industry X on product Y. Almost by definition, that means young, passionate labor. Industry leaders quickly learn how to exploit the young and passionate. This is exacerbated in Japan, that already has a significant salaryman culture. However, I'm not sure this could be fixed through regulation. It's very wrapped up in human nature, and is a problem that you see across the world. Ultimately, the people involved have to make a choice about how they spend their lives. I might be wrong, but people have tried to fix the systemic issues for longer than I've been alive. reply gmerc 8 hours agoparentI don’t think it’s about prestigious as much as it is about passion. People in these industry join and often work there out of genuine passion, which makes them do sacrifices that take years to regret. reply savanaly 9 hours agoparentprevI totally agree with your diagnosis, but I don’t see why it’s considered to be a problem. Why shouldn’t people be free to trade off salary against other desirable traits in a job? Even at the extremes? reply Andrex 8 hours agorootparentIf unionization were endemic to the global economy, that might work. Lacking that, power dynamics are such that workers need protections enshrined in legislation. If salaries are a race-to-the-bottom, nobody benefits except the ones doing the hiring. You may have a \"job,\" but the market salary average would be depressed while the companies enjoy a large talent pool of replaceable workers. If I didn't know history too well, I likely wouldn't hold this position. But it's clear as day if you crack open a history book. reply madrox 8 hours agorootparentUnions were on my mind when I read this. However, for some reason unions don't tend to take over in creative fields or fields of passion. SAG-AFTRA is the only exception to this that I can think of. This is why I think it's become common practice for tech companies to profit share. We take it for granted now, but it's not common...especially for artists. reply Andrex 8 hours agorootparent\"Creative\" unionization (for lack of a better term) doesn't pop up often in the news but it's absolutely out there and growing.

It also must be said that during the Hollywood strikes last year, it was the Writer's Guild that drove the talks and were the ones to get the studios to capitulate. And I find writing to be the building block of creativity and passion for a lot of industries. Every story starts somewhere, these days usually on a writer's PC. That the WGA is demonstrably one of the strongest unions in America makes me very happy, but a little forelorn other unions aren't nearly as strong. IATSE isn't regarded nearly as respectfully in Hollywood, for instance. reply financypants 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen would candidates compete to work for less? I haven’t seen that demonstrated anywhere. I have seen firms compete on pay. reply Andrex 8 hours agorootparent> When would candidates compete to work for less? The first example to jump out in my mind is gov't contractors, which isn't a direct analogue to workers but the mentality of undercutting your competition to get ahead is basic human nature IMO. Two candidates vying for the same job wouldn't consciously sabotage each other (let's assume). But if they both give a salary quote, why wouldn't the lower-priced candidate be a more appealing hire? With no protections, it would come down to whoever is willing (or able) to cut more pieces of their body off to win the job. And that behavior is not conducive to a well-functioning economy that supports a large and contented middle class, which is the preferred economic status of all state actors. reply badosu 8 hours agorootparentprevWhen they can replace you no matter how talented you are, it only takes hiring the next bright eyed young aspiring artist. reply madrox 9 hours agorootparentprevI tend to agree with you. In the end, salary reflects what the market will put up with, and if you're not willing to take a salary hit to work in games, someone else will. This is why I don't think regulation will fix this. It has to be on the individual to decide what's right for them. reply Ecstatify 8 hours agorootparentYeah let’s get rid of minimum wage while we’re at it. reply madrox 8 hours agorootparentMinimum wage does solve a certain kind of unskilled worker exploitation. I don't think passion tends to be at play for minimum wage jobs. This is a different kind of exploitation that's more difficult to regulate. reply swells34 8 hours agorootparentprevI'd much rather implement a maximum wage, would do a huge amount of good for our society. Let's say a cap on any more than $10M a year for total wealth gain for any individual. Everything else is taxed at 100%. Suddenly, we could all have healthcare, kids would get the supplies they need for school, a UBI scheme would be doable. Basically, we could finally stop acting like a poor third world country. reply jazzyjackson 8 hours agorootparentThis is literally how the freemasons started as a secret society btw. After the black plague there were salary caps on skilled labor but the masons decided to hell with that and colluded to demand higher wages under the table if you wanted a cathedral or a city hall built they held all the leverage reply j7ake 8 hours agorootparentprevPlease explain why taxing people beyond $10M at 100% will result in better social programs? Your theory can also be countered with another theory: people making a certain amount of money will simply leave the country, leaving you with less tax revenue than the current system. Also, how does one tax unrealized stock market gains (which is what most wealthy people's wealth are)? I have not seen that policy anywhere and I imagine it would be very difficult to implement. reply Gormo 7 hours agorootparentprev> Suddenly, we could all have healthcare, kids would get the supplies they need for school, a UBI scheme would be doable. Could you explain the reasoning by which the policy you propose would be expected to produce these outcomes? reply tomcam 8 hours agorootparentprevIs it your thought that a 100% tax rate would increase the productivity of those being taxed at that rate? Or even leave it unchanged? reply lacrimacida 7 hours agorootparentNot exactly 100% but high enough to keep greed in check after a certain cap reply tomcam 7 hours agorootparentHow much would keep people motivated while solving the problems of society? reply lotsofpulp 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy tax income? Wealth should be taxed. The problem is hoarding, not doing valuable work. For example, owning land that is empty or an empty building for years just so it appreciates deprives the community. Tax the shit out of it so it forces the owner to use it productively or sell it so someone else can figure out how to use it productively. reply tomcam 7 hours agorootparentIf you use your car only couple of days a week, should you be taxed more on your car than someone who uses theirs every day of the week? What about a piano you haven’t practiced on for a few years? The expensive ski boots you haven’t touched since high school? reply lotsofpulp 4 hours agorootparentMaybe, but we can at least start with the more fundamental resources that have to be shared amongst people and are in limited quantities, such as land. Driving giant pickup trucks for no productive reason also uses up a societal resource, and increases societal risks, so I would not mind seeing extra taxes on those compared to more reasonable methods of transport, and a case could be easily made that all personal vehicles should be taxed much higher to incentivize public transit construction and use. Society is not losing out much if you don’t use your ski boots since college, but maybe society does benefit if you consume less throwaway things, so a generally increased tax on consumption, perhaps based on mass and distance (since more mass moved further distances takes more energy to move) might work. Easiest way to do this is simply 10x tax on fossil fuels, it will flow down to everything. Tax things you don’t want. Taxing the result of productive work (income) is disincentivizing something we do want. We want people working hard and striving to do the difficult tasks that are in short supply of expertise (and higher income). reply tomcam 48 minutes agorootparentDoes property tax count in your scheme? Do you understand that for many people in the world, the car you or at least people in your peer group might drive would be the equivalent of a giant pickup truck to them? Who decides what a reasonable method of transportation is? For example, the bus system is terrible where I live. Am I allowed to have a pickup truck under your scheme or should that be taxed the same as if I had a better mass transit system near me? How would you monitor use of my pickup truck to be sure I was using it practically in a way that meets your requirements for proper pickup truck usage? reply jazzyjackson 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is neo-georgism, no? I knew somebody always advocating for this while simultaneously resigned to the fact it wouldn't ever be pulled off (too much inertia in the status quo i guess) but i like it a lot better than \"eat the rich\" reply jahewson 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah so that’s not how taxes work. reply s1artibartfast 8 hours agorootparentprev100% would agree. reply Andrex 8 hours agorootparentDon't worry, you types will just get AI to do everything for you for free eventually anyways. Right? Myopic. reply s1artibartfast 5 hours agorootparentno, I just think that minimum wage is the worst possible way to address the issue, from an economic perspective. It would be far better to pay people what their work is actually worth, and then give them charity through the government, supported by taxes, if need be. Same goes for healthcare, which should absolutely not be a mandated part of employment. Pay people what they are worth, and let them buy healthcare. If we want to subsidize or provide charitable healthcare, then we can do so too. reply mcmoor 8 hours agorootparentprevThe solution for that is UBI not minimum wage reply Moru 8 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's a very uneven power balance. Big company using young inexperienced workers that just want a foot in the door on a childhood dream and have no idea how much their work is worth. Most companies knows to exploit this to the full. Especially known in arts, music and game industry. Less so with (metal) industry jobs where there are old unions helping the workers to a healthier power balance. Except for Musk that seems to be a strange new coin behaving like the industry did 200 years ago. reply tomcam 8 hours agorootparentDid people 100 years ago get stock options and similar forms of compensation along with their meager salaries? reply astrange 6 hours agorootparentprevAnime doesn't really have big companies. Maybe Aniplex (Sony) at most. reply double0jimb0 8 hours agorootparentprevTesla as an innovation-driven company couldn’t be further from the types of metal industry jobs you refer to. Why can’t an innovative company trade its “capital” to get the young and ambitious to work for less pay? reply dymk 9 hours agorootparentprevOf course, the children yearn for the mines! reply oatmeal1 8 hours agorootparentWhen the alternative is starving, they do. The problem isn't children being allowed to work in mines. The problem is the lack of superior alternatives available to them. reply kelnos 8 hours agorootparentRight, and in this case, the superior alternative should be an animator who makes a decent living. Sometimes, unfortunately, we have to legislate the superior alternative into existence. I'm not certain that's a good or necessary move in this particular case (I doubt there are many if any animators where their choice is to be an animator for low wages, or starve and live on the streets), but it's an option. I always thought it weird that we have minimum wage levels for hourly workers, but once you're salaried, you work however many hours your employer wants, or you get marginalized or fired. For many HNers that's not that big a deal, as our effective hourly wage still ends up to be many hundreds of dollars. But there are salaried workers down at the low end who are required to work quite a bit more than the 40 hours a week their \"nominal\" hourly wage might be calculated off of, and some of those people end up well below what a minimum wage would be for hourly workers. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparent> I always thought it weird that we have minimum wage levels for hourly workers, but once you're salaried, you work however many hours your employer wants, or you get marginalized or fired. This isn’t actually true in Japan though, and why so many people actually favor all the overwork. If you are salaried, and not on a specific kind of contract (my contract includes up to 45 hours of overwork), all your overwork is paid by the hour, with higher multipliers for late night work. Which is how people effectively double their salary. reply oatmeal1 5 hours agorootparentprev> Sometimes, unfortunately, we have to legislate the superior alternative into existence. There is nothing we have to do. And are there no animators currently making a decent living? Legislating a minimum wage does not give the animators extra leverage. The higher it is, the more employers will invest into technology to replace them. There are all kinds of ways to improve the lot of the disadvantaged. The minimum wage is one of the worst ways to do so. reply a_t48 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is what salary exemption in CA is for, in my understanding. Unless you're making more than twice minimum wage overtime must be paid, even if salaried. The bar may be even higher for certain professions (like software!) (Caveat that more of the world exists than CA) reply filoleg 8 hours agorootparentprev> Right, and in this case, the superior alternative should be an animator who makes a decent living. I mean, i am not entirely sure about animation, but there is a “superior” alternative to gamedev, and people still willingly choose it over being a software dev elsewhere. Despite gamedev having way worse WLB and worse pay. Most of gamedevs can easily just become SWEs at a tech company, get paid much more, work much less, and on any numerical metric do better. And many of them intentionally choose not to. And it isn’t for the lack of skill at all. If it was just due to the lack of superior alternatives, then we wouldn’t see this situation occurring in the gamedev/swe world. reply dymk 4 hours agorootparentprevI promise you children do not yearn for mines even when they're starving. At most, they'll begrudgingly enter the mines, and some might not come back. reply DANmode 8 hours agorootparentprevI might be missing some context due to your curt response. Are you implying that mines were once considered a high-class \"cool\" job to have, like working at Google, Uber, SpaceX, or Twitter was a decade+ ago (and still is today for many?)? What is the connection here, exactly? reply kelnos 8 hours agorootparentIt was sarcasm. The poster was referring to child-labor laws, that prohibit children from working in many conditions. Many of these laws are rooted in times when children would work in factories, mines, etc. in order to help their families make enough to survive, but, being children, were of course exploited. \"The children yearn for the mines!\" is a hyperbolic response that a caricature of a human might give if they were against the elimination of (legal) child labor. reply silisili 8 hours agorootparentImportant missing context here: the original saying was regarding Minecraft being among the most the popular games for children. reply dukeyukey 8 hours agorootparentprevYou're taking it too literally. The phrase \"the children yearn for the mines\" is a sarcastic meme phrase. reply DANmode 8 hours agorootparentYeah, I figured. This community tries not to do that, but instead of just downvoting, I was hoping to retain some value in their contribution, keep the conversation on topic. reply slothtrop 9 hours agorootparentprevThe \"children\" (i.e. working adults) have to go well out of their way to work on games and anime and know how much it pays. The mines (for real) in developed countries actually pay really well and are sometimes unionized. reply GuB-42 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause there are not many desirable traits. If people were really doing what they enjoyed, it would be fine, but the problem is that they often don't. I am thinking more about the video game industry, but I think there is a similar problem in animation and all other \"fun\" industry. People who get in these industries often want to get paid for what they already do for fun, being doodling or coding small games. Or maybe they see the big projects like a popular anime or a game they loved and want to be part of it. But in many cases, what they only get is a repetitive, not very creative, and high pressure job, with all the fun sucked out of it. Which would be fine if the pay was worth it, but it isn't, and the prospects are not great either, because the really interesting positions are few compared to the grunt work. Problem is that newcomers don't know that, or maybe hope they are special, and companies really play on that, schools too. What happens is that a few years later you get a bunch of guys that are completely drawn out, hopefully they find a better job elsewhere, to be replaced by a new batch of kids with a soon to be broken dream. Some are luckier and get the job they really wanted (it probably won't be you), and others are really unlucky because their skillset doesn't translate well to other industries and end up with burn out, depression and poverty. reply ParetoOptimal 8 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is it becomes collectively forced and the value of their labor is devalued. reply ycdxvjp 7 hours agoparentprevIt can be fixed. People need to learn some basic finance if they want to influence how creator economy businesses run. If you can't do that make friends with business experience who you can trust and rely on. If you can't do either, don't get into a creative field. Most of the time creatives just hand over all financial decisions completely to some one else. And then guess what, the financial engineers gain much more influence over how the business run.",

    "title": "Introducing Bun Shell: Streamlining Shell Scripting in JavaScript",
    "originLink": "https://bun.sh/blog/the-bun-shell",
    "originBody": "JavaScript is the world's most popular scripting language. So why is it hard to run shell scripts in JavaScript? import { spawnSync } from \"child_process\"; // this is a lot more work than it could be const { status, stdout, stderr } = spawnSync(\"ls\", [\"-l\", \"*.js\"], { encoding: \"utf8\", }); You could use APIs to do something similar: import { readdir } from \"fs/promises\"; (await readdir(\".\", { withFileTypes: true })).filter((a) => a.name.endsWith(\".js\"), ); But, that's still not quite as simple as a shell script: ls *.js Why existing shells don't work in JavaScript Shells like bash or sh have been around for decades. Shells are a solved problem!! Hacker News Commenter, probably. But, they don't work well in JavaScript. Why? macOS (zsh), Linux (bash), and Windows (cmd) all have slightly different shells with different syntaxes and different commands. The commands available on each platform are different, and even the same command can have different flags and behaviors. To date, npm's solution is to rely on the community to polyfill missing commands with JavaScript implementations. rm -rf doesn't work on Windows rimraf, the cross-platform JavaScript implementation of rm -rf, is downloaded 60 million times per week: Environment variables like FOO=bar doesn't work on Windows Setting an environment variable is different on each platform. Instead of running FOO=bar, you probably use & install cross-env: which is where on Windows Thus, another package with 60 million weekly downloads was born: Shells also take too long to start How long does it take to spawn a shell? On a Linux x64 Hetzner Arch Linux machine, it takes about 7ms: $ hyperfine --warmup 3 'bash -c \"echo hello\"' 'sh -c \"echo hello\"' -N Benchmark 1: bash -c 'echo hello' Time (mean ± σ): 7.3 ms ± 1.5 ms [User: 5.1 ms, System: 1.9 ms] Range (min … max): 1.7 ms … 9.4 ms 529 runs Benchmark 2: sh -c 'echo hello' Time (mean ± σ): 7.2 ms ± 1.6 ms [User: 4.8 ms, System: 2.1 ms] Range (min … max): 1.5 ms … 9.6 ms 327 runs If your intent is to run a single command, starting the shell can take longer than running the command itself. If you're running many commands in a loop, that gets expensive quickly. You could try embedding a shell, but that's really complicated and their license may not be compatible with your project. Are all these polyfills really necessary? In the world of 2009 - 2016, when JavaScript was still relatively new and experimental, relying on the community to polyfill missing functionality made a lot of sense. But it's 2024 now. JavaScript on the server is mature and widely adopted. The JavaScript ecosystem understands the requirements today in a way nobody did in 2009. We can do better. Introducing the Bun Shell The Bun Shell is a new experimental embedded language and interpreter in Bun that allows you to run cross-platform shell scripts in JavaScript & TypeScript. import { $ } from \"bun\"; // to stdout: await $`ls *.js`; // to string: const text = await $`ls *.js`.text(); You can use JavaScript variables in your shell scripts: import { $ } from \"bun\"; const resp = await fetch(\"https://example.com\"); const stdout = await $`gzip -c${buffer}`; console.log(buffer.toString(\"utf8\")); You can redirect stdout to a file: import { $, file } from \"bun\"; // as a file() await $`ls *.js > ${file(\"output.txt\")}`; // or as a file path string, if you prefer: await $`ls *.js > output.txt`; await $`ls *.js > ${\"output.txt\"}`; You can pipe stdout to another command: import { $ } from \"bun\"; await $`ls *.jsgrep foo`; You can even use Response as stdin: import { $ } from \"bun\"; const buffer = new Response(\"bar foo bar foo\"); await $`grep fooscript.bun.sh bun script.bun.sh How do I install it? Bun Shell is built into Bun. If you already have Bun v1.0.24 or later installed, you can use it today: bun --version 1.0.24 If you don't have Bun installed, you can install it with curl: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/installbash Or with npm: npm install -g bun",

Of course on paper that sounds fine. However, something that is missing from here is some assurances of how compatible it actually is with existing shells and coreutils implementations. Is it aiming to be POSIX-compliant/compatible with Bourne shell? I am going to assume that not all GNU extensions are available; probably something like mkdir -p is, but I'd be surprised if GNU find with all of its odds and ends are there. This might be good enough, but this is a bit light on the details I think. What happens when the system has GNU coreutils? If more builtin commands are added in the future, will they magically change into the Bun implementation instead of the GNU coreutils implementation unexpectedly? I'm sure it is/will be documented... Also, it's probably obvious but you likely would not want to surprise-replace a Bourne-compatible shell like ZShell with this in most contexts. This only makes sense in the JS ecosystem because there is already a location where you have to write commands that are going to be compatible with all of these shells anyways, so just standardizing on some more-useful subset of Bourne-compatible shell is mostly an upgrade, since that'll be a lot more uniform and your new subset is still going to be nearly 100% compatible with anything that worked across most platforms before, except it will work across all of the platforms as-intended. (And having the nifty ability to use it inside of JS scripts in an ergonomic way is a plus too, although plenty of JS libraries do similar things, so that's not too new.) reply sureglymop 2 hours agoparentWait but find isn't a builtin command right? What do you mean by the odds and ends of GNU find not being there? That doesn't depend on the shell, it's an external program being called. reply jackhalford 32 minutes agorootparentIt does depend on the shell here, bun is reimplementing basic commands to make them cross platform, like rm -rf is not running the rm binary because that doesn’t work on windows reply abhinavk 3 hours agoparentprevI have recently switched to using Nushell as my default shell. They were also writing their own but recently decided instead to begin incorporating github.com/uutils/coreutils (Rust rewrite of GNU coreutils). They target uutils to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU are treated as bugs. reply Aerbil313 21 minutes agorootparentYeah, this is nice but also sad. GNU coreutils is ancient at this point. I know this is probably critical to get user share for nushell and not enough dev resources etc. but I’d wish they were innovating on this front too with simpler and less bloated coreutils, as they are already completely changing the shell paradigm. reply netghost 7 hours agoparentprevScanning to the bottom, it seems like the most likely use is to improve the ergonomics of simple scripts that need to shell out in some cases and also to streamline some of the more mundane package.json scripts, like deleting a directory when cleaning.

How much perf is there? Small commands like cd or ls I'm less interested in. You say you provide your own shell... bsh, zigsh, what? reply Jarred 8 hours agorootparentIt’s nearly all in Zig. The parser, lexer, interpreter, process execution and builtin commands are all implemented in Zig. There’s a JS wrapper that extends Promise but JS doesn’t do much else. The performance of the interpreter probably isn’t as good as bash, but the builtin commands should be competitive with GNU coreutils. We have spent a lot of time optimizing our node:fs implementation and this code is implemented similarly.

Although according to the linked issue, it has been \"fixed\", I still ran into a problem during a batch script that was calling imagemagick through a shell for each file in a massive directory; profiling was telling me that starting (not completing) (yes, I was using the async version) the child process increasingly slows, from sub-millisecond for the first few spawns, to eventually hundreds of milliseconds or seconds... Eventually I had to resort to doing only single spawn of a bash script that in turn did all the shelling out. It seems that the linked execa still relies on child_process and therefore has the same issue.

They are a reasonably simple extension of template strings, which allow constructing strings very easily by allowing arbitrary code to be put inside a ${} block inside of template strings (ones that begin and end with backticks ` instead of single or double quotes). So if you think about it template strings are like a tagged template who's function just calls .toString() and concatenates each argument it is given. There are some really nice safe sql libraries that use this for constructing queries. They are useful basically anywhere you might want string interpolation and a bit of type safety, or special handling of different types. Lit Element is also a very clever usage of tagged templates. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 1 hour agorootparentI just wish they had something like pythons triple quotes or here docs or c++ r strings.

Typically server side and browser based JavaScript programs are deployed on Linux systems in production. Today if I want to reliably automate some scripting I do NOT use shell scripting because it makes a bunch of implicit dependencies on existing system. Instead I write these utility scripts in either JavaScript or PHP depending on the project and this seems to give JavaScript a slightly nicer consistent interface to perform basic functionality, built directly into the runtime. reply CuriouslyC 6 hours agoprevThis looks very cool on the surface. There are a lot of systems out there with a mishmash of javascript and shell, those systems are stitched together in arbitrary ways, and it can often make them hard to debug and test.

And if you don't like PowerShell, there's Nushell. reply marwis 1 hour agorootparentActually Powershell is terrible for piping anything native. It will damage whatever data you pipe. That's because unlike other shells where piping just passes through binary stream, Powershell is based around the concept of piping streams of .NET objects so it will try to parse output of one native command into a list of .NET strings, one for each line, and then print them out to input of another command.

I've seen and tried lots of solutions like that in different languages, but believe now it's a wrong level of abstraction. If you want to provide some crossplatform way to execute ls, providing an \"ls()\" function is much cleaner. Otherwise you start accumulating issues like: which flags are supported, does it support streaming, what about newlines in file names, how do you deal with non-utf filenames, what happens with colour output, is tty attached, etc. These are new problems which you didn't have when using the native JS filesystem functions. And when they bite you, it's not trivial to see where / why. None of the examples really look that hard to replace either. The current solutions are not great.

In some way, this is actually useful as people need to know the differences and possible new risks with an EV. On the other hand, it’s still biased. reply kramerger 17 hours agorootparentThere have been multiple stories about EVs getting stuck in snow then running out of battery and being towed. But the particular cases where the car itself has broken down seem to be limited to Teslas. Even in the heavily moderated Tesla Club Sweden forum people have started questioning the reliability of these cars in the winter. reply bbarnett 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's not biased to report \"car brand X becomes useless because of temps, unlike all other cars\" That is indeed a story, and should caution those in certain environments not to buy that brand. It also shows a lack of testing, to sell cars into a market, where they won't work reliably for part of the year. And a completely different tact, a car breaking down is expected. An entire production model being flawed, and defective, is not. This is not even slightly biased. reply thebruce87m 15 hours agorootparentprevOr… the Tesla ones are being amplified. I spent two hours in my car in 0C last week taking a call with my AC, heated seat and heated steering wheel on and the battery %age didn’t budge a single point. My conservative friends in Scotland are all eager to share “horror stories” of Teslas in Chicago with me. When a Tesla has a problem it literally makes world news. That should tell you how often these things happen. reply edgyquant 14 hours agorootparent0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit so we’re not talking about the same kinda of temperatures here. You’re talking about right at freezing, which can be common most everywhere in the northern hemisphere at least. The other is quite a bit colder but still common in the Midwest and actually cold places. This seems like a bad faith comment when looked at in that context. reply thebruce87m 14 hours agorootparentI’m sure most people on Hacker News are smart enough to realise I wasn’t saying it was equivalent since those are very different temperatures. Heat pump performance doesn’t scale linearly either, but even at 3x worse performance I could last for a long, long time stuck in a snow storm. reply edgyquant 14 hours agorootparentNo I don’t think so, the implication was that you were comparing them and saying it was overblown. These Teslas are having issues at single digit/zero degree Fahrenheit so your anecdotal rebuttal isn’t useful. reply thebruce87m 13 hours agorootparentI think you’re missing my point. I’ll choose the best faith and assume I didn’t convey it properly rather than you are intentionally missing it. Here it is again: * I live in Scotland * I am subject to Scottish weather * In my Scottish weather the car operates just fine * My conservative friends are sharing stories of a handful of issues people are having in another country as proof of… something. Not sure exactly what but some culture war thing they have been tricked into spreading by their influencers. * Tesla stories are therefore amplified. There were a bunch of ICE cars also having issues but you don’t hear about them. reply bbarnett 12 hours agorootparentThere are absolutely zero ICE cars having issues at 0F, let alone -40C, unless they are defective, or poorly maintained. Frankly, you're making a false equivalence here. You're conflating \"teslas in perfect factory delivery order\" not working at normal winter temps, with \"a poorly maintained or defective ICE car\" not working. It's not the same thing. At all. I've driven all sorts of cars sold in North America, and -40C? Fine. I've owned VWs, Toyotas, GMs, my neighbours have all manner of cars. No one has problems with -40C. No one. ICE cars, in good working order are fine, and start and work reliability at -40C. Teslas, it would seem, do not. That is not someone picking on EVs. Really, EV tech is very new, compared to ICE. reply thebruce87m 11 hours agorootparentYou’re saying that ICE cars don’t have issues at -40C? I can’t possibly take this to be good faith in any way. And any evidence I could provide you will claim that they are “poorly maintained”.

They seem to be saying, > ICE cars, in good working order are fine, and start and work reliability at -40C. ...and they're mostly correct. In that sort of weather, you just use a bit higher concentration of antifreeze in your coolant mixture. Fuel will usually start freezing at a colder temperature as well. Hope you enjoy doing your things! p.s.) fun fact: one need not specify C or F or K when the value is -40 degrees :) reply thebruce87m 9 hours agorootparentI have no experience with those temperatures but it seems that cars that are exposed to these conditions need a whole host of ways to deal with it, special fluids, block heaters and systems to automatically start the car if it falls below certain temperatures. Given that I think if we had a -40 snap in Scotland a great many brand new in-spec ICE cars would fail to start. Or is this all wrong and you can just turn the key on any old ICE and go? Genuine question since I don’t live in conditions like those. And reading the Reddit thread here suggests that a great many EV owners are doing just fine in extreme temperatures: https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/194yg8x/how_are_yo... Maybe that’s not -40 and they’ll all fail then? reply ImPostingOnHN 9 hours agorootparent> it seems that cars that are exposed to these conditions need a whole host of ways to deal with it, special fluids, block heaters and systems to automatically start the car if it falls below certain temperatures - They don't need \"a whole host of ways to deal with it\". - They don't need \"special fluids\", just normal ones any other car needs, properly selected for the climate. - They don't need block heaters - They don't need systems to automatically start the car if it falls below -39 degrees. Given that, I don't think if there was -40 degree weather, a great many brand-new in-spec ICE cars would fail to start. After all, some places reach that weather, and the cars don't. Yes, you can turn the key and go, in -40 degree weather. You will be cold while the car heats up, but it will turn over, at least within 2 or 3 tries. The requirements are the ones you have for maintaining an ICE car in any weather: proper oil, proper coolant mixture, and proper battery maintenance. You can admittedly get away with failing at these, in less extreme climate. For example, in the south, it can be hot enough that you can use water, with no antifreeze at all, as coolant. As for your reddit thread, I wouldn't trust it as an accurate measure of anything, but that's neither here nor there. I'm not interested in a contest between the two, so I'll remain on the topic of whether a properly-maintained ICE car would just work in -40 degree weather (it would). reply CyberDildonics 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy were you running your AC while heated seats and steering wheel were on and why run the AC when it is freezing outside? reply wcoenen 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet there are no such stories from the many Tesla drivers in places like Canada and Norway. Just guessing, but could it just be that rapid EV growth resulted in a lot of relatively new EV drivers in Chicago? And some of these new drivers didn't know yet about battery behavior in the cold, and how to mitigate it with battery preconditioning? reply porphyra 15 hours agorootparentNorway uses a different charging connector. On the other hand, the event in Chicago was clearly a freak event and in no way reflects the normal operation of Tesla charging infrastructure in cold weather (elsewhere in North America, where it was also very cold, the vast majority of Teslas were fine). reply ijhuygft776 18 hours agoparentprevIm glad I rented a Tesla (as opposed to buy one)...

I will offer a very cynical answer: NPR and The Guardian (which is misrepresenting the scope and cause - see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39065628) have an axe to grind, but need to walk a fine line as to come across as being anti-EV. reply tw04 18 hours agorootparent>One should wonder why the title (and story) is not about EVs generally? Because you're taking it out of context? The story is about Tesla owners having issues getting their cars charged and long supercharger lines which both occurred. There were no reports of long-lines at CCS chargers that I heard of on any of the EV forums I participate in. The \"not specific to the carmaker\" was in regard to Lithium batteries (generically) struggling in super-cold weather. Furthermore, you completely disregard the fact there's an entire section about how other Tesla owners weren't having issues charging in the cold. Between the two I guess the question is do you have an axe to grind with NPR or are you just upset there's negative (deserved) press about Tesla supercharging struggling in sub-zero temps? Some of it is their fault, some of it is an education thing, but Tesla also does a pretty horrible job of educating owners on charging etiquette. reply andsoitis 17 hours agorootparent> Between the two I guess the question is do you have an axe to grind with NPR or are you just upset there's negative (deserved) press about Tesla supercharging struggling in sub-zero temps?

You had large numbers of people literally having to get their cars towed. If I lived in Chicago and needed to charge my car, I'd absolutely want this reported on. Anytime there has been a gas shortage and long lines (like when Florida faces a hurricane) it is quite newsworthy. Both for the people that live in the area (so they can make other accommodations) and nationally so they know they should probably stay clear of the area. Are you running around complaining about that reporting as well? >There are way more interesting and important issues to report on, and I wish that NPR, which is one of my main news sources, would do a better job. Like what? You're acting as if there's some major breaking story they ignored to report on this. Can you point to anything beyond a vague \"there's other things they could report on and this isn't interesting to me personally\"? You haven't actually stated why this isn't newsworthy beyond you don't feel it is. What about \"hey don't go to a supercharger if you live in Chicago and it's super cold\" isn't important or newsworthy to Tesla owners/renters/drivers? reply edgyquant 18 hours agorootparentprevOkay, how about one of literally any other news source (I found this on ground news and picked NPR to avoid being accused of conservative bias) https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/17/business/tesla-charging-c... https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/dead-teslas-oak-brook.amp https://abc7news.com/amp/chicago-area-tesla-charging-station...

Ok this particular issue I would defend Tesla because I do think the story is blown out of proportion (with different news outlets having differing motivations).

That is owner data, not company data and it should be stored in a cryptographically secure manner accessible only to the owner themselves. This is entirely possible to implement but it just isn't because it would be forfeiting part of their information asymmetry that Telsa enjoys over it's customers/market. reply usrusr 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that's the obvious motivation at the surface, I never questioned that.

Also the Tesla uses Cameras instead of Lidar which is mentioned in the article, so they already had a million cameras they could give a driver access to. Jeep having access to my cameras though?

Any car that has cameras on the car that looks at the interior of the car should not have been purchased in the first place. OF COURSE they will be looking at video when they shouldn't be. Has there ever been an example of a company that hasn't? Ring has done it. Roomba has done it. Open it to any data not just camera, and people like Uber have used that data for nefarious purposes. Any device that sends back data to the home office is just too ripe for misuse. Then, when it comes out in examples like this that it has occured, there is 0 liability for the company involved.

Tesla also does let you do geofencing with Sentry mode, but I opted to have it running at work and off at home.

If I walk into a relative's house and they have a fscking camera pointed at me, which believe it or not is usually the case, I will complain about it, turn around, and walk back out of the house. If they have a device under the control of a third party that has a microphone on it, I will shut down any conversation that I wouldn't want said third party listening to. This is beyond what I do with my own personal devices. I know this must make me seem rude or anti-social in many cases, but I really don't know how to get the message across about what's happened along with its very real impact. Not long ago the partner of a relative of mine decided to get drunk when the relative was visiting me. Because they were drunk they weren't answering their phone, my relative got themself all worked up about it. They called the alarm company and talked to what sounded like some 19 year old kid who said, \"I see a naked person walking around in the living room on your video feed.\" Somehow my relative was actually okay with this. It didn't occur to them that maybe they probably didn't want random kids staring at them naked in their own living rooms, which is exactly what was happening at that very moment. I gave an ultimatum that I would never visit their house again so long as they had those cameras installed. Only then did my relative remove them. I couldn't believe that they actually seemed okay with the fact that this kid was looking at their naked partner in their own living room. Now I guess I have to have a new rule: Do not get in vehicles that spy on you. The trouble at this point is that it may become more and more difficult to tell for sure which vehicles do that and which don't. There is an increasingly lengthening list of reasons why I would never want to be in a Tesla specifically, so that's an easy one to avoid, but many other car manufacturers at the very least track your location all the time. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them also uploaded video and audio feeds from surveillance devices integrated in the vehicle, right along with your location telemetry. reply crote 17 hours agoparent\"Fun\" fact: cars having the capability to relay your conversations and location are increasingly becoming mandatory.

In my ideal world we have more news sources that can and attempt to do that more effectively. reply ImPostingOnHN 18 hours agorootparentprevMan who constantly begs the world to look at him, attention seeker with no qualms about endorsing anti-semetic conspiracy theories in public, is actually the victim of a global conspiracy to give him the attention he wants, when he truly seeks privacy, and to not be talked about, his fans say. reply cowpig 18 hours agoparentprev [–] Where did you get this quote from?

I do think there should be more opportunities to connect people across the world. I think if more people connected directly there be less faith in the filtered messages we get from our media and politicians. To the creator of this: - Thanks for creating! - A small recommendation: maybe a little text paragraph on the landing page explaining it might warm people up a bit as to what to expect. Doesn’t need to be much and doesn’t need to be paragraphs of marketing babble. Actually, please def no to marketing babble… lol. But I think we’re conditioned to get a little explanation before jumping in. Not a critique at all! I love this. And its just my 2 cents. reply ethbr1 17 hours agoparentAgreed! I ended up talking with someone halfway around the world for an hour. We discussed what we did, some interesting differences... and it also turned out that everyone everywhere has at least a few gripes about their project management system (whatever it is). We're all more alike than we are different. :) Thanks to author for making this! PS: If HNers are uncomfortable talking to strangers via voice, maybe write out a script with some discussion prompts. It's a learnable skill, and something you can absolutely get better at! (Said as someone who started with crippling fear of talking to strangers, into my 20s) reply tbwriting 17 hours agoparentprevAgreed. If voice chat isn’t your thing: talkkshopp.com reply vegancap 19 hours agoprevIf the thought of voice chats with randomly selected strangers didn't terrify me slightly, I think this would be an awesome idea. For the more out-going among us, can imagine some cool conversations and ideas coming out of this reply delusional 19 hours agoparentSlightly? I opened the page before completely processing the title and panicked like a boy forgetting to close his porn before bringing his laptop to school. Don't just invade my personal space like that. reply drakonka 18 hours agorootparentHahahah same exact experience here. Clicked the tab and it was like touching a stove as my brain caught up with the title - noped out immediately. Now reading through comments while trying to work up the guts to try it. Edit: I did it. I spoke with three people and it was really cool actually; thanks for sharing this. reply punkspider 18 hours agorootparentI'm in the same boat. I'm also very interested in talking to random HN users, but my hesitation comes from the fact that if I start a chat I'll really commit because I want to make it meaningful. I guess now I'm doing a cost-benefit analysis whether I should try this out while it's gaining popularity, or I should continue what I was working on. reply ethbr1 18 hours agorootparentI'll just put it out there that if you start talking with a random stranger, \"... okay, I've got to go now.

For some reason it's just more expensive when the government does it. reply fshr 14 hours agorootparentmaybe \"barely doing anything\" is better than doing nothing, though? reply LoganDark 13 hours agorootparentBelow a certain threshold, throwing money at public services is just going to get it diluted. This may not necessarily be a bad thing on its own, but when even the smallest public project seems to cost way more, you're never going to know if your $10M investment helped, or if it just went into someone's paycheck. reply CapstanRoller 12 hours agorootparentAre private projects better? I've never heard of a private alternative to SNAP or Medicare or Section 8, nor any interest in creating such programs. reply hkt 11 hours agorootparentTrue - the UK's NHS was a product of people realising there would never be universal health care if it was left to the market. reply hkt 11 hours agorootparentprevOpex is a valid form of public spending.

I find it difficult to break off conversations because if I meet a new human being I'm interested in I'll want to meaningfully connect and perhaps form a light friendship. reply hackernewds 17 hours agorootparentInstead of thinking about the speed bump, you could also just climb over the speed bump. it's not a mountain as it might seem :) reply aizyuval 18 hours agorootparentprevI talked with someone over an hour.

Have to say I prefer this over to text chats by a mile. Very fun start to my morning reply stephenitis 19 hours agoprevIn the age of replicated AI voices and security it seems like this would be a bad idea. How much voice sample is needed to decently replicate someone's voice? reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agoparentI wish I had a decent way to calibrate my paranoia about stuff like this. I don't want to miss life's nice opportunities just because I was too worried about this kind of thing. But I don't want to be too lax either. reply AlecSchueler 19 hours agoparentprevAnyone could record you for this purpose at any time. reply thfuran 17 hours agorootparentBut first they'd have to sneak into my house and somehow trick my into talking. reply ricardobeat 17 hours agorootparentOr, you know, find your LinkedIn or phone number and offer you an incredible work opportunity. reply LoganDark 15 hours agorootparentprevOr have you visit a convenient website that streams your voice to the internet? reply thfuran 13 hours agorootparentNo one could be that dastardly. reply hackernewds 17 hours agorootparentprevand do what with this exactly? technically the author could record all audio here, and use it for model training or snoop into the conversation reply AlecSchueler 7 hours agorootparentImpersonate your voice. Think of the old scam where someone texts you and says they're your granddaughter and they're stuck somewhere and need an urgent money transfer. In the old days the advice would be: call your granddaughter and have get confirm the story. But now with AI tech your granddaughter could call you up and deliver the scam in her own voice. reply kaba0 11 hours agoparentprevSo you also don’t go to the shopping centre because they could have a mic recording you? reply stephenitis 4 hours agorootparentas it pertains to this discussion, No i don't think people are reliably snooping my voices in a shopping centre. But I do go to shopping centers. I'd rather not sit down with a stranger without knowing them and in a format where I can be recorded. so Omegle would've been out. That said if this site had less anonymity and maybe a registration I would be more comfortable with it. reply explorigin 19 hours agoparentprevSee whisper-speech posted yesterday. reply thimkerbell 14 hours agorootparentWhisperSpeech – An open source text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39036796 reply echelon 18 hours agoparentprevWell tuned zero shot models can use 5 seconds of audio, but the results aren't perfect. You won't capture prosody information, for example. The human voice isn't as unique as you might think, though. You can encode a lot of information about a voice in about 100Kb. reply sdrothrock 17 hours agoprevThis is really neat! I thought I'd try it out before bed (in Japan) and I was talking to someone from Dallas (hi, if you see this!), but it disconnected us. :( reply Element_ 8 hours agoprevThis worked great, it would be cool if HN added a button for it in the header! reply pulkitsh1234 18 hours agoprevI am absolutely terrified of informal \"coffee chats\"... One company I worked for had a policy to do it \"few hours every week\" with some random person.. completely hated that. reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agoparentI get the impression that many extroverts see introversion as a flaw / limitation that should be corrected, rather than an equally valid personality type that they should accommodate. Apologies if I'm painting with an unfair or inaccurately broad brush. I may be vastly overestimating the prevalence of that attitude. reply chrisandchris 18 hours agoparentprevSome people would be happy if they're paid just to talk to somebody _few hours_ during worktime about non work-related stuff. reply HL33tibCe7 17 hours agorootparentThe kind of people who work in HR (which is why these schemes get set up) reply joshuamcginnis 17 hours agoprevI just shared a nice chat with a gentleman from Detroit working on some interesting LLM stuff.

Is it E2EE directly between you and the other person? The website doesn't say much before you click the Start button. Everything has tradeoffs, and implementation details matter. reply imhoguy 12 hours agoparentI have no means to check this page on my mobile now, but if it was me making it I would have used WebRTC, plus some backend to pair random peers.

Was fun to connect with another hacker over morning coffee. reply scooke 10 hours agoprevHow does it know we are HN users? reply michaelaiello 17 hours agoprevSpoke with folks in Brazil, Switzerland and Minnesota. So much fun. reply aizyuval 18 hours agoprevI talked with the one who build it over it, it’s great. He’s a very nice guy and we had a great conversation.

Text to a random person, and, maybe ask for optional keywords to match on, for slightly less random. reply shlant 19 hours agoparentprevI assume because video is hard and/or expensive reply runlaszlorun 17 hours agorootparentShouldn’t be with WebRTC, right? I haven’t used it a lot but the scalability issues I’ve heard of with are due to the fact that p2p _group_ video is an n^2 problem by its nature. reply imhoguy 12 hours agorootparentprevIt is quite simple with p2p WebRTC, like Jitsi did that, and perhaps still do. reply withinboredom 19 hours agoparentprevyeah, what about people who cannot talk? reply hkt 18 hours agorootparentMaybe an IRC channel would be good. Libera (nee freenode) would seem like a natural home. reply sourcegrift 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat would you propose? Video? What about people who are invisible? Just because you haven't seen anyone as such doesn't mean they don't exist. reply C0mm0nS3ns3 18 hours agorootparentHe probably meant text. Which is what I had in mind when I asked the question too. Text is way cheaper than audio and you can opt in audio after an text ice breaker. reply withinboredom 15 hours agorootparentprevWow. Mute or deaf people are real, invisible people are not. reply svkris_18 16 hours agoprevThis is an awesome idea.I just had a brief chat with a HN'er from Ontario (hi, if you see this) and I am from India.

More importantly, the purpose of language is communicate. If the sender and recipient achieve mutual understanding then language has been used effectively. Spelling and grammar are meant to be descriptive and not prescriptive. reply stephenitis 18 hours agorootparentI started to think about this.

Comments (2) The Ingenuity helicopter, imaged on Mars by the Perseverance rover on Aug. 2, 2023. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter has gone incommunicado. Ingenuity's handlers lost contact with the 4-pound (1.8 kilograms) chopper on Thursday (Jan. 18), toward the end of its 72nd flight on Mars. \"Data Ingenuity sent to the Perseverance rover (which acts as a relay between the helicopter and Earth) during the flight indicates it successfully climbed to its assigned maximum altitude of 40 feet (12 meters),\" NASA officials wrote in an update on Friday (Jan. 19). \"During its planned descent, communications between the helicopter and rover terminated early, prior to touchdown,\" they added. \"The Ingenuity team is analyzing available data and considering next steps to reestablish communications with the helicopter.\" Related: Mars helicopter Ingenuity phones home, breaking 63-day silence Ingenuity and Perseverance landed together in February 2021 on the floor of the 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero Crater, which harbored a big lake and a river delta billions of years ago. Perseverance is hunting for evidence of past Mars life and collecting samples for future return to Earth. Ingenuity is serving as a scout for the car-sized rover, on an extended mission that NASA granted after the little chopper aced its original five-flight technology-demonstrating campaign in the spring of 2021. It might be time for Perseverance to return the favor and help its little robotic cousin out. \"Perseverance is currently out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection,\" NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages both robots' missions, said via X on Friday.

NASA loses contact with Ingenuity Mars helicopter : Read more The Ingenuity Mars helicopter is a fantastic achievement and will clearly influence all subsequent Mars exploration. However contrary to the claim made in this article, Ingenuity is not 'the first vehicle ever to explore the skies of a world beyond Earth'. In June 1985 the twin Soviet Vega probes deployed balloons into the atmosphere of Venus during their decent to the surface. Although the Vega 1 lander's science package got triggered early by storms in the atmosphere during decent, both balloons operated successfully for over 46hrs where they conducted a variety of atmospheric measurements. At this time Soviet space exploration was probably at its pinnacle, the French CNES coordinated international efforts to receive signals from the 2 balloons, including the support by the NASA deep space network. There is a model of the balloons at the Smithsonian Air and Space Udvar-Hazy Center. Reply MikeMc Wow, so averaging less than 2 minutes per flight. Hopefully, now that they know the technology works, they can design a better helicopter for the next rover, if there is one. Actually, a drone helicopter would also be very helpful to an astronaut mission to Mars. I’m sure a good sized helicopter could fit inside Starship. Starship should be ready for Mars in 8-10 years. I think they said that they would want around 100 flights without people aboard, first, just to be on the safe side.

Congrats! reply tedivm 14 hours agoprevThis is pretty sad but also pretty amazing. The original plan was for five flights of around 90 seconds each, and it looks like it finally failed on flight 72 with a total from all flights of two hours, eight minutes and eighteen seconds of flight time. All of this in an extremely thin atmosphere. reply wolverine876 12 hours agoparentWhile I think NASA is the most incredible organization in human history, be wary of simple underpromising-and-overdelivering: If everything they build lasts longer than expected, not only are they giving bad estimates (which perverts allocation of resources), they are way too smart and experienced to be doing it unintentionally. Now if Ford Motor underpromised on your car, telling you it would last 2 years, you wouldn't buy it in the first place - you'd never find out that it really lasts 10 years. But I suspect NASA gets away with it because everyone is blown away by even the underpromised result - helicopters on Mars, holy sh-! - and also nobody has experience with how long Martian helicopters typically fly. reply mturmon 6 hours agorootparentYou are proposing an interesting thought experiment or hypothetical (“to what extent was the design team expecting a 10x longer lifetime?”). That’s worth pondering. Furthermore, you are answering it with a “they must have known!” I just don’t see how you can know this. (For context, I work at JPL and interact regularly with some of the Perseverance team, but nobody from the helicopter team, which was very small.) Some context. The helicopter was originally quite controversial because it had no clear science rationale (mission science requirements did not imply a need for a helicopter). My understanding is that it was put on as a tech demo and (paraphrasing) cool thing. The lab director at the time was a proponent. Of course it was a huge success. Because of its precarious status, it was not designed to fly a lot. Planning flights takes a lot of resources, coordination with the rover takes resources, etc. Bandwidth, time, and people. My point is that the “plan” was kept small partly because these ancillary costs had to be kept down. This would hold even if the hardware could last forever. The tech demo must not get in the way of the prime science mission, which had already been planned. The use of COTS components is another factor. The effects of radiation on microprocessors (in the Mars-surface or deep space environment) are not really well known, as a practical matter. There is just not much engineering experience with how bad it can get. So the longevity of the Snapdragon was (AFAIK) highly uncertain, not to mention whatever other COTS components were on it. Hope this context is helpful. reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparentHey - thank you! I really appreciate hearing from someone who actually knows what they are talking about. I know nothing about the helicopter in particular but as I pointed out, NASA seems to very frequently underestimates longevity and performance (not a crime at all and maybe politically wise); I can't remember when they've overestimated. Forget my impressions in prior posts - how and why does that actually happen? > tech demo ... precarious ... not much engineering experience Also, while I've taken the opportunity of spare resources to do experiments (though not usually on Mars), I'm careful about timing and appearances - I don't want to embarass my team or partners with a failure that's visible to outsiders who wouldn't understand it was an experiment, and would think we just failed at our jobs. Everything NASA does seems to be on a very public stage, interpreted by endless outsiders (like on HN :) ). The whole world watched the helicopter's first flight. How can someone approve the helicopter, and promotion of its flight, and risk the world saying, for the next decade, 'that crazy helicopter embarassment shows we need to rein in NASA', blah blah blah? NASA's reputation is very important to humanity. Thanks for sharing what you know. You guys do amazing things; people are so jaded that they don't realize how incredible it is. reply skykooler 5 hours agorootparentFor very expensive projects like mars landers, it's imperative that everything is very reliable. If the mission plan is 5 flights, that means the systems need to be reliable enough that there's a 99.9% chance that it will successfully complete those five flights. But that also means that there's, say, a 98% chance that it can successfully complete 20 flights and maybe a 80% chance that it could complete over 50 flights. So these extended missions are really a consequence of building things to complete the primary mission as effectively as possible. reply gizmo686 12 hours agorootparentprevThey never said the helicopter would break down after 5 flights. They said it was designed for 5 flights. Shipping it to Mars is expensive and slow, so they build in a lot of margin to increase the odds that they meet the requirements. Take a much more common example: expiration dates. A product going bad before its expiration date is an issue. Potential a massive one that could kill people. A product that remains in good condition after its expiration date is fine. As a result, expiration dates almost always occur far before the product actually expires. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparent> They never said the helicopter would break down after 5 flights. They said it was designed for 5 flights. That is salesperson talk. NASA has been doing public communication half a century too, and they know what people will take from it. reply bnralt 7 hours agorootparentI've found NASA's communication to be misleading in general. A while back I tried to dive into their spinoff claims, and there were a lot of exaggerations there. There's a reason why you hear press releases from NASA saying things like \"Research done on the ISS could help cure Alzheimers!\", but you don't hear Alzheimer researchers going \"Man, that research on the ISS really helped us piece together what was happening.\" Or \"NASA says there's going to be a major announcement tomorrow about a discovery on Mars!\", and the discoveries are usually \"we've found yet more evidence that Mars used to be wet.\" Even the missions themselves - there's been a lot of talk about how Perseverance is collecting samples as the first part of a mission to send them back to earth. But the difficulty is in launching a return flight from Mars, something we're nowhere close to being able to do at the moment. You have to wonder how much of the sample caching is really useful, and how much is just a way to look as if were making progress on something that's still incredibly far away. reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparentTo be clear, I'm not saying they are wasting resources, I'm saying they just underestimate. reply ygjb 8 hours agorootparentprevMeh. I don't think your position makes sense. Your assessment of the estimates is basically MBA talk. They designed the helicopter for 5 flights. It is very likely the case that the requirements that a rotary wing aircraft can operate for 5 flights with minimal operator intervention, and only between missions, resulted in an helicopter that had a longer lifespan. Could they have done it cheaper? Maybe, probably, but most likely with a much higher risk of failure, and given the time, distance, and cost, and the organization doing the work, I am pretty confident that the team made the right choice. reply aurareturn 8 hours agorootparentThey designed the helicopter for at least 5 flights. It's just PR. Classic underpromising and overdelivering. NASA is a an entity that seeks public support and funding. Saying they over delivered by 16x is a good way to get the public, such as people in this thread, to think they're doing great. reply acdha 7 hours agorootparentIt’s more than PR: it’s recognizing that there is a massively greater cost to failure because fixing even a small problem is impossible. When you’re designing something with sufficient robustness to hit that minimum success requirement, it’s almost certain that you’ll be able to exceed it by a large margin. NASA is willing to pay more to avoid failures, and given their funding model that’s almost certainly the right call. Think about it like having to get across town after work for some reason. If it’s your buddy’s party and it’ll run all night, you might take the bus or call an Uber but it’s no big deal if you’re a few minutes late. If it’s your party, you might pay to park your car nearby or have a ride waiting for you. If it’s the meeting where you’re selling your company or announcing your presidential campaign, you might have a helicopter waiting on the roof. NASA’s stuff is all like that last case because the base costs are so high - shipping anything to another planet and waiting years to do it again, if you are given the chance, costs so much more that it makes sense to pay extra to build everything with deep safety margins just so you can say the odds of failure are comfortably low. reply aurareturn 7 hours agorootparentIt’s underpromising and over delivering. They knew internally that it could fly 16x more. They just didn’t want to say it in a statement publicly. reply glenstein 4 hours agorootparentActively promising outcomes that push equipment to the brink of failure would be malpractice and the planners would deservedly be fired. These are novel and truly unprecedented space missions. There may yet be a future in which we can confidently predict outcomes at scale, but we are not there yet. Being conservative in assumptions is a virtue, and hopefully is emulated in every future mission. reply rvnx 6 hours agorootparentprevIt also means costs and estimates are incorrect and a potential waste of public resources reply coryrc 5 hours agorootparentprevThey knew it would last exactly 80 flights? Wow, they are good. reply bnralt 5 hours agorootparentprevThe PR is how they're reporting it. \"We want an minimum of 20, but it could make upwards of 200 flights before giving out\" isn't as punch as they want. They want to say, \"We only are planning on 5 flight. WOW, 15 flights?! Wait wait wait...NOW IT'S UP TO 40 FLIGHTS?!?!\" (And if your target is at least 20 but you say it's 5, you can miss your target and still claim you succeeded.) Look at the reporting from NASA. For instance[1]: > “Less than a year ago we didn’t even know if powered, controlled flight of an aircraft at Mars was possible,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Now, we are looking forward to Ingenuity’s involvement in Perseverance’s second science campaign. Such a transformation of mindset in such a short period is simply amazing, and one of the most historic in the annals of air and space exploration.” ** > “This upcoming flight will be my 22nd entry in our logbook,” said Ingenuity chief pilot Håvard Grip of JPL. “I remember thinking when this all started, we’d be lucky to have three entries and immensely fortunate to get five. Now, at the rate we’re going, I’m going to need a second book.” \"One of the most historic in the annals of air and space exploration\"? Or here[2]: > NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter completed 71 flights since first taking to the skies above the Red Planet on April 19, 2021, far exceeding its originally planned technology demonstration of up to five flights. Of course, this makes it to the Wiki article[3]: > The helicopter's performance and resilience in the harsh Martian environment have greatly exceeded expectations. The aircraft surpassed its required altitude and flight duration specifications soon after beginning operations on Mars. This allowed Ingenuity to perform far more flights than were initially expected of the aircraft. Or look at how XKCD has a comic about \"Wow, I can't believe this rover exceeded our expectations by so much!\" for both Spirit[4] and Opportunity[5]. At this point, it's hard to not see this framing as NASA spin, one that people keep falling for over and over again. [1] https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9146/nasa-extends-ingenuity-helic... [2] https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Helicopter-High... [3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter) [4] https://xkcd.com/695/ [5] https://xkcd.com/1504/ reply glenstein 4 hours agorootparentThe XKCD comics do not at all suggest that we are supposed to treat the unexpected longevity of the missions as spin from NASA. One is a playfully satirical exaggeration of capabilities. To the extent it offers a commentary, is fully crediting a rover for it's toughness and longevity. The other approaches the longevity from a perspective of sentimental affection for an innocent rover who grows increasingly lonely as it's mission grows longer and longer. It does not imply prior knowledge or PR spin on the past of NASA. reply bnralt 4 hours agorootparentThe whole reason why people think of it as being an incredible amount of longevity is because of the NASA spin. Both of those say the planned mission was for 90 days, and so you get things like the exchange in the Opportunity comic of \"11 years, wow.\"/\"Wasn't the original mission 90 days?\"/\"This is starting to get weird.\", or things like the Spirit comic having \"Day 1944 of 90.\" Neither of these really work if NASA says, \"We're hoping for a decade, but our minimum goals are 90 days.\" It works because of the NASA spin, \"Wow, this was only supposed to be a 90 day mission/5 flights, but we can't believe how much these things have exceeded our expectations!\" If people are continuously telling you their work is so amazing that they're blown away by how much the results have exceeded their expectations, you should probably question how honest they're being with you. reply nurettin 3 hours agorootparentprevCyberdyne industries: You were designed to live for eight years. Cyberdyne industries: I never said you would die at the end! Aieee my eyes! reply bryanlarsen 12 hours agorootparentprevA 99% chance of lasting 5 flights is likely the same build as a 50% chance of lasting 72. OTOH there is approximately 0% chance a Ford is going to last 10 years without any maintenance or repairs. reply tracerbulletx 12 hours agorootparentprevOr the estimates are based around guaranteeing a high statistical chance they hit the estimate which is perfectly fine to do. reply Buttons840 12 hours agorootparentYeah, I've often wished organizations I've worked for would define what an \"estimate\" is. Do they want an estimate I think there's a 50% chance we'll hit, or do they want an estimate I think there's a 99% chance we'll hit? In my experience they want the 50% estimate and expect us to hit that estimate 99% of the time. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, same thing - and I think we can assume that NASA has people smart enough to know it's the same thing. reply jakobson14 8 hours agorootparentprevFord knows how to build cars after building them for 100+ years. There's nobody who has ever tried to fly a helicopter on mars before. NASA built in lots of margin to help ensure they met their objective, especially considering that it's really fucking hard to get a new helicopter to mars if it breaks. reply sowbug 6 hours agorootparentprevAs the expression goes, \"Any idiot can build a bridge that stands, but it takes an engineer to build a bridge that barely stands.\" reply dylan604 10 hours agorootparentprevOR, it's design a thing to work for the mission that had been designed/approved/funded. Any science that can continue after the missions actual experiments have concluded is just bonus. Would you want the thing to be designed at any lower caliber just because it was only needing to do 5 short durations? Would it actually be any cheaper? Doubtful. So, we keep having gear designed that shows us exactly what could happen for longevity while accomplishing the actual mission goals for the same budget reply sitharus 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s more like Ford sell you a car that’s guaranteed to have no breakdowns or need oil changes for the first two years. It might run a lot longer, but you they only promise two years so you plan to use it for that long. If it broke in those two years you’d be very upset, but if it does last longer that’s a bonus. reply mcmoor 10 hours agorootparentI think it's more like guarantee. If it breaks down in less than 2 years, you get your money back. Still, no one buy a car to only use it for its guarantee period. reply sitharus 1 hour agorootparentBut we’re not talking about literal cars. We’re talking about on-off speciality devices designed to perform a task where there is no possibility of repair or service. They’re overbuilt to provide the best chance that the main mission is accomplished. Once that’s done they can keep going until it breaks. reply userbinator 5 hours agorootparentprevStill, no one buy a car to only use it for its guarantee period. Unlike with software, where they call that \"support\" and try to scare you into their next version immediately after that ends. Unfortunately, the automakers are slowly picking up those practices from software. reply fsckboy 4 hours agorootparentprev>which perverts allocation of resources when they get the funding for the mission is when they make the lowball estimates, but with the funding they build equipment that is much more durable. It's hard to see where any perversion takes place reply wolverine876 4 hours agorootparentResources are allocated based on return on investment. If estimates are inaccurate, so are ROI projections. It's not just this project, but others too: How do you compare ROI of multiple projects all with inaccurate estimates? reply glenstein 4 hours agorootparentprevExactly, that's actually getting more bang for the buck. reply EasyMark 9 hours agorootparentprevNASA isn't a business.

There's a missing step in the argument where it would be necessary to explain why that is bad. reply boringg 8 hours agorootparentprevIf only the rest of the world hit their targets in the same way. The world would be much more reliable place. reply roughly 14 hours agoparentprevNASA’s got a history of their rovers overperforming like this. Between this and Webb, it’s hard to argue they’re not the best out there. reply jasonpeacock 14 hours agorootparentIt's less about being the best (no criticism of NASA) but rather engineering decisions to _guarantee_ the planned mission, which means you over-engineer and thus get extra performance/reliability. You're not willing to accept the statistical risk that may end a mission early. reply roughly 13 hours agorootparentI agree that it's not strictly that NASA engineers are better engineers, but I do think there's part of this that's both cultural and becomes actual capability - I think even if you gave most engineering organizations the budget and mandate that NASA has, they still wouldn't be able to pull off something like Webb because they don't have the practice of it*. Capacity both builds and atrophies over time, and most places don't work to that standard often enough to maintain the capability to do so even if they wanted to. (*I don't necessarily mean the practice of shooting a rocket into space and launching a telescope, but the ability to build an object that can perform that exactly to its specifications under those kinds of circumstances.) reply nordsieck 11 hours agorootparent> I think even if you gave most engineering organizations the budget and mandate that NASA has, they still wouldn't be able to pull off something like Webb because they don't have the practice of it IMO, Webb is a bad example. It was super over budget, late, and experienced a litany of problems. In contrast, most un-manned NASA projects are roughly on budget and generally have few issues. And even the ones that do, NASA often figures out how to correct them like the Hubble telescope. reply adastra22 11 hours agorootparent> In contrast, most un-manned NASA projects are roughly on budget and generally have few issues. This is simply not true. Maybe for some of the smallest Discovery or New Frontiers missions, but then those aren’t actually built by NASA/JPL. Mars Sample Return is also famously insanely late and over budget, and so have been most flagship missions. reply jorvi 8 hours agorootparentprevProbably one of the purest examples of American exceptionalism. Give other space agencies the budget of NASA, let experience marinate and you will see similar performance. NASA does not have some sort of magical intrinsic property that makes engineers perform better by sheer effect of working under its umbrella. reply wegfawefgawefg 7 hours agorootparentI think he was comparing nasa to corporations, not other national orgs. reply firesteelrain 10 hours agorootparentprev> NASA engineers are better engineers… JWST was built by primarily Northrop Grumman engineers reply falserum 13 hours agorootparentprevMostly, with any endeavour, you never start in advanced state, you have basic solution, then refine and grow it. I guess formula would be: tech skills x organisational quality x budget x iterations already under the belt. Any of these factors can bring down the total result to zero. Not an easy task trying to control all of these. Nasa, congrats on successful mission, which now ended. reply rrdharan 12 hours agorootparent> with any [E]ndeavour I see what you did there. reply superjan 12 hours agorootparentprevI speculate that beyond that, extra longevity can also be used to increase your budget. If you plan for six months operations, you have a lower mission budget. They won’t shut you down after six months as long the device is still working. reply EasyMark 9 hours agorootparentprevThe most over engineering in the world won't help you if you don't have good to great engineers when you're talking about stuff that is off world. So while they aren't going to be guaranteed be the top 10 engineers in the world, they are easily some of the best engineers in the world and deserve that to be acknowledged, NASA attracts the best, and even though they don't necessarily pay Silicon Valley salaries for cream of the crop, a lot of people aren't strictly motivated by money. reply WalterBright 10 hours agorootparentprevSince it doesn't need to be man-rated, spend less trying to make it perfect, and instead make more copies. reply dotnet00 13 hours agorootparentprevIt comes down to the fact that a poorly educated public and a ruling class of parasites has made it so NASA has negative room for failure. If they don't completely overperform on everything, someone will get dragged before Congress or into a hitpiece, potentially canceling other projects. Just recently we had a former NASA administrator testifying to a House subcommittee that the entire private space push was a failure and that all the contracts should be cancelled to restart Artemis with the usual SLS-style corruption. reply gumby 13 hours agorootparent> It comes down to the fact that a poorly educated public and a ruling class of parasites has made it so NASA has negative room for failure. Both basically true yet overdone. Fundamentally the US has an extremely strong punitive blame culture. Too strong, in that it is a distraction, a spectacle, and inhibits resolution of an actual problem, if one even exists. I don't mean this just in government: it's a fundamental part of the American Weltanschauung, one oddly rarely discussed. It seems to be so fundamental that it's simply taken as a given, like the old \"fish doesn't know it's wet\" metaphor. FAA is a good example of an organization that implements an opposite approach: crash investigations follow a \"what happened so we can address it, not punish\" in air crashes, sometimes causing people to complain that \"nobody was punished.\" But without the threat of punishment people are more willing to speak freely, so that hardware or procedures that need changing can actually change. reply ordu 12 hours agorootparentI don't know about USA politics to have an opinion on the matter, so I'd rather believe you assesment. But I want to add another point of data. Or rather point of view from outside. My experience of communication and collaboration with individual Americans points to the opposite direction. They are focused on a problem solving, not on a blame assignment. I can compare with my fellow Russians, I can't play games with them, because they kill all the fun looking for someone to blame. But at the same time, if we take a look at our Russian politicians... If they even look for someone to blame, they look for a blatant scapegoat. So, I mean, it seems like a complete reverse. Probably it is a coincidence or a result of a flawed methodology, but still... reply smcin 9 hours agorootparentThe discussion here is specifically about US (political) oversight of government agencies like NASA, specifically after a failure. Not private companies, or tech, or problem-solving in general, or scenarios where positive incentives outweigh the likelihood of blame. Compare the huge public scrutiny of Space Shuttle failures vs the FAA being out-to-lunch on oversight of Boeing 737MAX for over a decade. Some people have commented that excessive scrutiny (e.g. at NASA) has resulted in changes in culture and the rise of risk-averse 'professional administrators'. reply gumby 7 hours agorootparentTrue, but my comment was intended to point out that the punitive nature of political oversight of government agencies is a consequence of a more general attitude of the public, and thus probably impossible to broadly change. reply mncharity 7 hours agorootparentprev> the US has an extremely strong punitive blame culture Fwiw, here's a related outlier. I long ago had an anthropology professor who described his thesis on a small South American fishing community culture as, AFAIR very fuzzily ... Sh-t happens wasn't a concept. Anything goes wrong, it's some individual's intentional fault. So not long-ago pacific island \"let's war on the neighboring island - this was so unusual, they must have done it to us\". And not even Papau's ongoing \"let's gossip together to decide who here is the witch causing these notable problems\". It's \"everything\", all the time, intentionally, by family members and coworkers and neighbors. Some fish escaped the closing group net? Stop, figure out who intentionally let them go, and... I no longer recall the \"and then what\". But stub your toe? Rain harms your crop? Pay the local witch doctor to find out who put the whammy on you. And pay him to whammy them back. Resulting in interpersonal relationships that, pervasively, were toxically hostile. Singularly so in his experience. An antithesis to community warm fuzzies, charity, and blameless postmortems. Exploring broader context can be fun. In addition to saying, say, \"extremely corrupt\", there's \"more corrupt than this other, less than that other, and similar in this way, different in that way\". Nifty high-dimensional spaces. Are there Ashby-ish charts for subcultures? Is principle component clustering of culture surveys available? In customer design discussions, the differences between multiple proposals create a vocabulary for discussing the space. Sometimes having a \"yay, we're better than that\" touchstone can be useful. Like perhaps the USA lost something valuable when the USSR folded - it seemed a helpful set of \"that proposal would make us too much more like them - that's not who we are\" and \"they're making us look bad\" arguments faded out. reply WalterBright 10 hours agorootparentprevIf people are threatened with punishment for making mistakes, they'll hide the mistakes.

Some years back in Seattle, a truck driver was charged with murder because he hit a cyclist that crossed in front of him. It was established in the trial that the cyclist had darted out from between two cars, and it was impossible for the driver to have noticed, reacted, and stopped in time. He was acquitted. Around here, they painted stripes for a bike lane. Good. Then the cyclists like to ride on the stripe, and randomly weave back and forth across it.

And if you ride in the bike lanes, as I do, you discover they are often populated with debris (unsurprising due to road camber and automotive bow wave and wake) and untrimmed branches from live bushes, which one must move leftwards in order to avoid. Many motorists act as if roads were built for cars and all others get to use them on sufferance, if at all. * Excepting controlled-access roads, i.e. freeways. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentThe cases I've seen were not the result of debris avoidance. The bike lanes were clear. > Many motorists act as if roads were built for cars and all others get to use them on sufferance, if at all. Wandering over the line into traffic without looking is just stupid. No amount of lawsuit money is going to fix getting crippled. reply LAC-Tech 8 hours agorootparentprevAll the debates about cars vs bikes are so stupid. Bicycles are vehicles according to law basically everywhere on earth. It's all very simple - you over take vehicles safely, vehicles signal where they are going and drive predictably, you don't overtake vehicles when stopped at an intersection, etc etc. It's just a smaller slower vehicle, that's it. reply mindslight 5 hours agorootparentprevHonestly if the bike lane is full of debris, or has a line of parked cars too close such that their doors swing open into it, just ride fully in the next lane over. A bike lane is a lane that can be used by bikes, not a lane that must be used by bikes. And in general the vast majority of the complaints about cyclists swerving too much can and should be addressed by riding further out aka taking the lane. reply LAC-Tech 8 hours agorootparentprevI was a cycle commuter for a long time. I never seemed to have all the issues other cyclists have with auto traffic, and my area was pretty \"middle of the road\" for car-centrism (ie not suburban america, but not amsterdam either). The reason i would sometimes ride at the outer edge of the bike line was because the middle of the bike lane was right in 'car door' range. Assuming that people are not only going to look before they open the door, but that they are going to look for a narrow, quiet vehicle, that requires them to look in the very corner of their mirror is naive. So if I couldn't see through the back windshield and confirm a parked car was empty, I just wouldn't ride there. Saved me a couple of times. In another post below you mention \"the road was free of debris\". It's very unlikely you can tell, from a fast moving car, through a windshield, that the road is clear of debris that would effect the narrower, thinner tires of a bicycle. What might not even register for an automobile might be a repair job for a cyclist. All the above having been said - I absolutely saw some very stupid behaviour from cyclists. But also realise people usually aren't doing things just to annoy you personally. And I'm a larger than average man, nothing remarkable, but I could bowl over old ladies walking slowly in-front of me at the supermarket if I wanted to. After all they are smaller, slower and in my way. Yet I never seem to fantasise about it like many automobile drivers do. Worth thinking about. reply WalterBright 8 hours agorootparentI've cycled to work for years. I know what debris looks like. There wasn't any in the cases I mentioned - the roads were dry and clear. I'm not talking about cars at a standstill opening doors, either, I'm talking about traffic moving at 35 mph. No, I don't fantasize about mowing them down. I want nothing to do with that. Help me help you to avoid hurting you. reply steelframe 8 hours agorootparentprev> A cycle is far, far easier to maneuver to avoid an accident than a truck. No, it isn't. Most all four-wheeled vehicles traveling at 25mph can stop much, much more quickly than a bicycle traveling at 25mph simply because they have a large total contact patch and antilock braking technology. A maneuver you might pull with a 4-wheeled motor vehicle behind you because they can probably slam on their brakes in time to keep from running into you will usually result in the cyclist smashing into the back of you and being seriously injured. They can turn more sharply at speed, and they can accelerate much more quickly too. > Around here, they painted stripes for a bike lane. Good. As someone who tries to use them here and there, I generally don't view painted stripes being passed off as \"cycling infrastructure\" as a good thing. > Then the cyclists like to ride on the stripe, and randomly weave back and forth across it. Some cyclists are better than others at signaling before switching lanes. I used to be better about it before a motorist ignored my outstretched hand and broke it in two places once because they were trying really, really hard to stay in their lane rather than thinking about giving me the space I needed. That taught me that it's safer to just plop my butt directly in front of them when I need them to slow down or give me more space to pass. > As a driver, I have to spend all my attention trying not to hit those suicidal cyclists, who never look back to see if it is clear when they drift into the car lane. It's madness. I don't understand them at all. It can be perfectly rational and safer. The most dangerous situation for me is when a motorist disregards me. As in, they snap-judge that I'm somehow negligible, and they can continue in their zoned-out state of mind as they maneuver a multi-ton chunk of steel at a high speed around me. Cyclists are often run off the road or clipped by motorists whose brains don't register that they're something they need to pay attention to. When I'm cycling on the road, I do everything I can to \"throw an exception\" in the minds of motorists around me. Override System 1, and get their System 2 to take over -- for those familiar with the book Thinking, Fast and Slow. This almost always means riding much further to the left than one might instinctively ride. Now getting to \"bike lanes\" -- a term that I don't really like that much because it implies that it's the only lane I should be using at any point in time. And because \"bike lanes\" are actually car infrastructure, if you think about it. But that aside, \"bike lanes\" are often better described as \"door zones.\" They're often painted right next to parked motor vehicles, and virtually nobody checks to make sure there isn't an oncoming cyclist before they suddenly fling their doors open. Many cyclists have been killed or seriously injured as they've been flung into faster-moving traffic in the adjacent lane when that happens. When I'm approaching a parked motor vehicle, My objective is not to stay within the paint on the road at all, because it's just paint. Instead I'm judging how wide the door of the parked vehicle would be when it's suddenly flung open, and move to the left by that distance plus maybe an extra foot as a safety measure. Often that means I'm crossing out of the \"bike lane.\" If I'm doing that I will signal and merge into the lane next to me as safely as I can, but there's often a large differential between my speed and that of motorists in the lane next to me, as \"bike lanes\" encourage. That means the approaching motorist will need to be prepared to slow down, assess when it is safe to pass, and then move over far enough to pass so that there's at least 3 feet of space between me and their vehicle. System 1 tells motorists to \"stay in their lane\" and \"keep going at speed.\" Motorists doing that end up \"buzzing\" me, risking hitting me with their side mirrors, or worse. So for my own safety in that situation I have to arrest that in as clear terms as I can. That usually means moving all the way into the center of the lane, directly in front of them. Once I've taken the option to \"buzz\" me while staying in their lane away from them, they either slow down and wait until road conditions are safe for me to move back to the right lane, or they allow the switch in their brain for \"I must leave my lane to pass\" to activate, which generally results in them giving me more space as they pass. Yes, snapping our of your System 1 is uncomfortable. I'd rather your System 1 just assumed that a cyclist would be traveling in the regular wider lane at any time, rather assume that the cyclist will always be neatly and conveniently tucked away in the nearly-invisible \"bike lane.\" It seems unsafe. But the alternatives, riding in the door zone or encouraging motorists to try to squeeze by at speed, really result in a less-safe situation. reply WalterBright 7 hours agorootparent> Some cyclists are better than others at signaling before switching lanes. They're not \"switching lanes\". They are wandering randomly back and forth over the line, with no discernable purpose. It's not about parked cars, either. The stripe is fresh and new, it is not \"nearly invisible\", and it periodically has a bike painted on it so nobody can misunderstand that it is a bike lane. reply LAC-Tech 8 hours agorootparentprevFundamentally the US has an extremely strong punitive blame culture.

Your comment literally reads as \"person from country with near highest incarceration rate globally feels that not enough people are being punished\". Any thoughts on why the USofA is so punitive (compared to damn near every where else)? reply LAC-Tech 6 hours agorootparentPrison population by itself doesn't tell us much. You'd have to compare it against some sort of measure of crime victimisation (crime rates are always a bit flawed, because if police don't respond to crimes -> people stop calling -> no crime officially happened). At the opposite end, the lowest prison incarceration rate of any non-microstate is the Central African Republic. According to worldpopulationreview (first search engine result, happy to look at better sources if you have them), the CAR prison population per capita is a mere 2.5% of the USAs. The wikitravel article for this jurisdiction gives us this helpful warning: Most Western governments have issued explicit warnings to not travel to the Central African Republic under any circumstances. Violent crime, such as armed robbery, aggravated battery, and homicide, is extremely common. Large parts of the country are controlled by armed warlord groups who regularly kidnap, injure, and/or kill civilians. In the event of unrest, airport, land border, and road closures may occur with little or no notice. Consular services are often either extremely limited or non-existent. In short, stay away, and if you have no choice be sure to exercise war zone safety.

NASA spacecraft/probes have primary, secondary, and auxiliary missions. Everything on the probe is designed and built with an eye to being able to complete secondary and auxiliary missions but the guarantee (insofar as anything can be) is the probe can accomplish its primary mission. Unfortunately this leads to uninformed reporters to make stupid claims like \"a probe only designed to last 90 days...\". There's no self destruct or planned obsolescence in NASA probes. They don't have an egg timer set to 90 days and then explode. The probes are designed to last at least as long as the ability for their consumables/power supply lasts. Consider the stresses of launch, transit through space, and insertion/landing are way worse than day to day conditions for a lot of probes. If they can survive all of that rolling around a desert is relatively easy (in comparison). If Ingenuity made one successful flight there was little reason it couldn't make more so long as it had the appropriate power available and the Martian Space Defense didn't shoot it down.

They were moving nuclear weapons into Cuba. NATO, as I pointed out, was trying to make Russia a trade partner even after they invaded Georgia and Ukraine, and to this day most countries can hardly fund their militaries (even though many individually have economies larger than Russia's and could fund larger militaries by themselves). NATO didn't conduct exercises, was very careful about putting forces near Russia's border - even on NATO territor, had no facilities in Ukraine (which has never been a member), and certainly didn't move nuclear weapons anywhere near Russia. reply Intralexical 4 hours agorootparent> They were moving nuclear weapons into Cuba. For the record, the US had put nukes in Turkey before the USSR put them in Cuba. The crisis was resolved by removing them from both, but only the withdrawal from Cuba was publicized. Of course, the other stuff you said was accurate.

Russia is a different country. reply wolverine876 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's just false. There was no way NATO or Ukraine was attacking Russia, in ten thousand years. NATO can barely be bothered to fund their militaries even now, and the US Republican party can't be bothered to fund Ukraine. Even after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014 (and Georgia before that) the NATO countries were still making gas and other trade deals, thinking they would bring Russia into the fold of peaceful, free-trading nations. Trump tried to work with Putin; Obama did the big 'reset', etc., etc. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparentprevRemind me why we are killing each other? Is it for survival? OT: We know everything we need to survive and prosper very well - imperfectly, but with margin of error to spare, including capable political systems. The people still killing are just criminals who want to steal and murder. reply Intralexical 5 hours agorootparentprevIdk. If there were gods, which one is correct seems like it'd be a pretty important question. I wouldn't want to worship Beelzejuice Voorhees the Head-Chomper. Of course, killing people because they privately worship the Head-Chomper is probably too far, unless they're actively chomping (your?) heads. Also, Beelzejuice isn't real. But principles like human rights and freedom are worth fighting for, and necessary to sometimes fight for (or else we're all screwed)— Beliefs, certainly, if not anthropomorphized as \"gods\". Also, religions are a pretty strong indicator of social in-groups and out-groups. If you removed the gods from some religious wars, they'd probably still be fighting each other over skin color, language, ethnicity, culture, social ties, Adidas vs. Nike preference, external political goals, land use, water contamination, domestic political pressures, fishing rights, economic disenfranchisement, etc. Theology may help divide and rationalize it, but control over resources and power are pretty concrete motivations for creatures that have to worry about starving/dying, and gods are a proxy for that. Scarcity begets conflict. GDP per capita is ~$900 in Gaza, ~$350 in Afghanistan, ~$5,000 in Omsk. Doubt many would willingly sign up, or accept being conscripted, to murder unbelievers if they were more sure about having warm meals and meaningful works to cherish. Doubt NASA engineers would be \"capable of flying a remote vehicle on a literally other planet\" if they were busy scrounging for physical necessities. Even Bin Laden introduced his 2001 statement by referencing the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and its effects on people. Kirill may talk of the \"Antichrist\", but what Putin wants is Sevastopol. I think it's reductive to just say \"we also kill each other in large numbers over whose god is correct\". We kill each other for a variety of reasons, usually fear of ourselves being killed, and sometimes we bring gods into it but it's very rarely, if ever, the sole reason. reply Aaargh20318 10 hours agorootparentprevI dunno, some of these recent episodes of ‘the news’ feel a bit like lazy writing.

It is important to me that people move beyond blaming God for things like this. There are many more, and much more recent as well, examples where if people cared to seek what God thought the entire conflict would've been avoided. For example...where was the dispute about God, say, between the Chinese and the Japanese fronts during World War 2? Or between the Nazis and the Red Army? It wasn't a disagreement about God that resulted in dropping the atom bombs to end conflicts of that scale, unless you would agree with me that the only disagreement was that America kept believing in God and her adversaries no longer did...in which case I'd then just say that fundamentally it was disbelief in God that led to WW2's horrors, not disagreements over which God is correct. God is exonerated in all cases. This approach would be more respectful of the engineers who believe in God and who also contribute to projects like the space vehicles and probes or other impactful projects, and certainly more respectful of the great names in human history who are remembered for their contributions and noted also in the record for their love for God... reply fhsm 8 hours agoparentprevA helicopter running Linux no less. https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseveran... reply dontupvoteme 13 hours agoparentprevI forgot which probe and celestial objects it was, but at one point NASA was investigating a moon around Jupiter or Saturn, thought about dumping it there for nice photos (it was out of fuel iirc) and then they realized that it might have life on it. So they intentionally crashed it into the planet instead as to not potentially contaminate said moon - possibly our first implementation of the prime directive! reply dotnet00 13 hours agorootparentWe did that with Cassini on Saturn, and we intend to do that with Juno on Jupiter. But, on the other hand, while measures are taken to ensure that spacecraft headed to other bodies are not contaminated, we've also found that life still often manages to find a way. So I thibk the various landings on Mars, and the lander on Titan (plus the quadcopter heading there later this decade) are somewhat likely to have brought along some extremely resilient (but dormant) life anyway. reply breput 7 hours agoprevContact has been re-established[0] although the state of Ingenuity isn't known yet.

Similarly, the video (and associated audio which malfunctioned) of the skycrane-deployed landing was done by COTS components which otherwise would not have been present at all.

    "originBody": "Society Please Don’t Make Me Use Another QR Code Restaurant Menu My complaints are minor but many January 18, 2024January 19, 2024 - by Anne ThériaultAnne Thériault Updated 13:07, Jan. 19, 2024Published 6:30, Jan. 18, 2024 Celina Gallardo / Wikimedia Commons / iStock I recently travelled to Italy, and the first pleasure of every meal there was reading the menu. Phrases like “risotto al nero di seppia, burrata e ricci di mare”— risotto with cuttlefish ink, burrata, and sea urchins—and “paccheri pestati cunzati con gamberi, pistacchi e bisque”—paccheri pasta with crushed seasonings and with shrimp, pistachio, and bisque—felt like a rich prelude to the food itself. On a rooftop patio in Florence, I was handed both the regular menu and a supplementary sheet of paper. I happened to be there during white truffle season, and the sheet of paper listed all of the dishes they made with the delicacy. I sat there, literally under the Tuscan sun, feeling like a character in a book—one that was very unlike my everyday self. Don’t let news disappear from your feed. Sign up for The Walrus newsletter and get trusted Canadian journalism straight in your inbox. Email* GDPR By checking this box I consent to the use of my information for emails from The Walrus.* Submit One of the chief pleasures I get from reading is in poring over the descriptions of food. Give me a banquet scene or a dinner party where the wine pairs perfectly with both the entrée and whatever dramatic revelation is about to come, and I am rapt. Battle scenes bore me, but reading a character’s grocery list enchants me. Maybe that’s why I love restaurant menus so much—a well-written one can feel like a piece of literature in and of itself. Part of the magic of those Italian meals was not just in reading the menus but in encountering them as physical objects, feeling their weight in my hands and touching the grain of their paper. There was a world of difference from the last menu I’d encountered in North America, which had to be accessed via QR code. That meal had been at a nice restaurant, with flowers on every table and friendly service, but having to begin my meal by squinting at a smudgy screen did somewhat take away from the experience. How Bad Is Alcohol, Really? The Mushroom Boom I Didn’t Hate Cooking Palak Paneer, I Hated the Patriarchy QR codes, or quick response codes, aren’t new—they’ve been around since 1994, though they weren’t initially widely adopted outside of Asia. During the pandemic, their ability to offer contact-free interactions led to a rise in their use in the rest of the world, including at restaurants. But even as more and more restrictions were dropped, many of the QR code menus stayed. Hospitality Technology’s 2022 Restaurant Technology Study reported that 66 percent of restaurants in the US used QR code menus, and 19 percent of restaurants planned on adding them. The stats for Canadian restaurants are similar, according to the Toronto Star, which pointed to a Dalhousie University survey that indicated three out of every five Canadians used QR codes at restaurants or grocery stores in August 2021. My complaints with QR code menus are minor but many. I love the communal aspect of dining out with friends or family, and I hate the way that QR code menus take me out of the shared moment and force me to look at my phone (which, of course, leads me down the rabbit hole of checking my various notifications). I hate the way QR code menus mean scrolling, pinching to adjust size, and sometimes juggling between multiple tabs instead of just having to glance over a page or two. There are larger issues too: websites with menus on them can track consumer behaviour, one more tiny erosion of our everyday privacy. QR code menus also mean that people need access to a smart phone or some other kind of device and, if they do have one, that they possess a certain level of tech savviness, which excludes some potential patrons. And as Bloomberg reported in 2021, technology that promotes contactless dining has already been linked to job losses in the service industry. I’m not alone in my dislike of QR codes. In 2022, Conor Friedersdorf wrote an impassioned polemic against them for The Atlantic, and in 2023, the New York Times published an article on their alleged demise, full of quotes from people who loathe them. Even a brief search for the term “QR code menu” on X (formerly known as Twitter) will show you how deeply unpopular they are—one of my favourites, from user @mlokeshceo, simply says, “Menu > QR code.” Succinct and true! Physical menus are more than just aesthetically pleasing; they can also serve as important historical documents. The New York Public Library has approximately 45,000 menus dating from the 1840s, a collection that they’re in the process of digitizing through their “What’s on the menu?” project, and it’s amazing how much can be gleaned from those documents. The first and most obvious piece of information is what people were eating in a particular time and place—along with how much (or little) they paid for it. One of the menus in the NYPL’s collection is from Mart Ackerman’s Saloon in Toronto, where, back in 1856, diners could get a porterhouse steak with a choice of sides for $0.50—about $12 in today’s terms—accompanied by a glass of Siberian cobbler, ladies’ fancy punch, or a cocktail simply called the eye opener, all priced $0.13—$1.50 today—or under. But there’s so much more that can be learned from these menus beyond just items and prices. “I think the menus are really important because they’re archival traces of what people are eating, or what people are purchasing, or have the opportunity to purchase,” says writer and cultural historian L. Sasha Gora. “They tell so many different histories. These can be environmental histories—so, really thinking about how certain ingredients disappear, or reappear, or appear to begin with.” Gora leads a research group at the University of Augsburg dedicated to the culinary environmental humanities. Among other themes, the group has explored the idea of culinary extinction—namely, what happens when the animals and plants used for a popular food go extinct because we have eaten them out of existence? Take the passenger pigeon, for example, which died out in the early twentieth century thanks to overhunting. As it was going nearly extinct, you would think it would be disappearing from restaurant menus too. And yet, as passenger pigeon numbers rapidly declined, passenger pigeon pie was still on the menu, according to Gora, at the storied Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City. Gora says it’s possible that the pie really did contain passenger pigeon meat, but it’s also possible that it was the meat of some other, more common pigeon. Either way, the menu gave customers a perception of abundance even as their appetites decimated the ecology around them. Menus can also give us insight into attitudes toward gender. One fascinating example from history is the so-called “ladies’ menu”—a menu printed without prices so that women wouldn’t know how much their dates were spending on them (the practice mostly disappeared after a California woman threatened a restaurant with a discrimination lawsuit). Gora has an example relating to gender and menus from her own life too. In an essay titled “Today’s Special: Reading Menus as Cultural Texts,” she recalls working as a cook at a restaurant that served two versions of the same meal: “The Dirty Brunch” and “The Clean Brunch.” “The Dirty” came with bacon and sausages and, her boss told her, tended to be ordered by men; “The Clean,” by contrast, came with hummus and salad and tended to be ordered by women. But most of all, menus tell us about things that are ephemeral: foods, yes, but also often the places that serve that food as well. “A restaurant opens, and then it can run for a while, and then it closes, and then there are very few traces left,” says Gora. “So you don’t know what foods were being served, you don’t know how they were being contextualized. But if you have a menu, it actualizes the food, it preserves what was happening in the restaurant.” I can’t imagine that lunch in Florence would have been quite as thrilling if, instead of holding the leatherbound wine list in my hands and running my finger down the (extensive) inventory of options, the server had directed me toward the QR code for a digital menu. That meal was a moment—with perfect weather, a view of the Ponte Vecchio, and the strongest negroni I’ve ever had the good fortune to come across—and I’m glad that I was able to be fully in it, no screens involved. And if any future historians are wondering, the ravioli with fresh white truffles was worth every penny.

They take away physical menus because they need them for the next guests. Restaurants never - even high-end ones (which might be surprising, but high-end restaurants have more-expensive to produce menus) - never have enough menus. Owners skimp on printing menus because they're as penny-foolish as any other out-of-touch manager.

The fact that you visited some restaurant PDF or webpage from a dynamic IP address is not. Like the parent commenter said, any information about how long the table is being occupied comes from the POS and reservation system. But that data is for the restaurant -- there's no market in selling it, though it absolutely has value to the restaurant for its business decisions. But your phone isn't being used for that part. Data collection is certainly a thing. But it happens in specific ways for specific purposes. Using a credit card tied to your identity, but then worrying about revealing your phone's IP address while ordering, doesn't make any sense. reply o0ower0o 14 hours agoprevI get the nostalgic nature of the article, but it feels unfair as it seems to compare the \"best physical menu experience\" to the \"worst digital\" one. At its best, a menu can be a nice leather \"book\". At its worst, it is a one page plastic menu that has been touched by hundreds of people before you and never cleaned, it is also probably ruined or broken on the corners and in the middle, and has also a lot hand-made corrections to ingredients and prices that makes reading it way more frustrating. At the same time, a digital menu can be easy to navigate (with sections based on first courses, second courses, appetizers, etc.), it can show you the pictures of the food you're going to order and, sometimes, allows you to order without waiting for someone. Even at their worse, I still prefer the digital version as it is more hygienic and I don't have to wait 15 minutes for a waiter if they forget to bring one to the table (and then we also have to share that between 6 people). reply Beldin 12 hours agoparentThe article is about menus, not ordering. Physical menus can include photos and be easy to navigate. Most physical menus have separate sections for appetizer, side dishes, main course, etc. It's possible to incorporate ordering online into a paper menu (QR code/codes) for folks who don't want to wave at a waiter. In addition, a physical menu does not require you to use data or log on to the restaurant's wifi, is guaranteed not to track your browsing through the menu, can take up far more physical space than available on a phone screen, and won't start the dinner by everyone looking at their phones (and someone forced to help out the technically-challenged party member). Ordering without waiting is nice. Navigating a digital menu is too often a pain. Want to add a drink? That's on another tab, please wait while we load&render, no it's further down, oh you wanted non-alcoholic? Want to change your main?

That means that if you want to take a holiday from work you can just pay your employer the equivalent cash value of your labour instead of showing up and there is nothing your employer can say about it since they are always required to accept money as payment. In fact, you can evade all contractual obligation by offering money in place of what was expected to be paid. I can see why it isn't generally honoured. reply denverllc 15 hours agorootparentThe law doesn’t say that at all. It only applies to instances in which payment is made, and says you can’t accept credit card and not cash: > Everyone is obliged to accept up to 100 Swiss regular issue coins in payment.

Nowhere does this imply that you can trade working for paying an equivalent cash amount of your labour. reply randomdata 15 hours agorootparent> which payment is made Yes, that's right, labour offered in a trade is a form of payment. All trades sees both sides of the transaction make a payment. In the most common case as it pertains to employment, I pay you labour, you pay me money, at which point the trade is settled. But since the law states that money must always been accepted as a form of payment I can also pay you money in place of my labour. Per the law, the employer has to accept it. Thus, any time you don't want to go to work you simply have to offer money instead of labour, which you will get back since the employer is still obligated to fulfil their side of the trade. It's an interesting approach. But doesn't seem tenable in the real world, so it is not surprising that it is oft ignored. > and says you can’t accept credit card and not cash Exactly. Credit cards don't offer money, but instead offer tokens that you can later trade for money. Practicalities aside, no different than accepting chickens and then trading those chickens for money. Or no different than accepting labour and then trading that labour for money. It's all the same. A trade is a trade is trade. The law here requires that the cash must be accepted as a substitute in a trade. reply margalabargala 12 hours agorootparentYou're mixing creative usages of language with legal terminology. Colloquially, in English, one could think of \"labor\" as a form of \"payment\" in the way you describe. In the legal context, things like \"labor\" and \"payment\" and \"trade\" have specific meanings. These meanings cannot be interchanged with any other \"technically not grammatically incorrect\" definition of the same word as it might be used in spoken English.

If the food or drinks come out wrong, there's irrefutable proof I ordered correctly, and it's the kitchen's job to fix it.

All in all, it's much more efficient and it means you're never waiting for your waiter to reappear if you want to order another drink or something. You also pay the bill through your phone, which avoids the need to hand your credit card to the waiter.

This is the opposite of my experience. I can't think of a chain that uses them.

They either try to cram too much on one page, or require too many pages. It's not even necessarily that there are too many items, but that the design is shitty. Extra turd points if the page wastes the margins with noisy decoration or stock photos of drunk people smiling wielding margaritas or whatever and half of it is redundant ads for their specials.

Also, typing you card number on a phone is irritating, not to mention that I know nothing about that website and how secure it is. reply sokitome 10 hours agoprevI totally agree with the premise of Anne's article. Using a QR code for a menu or to place an order is so sterile and just ruins part of the reason for going to a restaurant in the first place, which is some sort of social interaction. Using a QR code to pay the bill is even more obnoxious as now a third party is being interjected into the payment/data tracking wheel of user surveillance. Technology is a great thing, but it can certainly be used in ways that are just plain degrading to a considerate life as a human being. reply hscontinuity 14 hours agoprevI have extensive restaurant experience on all levels and while philosophically the importance of that experience would subjectively suggest a bias in my statements, I assure you I offer only my philosophical approach to this particular dilemma in the industry. QR codes aren't novel in their approach to information; they are rather applicably similar barcodes. I think generally speaking most would agree. This is the disconnect for most of humans. Generally speaking, when instituting out-of-the-norm operating standards in a generally selective common environment, most tradition is bonded with rather than against. Such as a QR code as an example in replacing physical menus with physically-required experiences. Such as; walking in to physical place, sitting down or standing somewhere, picking up or looking at a written menu, speaking to someone (perhaps soon enough to be, some thing), ordering something to eat, eating said items, paying for said items, maybe a visit to the loo or not, and leaving the physical establishment. When you insert a new method that (generally speaking) detracts from societal norms, it isn't a question of whether it works or doesn't work it's purely a matter of fucntion for the experience. Example: If there were a true 'ghost kitchen' which also had a (let's just say hypothetically) street-facing counter window due to (again, hypothetically) extremely small real estate space for the transactional process of obtaining the food, like a 2x2' window where you pickup the food - and the entirety of the transactional process from the financial arm of this experience, were to functionally as such: scan QR code above window, place order, pay/send order, wait nearby window, pickup food as ready. That'd make sense. But not so much when you or you and a group or more are interested in sitting down inside a physical space, expecting a physical experience. The two are not equal and should be used as the experience is required, in my very humble, 25+ years of experience in this very industry, opinion. reply dougbarrett 15 hours agoprevI've seen this argument come up frequently and I find this is just a weird hill to die on.

In a country with rampant accelerating inflation, QR codes brought on by pandemic protocols were an unexpected saviour to the problem of having to mark up prices every week or month. The experience itself sucks in most places as you might have seen due to terrible tech stacks to host the menu, but the benefit of not having to print or markup so many menus have made QR a must. Funnily, I have an unfounded hunch that making price hikes so easy have in fact helped speed up inflation by a small bit. reply neverrroot 15 hours agoprevI prefer a real menu, but there are people that feel pressure when holding one, or interacting with the personnel, but I’m not convinced they do the right thing for themselves trying to keep it digital to avoid interaction in the real world with real people. There are of course a few advantages to having a menu available immediately, including for ordering something afterwards, but I got into the habit of always asking for a menu to be left at the table. Not only for this reason. In general I also enjoy interacting with the personnel when ordering, having a real menu definitely helps with that. reply naitgacem 15 hours agoprevHonestly, if I'm going to a restaurant especially with other people, I prefer to leave my phone behind.

Why can't my phone just read a printed URL by now? There's no reason the same information can't be human readable as well as easy for my phone to scan. I suppose it would require some kind of design paradigm to really denote text that could also be scanned, maybe a specific font style. Anyway it seem likely to me QR codes are eventually replaced by simple text. reply mixmastamyk 14 hours agoparentQR is more compact and higher accuracy. reply r0s 14 hours agorootparentAnd not human readable, is my point. The value tradeoff in accuracy and compactness is the question. Will that be enough to sustain QR codes? I don't think so. Also most QR codes seem to include a text url nearby the code anyway, so there goes the \"compactness\" argument. In that case it's redundant information as well. reply mixmastamyk 13 hours agorootparentThe compactness refers to the length of the url. Most mobile oriented stuff prefers portrait orientation. Not to mention colors, fonts etc. QR avoids all these issues. Maybe something better will come along but will have similarities. reply r0s 13 hours agorootparentQR has the same contrast requirement for colors to be read.

Cramming a 11x14 foldout menu onto a phone pdf is not a good UX. That said, I find the kiosk app at Panera Bread a much better experience than ordering from the menu simply because there’s a lot more information. Options, bread types, ingredients, etc. You can claw that out of the clerk, but it’s a bit arduous. So it can be done well. It just isn’t. And it’s don’t really blame the restaurants either. A comprehensive digital experience is really not their ballywick. Then there was a time I went to an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. There, we had no menus. The server came up, “What do you want?” “Well, what do you have?” “We’re an Italian restaurant. What do you want?” And I told him, and I got it.

I never actually cared whether a restaurant has one or the other, I will just use whatever they have, but I would much rather use a QR Code menu on my phone (especially if it allows me to order without talking to a waiter) than using a greasy, bulky menu that everyone else touches. I get that there are some disadvantages, but some of the ones listed in the article seem to be grasping at straws. Important historical documents? Give me a break. I don't know if this is a generational thing or not, but my friends (from 20 to 35) don't care for physical menus either. reply Dalewyn 15 hours agoparentIt's not so much that physical menus are good/better, it's that needing to open a digital menu on your phone when you're already in the restaurant and (presumably) paying to be served is the literal opposite of service. The really fancy restaurants even have the waiter verbally tell you their menu, or at least their special(s) of the day. reply tail_exchange 15 hours agorootparentI think that's completely subjective, because if I'm indifferent between the two mediums, then the service is not worse. I'd say it depends a lot on the restaurant. If I'm in a pricey restaurant, then give me both, because I want an experience tailored for me. If I'm in a Pub, please give me a digital menu, because god knows what is encrusted in those physical menus. Now, having to listen to a waiter recite a menu from memory is just plain bizarre. I've been to a lot of fancy restaurants and I've never seen this. The specialty of the day? Sure. But never the whole menu. Worse than having a written menu in a format you don't like would be having no written menu at all. reply scythe 15 hours agorootparentprevI never liked the version where the waiter explains the menu options because I always forget them by the time I need to order. reply NoZebra120vClip 14 hours agoprevWhat I've been doing for fast-food is to order ahead of time, usually while I'm en route on the bus. Google Maps has a unified interface that links out to the various delivery services, and the restaurant's own website if it's available. Then I order a meal for pickup, and it's all specified and paid in whatever app I used. Then I arrive at the restaurant and my meal is all bagged up to go, then I tell the counter girl that this meal is \"for here\" and may I please have a knife? \"No, we don't have knives anymore.\" How about a tray? \"No, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" So far they have tolerated my presence as I sit at a table and eat the meal on top of the paper bag. reply bitwize 15 hours agoprev [–] I've seen this maybe once or twice. Maybe it's just a matter of which restaurants we choose to patronize, but virtually all of them offer paper or laminate menus for us to use.

    "title": "Fujitsu Lifebook AH532 BIOS Vanishes: Investigating the Solution",
    "originLink": "https://blog.timschumi.net/2024/01/20/ah532-bios-investigation.html",
    "originBody": "Investigating a vanishing BIOS on the Fujitsu LIFEBOOK AH532 Jan 20, 2024 A few months ago, I got given a laptop with a very interesting condition. The BIOS setup menu was supposedly inaccessible, and nothing apart from the default boot option works. Time to investigate to see what is actually happening and what we can do about it. The status quo When starting the laptop without doing anything special, the default option boots just fine, as expected. However, while pressing F2 during boot causes a beep tone, it ends up falling through to the same behavior as if nothing was pressed. On the other hand, pressing F12 lands us in a very empty boot menu: This, obviously, is not good. The boot menu should (at least) show all bootable UEFI devices in addition to the boot entries that have been created manually. Populating the boot menu Of course, the first thing that one would try is to reset the BIOS settings. Since the CMOS battery is quite hidden behind plastic shielding, I instead bridged the CL1_CL2 test point that is located under the RAM slot. After the BIOS reinitialized, the boot menu looks like the following: The manually created boot option is now gone, and device-based boot options show up instead. However, trying to enter the BIOS setup menu still shows the same fallthrough behavior as it did before. Luckily, there now is the option to boot from USB storage, so the BIOS flash utilities provided by Fujitsu are a possibility going forward. Note that (at least for the AH532) there are multiple hardware revisions, so I had to go through the device serial number to arrive at the correct set of downloads. After flashing the BIOS and rebooting, the boot menu looks normal and pressing F2 to enter the BIOS setup menu works like a charm: Isolating a reproducer Now that I was back in a working setup, the first thing I did was to make a backup of the current configuration. For that, I made an image of the Winbond 25Q32BVSIG SPI flash chip that is marked as “U35” on the motherboard, as it contains the whole UEFI PI firmware volume including executable code and data storage. Whenever something is broken, I can now just flash back the image instead of going through a full reset-CMOS-and-update-firmware cycle. For easier testing, I also wanted a better reproducer than “reinstall your distribution of choice”. Therefore, I tried the first thing that came to mind, and it immediately broke the boot menu again: # efibootmgr -c BootOrder: 0000 Boot0000* Linux Warning: Do NOT run this command twice. Doing so made the boot menu completely inaccessible. Excursion: UEFI boot entry handling At a high level, UEFI stores data in a large key-value store that is collectively called “UEFI variables”. Included in those variables are (among other things) boot entries and related settings. Variable access is done through standardized interfaces that are documented in the UEFI specification. Boot entries are stored in entries named BootXXXX, where XXXX is a four digit hexadecimal number. Boot option order is determined through the BootOrder entry, which lists all four digit hexadecimal numbers in the order that they should appear in. On my Framework laptop, the boot entries are set up as follows: BootOrder: 0002, 0001, 2001, 2002, 2003 Boot0001: \"Windows Boot Manager\" Boot0002: \"GRUB\" Boot2001: \"EFI USB Device\" Boot2002: \"EFI DVD/CDROM\" Boot2003: \"EFI Network\" Putting the pieces together Suddenly, the efibootmgr -c output above doesn’t look all that confidence-inspiring. The command is supposed to create a new entry and insert it at the top of the boot entry list, but it ended up clearing the entire list instead. Running efibootmgr on a fresh boot also doesn’t result in quite the expected output: # efibootmgr -v Could not read variable 'BootNext': No such file or directory Could not read variable 'BootCurrent': No such file or directory Could not read variable 'BootTimeout': No such file or directory Could not read variable 'BootOrder': No such file or directory No BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery Could not read variable 'MirrorCurrent': No such file or directory Could not read variable 'MirrorRequest': No such file or directory It appears that Linux is unable to read existing variables from storage, which is immediately confirmed by inspecting the source of truth: # ls -al /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 15 16:09 . drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Jan 15 16:09 .. Note: At this point, I checked that Windows and various other UEFI tools are able to read the variables just fine, so Linux’ output is confirmed to be incorrect. Now, this explains why the custom boot entries and the device-based boot entries end up being gone. efibootmgr can’t find any existing boot entry setup and just assumes that it can create a new setup without repercussions. But why does it make the BIOS setup unusable? Using UEFITool, I inspected the flash image I made earlier, and reconstructed the following entries: BootOrder: 000E, 000D, 0006, 0007, 0008, 0009, 000A, 000B Boot0000: \"BIOS Setup\" Boot0001: \"Boot Menu\" Boot0002: \"Diagnostic Screen\" Boot0003: \"Recovery and Utility\" Boot0004: \"Diagnostic Program\" Boot0005: \"Diagnostic Progrogram ROM\" Boot0006: \"Floppy Disk Drive\" Boot0007: \"Drive0 HDD\" Boot0008: \"CD/DVD Drive\" Boot0009: \"NETWORK\" Boot000A: \"USB HDD\" Boot000B: \"USB CD/DVD\" Boot000C: \"Erase Disk\" Boot000D: \"Windows Boot Manager\" Boot000E: \"proxmox\" Oh, no… “BIOS Setup” is an actual boot menu entry. And it gets overwritten by the new boot entry that gets placed erroneously. Note: Attentive readers might have noticed the reason for why everything breaks completely when running efibootmgr -c twice: The second boot entry that is created would be Boot0001, which successfully replaces “Boot Menu”. Creating a temporary band-aid Now that I knew what went wrong, I was able to create a small program that resets the boot order, as well as the BIOS setup and boot menu entries to their expected contents. Note: This program is based on an UEFI dump of a Fujitsu LIFEBOOK AH532 (YLKV). It is unlikely that it will work on any other hardware (revision) that happens to have the same symptoms. Furthermore, the written data may also be dependent on the firmware revision, so take caution when running this on a firmware version that is not v1.08 or v1.09. Warning: I assume no liability for broken hardware or software due to correct or incorrect usage of this tool. #includeuint32_t boot_attributes = EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILEEFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESSEFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS; unsigned char bootorder_data[] = { 0x06, 0x00, // Boot0006 0x07, 0x00, // Boot0007 0x08, 0x00, // Boot0008 0x09, 0x00, // Boot0009 0x0A, 0x00, // Boot000A 0x0B, 0x00, // Boot000B }; unsigned char boot0000_data[] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, // Attributes 0x18, 0x00, // FilePathListLength // Description: \"BIOS Setup \" 0x42, 0x00, 0x49, 0x00, 0x4F, 0x00, 0x53, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x53, 0x00, 0x65, 0x00, 0x74, 0x00, 0x75, 0x00, 0x70, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // FilePathList[0] 0x04, // Type: Media Device Path 0x06, // Sub-Type: PIWG Firmware File 0x14, 0x00, // Length: 4 + 0x14 0x66, 0x8B, 0x1C, 0x72, 0x6C, 0x42, 0x86, 0x4E, 0x8E, 0x99, 0x34, 0x57, 0xC4, 0x6A, 0xB0, 0xB9, // FilePathList[1] 0x7F, // Type: End of Hardware Device Path 0xFF, // Sub-Type: End Entire Device Path 0x04, 0x00, // Length: 4 // OptionalData (empty) }; unsigned char boot0001_data[] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, // Attributes 0x18, 0x00, // FilePathListLength // Description: \"Boot Menu\" 0x42, 0x00, 0x6F, 0x00, 0x6F, 0x00, 0x74, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x4D, 0x00, 0x65, 0x00, 0x6E, 0x00, 0x75, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // FilePathList[0] 0x04, // Type: Media Device Path 0x06, // Sub-Type: PIWG Firmware File 0x14, 0x00, // Length: 4 + 0x14 0x40, 0x84, 0x48, 0x86, 0xBB, 0x41, 0xC7, 0x42, 0x93, 0xAC, 0x45, 0x0F, 0xBF, 0x77, 0x66, 0xBF, // FilePathList[1] 0x7F, // Type: End of Hardware Device Path 0xFF, // Sub-Type: End Entire Device Path 0x04, 0x00, // Length: 4 // OptionalData (empty) }; int main() { int rc = efi_set_variable(EFI_GLOBAL_GUID, \"BootOrder\", bootorder_data, sizeof(bootorder_data), boot_attributes, 0644); if (rc < 0) { efi_error(\"Resetting BootOrder failed\"); return 1; } rc = efi_set_variable(EFI_GLOBAL_GUID, \"Boot0000\", boot0000_data, sizeof(boot0000_data), boot_attributes, 0644); if (rc < 0) { efi_error(\"Resetting Boot0000 failed\"); return 1; } rc = efi_set_variable(EFI_GLOBAL_GUID, \"Boot0001\", boot0001_data, sizeof(boot0001_data), boot_attributes, 0644); if (rc < 0) { efi_error(\"Resetting Boot0001 failed\"); return 1; } } Naturally, this isn’t a great solution, since users will continue to brick their installations initially, just like they did for the last 10 years.

Someone clearly thought that was a good idea, and I wouldn't be surprised if they thought the same of the bloated monstrosity that is UEFI. \"Let's make the setup an EFI application\" sounds like a reasonable argument, but they don't realise that it's a very important application, one which should be accessible under all circumstances short of having the BIOS erased.[1] We're approaching 10 years since this happened: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5139055 And almost 8 years since this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11008449 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10999335 [1] Most if not all BIOSes on EEPROM (late 90s onwards) before UEFI had \"boot block recovery\" which would automatically detect if they were corrupt and attempt to recover by flashing from a specially formatted floppy disk. reply jtriangle 2 hours agoparentI've come across similar issues with OEM installs before, where it simply will not boot if anything but the OEM's factory image is installed by the OEM's install disks. Profoundly annoying, but, thankfully not commonplace and those couple times it's happened to me I've been in the return window, so, back they went. I figure that's as big of an FU as I can muster, the OEM dealing with a higher than normal return rate. Last time it was a HP laptop running a god aweful bloatware infested version of windows 8.1, never again. reply xlii 12 hours agoprevAround 20 years ago I had Fujitsu Siemens V3505 that beyond giving me a lot of grief when it came to get it to work ACPI, hardware buttons or getting FN-less function keys it had weird characteristic of requiring motherboard replacement every single time I installed Linux on it. As it was advertised as OpenSUSE compatible (and even came with stickers and such) first one or two times they made a fuss about it, but after that they replaced pretty much on the demand. I wonder if that was also related to the issue article was mentioning. But such design lasting for multiple years? reply dataflow 11 hours agoparentConfused, this only occurred during installation? Not booting after the OS was installed? reply tenebrisalietum 10 hours agorootparentRelated to killing EFI variables in a way the UEFI didn't expect I bet - would happen when boot loader is installed and boot entries set possibly. reply xattt 9 hours agorootparentThat’s an interesting failure mode. Is there any reason why the manufacturer didn’t consider that boot entries can be created and destroyed by the customer? reply cjbprime 13 hours agoprevIs there any indication why Linux can't read these efivars? That seems like a short fix away from the research already done, and would take care of everything. (Once you have the C skills already demonstrated in the post, kernel code is not especially difficult to debug.) reply timschumi 13 hours agoparentAs far as I have tracked it down (quite literally up to the point where it switches into the EFI context to run the respective service handler), the UEFI denies a call to `GetNextVariableName` with `EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER` (that part is actually indicated in `dmesg`) even though the request appears to be specification-compliant (and the existing implementation evidently hasn't been an issue on any other notable hardware). The main issue with fixing it properly is that I'd most likely have to reverse engineer the Windows kernel or the UEFI firmware itself (note to self: I haven't yet checked whether any of the *BSDs can read EFI variables in general and on this hardware in particular) to figure out where the request is going wrong/what Windows is doing different. It's not impossible, given that one can unpack the UEFI PI firmware image into all the separate modules, but going through them to figure out where variable management is implemented will still take me a few weeks at least (not due to any particular challenge, it's just consuming a lot of time that I don't have right now). reply timschumi 11 hours agorootparent> note to self: I haven't yet checked whether any of the *BSDs can read EFI variables in general and on this hardware in particular Good news: FreeBSD is able to read the whole variable list.

Sorry you wiped your drive though!! reply jandrese 11 hours agorootparentprevOne thing I've gotten used to over the years is Linux complaining that some part of the machine's EFI is buggy no matter what machine it is installed on. Apparently it's just too complicated for hardware manufacturers to get right. I also feel like there is far too much duplicated effort in the industry with everybody making their own version that is slightly buggy in a unique way. reply j16sdiz 4 hours agorootparentIt is just moving the complexity around. In the old BIOS + ACPI days, the OS carries hardware specific hacks. These hack were buggy and hard to keep to day. We (the community as a whole) decided it is better leave the hardware specific hacks to the hardware, UEFI was supposed to provide enough abstraction for all we need. The result is, of course, the hacks with all its bugs are moved to the firmware. reply drewg123 12 hours agorootparentprevFreeBSD can read and manipulate EFI variables in general. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try efivar or efibootmgr in FreeBSD. Grab the memstick image from here: https://download.freebsd.org/releases/ISO-IMAGES/14.0/ Uncompress it, and dd it to your USB drive.

I wonder if there is a way to dynamically watch the Windows call, to compare it with the Linux one, to avoid the tedious reverse engineering. Or if the syntax of Windows GetNextVariableName() use is generally understood/documented? This could happen either through somehow getting logging from the Windows end, or somehow changing the UEFI to be one you control and logging there, or finding a different BIOS/OS that can read the vars and getting it to log its work. reply timschumi 12 hours agorootparent> Makes sense! I wonder if there is a way to dynamically watch the Windows call, to compare it with the Linux one, to avoid the tedious reverse engineering. Or if the syntax of Windows GetNextVariableName() use is generally understood/documented? The userspace interface is somewhat documented by third-parties (because it is technically internal). However, the important parts happen kernel side, and I'd rather avoid diving too deep into Windows because some very interesting job postings (understandably) have \"No exposure to Microsoft code or reverse-engineering of Microsoft software\" in them. I already tried getting to the service handler implementation via Linux, but memory protections made it weird enough that I was even questioning whether it was returning correct raw data when trying to read it from memory (or I have been looking at the wrong set of headers). reply mjg59 11 hours agorootparentprevLast I checked (which was about a decade ago) Windows doesn't call GetNextVariableName() - it just accesses variables on demand. We should probably handle that in a cleaner way. reply timschumi 11 hours agorootparentIt seems like that is no longer the case. I was able to successfully retrieve a non-standard variable using the `UEFIv2` PowerShell module [1] (which is just a thin wrapper around the undocumented `NtEnumerateSystemEnvironmentValuesEx` function) without actually naming the variable in question. To the untrained layman like me, this sounds like Windows actually is querying via `GetNextVariableName`, because UEFI doesn't seem to offer any other interfaces that aren't \"get/set variable by name\". [1] https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/UEFIv2 reply mjg59 9 hours agorootparentOk, yes, sounds like it is in that case. Which means figuring out how Linux is doing this differently to Windows, sigh.

Had there been any more than one possible type of chip and more than three of these similar looking chips on the [accessible part of the] motherboard, I'd probably still be sitting here trying to figure out what to do.

Some pins are easier where you have a via to solder to instead of the pin. Had to carefully lift the VCC pin to avoid turning on the whole board. Not all is lost if you break a pin: can carefully file down a bit of the plastic chip encapsulation to expose some pin to rebridge it once complete.

In either case, Linux is the only thing affected by this, so in real-world setups Linux is going to be the only boot option that is available while the boot menu is in a broken state. reply crote 14 hours agorootparentThere's a pretty decent chance nobody else is actually trying.

A NAS is like a special storage locker for digital files (like documents, photos, and music) that you can access from multiple computers and devices in your home or office. On diskprices you can see all Amazon listings of hard drives that are on discount so you can save money. You can also filter them by Amazon warehouse country, condition, type, capacity, and more. The best part is the website is constantly updated, so you never miss an opportunity. How It Makes Money If you look on the left side below the filters, you will see a block of text saying that this website is supported by paid affiliate links. This is how the website makes money. And we’re not talking about a few bucks. Diskprices makes around $5,000 a month. Not bad for a single-page website. Here’s what the owner has to say about the earnings: Screenshot originally posted on https://boringcashcow.com/ Because there is just one person working on the website, the operation costs are…",

As a data hoarder, I try to just wait for deals and not use this site. reply dsr_ 18 hours agorootparentThe other thing is that they consistently allow MDD / Max Disk Deals or whatever their name is to occupy the New disk listings, despite every Amazon review of them being full of \"this disk is lightly used\".

We only see the tip of the iceberg without really knowing what’s going on behind the scenes. Some sort of marketing is always involved. reply jauntywundrkind 14 hours agorootparentI dislike these lines of thinking, because they seem based on conspiratorial thinking. Our imagination lets us always think something is lurking, something is deeper & scarier than we imagine. This site is popular because it's organic & good & a fine service, one without peer or equal. It asks nothing of the user, and helps them make good informed decisions effectively. Imagining there's some secret agenda is all too popular in way too many areas in the world. Fear Uncertainty & Doubt (FUD) can have some basis, but letting it get in the way, letting it obstruct or out shadow simple good as it comes lets us miss out on understanding value and positivity, and with those basis undermined we (society) are screwed. reply andrewstuart 21 hours agoparentprevSo I can't just jump in and copy cat? reply creer 14 hours agorootparentPeople mention other products where that might work. So yes, jump in. The issue with sites like this, I feel, is staying power. Even with some reasonable SEO awareness and legitimate presence on the corresponding technical forums, it still takes years to accumulate links (but perhaps mostly bookmarks) to your product discovery site. Including organic HN mentions - if that's the right audience. Same for any other old-style web site. And people want a quick buck. So that they get impatient and give up the entire thing, or they give up mentioning the site in the right places. Or so that they sell ads or product placement - which then kills the organic effort. reply nerdponx 20 hours agorootparentprevDo the same for RAM or monitors or just about any tech product that can be hard to shop for. reply veeti 19 hours agorootparentNot affiliated with them, but https://www.productchart.com/monitors/ is pretty sweet for finding a monitor. reply imagine99 39 minutes agorootparentUnfortunately, it doesn't let you filter by aspect ratio, so you cannot get e.g. all 16:10 monitors which is something I'm always actively searching for and it's so difficult. The page also doesn't list the unique Dell U3023E and its predecessors which are 2560x1600, i.e. 16:10 monitors, and perfect for design & development both in portrait and landscape mode. If the developer of that website is on HN, I hope they can add a filter for aspect ratio and more 16:10 monitors as well. reply joshstrange 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is, it was very useful in narrowing down exactly what I wanted (how Amazon fails to provide decent filtering is beyond me) but it doesn't work well on mobile which is a shame. reply sgc 17 hours agorootparentI don't understand Amazon either. They actively neuter their filtering and sorting. Obviously they think they make more money that way, but it is an absolutely insane choice to make if you have any self-respect. 2024. Everything is slow. Search doesn't work. Ad infestation is even more invasive than the popup spawning days of old. Product quality is rock bottom. We have done ourselves in.

Mens sizes are literal measurements in inches, ostensibly. However when you look at the sizing chart on brand websites you realize they all have varying levels of vanity sizing - across brands, across fits within a brand, and across years within a fit. Then you have all the confusing nomenclature for fits - skinny, slim, straight, classic, standard, relaxed, boot cut, baggy, flare, athletic, etc.. And then hybrid ones like \"slim straight\" or other nonsense. Finally, some brands offer different inseams/lenghts for a given waist, while others have fixed ones per waist size so you have to get them tailored after, etc. The shopping experience for me in jeans is to trying multiple brands/fits/sizes every 5+ years, and then keep buying that exact model until it is no long available, then reset. reply mike503 14 hours agorootparentAlso if you've ever done a deeper analysis of Lucky jeans, the same exact model is wildly different depending on where it got produced. Different material composition, fit, flexibility/softness (due to the difference in materials), different country it was produced in (and IIRC, it's not even consistent. Mexico is not always 100% cotton for example. There was no discernible pattern) I try to find products I like and then buy a bunch of them (in case they stop making them, etc) and I wound up making a spreadsheet once after becoming frustrated with the inability to trust the same \"model number\" means the same thing there. reply nerdponx 9 hours agorootparentLevi's has the same issue. reply steveBK123 14 hours agorootparentprevRight the apparel industry is so outsourced and rebranded that the factory / subcontractor variation is obvious to the customer ! reply prakhar897 18 hours agoparentprevCan anyone specify how the author approached this with respect to SEO.

I think everyone but me is wrong and that my phone in portrait mode should be able to show at least 100 characters.

This is larger than I find ideal but about the same as an average paperback novel. That said I need to twiddle a setting in Android developer options to get even this small.

Doing the same stuff in the fashion industry may not work. reply II2II 19 hours agoparent> People asking for disk prices probably have looser standards in terms of UX. Perhaps the opposite is true. A site like this works because Amazon is poor at finding products, never mind for comparing prices. Even e-commerce sites that filter data in a similar manner (and typically do a better job since they have more complete product details), this site is both faster and makes product comparisons easier. While it is probably possible to tweak to UX to make it better, I would suggest the success of this site is due to providing a better UX for its target audience. reply arter4 18 hours agorootparentI mean from an aesthetic standpoint. People interested in disk details and prices may not care that much about material design, responsiveness and carousel with disk pictures. They want to get what they want.

Turns out the author does mean according to the standard, but thinks that “I don’t know” is a synonym for both undefined and unspecified behavior. It seems weird to use imprecise terminology in a post that’s all about lecturing about standards compliance. reply TillE 10 hours agoparentI'm really surprised at how many people are annoyed by this quiz. It doesn't specify a compiler/platform, therefore all the definite answers are clearly wrong. reply codeflo 10 hours agorootparentI think most C programmers know that the size of ints is implementation defined, and I've programmed on platforms where it was 2 bytes instead of 4. But when someone promises a brain teaser, and then asks an unclear question, you read that and go \"What the author actually means can't be that dumb, can it?\" It's annoying when a charitable reading of an unclear statement leads to an aggressive \"gotcha\". reply croes 10 hours agorootparent>I think most C programmers know that the size of ints is implementation defined, and I've programmed on platforms where it was 2 bytes instead of 4. So it's easy to say: I don't know. reply codeflo 10 hours agorootparentBut I do know. Though not specified by the standard, ints are 4 bytes on any standard platform anyone has used in this millennium. reply pajko 2 hours agorootparentNope. On 8-bit platforms int is 16-bit wide, and even on some 16-bit platforms too. And this is not just history, embedded toolchains are prepared to handle the code as if it were platform-independent. The C99 uint32_t type is defined to 'unsigned int' on most sane platforms (not sure about ILP64, maybe it's unsigned short, but what's the uint16_t then?) But in the arm-none-eabi toolchain it's defined to 'unsigned long', because it is assumed that the same code is being built on 8-bit and 32-bit platforms, and so only 'long' guarantees the 32-bit range. And to avoid format string warnings, printf format strings shall contain the PRI*32 macros like PRIu32 instead of the raw %u / %lu. reply 1000100_1000101 9 hours agorootparentprevBut C works on non-standard platforms. On a TI DSP I used this millennium, sizeof(char) == sizeof(short) == sizeof(int) == sizeof(float) == sizeof(double) == sizeof(void *) == 1. Each and every type was 32-bit. Each memory address pointed to a unique 32-bits, ie: (int *)0, and (int *)1 did not overlap on that system. As sizeof measures addressable units, not bytes, so they're all size 1. Even on more standard systems, int is 4 bytes on systems using an ILP32 or LP64 convention, but ILP64 is a thing too, making int 8 bytes. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentYes, C supports that. But in practice, you're going to re-engineer the code. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's right. The crazy one is `long`, which is 32 bits on some platforms and 64 bits on other platforms. I solved that problem by never using `long`, opting instead for `int` for 32 bits, and `long long` for 64. `long` should be deprecated for 32 and 64 bit platforms, it's not fixable. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentIn D, we use `int` for 32 bits, `long` for 64 bits, and `size_t` for a pointer index. All the craziness just melts away. You can port the code back and forth between 32 and 64 bit patterns, and it just works. All those `int32_t` types are out back in the bin along with the whiteout. reply volemo 4 hours agorootparentI like Rust’s choice for basic types: initial and the number of bits: u8, i32, f64, etc. (I’m not comparing the languages in any way here, just praising a clean notation.) reply WalterBright 3 hours agorootparentI suspect the impetus for suffixing the number of bits is a bit of a backlash from C, where you never know how many bits are in a type. That has caused C programmers a lot of trouble and extra work. reply junon 9 hours agorootparentprevExactly. The answer isn't \"I don't know\". The answer is \"Undefined\". This isn't pedanticism. It's being unambiguous. This was a semantic quiz, not a technical one. reply kerkeslager 10 hours agorootparentprevPeople do tend to get annoyed when you don't communicate something, and then use it as a gotcha.

In either case, is \"I don't know\" wrong? Given the information in this quiz, I don't think it is. reply not2b 9 hours agorootparentThe quiz is exactly right: yes, the answers are all \"I don't know\" because the behavior is either implementation defined or undefined for each of them, and a couple of these reflect mistakes that I have had to point out in code reviews in recent years: expressions with multiple side effects without a sequence point, and shifting a N bit integral type by N bits (yes, that is undefined because some processor instruction sets mess up that case). C and C++ programmers need to be taught that they must not write that. reply Const-me 9 hours agorootparent> C and C++ programmers need to be taught that they must not write that. Things have stabilized quite a while ago. 99% of people who write C or C++ in 2024 will never use any computers where sizeof(int) != 4, or big endian processors, or systems where floats don’t conform to IEEE-754 standard. Why shouldn’t they write code which requires these particular details from their compiler and the target processor? reply SAI_Peregrinus 7 hours agorootparentI'd say there's no issue with writing such code, so long as it's protected by a compile-time assertion. That said, if you use a variable-width integer type (`char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`) instead of a fixed-width type (`int32_t` & such) for anything other than passing parameters to existing libraries (including the standard library) I'd say you're Doing It Wrong. If you actually intend to have a variable-width, use one of the `_least` or `_fast` types to make it clear that you didn't just screw up. reply avgcorrection 10 hours agoparentprevSuch an explicit option might have given the game away. I haven’t programmed in C much but my thought would be, “wait is the gimmick here that everything is UB or implementation defined?” reply firebaze 9 hours agoparentprevAny experienced C programmer knows this is undefined behavior. But taking this test, would you really check \"I don't know\" if you do know it is UB, when there is no option \"platform specific\" or \"UB\"? reply genman 9 hours agorootparentYes, because platform is not specified, so you really do not know. Or you really don't know until you know what the platform is. reply sitzkrieg 8 hours agoparentprevzero mention of misra to boot reply notfed 9 hours agoprevSeems like some people are getting their ego hurt because they don't like being told they got the wrong answer. Very human. This quiz isn't an IQ test, people, and the questions are intentionally trick questions. It's essentially a form of cynicism intended to demonstrate major design oversights of the C programming language. So calm down and have a laugh. Also, \"I don't know\" is the right answer. If you can't accept that, you may need to meditate more. reply red75prime 11 hours agoprevIf it were \"Implementation defined\" and \"Undefined\" or \"I know that I can't answer\" instead of \"I don't know\", I'd have done better. Choosing to answer that you don't know is hard, especially if you know why you can't give definite answer. reply ummonk 10 hours agoparentYeah if the first one weren't so obviously implementation defined, I'd have second-guessed myself on a lot of the others. reply LatticeAnimal 11 hours agoprevIf anyone is curious, on gcc 12.3.0 and clang 16.0.6 (x86_64), the answers are what most people (who have written lots of C) would expect: 1) 8 2) 0 3) 160 4) 1 (both clang and gcc output a warning) 5) 2 (only clang outputs a warning) While I like the idea of this quiz, I think it would be more powerful if it provided examples of compilers / architectures where these are not the correct answers. (I also think thorough unit tests would catch most of these errors) reply ryao 10 hours agoparentMy answers for 2, 3 and 5 were different: 2) I thought the type would be promoted to short. It turns out that the result of the arithmetic operation is promoted to int. 3) The signness of char is platform dependent. It is signed on x86 and amd64, but unsigned everywhere else. After seeing my mistake, I would expect this to cause the answer to be -96 on amd64 from sign extension when it converted into an integer, yet it is 160, which is what I would have expected from a platform where char is signed. If anyone knows why it is 160 here, please let me know. 5) This is a classic. I know to answer I do not know because despite having an Operator Precedence, C famously says that this is undefined. I have no idea why the standard does this when there is a clearly right answer. Java for example makes this have only 1 right answer. reply erhaetherth 9 hours agorootparentCan you explain 3? A space is 20 IIRC, 2013 is 260. An unsigned char tops out at 255 but I guess this one is* signed so... that's 127. And then I have no idea what happens, some kind of overflow, but I don't know the wrapping rules. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparent' ' in original C is the encoding for space. This might be ASCII or EBCDIC or something else local to a specific hardware implementation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC So, maybe 0x20, maybe 0x40, maybe something else. At least you know that '0', '1', .., ''9' are contiguous. reply juunpp 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's 0x20 like others pointed out. The wrapping rule here is that signed integer overflow is UB. reply defrost 6 hours agorootparentAssuming ASCII char encoding ... which isn't a given in C, just extremely commonplace. reply jbeninger 9 hours agorootparentprevI made the same mistake having worked with URL encoding for so long. \" \" is 20...in hex. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparent\" \" is a C string constant ... so a space encoding followed by a NUL encoding. reply ryao 9 hours agorootparentprev' ' is 0x20 or 32. reply defrost 8 hours agorootparentor 0x40 .. or something else. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC reply Farmadupe 11 hours agoparentprevThe author is making a deliberate point about undefined behaviour in the article. Hence them not executing worked examples. In fact, by not doing so they are making a subtle implicit statement that it is uninteresting to consider actually attempting to execute these snippets. The third paragraph of the \"P.S\" of the article (you have to press submit to see it) is the one that really gives the game away. reply ryao 10 hours agorootparentMost of these things are implementation defined rather than undefined. Only the 5th is undefined. reply 1000100_1000101 9 hours agorootparentMore than implementation defined, for some you need context that simply isn't given. On the ones with mixed-type structs, even if you know what system it's compiled for you don't know if someone has used pragma pack 1 to byte pack the data instead of standard packing. Just seeing the struct, you still don't know. reply ryao 8 hours agorootparentGood point, although that is not part of standard C. reply ksherlock 7 hours agorootparent'#pragma pack' isn't part of the C standard, but #pragma is and \"causes the implementation to behave in an implementation-defined manner.\" reply LatticeAnimal 10 hours agorootparentprevI agree that in theory it would be cool to have C code that uses only defined behavior and works on all platforms for all eternity. However, I think most programs have a fairly clear understanding of what platforms (OS+arch) they are targeting and what compilers they are using to target those platforms. If the compiler has defined behavior (and you have unit tests for that behavior) on all of these platforms, I don't think it is a huge deal. (Ideally you wouldn't... but sometimes its an accident or unavoidable) As an example, while struct padding (problem 1) might not technically be in the spec, it is a cornerstone of FFI and every new compiler (that supports C FFI) has a way to compile structs with the same padding. To my original point, if the article had instead given examples of compilers + architectures that produced different answers, I might feel differently. However, just saying mentioning that these weird edge cases are undefined (in the spec) doesn't mean much to me. reply not2b 9 hours agoparentprevThe case with multiple increments in an expression might produce different results depending on optimization level, perhaps not in this case but in other cases. That is because the compiler is allowed to use any order, so the order it picks might depend on what is in the registers. reply erhaetherth 9 hours agoparentprev5) How does 2 make sense? Shouldn't be 0 + 1? Or does the pre-increment take precedence over the addition, thus the left i is 1 but not because of the post-increment? reply P-Nuts 16 minutes agorootparentTo get 2, there are (at least) a couple of ways it can happen, we can do i=0,i++ and get LHS=0, now i=1,++i and get RHS=2. Or we can do i=0,++i and get RHS=1, then i=1,i++ and get LHS=1. However we’re also allowed to do something like this: i=0, a=i, b=i, b=b+1, RHS=b (RHS=1), LHS=a (LHS=0), a=a+1, i=a, i=b. Probably quite a lot of other things are allowed to happen. Usual disclaimer that a standard-compliant compiler is allowed to vaporise your cat etc as part of UB. The thing to Google is “sequence points”. reply dang 9 hours agoprevRelated: So You Think You Know C?

EDIT: I will never understand HN comment newlines. reply vbezhenar 10 hours agoprevMy recent WTF with C and C++ was that I found out that C++ compiler can just throw away infinite loop (and clang does that), while C compiler must not throw it away and must compile it as expected. It's all according to the standard. For example it's a typical construct for embedded software. That solidified my opinion that C and C++ are very different languages despite naive view being that C is just a subset of C++. They're fundamentally different. reply wzdd 10 hours agoparentI got curious about this. It seems that C11 at least is much closer to the C++ behaviour: under certain conditions, compilers can assume that loops terminate even if they can't prove it. See https://krinkinmu.github.io/2021/12/12/pain-of-infinite-loop... for example and the relevant part of the standard, N1509 (Clang's compatibility chart referencing that: https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html). Importantly (see for example https://blog.regehr.org/archives/140) it's not that the standard previously explicitly forbade this sort of optimisation, it's just that it wasn't very clear and compiler writers interpreted it differently. So in summary, yes, they're different languages, but \"modern\" C is is less different for this particular thing. reply ryao 9 hours agorootparentHow they treat infinite loops that obviously never terminate (e.g. while (1)) is probably of greater interest. The first link gives this code: namespace { void Panic() { while (1); } } // namespace extern \"C\" void kernel() { Panic(); } The clang++ really does optimize this away: https://godbolt.org/z/1Wf135918 The same thing happens when I let clang++ compile a C version as C++: https://godbolt.org/z/MxcGfWhej However, if I compile it as C with clang, I get an infinite loop: https://godbolt.org/z/x63fo33Wa reply ryao 10 hours agoparentprevHere is another. In C, union types support type punning. In C++, they broke that guarantee, so if you compile C code that uses a union type as C++ code, it could be broken. It would be nice to know why they broke this. My guess is that it violated the strong type philosophy of C++ and thus had to be broken on ideological grounds. C++ also broke implicit void pointer conversions, but at least that one had the reason that it was incompatible with function overloading. Not that anyone involved with C++ would tell you this. Instead, they provide bad C code that breaks the strict aliasing rule and claim that breaking implicit void pointer conversions somehow follows from it when in reality that is a non-sequitur: https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#void-ptr reply charleslmunger 10 hours agoparentprevWhen would you want a loop that does not terminate and does not perform I/O, read/write a volatile, synchronize with another thread, or perform an atomic operation? reply ryao 10 hours agorootparentOne time the heat at my place went out and I wanted to repurpose my machine as a space heater.

Primarily, I have determined that I really don't like dealing with manual memory management. For all the tasks I'm interested in, C's performance gains over a GC'd language are marginal at best. Number crunching? Julia is competitive with C. Web servers? The JVM will handle it just fine. Microcontrollers? For what I do Lua+NodeMCU or MicroPython does everything I need it to. Reasonably fast command line application? Go's got you covered. When I do use C in 2024, I pretty much always cheat and use the Boehm GC, which is fast enough for whatever I need it for. I'm not smart enough to know if I handled pointers correctly, and I don't know that I want to spend the time to get smart enough. Obviously systems C and manual memory management has a place in the driver and kernel world, and if you're genuinely good with it then my hat goes off to you, but I don't feel like it buys me enough today to use it much. reply pockybum522 10 hours agoprevProgrammers annoyed with the 'quiz' might really enjoy this book on that site, which is an excellent read. https://wordsandbuttons.online/SYTYKC.pdf reply tpoacher 51 minutes agoprevwell, just from reading the title, i assumed it would be trying to make a point, so I took the test without even reading the questions and got 5/5. PS: 'sizeof with parentheses' looks so weird to me. reply Const-me 10 hours agoprevMy today’s WTF on the topic. The following C++ returns incorrect value when the argument is 8 or greater: inline uint64_t makeRemainderMask( ptrdiff_t missingLanes ) { // This is not a branch, compiles to conditional move missingLanes = std::max( missingLanes, (ptrdiff_t)0 ); // Make a mask of 8 bytes // No need to clip for missingLanes >= missingLanes * 8; return mask; } TIL the language standard defines right shift operator for unsigned types in a weird way, making so for uint64_t argument, a >> b is equal to a >> ( b % 64 ). I expected zero on the output for b >= 64, not that. reply dzaima 10 hours agoparentC++ doesn't even define it as that; it's actually just undefined behavior to shift by any amount greater than or equal to the width! reply ksherlock 10 hours agoparentprevCPUs handle excessively large shifts in implementation defined ways. Some return 0. Some trap. x86 masks the right hand side with & 63 (for a 64-bit shift) so shifting by 65 is equivalent to shifting by 1. In C and C++ it's undefined behavior (Really it should be implementation defined) reply sweetjuly 10 hours agorootparentRISC-V is even more fun where they shift based on shamt[4:0] (or [5:0] in XLEN=64 mode). So, if you do something like: li t0, 128 li t1, 1 sll t2, t1, t0 You'll get t2 := 1 since t0[5:0] == 6'b0 (i.e. no shift). It's a very sensible solution IMO if you don't have trapping arithmetic since you don't have to do anything special to handle illegal shifts, it just works. reply Const-me 10 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, thanks. BTW, I fixed like that: uint64_t mask = -( missingLanes >= missingLanes * 8; I only care about the AMD64 because the surrounding code uses AVX2 intrinsics, i.e. my new version is hopefully good enough. I’ve tried conditional operator to not rely on these details, however VC++ failed to generate fast code from them. It emit branches, and that code is kinda performance critical. reply dzaima 10 hours agorootparentprevAnother different shift implementation is in ARM NEON, where, for a non-constant shift amount, there's only a shift-left, and that with a negative shift amount gets you right shift; thus, were it forced to choose only one behavior, either scalar or vector shifts would get worse. reply not2b 9 hours agoparentprevNo, it doesn't. Shifting by a wider amount than the width of the type, or an equal amount, is undefined in C and C++. That was done because different processors handled the case differently, meaning that any specification would give one processor a substantial time penalty compared to the competition. So the committee gave up on obtaining agreement and called it undefined. reply bxparks 9 hours agorootparentBut why did they make it Undefined Behavior instead of Implementation Defined? I love the C language, but there are now so many UBs in the language, it is painful to use. reply ryao 8 hours agorootparentIf they did, we would have two subtly different dialects of C for cyclic shift and zeroing shift, and possibly even worse, combinations of the two.

I came from a time when portable code had to work on an incredibly diverse range of platforms with many different compilers, some proprietary, and all of these corresponded to real issues, not language lawyer nitpicking. reply WalterBright 9 hours agoprevHaving implemented two C compilers, knowing every last detail is sometimes a bit annoying, because one thinks \"why the heck is that there!\" For example, the syntax for a cast is indistinguishable from that for a function call for many cases. The only way to parse it correctly is to keep a symbol table of the typedefs. Believe me I tried, and finally threw in the towel and did a special symbol table just for typedefs. This is just pointless complexity. It's why D's cast syntax looks like this: cast(T)x; i.e. cast is a keyword. reply ryao 8 hours agoparentWould you give C examples of this? I am having trouble imagining how a cast would look like a function call to the compiler. reply trealira 8 hours agorootparentAlthough I'm not who you asked, I can think of a slightly contrived example. If a is a variable name, then this is using b as the first argument to call the function a (which is surrounded by unnecessary parentheses). If it's a type name, it's casting b to the type a. result = (a)(b); reply WalterBright 8 hours agorootparentIt's not contrived enough - it happens in real C code. reply trealira 7 hours agorootparentMy example is slightly contrived because the parentheses around b are unnecessary to cast it, but it becomes more realistic if it's a more complex expression like this: (foo)(a + b) Or this: // Comma expression or function call arguments? (bar)(first = side_effect++, second) reply WalterBright 7 hours agorootparentYeah, (a)(b,c) is that a comma-expression or an argument list? reply throwawaymaths 9 hours agoparentprevSeems pointlessly complex too. Why didn't you just make it cast(T, x)? reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentNeither is more complex.

Answers can be obtained by compiling with \"-O3 -fsanitize=undefined\" and seeing which functions include __ubsan_handle*. int16_t a( int16_t a, int16_t b) { return a*b; } uint16_t b(uint16_t a, uint16_t b) { return a*b; } int32_t c( int32_t a, int32_t b) { return a*b; } uint32_t d(uint32_t a, uint32_t b) { return a*b; } reply ryao 9 hours agoparentFor 32-bit types, the undefined behavior is where I expected it to be, but it is the opposite for the 16-bit types. Why are the 16-bit types different? To make things weirder, I tried 8-bit and 64-bit versions. The 64-bit version behaved like the 32-bit versions, but the 8-bit versions had no undefined behavior checks. Why is 8-bit so different? reply dzaima 9 hours agorootparentSmaller-thanint' types get implicitly promoted to 'int' before arithmetic.

In standard C, this requires C23 and only works for macros that are not used as expressions. Or you can use GNU extensions and make it work for expressions and work even on old compilers. reply yongjik 8 hours agoprevKnowledge is knowing that sizeof(int) is implementation-defined.

There are a bunch of problems with this approach: a. Your target ecosystem(s) probably follows a few norms in cases not defined by the standard. If it works on the target ecosystem(s), nobody cares if it's non-standard. Testing on the target ecosystem, preferably automated testing, is the standard that matters. b. Some of these norms are extraordinarily powerful. For example, check out NaN boxing[1]. Standard? Hell naw. Useful? So useful that it's practically mandatory for dynamic PL interpreters to compete on performance. c. So let's say you're targeting an ecosystem that does some atypical stuff, i.e. doesn't follow the norms mentioned. Well, joke's on you, off-the-beaten-path ecosystems typically also have bleeding-edge tooling that doesn't implement the standards. So again, testing on the target ecosystem, preferably automated testing, is the standard that matters. d. So let's say you're targeting a lot of ecosystems, so many ecosystems that you can't reasonably test on all of them, like if you're writing NetBSD or the JVM. Okay, well, the edge cases of the C standard still don't matter because you just shouldn't be using any of the off-the-beaten-path parts of the C standard anyway, since those parts are the parts which aren't implemented in lots of obscure architectures. e. And sure, if you really just enjoy being annoyingly pendantic you can go and learn the whole C standard and go write your own blog test with integrated quiz and then condescendingly tell people they don't know C, with the implication that you do know C. But the reality is that knowing those weird edge cases of C isn't useful because if you actually use those edge cases of C then nobody else on your team can read your code. f. And lastly, there's plenty of defined behavior which you shouldn't use, too. Just because you know what it does, doesn't mean the next person reading your code knows. My answers to the questions in the test: 1. 8 on most ecosystems. If it matters, test it, but if it matters you probably need to use one of the non-standard extensions mentioned to do anything about it, so the standard didn't matter so much did it? 2. 0 on most ecosystems. But frankly, don't use `short int`, ever. Use int with the limits defined in `limits.h` if you just want the most efficient integer width, and if you need a specific integer width use the the types in `stdint.h`. Yes, I'm aware that `int` isn't defined as the most efficient in the standard, but `int` is one of the first things people implement in a C compiler so the likelihood of coming across an int that isn't the fastest integer size is absurdly small. 3. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Who cares if this is defined? Even if it were defined it would be bad code. Don't multiply chars, FFS. 4. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Obviously bit twiddling when you don't know teh structure of the bits is bad. The fact that Endianness is relevant in bit shifts and yet is not brought up by the author does in fact show the dangers of smugly pretending you know C better than other people. 5. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Who cares if this is defined? Even if it were defined it would be bad code because depending on the pre/postfixedness of ++ is hard for most people to reason about.

Most went in the direction of being Big Idea languages that tried to supplant domains like C++ and Java. The language that is probably the closest is Zig, but I hear Odin is pretty good too (the website specifically mentions it as a C alternative) The things I like about C aren't really about the language itself. There just aren't many programming languages that do these things well 1. Cross platform across Linux, MacOS (Intel and Arm), Windows (Without the use of MinGW And Cygwin), *BSD 2. Ability to create an executable 3. Small programs that start quick 4. Simple syntax that does not obfuscate when allocations are occurring For GCed languages GO is probably the one that best fits this criteria for most people. Sometimes I wish someone just took C and improved it. Instead of looking at C++ and thinking \"what features should C have that C++ has\" It should look back at C and go \"What features does C not have, that it should\"? Some that come to mind are 1. A better syntax for creating pointers and dereferencing them 2. Fixed const so that it works with array initialization 3. Modules instead of headers 4. Cross platform string types that encoded length 5. Hash tables 6. Remove preprocessor macros and replace common use cases with things built into the language 7. Build system that didn't rely on Make, Cmake, Ninja, Autotools, configure etc 8. Easy interop with C Maybe this is a lot to ask, but most languages I see are solving waay more problems then this. 2,4,5, can be done without leaving C, which is why most people homebrew their own solutions. I think Pascal actually comes close, but it's held back by the fact that the editor support is pretty poor. Pacal-Mode in Emacs is not good, and Lazarus with its multiple floating windows is infuriating to have to alt+tab multiple times to switch to and from it. Plus I could never actually get it to build my programs properly without throwing some dwarf errors. Recently I've been playing around with Gambit-C and it seems to suit most of my needs. It compiles to C, and then the C code is compiled with Clang, MSVC, or GCC depending on what your platform is. I get the benefit of a language that has more features than C with it being R7RS (but still being small because it's Scheme) and implementing the most common SRFIs (including hashes), but with all the portability of C. It also has dead simple interop with C using the C-Lambda and C-Define special forms (you can write C directly inside the Gambit code)^1 which means you can leverage C code with hardly any effort. There are tradeoffs with this approach, but IMO almost all of them are ecosystem related which can be fixed, as opposed to language related, which might be impossible to fix without breaking compatibility with existing code 1. https://www.deusinmachina.net/p/gambit-c-scheme-and-c-a-matc... reply pjmlp 2 hours agoparentActually Modula-2 came in 1978, Ada in 1983, Mac OS shipped with Object Pascal in 1984.

IIRC unspecified behavior in C is not required to be known or consistent. reply plorkyeran 10 hours agorootparentprevMy bigger problem with the first one is that the explanation is incorrect and it isn't actually about structure padding. The explanation is making the incorrect assumption that `sizeof(int)` is always 4, but it isn't. `sizeof(*(&s))` can be as small as 2. reply advisedwang 10 hours agoparentprevThat's kind of his point though - don't rely on your intuition for how most common compilers work!

And it wasn't about \"intuition about how compilers work\", because not all of these deal with undefined behavior.

My personal gotcha was finding out I was relying on shifting an unsigned integer by the bit size of the integer to be 0, as if \"you shifted every bit out of the integer, leaving 0\". Shift any size under the integer's size in bits? Yep, those bits were shifted out leaving 0. Shift that last bit? Nope, that's Undefined Behaviour, and suddenly it's not 0 just because you changed a flag. reply chasil 10 hours agorootparentprevTake the manipulation of the space, for example.

We can know what is happening in memory in a human readable way. And that is the beauty of it.

They are technically `undefined` according to the C standard, but are the behavior of every mainstream compiler. So much of the world's open-source code depends upon these that it's unlikely to change. Using clang version 15.0, the first 2 produce no warning messages, even with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic. Conversely, the last 3 produce warning messages without any extra compiler flags. The behavior of the first two examples are practically defined even if undefined according to the standard. Now, when programming for embedded environments, like for 8-bit microcontrollers, all bets are off. But then you are using a quirky environment-specific compiler that needs a lot more hand-holding than just this. It's not going to compiler open-source libraries anyway. I do know C. I knowingly write my code knowing that even though some things are technically undefined in the standard, that they are practically defined (and overwhelmingly so) for the platforms I target. reply GuB-42 9 hours agoparent> Now, when programming for embedded environments Something that a lot of C programmers do... Most people who write for typical desktop and mobile computers don't do C. They tend to do C++ or other, higher level languages.

If you intend on relying on such assumptions, make it explicit, for example using padding, stdint, etc...

That said, warnings do not necessarily mean that the code is invoking undefined behavior. For example, with if (a = b) GCC will generate a warning, unless you do if ((a = b)).
