    "content": "Google has a secret browser hidden inside the settingsPosted on June 26, 2023I recently discovered a secret browser located inside the \u201cManage my account\u201d popup that Android has in various apps (quite important apps, such as Settings, and all Google suite apps). The browser even bypasses parental control!How to get there?Getting there\u2026. takes some work:1. Go into Settings\u2192Google (or any app that lets you choose your account) and click on \u201cManage my account\u201d.2. Then go to the \u201cSecurity\u201d tab. In there, scroll down until you find \u201cPassword Manager\u201d. Click on it.3. Click on the \u2018Settings\u2019 icon in the top-right.4. Scroll down until \u201cSet up on-device encryption\u201d appears. Click on it, then click on \u201cLearn more about on-device encryption\u201d.5. Now you are in the browser. But you want to go to Google.com! So click on the hamburger menu, then click \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d.6. Tap the nine dots at the top, wait 5 seconds (it takes some time to load) and click \u201cSearch\u201d (If you don\u2019t find the search icon, you can also scroll down until \u2018Google\u2019 and click on that)7. Logout from your Google account.8. You got the secret browser ! You can go anywhere. You can also play YouTube videos (with ads, unfortunately), and all of this is in the settings app (or whatever app you choose) !LiveOverflow in Settings appBrowser overview:Pros: It\u2019s a pretty private browser : it has no history and it auto logs out of all Google accounts that were logged-in, at the end of the session.Cons: the most obvious one is the back key, which means every time you press the back key, instead of going back one address in the history, it goes back into the password manage settings, but I guess it could be considered an advantage \u2013 as an emergency key for privacy.The same goes for no address bar. (But look at the glass half full: it still doesn\u2019t advertise itself on the installation page of other browsers).But there are another things that prevent this browser from being a secure browser: The dangerous functions.The dangerous functions:As I was using this browser, I discovered a strange thing. A weird JavaScript object named mm. To see this, go to eruda, (just because it\u2019s the best mobile JavaScript console I know) and type mmScreenshot of eruda expend the mm objectAs you see, there are three functions:Let\u2019s start with closeView() function, because it\u2019s the only clear function: it just closes your browser, as would happen if you press the back key. Not a standard JavaScript function, but nothing to worry about. (you can try it right there by typing into eruda \u2018mm.closeView()\u2018)Then you have two methods which I don\u2019t know what they do, but they sound scary. As this is a secret-browser of the \u2018on-device encryption\u2019 feature, I can guess, they are both used to set your local encryption keys. So it looks like a malicious website can put their keys there, and try to make you pay for them!I think this is the time to tell you that I already reported this to Google, and they say this is not a security vulnerability (probably because this secret browser is not very popular), and that the parental control bypass is the \u201cIntended Behavior\u201d \ud83d\ude42Google\u2019s answer to my reportIf you enjoy using it, please let me know in the comments what you did with it.Hope you enjoy your (new?) browser that you didn\u2019t know you had !There is a cool Hacker News discussion on this article.",

The hardware requires a smartphone for pairingThe product collects GPS co-ordinates, cell phone tower data and nearby Wifi beaconsLocation data is sent over the Internet to servers in Hong Kong and mainland ChinaApp store misleads consumers by stating that no personal data is collected or shared. Since the Android app requires location permissions to use the hardware device, users are effectively forced to continuously broadcast their physical location to 3rd parties in order to use the product.There are no legitimate reason for a car battery monitor application to track it\u2019s user\u2019s location. With over 100,000 downloads on Android alone, this raises significant privacy concernsIn this three part series:Part 1 - This pagePart 2 - Reverse engineering the AMap SDK location tracking featuresPart 3 - Reimplementing BLE functionality and obtaining the firmwareWithin this series of posts, we explore the discovery of an Bluetooth enabled battery voltage product, acquired from a popular electronics retailer in Australia. What started as an initial hunch lead me down rabbit a rabbit hole to discover that the app covertly tracks the users physical location. It collects GPS co-ordinates, neighbouring cell phone tower location data and Wifi access points, sending this data to cloud servers in Hong Kong and mainland China.At the time of writing, location data is sent to servers related to two seperate corporate entities:The product / app developer, Leagend, hosted in Alibaba Cloud, Hong Kongbm2.quicklynks.com / 47.244.125.231The location services SDK developer, AMap, hosted in Alibaba Cloud, Beijingdualstack-cgicol.amap.com / 106.11.130.194Partly responsible for the extensive data collection is an embedded library used, called AMap, which is a \u201cleading provider of digital map in China\u201d.Acquired by Alibaba, it is stated that \u201cIn 2018, Amap became the first Chinese maps service to navigate a path to 100 million daily users\u201d. In part 2 we look under the hood at how AMap is not only collecting the GPS co-ordinates, but also every other possible location data the phone can collect - surveying Wifi and telecommunication cell phone tower data.The Android application which connects to the battery monitor device, BM2 100K+ downloads, with 1.55K reviews.The iPhone iOS version can be found here. While I have not peformed any static analysis on the iOS decompilations to date, inspection of the network traffic from the phone reveals that that the Apple iPhone version is also sending location data to remote servers.Feel free to reach out to me on twitter for partially reverse engineered decompilation of the sources referenced. The subsequent posts should provide enough detail for others to independently verify what is being reported.A wireshark trace of mobile trafficProduct informationI acquired the vehicle battery monitoring Bluetooth device sold under the brand PowerTech from a popular Australian electronics retailer, Jaycar Electronics.This appears to be a re-branded Bluetooth 4.0 Battery Monitor by a company called Leagend which is available on Amazon for purchase.It\u2019s resold under local brands, for example another popular auto retailer, Repco, sells it under the Century brand.Other device names are \u201cZX-1689\u201d and \u201cLi Battery Monitor\u201d which the application looks for in the device name of the advertising BLE beacon which are indentified in part3.The device is quite simple - you connect it to the terminals of a battery and pair it with your phone. It shows the battery voltage/percentage and allows you to run some crank tests. That\u2019s what\u2019s advertised.Jaycar (Powertech) and Repco (Century) branded BM devicesAdditionally, the required application runs in the background, effectively turning a smart phone into location scanning device. Having your phone become a continuous Wifi scanner drains the battery - and this isn\u2019t something legitimate application developers want. People do complain about issues caused. Patrick\u2019s review of the BM2 app would agree:While we can\u2019t explain the legitimate reason a battery voltage monitor would need to know your GPS location, a charitable explanation of the AMap SDK collecting GPS, Wifi and cell tower data is they are attempting to do what Google and Apple already do - build a relational database, mapping phone cell towers and wifi access points to GPS co-ordinates. When a phone has bad GPS signal, knowing the adjacent Wifi access points or phone towers within reception can help increase accuracy.Some terminologyAMap collects the telecomunication provider\u2019s adjacent cell phone tower location data - Specifically the cell global identity. This is an ID that uniquely identifies a cell, unique across the whole world.The CGI is made up of:MCC = Mobile Country CodeMNC = Mobile Network CodeThe MCC + MNC make up the PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) - Identifies the mobile operator (e.g. Telstra, Australia)LAC = Location Area Code. Set of base stations grouped together in a geographical regionCI = Cell ID. Identifies base station transceiver within a region. Think of this as an \u2018antenna\u2019 that your phone is talking toIn 4G, technically TAC (tracking area code) is used.Wifi data collection includes:BSSID MAC address of Wifi access points.SSID - Access point nameThe AMap developers go to lengths to conceal the behaviour, encrypting any data before it touches disk or sent over the Internet. Location data is encrypted with ephemeral AES keys which is then encrypted with a public RSA key. This removes the dependency for certificate pinning and ensures man-in-the-middle inspection of the network traffic is not possible without modifications to the application or obtaining the corresponding private RSA key.Data privacyNote: As of 27th of June 2023, the BM2 app developer have updated the privacy statements on both the Google Play and Apple App stores - now mentioning that precise location data is being collected.The following is stated on the BM2 app Android Play store:One by one, let\u2019s review the statements claimed:1. No data shared with third partiesIn addition to your battery statistics (e.g. voltage), the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of your location is sent to the BM2 application cloud servers, quicklynks.comCrash analytics are sent to a 3rd party Chinese company, umeng.comWifi, cell phone tower and GPS co-ordinates are sent to a Chinese company, AMap2. No data collectedSelf explanatory3. Data is encrypted in transitData sent to the BM2 cloud servers is unencryptedHow about on the Apple store? take a lookThe privacy policy fine print does mention \u201cHong Kong\u201d and \u201clocation information\u201d. We all read the fine print right?Location and Android permissionsFor the application to work, you must give the Android application permissions that let it obtain location information otherwise it won\u2019t work: For Bluetooth scanning, Android requires this permission. At least with the iOS version, you can hit \u201cdeny\u201d when it asks for location permissions and the battery monitor device will still work.To expand on the reason cited, it\u2019s best explained from Android\u2019s developer documentation:To provide users with greater data protection, starting in this release, Android removes programmatic access to the device\u2019s local hardware identifier for apps using the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth APIs. To access the hardware identifiers of nearby external devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scans, your app must now have the [ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION] or [ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION] permissions.I would argue that such a broad permission that covers both Bluetooth, GPS and Cell data offers lower data protections - as it opens up app developers to abuse this permission as we see with the BM2 application that really just requires BLE scanning. BLE scanning can be achieved with just BLUETOOTH_SCAN, available on Android 12+.Update 2023-06-27 Google provide further guidance here. It is possible to specify ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION with android:usesPermissionFlags set to neverForLocation. This is only for when Bluetooth scan results are used to derive physical location. That does not seem to be the case here though.The hardwareOur interest lies mostly in the phone applications that interface with the hardware, although it\u2019s customary to at least take a peek inside and explore what the possibilities are for pulling off the firmware.Not much too it; some voltage regulators and a single SoC - a Texas Instruments CC2541) all in one Bluetooth Low Energy MCU. Datasheet here. Some possible debug ports are spotted:Click to enlargeThe CPU is based on an 8 bit Intel 8051. Later revisions of the CC series use ARM cortex architecture.According to the specifications, the CC series SoCs support on chip debugging via a proprietary interface - No JTAG or SWD to be seen here. This means we will need the CC Debugger or try some custom Arduino implementation, although this specific IC is not supported. As the device supports over-the-air updates, there is a REST endpoint which will return the firmware over HTTP, documented in part 3It appears there is no shunt or other current sensing circuity. Hardware wise, this really is as simple as it gets.The test setupFor testing I\u2019m using a small led acid 12v battery with the BM2 battery monitor and a rooted Android handset which will be used for dynamic instrumentation.Notably, the setup sat on my desk. As we discover in part 2 of this blog post series, the AMap location data is only written to it\u2019s database from memory when it detects you are physically moving. To overcome this and other hurdles, Frida and Objection used extensively to instrument the running software in run time.Dynamic analysisIntercepting network trafficMitmproxy is a defacto \u201cin the middle\u201d proxy software and it now supports a new mode using wireguard. What this means is it\u2019s extremely trivial (and quick) to peek inside mobile application traffic with minimal configuration. Once the Wireguard application is installed on the handset, simply mitmweb --mode=wireguard and take a scan the QR code on screen by taking an image from the handset. Immediately all traffic from the handset will be sent over a Wireguard tunnel to mitmproxy. Browsing to http://mitm.it then allows you to download a certificate to add to the trust store. With iOS the process is trivial. Android has now made it harder to do, and in this case I had to use a rooted handset.Note: Since the BM2 does not use HTTPS, there is no need to even install a certificate. What this means is that anyone can independently identify that their latitude and longitude co-ordinates are being sent on either iOS or Android with no modifications to their phone.After the application connects to the battery monitor device, we see a POST request is sent to http://bm2.quicklynks.com:8080/api/bm2/userDevice/upload?.Latitude and longitude fields are highlighted in green.At the time of writing, this server resolves to a host in Alibaba cloud, HK:$ host bm2.quicklynks.combm2.quicklynks.com has address 47.244.125.231$ curl https://ipinfo.io/47.244.125.231{ \"ip\": \"47.244.125.231\", \"city\": \"Sham Shui Po\", \"region\": \"Sham Shui Po\", \"country\": \"HK\", \"loc\": \"22.3302,114.1595\", \"org\": \"AS45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd.\", \"timezone\": \"Asia/Hong_Kong\",}In this specific request we also see a sample of the battery voltages, the hardware MAC address of the device (nickname and serialNo).Spoofing GPS co-ordinatesGPS co-ordinates can be spoofed by using the following Frida to dynamically hook into android.location.Location.{getLatitude|getLongitude} methods. Frida will be used extensively in our testing. More on this later.location.jsconst lat = 39.1090;const lng = -76.7700;Java.perform(function () {  var hookedClass = \"android.location.Location\" var Location = Java.use(hookedClass); Location.getLatitude.implementation = function() {   console.log(\"[+] \" + hookedClass + \"new lat:\" + lat); return lat; } Location.getLongitude.implementation = function() {   console.log(\"[+] \" + hookedClass + \"new lng:\" + lng); return lng; }})To invoke: $ frida -U -l location.js -f com.dc.battery.monitor2Memory analysisAs stated earlier, GPS, Wifi and cell data is gathered by the embedded AMap library. The code is obsfucated to make reverse engineering more time consuming. Anything that touches disk or the network is encrypted serialized binary blobs. This calls for some quick wins with dynamic instrumentation as the code runs on a handset while paired to the hardware battery monitor.For example, we can peek inside the application\u2019s heap memory. For this we will use a plugin for Objection called Wallbreaker. After some quick analysis of the AMap library we know what class names to find instances in memory (click pictures to expand):GPS data:Telecommuncation provider cell data:Wifi data (toString() enumerated):Static analysisDecompilationFirst let\u2019s grab the APK straight off the handset. We could of course get a copy from APK pure too from hereFirst identify the application name identifier which is com.dc.battery.monitor2:Obtain the path of the APK and pull it from the device with adb shell pm path then pull it off the phone.JADX is our choice for the de-compiler, and it\u2019s just great. Opening the .apk and it handles everything in one shot, from decompression to de-compiling the java bytecode into Java.The very first thing is to check the permissions in AndroidManifest.xml after opening the APK in APK in jadx-guiThe hightlights in green raises a few questions. We have explained why FINE_LOCATION is required, but why would a battery monitor application needs CAMERA, IMAGE_CAPTURE, ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE, MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS and RECORD_AUDIO ?At this point it\u2019s possible that this functionality is unused. More investigation is needed here.Very quickly we see that the decompilation of the java bytecode directly from the APK is going to be problematic. The entrypoint is com.stub.StubApp which has methods names obsfucated with xor encryption which indicates there is more work to do.<application android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme\" android:label=\"@string/apk_release_name\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\" android:name=\"com.stub.StubApp\"Fortunantly it\u2019s obvious that a commercial software packer called qihoo.util has been used. Zimperium has a good writeup on this packer as it\u2019s often found employeed in Chinese based mobile malware. It\u2019s somewhat advanced in the sense that the unpacked software is encrypted and packed into native, compiled library. People have written unpacking tools that claim to handle this packer such as android-unpacker. Given that developers often update and change their packing techniques, the unpacker tools in the public domain can quickly become outdated.As such we will take much easier approach - by using frida-dexdump it\u2019s possible to dump the original (unpacked) mobile application Dalvik executable bytecode from memory after opening the application on the handset.Qihoo 360 is not without their own contraversy, being \u201cplaced on the Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s Entity List due to U.S. national security concerns\u201d.After installing dexdump (e.g. pip3 install frida-dexdump), run it after opening the application:frida-dexdump -U -f com.dc.battery.monitor2 -dUse dex2jar to covert classes.dex to java bytecode:./d2j-dex2jar.sh ./com.sec.android.app.samsungapps/classes.dexWe can the use jadx to then decompile into readable java and now have the original application code, method names, variable names for com.dc.battery.monitor2, as no further obfuscation was done outside of the initial packing/encrypting.The exception here is the amap location services SDK library which was originally obsfucated which will make our time a little harder to reverse these parts. Fortunately class names are recoverable for the AMap related classes by selecting tools -> deobsfucation in JADX.While the variable or method names are random(ish) strings, the recovered class names are descriptive enough that with some effort the function of the classes and methods is identified with method and variables renamed appropriately by hand.Next up, in part 2 we will investigate how the embedded AMap SDK is not only sending the GPS co-ordinates, but Wifi and telecommunication cell tower data.Updated: May 21, 2023PreviousNext",

To Apple, they also make more revenue from their prioritization of marketing similar sounding two minute tracks in this \u201cnouveau pop\u201d format, backed up by a small amount of older superstar artist anniversary editions. Good original new music never makes it to the featured content sections.And Genres and algorithms are a mess. It applies across the board to all music and is really a problem for the flavors of House, Techno, and other genres that are simply labeled \u201cElectronic\u201d or \u201cDance.\u201d I\u2019m getting Avalon Emerson one minute, Bicep the next, to be ruined by corporate mass marketed deadmau5, follow by a Bad Bunny remix\u2026.worse is the algorithm which thought I might like corporate edc-esque superstars and poorly autotuned remixes- though I have not added a single song to my collection in 20 years of digital music consumption\u2026Can we do better than \u201cDance\u201d and \u201cElectronic?\u201d Of course they could, they haven\u2019t. One must go elsewhere.For House and Techno, this dearth of music discovery and search-ability methods by streaming companies makes room for independent music station alternatives, like Fault radio, or gives a reason for one to seek out artists via other means, like going to independent music festivals like Sunset Campout, Honcho campout, and other events highlighted on Resident Advisor, a poster in a nightclub, a text message listing the warehouse location.(Apple Music did at least bring back Beats in Space.)I think about the proliferation of streaming, and how it actually makes finding new content difficult for people who are not familiar with those other means of distribution.- We have deprioritized the concept of the local radio station, now what was alternative rock is a rebroadcast of an AM Sports broadcast (i.e KFOG)- the death of the sale of \u201csingles,\u201d made it a cheap entry point for people to experience a new artist. Releasing a track on Spotify doesn\u2019t feel as substantial.- and exclusively agreements contract provisions with corporate entities that engage in predatory practices that force up and coming artists to choose between performing for their fans at local venues, or extending their potential reach by putting their name on the bill for Coachella, sacrificing potential shows for a few hundred of miles away and several months on either side of the festival.- Additionally entertainment conglomerates like AEM and LiveNation are increasingly becoming the owners, or managers of, the entertainment venues in cities around the world. Similar exclusivity agreements can have a significant negative impact on unaffiliated independent venues ability to compete.I can\u2019t speak for anyone in particular from the Gen Z or Alpha generation.

From my perspective my ability to find \"good\" music is better than it ever would have been in the past.I find music suggestions from forums, review sites, subreddits, friends, online people I follow, etc. Then I can immediately listen to it with no effort or expense. I found my favorite album of all time from a random comment someone left on an internet thread.To me the idea of having to wait until a local radio station played a song, and then make a leap of faith on purchasing the album seems like such a worse experience.Similarly, in terms of creating music, it has never been easier to learn, create and distribute your own music. The rise of the internet has made it so much easier to find a niche communities of people making incredibly diverse and experimental music together.In my mind, streaming sites have two roles and do a very good job at both:- make all music as accessible as possible- suggest music for people who want to \"passively\" listen to music, which is how the average person has always listened to music (and that's a completely legitimate thing to want and enjoy)I see a lot of \"the death of cinema\", \"the death of music\", \"the death of video games\" takes around, and I can't help but feel like these views come from people who have lost track of where the \"niche\" communities has moved on to and then feel despair when to them it looks like the \"mainstream\" is all that exists.replyseanthemon 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I agree, I think another part of it is accessibility to tools and content.

Will we ever be able to surpass the classics?replyasdff 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think we peaked with music already, maybe in the early 2000s. Popular music was so simple before the 1970s. There were a few chord structures and you just had some generic verses and put it on a record. Take someone like leadbelly or bb king, they were just playing folk music that had been played for at least 100 years before either of them were born, reusing old verses or adding their own, adding a short guitar lick between verses if so inclined (bb admits this was even because he could not sing and play at the same time). A lot of their fame as a result was happenstance of being at the right place at the right time (leadbelly in particular) versus them being a head and shoulders better folk musician than the other musicians of their time. A lot of the Beatles and other such acts in the early 60s were like this too, just basic formulaic rock n roll songs with the artists marketed as heartthrobs more than musicians even. They all even had the same haircuts.Fast forward to something like Radiohead's Kid A and you have orders of magnitude more complexity going on the track. So many different sounds layered in very complicated manners. Its almost like a classical composition how there are motifs, movements, different emotions being evoked, but with any sound imaginable compared to what few are possible from the orchestra ensemble. A song from Kid A is just a part of the greater album itself. Nothing was made to stand on its own between radio advertisements.It seems these days we are reverting to how commercial music was always made. Very commercial studio focused with the artists removed from production. Generic lyrics written by low paid songwriting staff and same old tried and true chord progressions we've heard forever. The artist is a brand and a sexy person meant to sell products versus someone particularly talented with an instrument or with songwriting skills.replydragandj 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]And yet the Beatles stood the test of time much better than the alternative hits of the \u201890s (Radiohead included).

People still listen to both Radiohead and the Beatles and lesser known \"alternative\" acts from the 1960s like the velvet underground today. All went on to influence others. I'd say they all stood the test of time. Stuff like record sales depends a lot more on how well your label commercialized you versus your musicianship. The mid century media era was also much smaller in terms of competing artists that were actually put in front of listeners. 3 stations on TV, a few radio stations playing music from the same record labels, a shop in town selling records from a few major labels, and that's all the discovery you have. popular acts were far more popular proportionally than popular acts in later years, just because you didn't have much option or choice otherwise back then.replydragandj 56 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It means that the Beatles (who the parent mentioned explicitly as a basic formulaic rock in contrast to the \"peak\" from the '90s) is much more well known now than Radiohead, and could even have been more popular than Radiohead even during the peak of Radiohead's popularity (with the general audience, of course). I doubt that the problem of alternative bands was media exposure, because they had plenty in their heyday. The issue is that their music appeal only to a small(ish) subset of people, and that most people would like something else. I don't mean this as a bad thing.

I asked it to cut 30 seconds from the middle of a song (a spoken word portion without music) and then shorten the track by 30 seconds.

Instead I got:  at 00:00 a 00:16 segment (00:00\u201300:16)  at 00:16 a 00:51 segment (02:05\u201302:57)  at 01:07 a 02:31 segment (01:34\u201304:05)  at 03:39 a 00:11 segment (04:03\u201304:14)It's adding and repeating chunks of the song and cutting other parts and I'm not sure why.replystu2010 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]What's the maximum length?

    "content": "Rising corporate profits account for almost half the increase in Europe\u2019s inflation over the past two years as companies increased prices by more than spiking costs of imported energy. Now that workers are pushing for pay rises to recoup lost purchasing power, companies may have to accept a smaller profit share if inflation is to remain on track to reach the European Central Bank\u2019s 2-percent target in 2025, as projected in our most recent World Economic Outlook.Inflation in the euro area peaked at 10.6 percent in October 2022 as import costs surged after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and companies passed on more than this direct increase in costs to consumers. Inflation has since retreated to 6.1 percent in May, but core inflation\u2014a more reliable measure of underlying price pressures\u2014has proven more persistent. This is keeping the pressure on the ECB to add to recent interest-rate rises even though the euro area slipped into recession at the start of the year. Policymakers raised rates to a 22-year high of 3.5 percent in June.As the Chart of the Week shows, the higher inflation so far mainly reflects higher profits and import prices, with profits accounting for 45 percent of price rises since the start of 2022. That\u2019s according to our new paper, which breaks down inflation, as measured by the consumption deflator, into labor costs, import costs, taxes, and profits. Import costs accounted for about 40 percent of inflation, while labor costs accounted for 25 percent. Taxes had a slightly deflationary impact.In other words, Europe\u2019s businesses have so far been shielded more than workers from the adverse cost shock. Profits (adjusted for inflation) were about 1 percent above their pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of this year. Meanwhile, compensation of employees (also adjusted) was about 2 percent below trend. This is not the same as saying that profitability has increased, as discussed in our paper.Previous episodes of surging energy prices suggest that labor costs\u2019 contribution to inflation should grow going forward. In fact, it has already picked up over recent quarters. At the same time, the contribution from import prices has fallen since its peak in mid-2022.This lag in wage gains makes sense: wages are slower than prices to react to shocks. This is partly because wage negotiations are held infrequently. But after seeing their wages drop by about 5 percent in real terms in 2022, workers are now pushing for pay rises. The key questions are how fast wages will rise and whether companies will absorb higher wage costs without further increasing prices.Assuming that nominal wages rise at a pace of around 4.5 percent over the next two years (slightly below the growth rate seen in the first quarter of 2023) and labor productivity stays broadly flat in the next couple of years, businesses\u2019 profit share would have to fall back to pre-pandemic levels for inflation to reach the ECB\u2019s target by mid-2025. Our calculations assume that commodity prices continue to decline, as projected in April\u2019s World Economic Outlook.Should wages increase more significantly\u2014by, say, the 5.5 percent rate needed to guide real wages back to their pre-pandemic level by end-2024\u2014the profit share would have to drop to the lowest level since the mid-1990s (barring any unexpected increase in productivity) for inflation to return to target.As noted in our recent review of the euro-area economy, macroeconomic policies thus need to remain tight to anchor expectations and maintain subdued demand. This would coax firms to accept a compression of the profit share and real wages could recover at a measured pace.",

    "title": "I'm Done with Red Hat (Enterprise Linux)",
    "url": "https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/im-done-red-hat-enterprise-linux",
    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36479882",
    "content": "June 26, 2023Two years ago, Red Hat killed CentOS, a widely-used free version of their Enterprise Linux distribution.The community of CentOS users\u2014myself included\u2014were labeled as 'freeloaders', using the work of the almighty Red Hat corporation, without contributing anything back. Don't mind all the open source developers, Linux kernel contributors, and software devs who used CentOS for testing and building their software. Also ignore the fact that Red Hat builds their product on top of Linux, which they didn't build and don't own.I almost wrote off Red Hat back then. It felt like someone stuck a knife in my back.This past week, Red Hat took that knife and twisted it hard, when they published this blog post. Let there be no mistake: this was meant to destroy the distributions the community built to replace what Red Hat took away.There were only two things that kept me around after Red Hat betrayed us the first time: First, instead of attacking the community of open source users, many Red Hatters reached out and asked, \"How can we do better?\" It didn't heal the wound, but it meant something, knowing someone at Red Hat would at least listen.Second\u2014and more importantly\u2014Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux stepped in. They prevented a mass-exodus from the Red Hat ecosystem, giving developers like me a stable target for my open source work. But Rocky and Alma relied on Red Hat sharing their source code.Here's how it used to work:Red Hat would grab a copy of LinuxThey would add magic sauce that makes it Red Hat Enterprise LinuxThey would release a new versionThey would update a source code repository with all the data required to build it from scratchThat's kinda the status quo because in open source, the source... is open! And it doesn't matter if someone who uses your source benefits from it too... that's kind of what it's all about! We all benefit from sharing our work, and in this case, the GPL license Linux uses legally requires us to share it!Without that sharing, there would be no Debian, Arch, Mint, Ubuntu, PopOS, Fedora... or any of the other hundreds of Linux distros that build on each other and prop up the community.But Red Hat decided to put the source code behind a paywall. Now, this is legal. Technically, the GPL allows it. But it's generally rude and annoying to do that when the code you're locking down is largely based on other people's open source code.But... it's within their rights, so I won't argue that point. What I will argue is the current subscription agreement, which might not be legal. Red Hat currently says they can cancel any user's account if they download the source code and redistribute it.Let's say someone downloads the source through a Red Hat subscription, and uses that to build a new version of Rocky Linux. If Red Hat retailiated by cancelling that subscription, I'd definitely tune into that court case.I don't know if the community could front the money to take on IBM's powerful laywers\u2014maybe that's what Red Hat's banking on. But there's another player in this game who might, and that's Oracle. Wouldn't it be ironic if Oracle were the ones who knocked Red Hat down a peg for being so uppity with their abuse of their community!But let me be clear: everything I've seen points to Red Hat trying to choke out downstream distros like Rocky, Alma, and Oracle Linux. I think their hope is users of those distros would get scared and sign up for a Red Hat subscription. They need this to happen to lock in some short-term profits to please their IBM overlords. That's my cynical take on it.What Red Hat's doing is skirting right on the edge of legality the terms of Linux's GPL License. If you wanna dig into that, read this post from the Software Freedom Conservancy.Red Hat used to be the company of rebels. They used to have edgy ads quoting Gandhi and positioning Red Hat as the plucky underdog, using open source to upend the old proprietary software companies.It's funny they used to be so devoted to that Gandhi quote in particular. In one sense, Red Hat kinda won, they're the default choice for running Linux in big companies.The irony is that Cory Doctorow recently wrote this about a different company, but I think it applies here:HERE IS HOW platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.What a juxtoposition!They built up so much goodwill in the open source community through the years and used to be known as the 'open source company.'But they're throwing away that goodwill\u2014at least as far as Linux is concerned\u2014all in the name of profit.Developers like me, maintainers of the EPEL repository, Fedora maintainers who are rightfully worried about the long-term impacts...We're all being told to go sign up for a Red Hat Developer Account so we can snag our 16 licenses[^1] of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for testing.Oh boy!Thanks, I guess I'll drop doing something actually productive and spend a week retooling my test infrastructure and automation to work with Red Hat licensing.You know who doesn't require me to do that?Debian. Ubuntu. FreeBSD. Not even Rocky Linux!And please tell your employees to stop patronizing me, saying I should just use CentOS Stream. There's a reason Rocky and Alma linux have been downloaded millions of times. Stream is not a substitute for CentOS.So I've dropped support for Enterprise Linux on all my work, effective last Friday.And people are asking me about Ansible. That's the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (by IBM), by the way.I don't think Ansible's gonna try locking down access, but the fact I have to spend even a second considering that possibility is insane!Who wants to build around an ecosystem where the open source users are called freeloaders and where massive disruptions are implemented in the middle of a release cycle, two times in a row, with no warning?I don't see this helping Red Hat in any way in the long term.In the end, this is just sad:It's sad for users like me who used CentOS and developed tools on it that on-ramped folks into Red Hat's ecosystem.It's sad for Red Hat, which used to fight for open source, but now puts up barriers around their own source code.It's sad for everyone still in their ecosystem, because they're now forced to deal with Red Hat's licensing shenanigans and the loss of so many in the open source community.Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux both announced they'll find a way forward. I hope they can, if nothing else so people who stuck with Red Hat don't get burned again.But as for me? I'm done with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.I'll keep up support for Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux on a best-effort basis, but I have no confidence I'll be able to support Enterprise Linux moving forward.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...[^1] Red Hat seemed to be upping the limit to 240 sockets per developer, but now it seems that was just a bug.Further readingCracks are showing in Enterprise Open Source's foundationsDear Red Hat: Are you dumb?Removing official support for Red Hat Enterprise Linuxred hat linux open source video youtubeAdd new commentCommentsTiaan \u2013 17 hours agoSolution could be as simple as drawing up a new GPL that would exclude RedHat practices and campaign to have package maintainers adopt it.

Li-ion batteries were the key that allowed us to have truly portable devices that had decent battery life and light weight. It also broke us away from things like Discmans powered by disposable AA batteries. From Laptops, the smart phones and nowadays bikes, cars and trucks - the amount of change that it has brought is astounding. Anyone old enough to have used devices before Li-ion can remember the weird oddities you would have of inconsistent power and odd charging properties.However, from a hyper environmentalist position, this invention unfortunately ended up fueling all manners of wars through the specific material requirements, cobalt being the prime example, it also sort of helped kick off the idea of devices that could be almost disposable (non-replaceable batteries) but these are all secondary flow on impacts of Goodenough's core invention.More a lesson that even things intended to be good can have weird unintended consequences in a chaotic world. It was never his intent to do so it just worked out that way.The John was the living personification of the scientific inventor should be admired, we need more like him and here is hoping that the future will continue in that endeavour of progress.replyepistasis 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]Compared to all other basic materials we use in our life, lithium is pretty mundane. No war has been faught over cobalt. It's a byproduct of other mining, and quickly being phased out for cheaper less controversial materials.Lithium mining gets a bad rap not because it's particularly environmentally devastating, but because of political narratives that try to prevent technological change. Lithium is really a mundane material. You never hear people complaining about potash mining or other similar salt extraction, lithium is just targeted because of the industries that it upsets, which are in turn orders of magnitude more damaging.Which isn't to say that we shouldn't make it as environmentally friendly as possible. I'm just saying that if you fill up a tank of gas, you have a hell of a lot more to answer for when it comes to environmental karma than if you fill an equivalent lithium battery.replydefrost 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]For anyone that would like to go to primary sources for this:  Australia has one of the biggest lithium reserves and is the biggest producer of lithium by weight, with most of its production coming from mines in Western Australia.

[1]World\u2019s ten largest lithium mines in 2020 [2]Having established that much of the world's lithium is sourced from my state here in Western Australia, these are the local environmental concerns raised [3] (1997) wrt Greenbushes [4] and the local EPA recommendations wrt Greenbushes expansion (2019) [5].As a state we like clean air, clean beaches, native forrests, traditional ownership | stewardship, protecting the flora and fauna, and making sure mines are cleaned up afterwards.Currently Greenbushes mine is a bloody great hole in the ground, of which we have many, in the near future it will be a large lake surrounded by regrowth.Conditions in Argentina, Chile and China are left as an exercise for the reader .. there is also the matter of processing concentrates which is typically dirtier than mining to export concentrates.Processing can be very polluting, it can also be closely watched and contained with plant wide pads under layed with membranes that are regulalry monitored, inspected, fined for breach, etc.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_mining_in_Australia[2] https://www.mining-technology.com/marketdata/ten-largest-lit...[3] https://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Cargill.html[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbushes_mine[5] https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/media-statements/expansion-greenbu...replyDrBazza 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Just dropped a google pin on the site and the area is greener than I expected.

I\u2019ve been tangentially involved in the mine designs for the new underground mine coming off the pit, so it\u2019s decades away from rehab.A few options for old pits I\u2019ve worked on is backfilling with waste material and then capping with earth. Backfilling with treated Tailings and then capping. Or just letting it flood, but putting protections in. Generally they will be liable to manage if for a decade or so after mining is complete. Again all depends on the permit.Biggest thing you worry about though, especially if you go underground is how to seal it off from other water structures (if required.)Sorry for brain dump but lots of variables here!(I\u2019m a hard rock mining engineer)replydefrost 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]G'day :-)You might enjoy this tangential but otherwise Lithium related snippet of news.NASA opposes lithium mining at tabletop flat Nevada desert site used to calibrate satelliteshttps://apnews.com/article/nasa-lithium-mining-nevada-climat...replyDrBazza 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Interesting answer, thanks.replylm28469 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Meanwhile... https://www.eurometaux.eu/media/20ad5yza/2022-policymaker-su...replylight_hue_1 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This is too rosy of a picture when it comes to cobalt.

And it's still a good trade compared to oil that finances all manner of stuff, like the Ukraine war, and international islamist terrorism. There's also less money all in all, which means if we replaced all oil production with lithium batteries, there would be less money total going into industry that is easily hijacked for these types of purposes.Let's also remember that avocado production is being hijacked like this. It's in general dangerous to have an industry that can be easily controlled and managed as it can then be taken over by mafia/terrorism/autocrats.

But blaming Cobalt (and in turn Lithium Ion batteries) for all of the worsts excesses of Nickel mines is a bit extreme. Cobalt is the \"waste product\".

The conditions of which are often horrific. Correcting the original who said cobalt mining is benign.Cobalt can't be blamed, it's not alive.If we're assigning blame, we should be blaming the Western corporate governance where it's trivial to whitewash where resources were extracted and how they were processed. If we insisted that our governments passed laws keeping corporations, and their executives, directly accountable, and requiring that they maintain a full chain of custody, then conditions on the ground in Congo would improve dramatically.It's not nickel's fault, or the fault of diamonds, or that if electric cars or batteries.

Because so many ideas are obvious and straightforward to implement that only gatekeeping could work at a scale large enough to prevent them from manifesting.I have not investigated the history of li-ion batteries at all, other than notable dates around the year 2000 that I quote for rants like this. But I would wager that the reason Goodenough's batteries took off is that he went through profitable channels so the military industrial complex and corporate competitors couldn't suppress them.Actually I'm completely wrong:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_lithium-ion_bat...1979. So li-ion batteries were suppressed until Obama's reelection around 2012, when the writing was on the wall and car manufacturers were forced to release electric vehicles that weren't terrible. So a 33 year gap where batteries, photovoltaics, etc etc etc could have kept CO2 out of the atmosphere:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_at...So today's 420 ppm minus 340 ppm around 1979 equals 80 ppm, where each ppm is 2.13 gigaton, so about 170 gigatons of CO2 leaked into the atmosphere to preserve the profits of the fossil fuel industry and other moneyed interests of the status quo.Let this be a cautionary tale, but also inspiration for fellow inventors.

However, this is less common compared to the occupational origin.Like many surnames, the spelling and pronunciation of \"Goodenough\" may have varied over time and across different regions. Variations of the name can be found, such as Goodenow or Goodenowes.It's worth noting that surnames have complex and diverse origins, and multiple factors can contribute to the development of a particular surname.

GettySHARECHRIS ROSALESView Chris Rosales'S ArticleschrishasacamerachrishasacameraAfter a 72-year reign, Oregon\u2019s self-service gas prohibition has been decisively repealed in the state Senate. Though there have been intermediate years and exceptions, notably in rural counties in 2017, and during wildfires or heatwaves since 2020. House Bill 2426 as proposed would require gas stations to staff half of the available pumps, but allows the other half to be self-service.According to a report from The Oregonian, fuel companies have long pushed for the change due to staffing shortages. The Northwest Grocery Association, an advocate for retail and food suppliers, claims that jobs won\u2019t be lost because half of gas pumps are already closed due to understaffing. The provision in the bill to staff half of pumps reflects this statistic, effectively reopening gas stations that are understaffed.Full-service gas stations are a relic of the past, from a time when adding fuel by yourself was dangerous and prohibited by state fire codes, but also inconvenient. One of the first self-service gas stations opened in 1947 in Los Angeles and started a change that caught strongly in the \u201870s. From then, self-service became the new normal, and when pay-at-the-pump proliferated in the \u201880s with the rise of credit cards. From then, there have been staunch holdouts of full-service gas stations, the most famous of which is New Jersey. Oregon was the other.Oregon\u2019s bill crucially prevents stations from charging more for a full-service pump than a self-service, which will effectively eliminate full-service pumps. The economic advantage of self-serve, saving money for the owners of the stations, will shift legislative future pressure surrounding full-service stations. Not to mention, Oregon drivers that would prefer to save time by simply pulling up to an empty pump rather than waiting in line for a forced full-service pump.The bill goes to Oregon Governor Tina Kotek to be signed into immediate effect.Got a tip?

Armed with data that showed surprisingly high levels of lead in pregnant women in rural Bangladesh, her mission was to figure out where it was coming from and how to get rid of it.At the start, there weren\u2019t any obvious answers. There were no lead-belching factories in the area. Leaded gasoline had been banned for years. And it couldn\u2019t be lead-based paint because few residents could afford to paint their homes. Her adviser thought the source could be lead-arsenate pesticides, but after spending days wading in muddy rice paddies, she ruled that out. She had hit a scientific dead end.Undaunted, she returned to Stanford University and joined an interdisciplinary team of researchers to look at the problem anew. Ultimately, using old-fashioned detective work and high-tech chemical analysis, the team identified the source and joined government officials in getting the lead out. Now, they hope to use the same approach to reduce lead exposure throughout the world.A heavy metalForsyth\u2019s main PhD adviser was Stephen Luby, MD, an epidemiologist who had been tackling the global lead problem since the early 1990s. His work began in Pakistan, where his research contributed to banning leaded gasoline in that country. But after he read a study (Bergkvist et al., 2010, in Environmental Research) about unexpectedly high levels of lead in pregnant women in rural Bangladesh, he knew his work wasn\u2019t done.\u201cThere is no safe level for lead exposure,\u201d said Luby, a Stanford School of Medicine professor of medicine and the director of research for the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health. Early in his career, Luby spent eight years focused on improving public health in Bangladesh, so this was personal.Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can seriously damage reproductive, neurological and cardiovascular systems. Exposure to it is a global problem, with an estimated 1 in 3 children with blood lead levels at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter, the level considered unacceptable by the World Health Organization. (In October 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered this level to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter.)\u201cThere is no safe level for lead exposure.\u201dStephen Luby, MD, director of research for the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global HealthBetween 24 million and 46 million children and teenagers in Bangladesh are estimated to have lead levels above this threshold, the fourth highest number in this age group behind India, Nigeria and Pakistan. Lead poisoning has lifelong, irreversible effects on the cognitive abilities of children, and the social and economic impacts to a country can be devastating.Children with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter may score 3 to 5 points lower on intelligence tests than unaffected peers, limiting their potential. In addition, preschool lead exposure is often associated with juvenile delinquency, violence and crime. In Bangladesh alone, the lower IQ levels caused by lead poisoning are estimated to cost $16 billion annually in lost lifetime productivity, 6% of gross domestic product.After Forsyth returned from Bangladesh, she reviewed her disappointing findings with Luby. But she had a hunch. She\u2019d recently read a lead study from that region (Gleason et al., 2014 in Journal of Environmental and Public Health) hypothesizing turmeric as a potential source of lead. Could it be the powdery, orange-yellow spice that permeates daily life in Bangladesh? Turmeric is used in curries, as a clothing dye, in cosmetics, in medicines and as an insect repellent. Luby was skeptical, but he let her run with it. \u201cShow me the evidence,\u201d he said.So, she analyzed 17 turmeric samples from her Bangladesh trip, and one had exceedingly high levels of lead and chromium. It was a start, and like any good medical detective, she began gathering more clues.The golden spiceForsyth is an environmental scientist with wanderlust. She\u2019s spent nearly 15 years studying health problems in Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania, Costa Rica and Australia, looking for ways to reduce contaminants in air, water, soil and food.When she was growing up in Logan, Utah, she loved mysteries. Early on, she decided to become a detective, and for her eighth-grade science fair project she went undercover to swab bathroom doorknobs at local restaurants, culturing bacterial samples to evaluate sanitation levels.This love of evidence-driven puzzles set her on a course to carry on her detective work and, after studying biology as an undergraduate, then earning a master\u2019s in environmental engineering and global health at the University of Washington, she contacted Luby. He recruited her as a PhD candidate, and she joined his initiative to reduce lead exposure in pregnant women, along with icddr,b, a global nonprofit in Bangladesh formerly known as International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh.Back in Bangladesh, Forsyth and the team began a deep dive into the workings of the turmeric supply chain. They interviewed the stakeholders in the production, consumption and regulation of turmeric. They went to mills, wholesalers and spice markets, all the while collecting samples of turmeric, colorants, dust and soil in little baggies for analysis.To mask flawed turmeric, some processors began dusting the roots with lead chromate \u2014 an orange-yellow industrial pigment used to color plastics and furniture.Turmeric, a member of the ginger family, is made from the rootstalks, aka rhizomes, of Curcuma longa. At the end of the growing season, farmers let the knee-high, leafy green tops dry out, then use hoes to dig up the rhizomes. Next workers, typically women, painstakingly remove dirt clods and break off the feeder roots. Then the naked rhizomes are washed, steamed and laid out to dry for a few weeks.After drying, the rhizomes are polished to remove dirt and the skins, revealing the yellow inner root. This is done manually or, in larger operations, by placing the rhizomes in rotating drums made of an abrasive wire mesh. Next, the rhizomes are cut, crushed and ground into a powder.Color matters to turmeric purchasers, and turmeric that is more vibrantly yellow typically sells for higher prices. The Stanford University team learned that this color-linked perception of quality may have started in the 1980s, when a flood interrupted the drying process, turning rhizomes brown and moldy.To mask flawed turmeric, some processors began dusting the roots with lead chromate \u2014 an orange-yellow industrial pigment used to color plastics and furniture. From the interviews, Forsyth learned that this coloration step continued for four decades after the flood and that most processors weren\u2019t aware that the pigments were toxic. But, with Forsyth\u2019s help, this would soon change.Bring on the ray gunsAs a child, Scott Fendorf, PhD, the Terry Huffington Professor and senior associate dean for integrative initiatives in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, liked playing in the dirt. Fortunately for science, his parents encouraged this obsession, and today, he is a leading expert in soil chemistry.Fendorf was one of Forsyth\u2019s PhD thesis advisers and was the first expert she consulted when she returned from Bangladesh with baggies full of spice, dust and dirt.Sitting in his cozy office, overgrown with houseplants thriving on enriched soil, Forsyth presented Fendorf with her challenges: How could she figure out where the lead poisoning was coming from? Was it in food, pesticides, lead-soldered cans, silt from local water supplies, or impurities in the clay/ash pellets that many pregnant women chewed to alleviate mineral cravings? And what technology could be applied to verify that lead from a given source was poisoning the Bangladeshis?Fendorf explained that a metal like lead can be composed of unique mixes of elemental isotopes that vary according to the source. These location-specific ratios can sometimes be used to pinpoint a lead source in the same way detectives use fingerprints to identify criminals. Analyze the lead isotope ratio in a blood sample to see if it matches one of the lead sources; if it does, bingo, you\u2019ve found the culprit.But he warned that this approach doesn\u2019t always work, so they enlisted Katharine Maher, PhD, professor of Earth System Science, and Karrie Weaver, technical director at the SIGMA Shared Lab at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, to evaluate how useful the analysis could be for this application.Turmeric is an orange-yellow spice used in curries, as a clothing dye, in cosmetics, in medicines and as an insect repellent. Close to 50% of Bangladesh\u2019s population is employed in agriculture, and turmeric is an important cash crop and export. (Photography by Timothy Archibald)The SIGMA, or Stanford Isotopic and Geochemical Measurement and Analysis, lab is home to several state-of-the-art devices \u2014 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers \u2014 that can analyze the precise elemental components of just about any material, from water, soil and tissues, to dinosaur bones. How do these mass spectrometers work? A sample is placed into a chamber where hot argon plasma breaks down a substance into its elemental components. Then the components are stripped of impurities, separated and analyzed by molecular weight and identified by custom software.As a first step, Forsyth and Weaver characterized the unique isotope ratios for each Bangladeshi lead source \u2014 and they lucked out. The lead-isotope fingerprints varied enough to identify specific sources. After the techs analyzed the blood samples collected during their first trip to Bangladesh, there was a clear signal \u2014 the blood-borne lead was coming from the turmeric and the industrial pigments used to color it.Next, the team had to figure out how to quickly identify tainted product in real time in the field; sending samples to a lab for analysis was too expensive and time-consuming to be practical.For this, Alandra Lopez, Fendorf\u2019s PhD student at the time, showed Forsyth a bright yellow plastic device that looked like a toy ray gun. It was a handheld X-ray fluorescent analyzer. Their lab used it for identifying toxins in the soil, and Lopez was tasked with developing a test methodology and training protocol for its use in turmeric testing.Then Forsyth bought one for the team for roughly $40,000, and they went back to Bangladesh, armed and ready.The stingGathering scientific evidence in a foreign country to fix a public health problem is one thing. Getting the country to act on it is another. This is where Luby\u2019s deep understanding and love of the Bangladeshi culture came in handy.\u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly hospitable culture, committed to education, with people who really want to make the country better,\u201d said Luby.Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, surrounded by India to the west, north and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. Its soil is fertile, enriched by frequent flooding of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems. Close to 50% of Bangladesh\u2019s population is employed in agriculture, and turmeric is an important cash crop and export.The government was highly motivated to do something about the lead problem, and Luby made sure that its Department of Agricultural Authority officials were partners in designing and implementing the lead study from the beginning.\u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly hospitable culture, committed to education, with people who really want to make the country better.\u201dLuby, a Stanford School of Medicine professor of medicineIn July 2017, three years into her PhD research, Forsyth and the team shared their stunning findings: Turmeric mixed with lead-chromate pigments contained lead levels up to 500 times the Bangladesh legal limit of 2.5 micrograms per gram, making it the most likely cause of the lead poisonings.Their presentation was attended by 21 governmental and non-governmental organizations, including Bangladesh\u2019s Food Safety Authority. Participants were alarmed, and word quickly spread to the highest levels of the government.From September through December 2019, the Stanford University/icddr,b team and public health officials launched a get-the-lead-out plan, beginning with an effort to inform manufacturers and consumers about the adverse health effects of lead-based pigments. News releases were published, face-to-face meetings were held with key businesspeople, and 50,000 educational posters went up in the markets and public spaces.The government declared that turmeric adulteration was a prosecutable violation, and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina discussed the problem on national TV. Then, the Stanford University researchers collected blood samples from workers at one of the larger processors to illustrate how the lead was not only poisoning consumers but also their employees.Finally, the officials revealed the most important part of the plan to the Stanford University team \u2014 a sting operation.Dusted and bustedFood Safety authority representatives, flanked by soldiers in camouflage uniforms, magenta berets and guns slung over their shoulders, strode down the center of a busy street market in Dhaka, the capital city. The crowds parted.Men riding three-wheeled rickshaws pulled over. Street vendors stopped stirring their aromatic curries. The spice sellers wearing parti-colored lungi skirts fell silent. Some curious merchants, sitting atop stacks of potatoes, ginger, onions and garlic, jumped down to follow the entourage.The spice SWAT team visited six turmeric sellers\u2019 stalls. At each, a Stanford University-trained technician pressed the nose of the X-ray fluorescent analyzer into dusty yellow bags of turmeric roots. After a minute or so, the tech could tell whether the root stalks were lead dusted. If they were, law enforcement officials moved in to confiscate and destroy the bags of tainted product.\u201cIt was law enforcement theater.\u201dJenna Forsyth, PhD, a research scientist with the Stanford School of MedicineBecause the government is understaffed in food safety enforcement and has a slow judicial process, officials opted for a shock-and-awe approach to punishment. Mobile court officials followed the SWAT team and, as soon as a violation was confirmed, they issued on-the-spot fines in the equivalent of $9,288 in U.S. currency, about three years of an average Bangladeshi\u2019s salary.To amplify the message, the whole sting operation was filmed by a Jamuna Television news crew and broadcast across the nation.\u201cIt was law enforcement theater,\u201d Forsyth said. But she admitted it was a highly effective way of informing dirty turmeric producers and sellers, \u201cYou\u2019re being watched.\u201dAfter the intervention, the team went back to the study sites to measure changes in lead levels in the turmeric supply chain, and they were amazed at the effectiveness of the campaign. At the markets, incidence of adulterated spice plunged from 47% in September 2019, to 5% in the first quarter of 2020, to no detectable lead in 2021. Evidence of lead-chromate pigment in the processing mills dropped from 30% in 2017 to 0% in 2021. And 16 months after the intervention, lead levels in the blood of sample test subjects dropped by a median of 30%.Getting the lead outBack at his office overlooking Stanford University\u2019s engineering quad, Luby multitasks in front of five computer displays. It gives visitors the impression that his ambitions for tackling our most challenging public health issues are much bigger than can be managed on one or two screens.Luby grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, raised by an OB/GYN father and a nurse mother. As an undergrad, he immersed himself in philosophy, history and political science at Creighton University, a Jesuit school that emphasizes social justice. He went on to get a medical degree, then studied epidemiology and preventive medicine, eventually serving as the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agency in Bangladesh.During college, Luby never thought he\u2019d become a scientist, but his unique mix of compassion, determination and scientific rigor is making a significant dent in the global lead problem.\u201cAmericans generally think we\u2019ve solved the lead problem, but this is fundamentally not true,\u201d said Luby. \u201cThere are 800 million children in the world with lead blood levels greater than recommended standards, and many will go on to suffer permanent brain damage. One million adults die every year because of exposure to lead.\u201d\u201cIn Dhaka, we found this important cohort of young children, 2- to 4-year-olds, who have wildly high levels of lead poisoning.\u201dForsyth, whose research is now focused on finding other sources of lead contamination in BangladeshHe emphasized that lead-dusted turmeric isn\u2019t just a Southeast Asian problem. Worldwide, turmeric is more popular than ever as an ingredient in teas, curries, anti-inflammatory supplements and coloring for processed foods like macaroni and cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. And while the major spice companies that sell it in the U.S. have good quality control procedures, a lot of turmeric is brought in by less conscientious importers, he said.Luby is now looking at using the playbook that worked in Bangladesh \u2014 evidence gathering, education, media coverage and law enforcement \u2014 to see if it can be applied to other countries.Meanwhile, Forsyth and the lead team are still hunting down other lead sources in Bangladesh.\u201cIn Dhaka, we found this important cohort of young children, 2- to 4-year-olds, who have wildly high levels of lead poisoning,\u201d she said.And like any good detective, she\u2019s keeping an open mind about possible culprits.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re exploring lead sources in battery recycling dumps, metal factories, and in pots and pans.\u201dLooking back on the project to date, Forsyth reflected on the most important lesson she\u2019s learned: \u201cLead is pervasive in our environment, and the toxic effects are profound. This is why we need to keep working this puzzle.\u201dSHAREKris NewbyKris Newby is a freelance science writer.

As someone who grew up in India, our school textbooks in the 90s had a list of common food adulterants, and turmeric adulteration with lead chromate was common knowledge to middle schoolers. I recall the curriculum included how to detect adulteration with simple at home tests. After turmeric, the next suspect probably would be yellow lentils.EDIT: actually the next suspect should be red chillis, adulterated with lead oxide.On an aside, food adulteration used to be such a common social menace in India in the 70s & 80s, such that it was a common theme in the backdrop of Bollywood films, with the hero taking on local mafia bosses who also dabble in food adulteration. India did a mediocre job controlling the rampant food adulteration, with the last major case I recall being an outbreak of Epidemic Dropsy in 1998 due to contamination of mustard oil. There's been cases every once in a while, though I suspect in those cases it is inadvertent contamination with Argemone plants growing in mustard fields.replyhammock 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]How can I test for lead in my tumeric?Edit: found this page which is amazing https://eatrightindia.gov.in/dart/replyTheJoeMan 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This page is fascinating!

In the absence of FDA guidelines on lead levels in spices, this study has used the lead levels in candy as the threshold (0.1 ppm) The study also highlights a previous case study in Boston where 4 pediatric cases had lead exposure - of the 4, only one had detectable lead in the family's turmeric - at a level of 1.4 ppm. This was a 12-month-old baby, so wasn't consuming the turmeric, and the case study doesn't suggest he was.The Indian food safety standards restrict lead in spices to below 2.5 ppm, with turmeric especially tested for lead chromate (FSSAI standards allow lead upto 10 ppm (!!!) in turmeric, while AGMARK allows only upto 2.5 ppm). Turmeric being exported from India to the USA has several additional mandatory certifications required, for other dyes like Sudan I - IV, aflatoxins, pesticides, etc. Since the FDA has no limits published on lead, the Indian limits of 2.5 ppm probably apply. Is that an acceptable level? Probably not great, and there is no safe level of lead. However, lead will show up in any agricultural product, so we need a reasonable 'acceptable' range. For me and most other Indians who consume turmeric on a daily basis, we defer to the Indian certifications.replymore_corn 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Just convince her that it\u2019s more magical (er, healthy) if she buys it fresh and grinds it herself.It actually tastes better that way, richer and more earthy.It does leave your fingers stained, but that is actually a benefit since it is a conversation starter.replydenton-scratch 10 minutes ago | prev | next [\u2013]There's too much padding in the article.TL;DR Lead is bad for you; shoppers don't like turmeric that isn't yellow; processors dust off-colour turmeric with lead chromate to make it look yellow.replybakul 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]They could have just asked....

    "content": "CSOJP Morgan accidentally deletes evidence in multi-million record retention screwup45Fined $4m for Who-Me-esque mess, for which it blames unnamed archiving vendor's retention settingsDan RobinsonMon 26 Jun 2023 // 09:30 UTCJP Morgan has been fined $4 million by America's securities watchdog, the SEC, for deleting millions of email records dating from 2018 relating to its Chase Bank subsidiary.The financial services giant apparently deleted somewhere in the region of 47 million electronic communications records from about 8,700 electronic mailboxes covering the period January 1 through to April 23, 2018.Many of these, it turns out, were business records that were required to be retained under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC said in a filing [PDF] detailing its findings.Worse still, the screwup meant that it couldn't produce evidence that that the SEC and others subpoenaed in their investigations. \"In at least 12 civil securities-related regulatory investigations, eight of which were conducted by the Commission staff, JPMorgan received subpoenas and document requests for communications which could not be retrieved or produced because they had been deleted permanently,\" the SEC says.What went wrong?The trouble for JP Morgan can be traced to a project where the company aimed to delete from its systems any older communications and documents that were no longer required to be retained.According to the SEC\u2019s summary, the project experienced \u201cglitches,\u201d with those documents identified for deletion failing to be deleted under the processes implemented by JPMorgan.Troubleshooting? Try trouble overshootingWhen troubleshooting the issue, workers carried out deletion tasks on electronic communications from the first quarter of 2018. This was apparently done under the belief that all the documents were stored in such a way that it would not be possible to permanently delete any records within the 36 month regulatory retention period specified by the Exchange Act.For its part, JP Morgan places the blame squarely on an unnamed archiving vendor that it hired to handle the storage for its communications.The vendor had apparently assured both JP Morgan and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on multiple occasions that its media storage complied with the relevant Exchange Act rules regarding the 36 month retention period, and therefore documents falling within that period were protected from deletion.In addition, JP Morgan says that extra coding was applied to mailboxes which were subject to \u201clegal holds\u201d in order to prevent the deletion of documents required to be maintained for other purposes, such as litigation.However, the reality turned out to be otherwise. In June 2019, a team from the Corporate Compliance Technology department was working on the project to delete any electronic communications, which included emails and instant messages that were no longer required to be retained.When the procedures developed by JP Morgan and the vendor failed to delete the appropriate documents, the team tried to troubleshoot the process, running deletion tasks across multiple time periods including emails from January 1 through to April 23, 2018.This was apparently done under the belief that safeguards were in place that would block the deletion of any records that were required to be retained.But it seems the vendor had failed to properly apply the retention setting to the \u201cChase\u201d domain within JP Morgan, leading to all emails within in it being permanently deleted, save those that were protected by the extra coding on \u201clegal holds.\u201dAccording to JP Morgan, it only became aware of this in October of 2019 when the company\u2019s legal discovery team found that electronic communications were missing from the early 2018 time period. It reported the incident to the SEC in January 2020.JP Morgan must face suit from Ray-Ban maker after crooks drained $272m from accountsBanks face their 'darkest hour' as malware steps up, maker of antivirus saysEver suspected bankers used WhatsApp comms at work? $1.8b says you're right'Sharp' chip inventory correction looms on horizon, warns investment bankerIn response to the incident, JP Morgan said it had implemented its own 36 month retention coding, and overhauled its operating procedures. These prevent deletion tasks from being run on electronic communications still subject to retention requirements, and also require that any employee seeking to run a deletion task must obtain approval from a senior level information officer.The SEC found that JP Morgan had \u201cwilfully violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder\u201d which require broker-dealers to preserve for at least three years all communications received and copies of all communications sent relating to its business.The company was ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations, and to pay a penalty of $4 million to the SEC.In a statement, the company told us that: \u201cJP Morgan takes its record keeping obligations seriously.

    "content": "NPR > NationalU.S. pedestrian deaths reach a 40-year highBy Juliana KimMonday, June 26, 2023 \u2022 5:00 AM EDTA new study paints a grim picture of American roads: every day, 20 people walk outside and end up killed by a moving vehicle.\"There are more pedestrians being killed today than in decades,\" Russ Martin, the senior director of policy and government relations at the Governors Highway Safety Association, told NPR.The organization, which tracks pedestrian deaths in the U.S., estimates that more than 7,500 pedestrians were killed by drivers last year \u2014 the highest number since 1981. The final tally may be even greater given that Oklahoma was unable to provide data due to a technical issue.Pedestrian deaths have been climbing since 2010 because of unsafe infrastructure and the prevalence of SUVs, which tend to be more deadly for pedestrians than smaller cars, according to Martin. When the pandemic arrived, there was an even greater surge as empty roads gave way to speeding and distracted driving.The pandemic has waned, but cases of reckless driving \u2014 and subsequently the number of Americans killed while walking \u2014 has not. The new data, released on Friday, shows the U.S. continues to lag in its effort to improve road safety, even as experts say some solutions are within reach.States below the Sun Belt ranked as having the highest rate of pedestrian deaths in 2022For the seventh year in a row, New Mexico was ranked as the most dangerous state for pedestrians.Arizona and Florida were also placed in the top spots for having high rates of pedestrian deaths in GHSA's estimates.Related Story: A New Jersey city achieved 0 traffic deaths in 4 years with quick, high impact ideasIt is not a coincidence that all three states are situated below the country's Sun Belt. Martin said Southern states tend to see more traffic deaths but it is not exactly clear why.There are multiple theories: in bigger states, communities are more spread out and as a result, people need to drive more to get around, he said. Another possibility is that Southern states have better weather and people spend more time outside.\"This is all just conjecture, but I think it's certainly worthwhile to take a closer look into what's going on in those states,\" he added.Local lawmakers can implement traffic calming measures todayTraffic safety has been an uphill battle in the U.S. for years but there are strategies at lawmakers' disposal to address the crisis today, according to Peter Norton, a professor at the University of Virginia who has studied the history of driving in America.\"The best things we can do will take years, but there are some things we can do now, they don't cost much money and they make a big difference,\" he said.Related Story: America's roads are more dangerous, as police pull over fewer driversFor instance, implementing sharp corners instead of round curves at the end of roads forces drivers to slow down to turn and therefore prevents speeding. That technique, along with adding pedestrian islands and large sidewalk bulb-outs, is known as \"traffic calming.\"Norton said installing speeding and red light cameras can also be effective if they work properly. Adding bike lanes can also keep drivers more alert on the road.Lowering speed limits is also an important step but only if it is enforced and used alongside other safety measures. Norton warned that roads with a mix of different vehicle speeds tend to be more dangerous.There are also some local and regional measures the GHSA pointed to that could help prevent deaths.In Hawaii, police officers are stationed in areas that have seen a higher volume of crashes or foot traffic to look out for reckless driving.And in Idaho, the state's highway safety office gave out walk audits for community members to identify safety concerns on the street. Local officials then use the results to improve the walkability of neighborhoods.",
