Zurich, Bern may soon follow (bloomberg.com)488 points by toomuchtodo 14 hours agohidepastfavorite487 comments neonate 42 minutes agohttps://archive.ph/zvgZO miklosz 12 hours agoprevThe city of Cracow in Poland banned billboards (and other visual advertising quite aggressively) about 2 years ago. Great outcomes. There are still some workarounds that companies do to put this s..t out in the public (e.g. covers of renovation works can contain up to 50% of advertising area, so we have renovations of just finished buildings only to put the covers with ads). Now, when I visit another city when there's no such ban I cannot stand this visual garbage. This should be banned everywhere. reply cromulent 12 hours agoparentOn my visits to Warsaw, I have always been struck by the translucent advertising entirely covering the sides of new-ish office buildings.

In Poland basically everything is covered in huge adveretisements, \"Kantor\" here and there, car repair shops, etc. On bus stops all the walls are covered in them and there is even something on top of it, facing the road.

If there's a building standing in Cracow, it can't have any logos on it. Unless the company is rich, then it may have their logos. Good thing that Cracow in general doesn't have any tall buildings (well, just one). For me it's socialism at its finest. Forbid the poor, allow the rich.

I was surprised how many car owners supported bans on parking on the streets and making bicycle lines instead. It decreased traffic jams. Basically, people started to park in big parking garages with good connections to main roads. Surely it required more time to walk. But then one spends much less time finding a place to park. And traffic from/to small roads were a significant contribution to jams. reply fakedang 9 hours agorootparentIt's funny seeing the behavioral differences in communally oriented societies vs idiosyncratic societies.

There are huge multilane roads cutting through the city in all directions. There is zero enforcement on speed and pollution limits. It's very dangerous to move around if you're not inside a car.

It's not economically viable in every City to have public transport running empty all night just for a few people who like to party yet live far away from the party scene. reply systemtest 9 hours agorootparentIt's not really economically viable to take a taxi to your night-shift warehouse job. That is around 70% of your daily wage going towards transportation. reply Rinzler89 8 hours agorootparentHow many people are doing nightshifts as part of the total employed population who mostly do day shifts? Unfortunately the same economies of scale apply to them as well. You can't have city wide public transport run 24/7 because a very small amount of the workforce works during the night. And night shifts tend to be set in order to overlap with public transport schedules (10pm-6am) so that's not such a big problem. reply systemtest 8 hours agorootparentI took a bus at 03:00 in the night from Santa Monica Beach to Hollywood. During a week day. If it is possible in the US of all places, it should be possible in The Netherlands. reply Rinzler89 8 hours agorootparentTechnically everything is possible, you can even fly people to commute to the space station, the questions is why some places consider night routes to be economically viable and some not, but that doesn't change the fact that public transportation night routes are a loss maker for the company. I guess it depends on how much the local government is willing to subsidize public transport, since otherwise daily price tickets will have to go up for all travelers to subsidize the few night travelers. Here in Austria we also don't have night routes during the week in cities that are not Vienna even if some people still need to travel during the night, but the transport companies can't run at a loss, so it's either the state pays for it(via higher taxes for everyone) or the day travelers will pay more for it, there's no free lunch here, someone still needs to pay for the unprofitable night service which is a loss maker. How Santa Monia does it I don't know but it doesn't change the fact the night services are loss makers everywhere and public transportation in general is only profitable at massive scale often relying on public subsidies to stay afloat even in the US. Also public transportation costs are not apples to apples comparable between countries. Maybe it works in the Santa Monica, since fuel is dirt cheap or maybe they subsidize a lot and maybe they can pay bus drivers peanuts or something I don't know, but here in Austria running public transport is very expensive (unions, pensions, strict work hours, great workers benefits, infrastructure, maintenance, running costs, etc), especially in cities other than Vienna, so the routes are pretty shit and night routes non existent in order to not loose money, so most people rely on private cars or taxis for commutes out of hours. Improving that would come at increased costs and ticket prices are already maxed out and so are taxes. reply lifestyleguru 10 hours agorootparentprevPolish society mentally is at the stage where car is the status symbol and part of their identity. Amplified by the fact that they're historically unable to construct their own car. Nobody is giving up their Mercedes/Volvo/BMW/Audi in a lease 1k EUR per month to walk around or drive bicycle around the city. Especially that employment regulations promote taking a lease for a car and having company's car is the ultimate benefit. Plus the obnoxious trend of huge SUVs and American-style pickups. People move out to the outskirts, buy more cars and bigger cars and then... they commute daily to the city. reply ptsneves 8 hours agorootparentAs a non pole living in Poland I think you are being unfair. The car mentality is not new, nor is it evil by itself. On the contrary it is supported by the reality that inner-cities are unbearably expensive and people need to live in the suburbs just like in the US. It is no irony that the same phenomenae has similar consequences. It is not people who are bad or stupid, on the contrary. In Wroclaw they added hundreds of KM of bike lanes....crisscrossing normal roads. I would like to take my children by bike to their kindergarten but I dont want me or them to die. So indeed i take my car, which i regret not being a damn fat SUV because i cannot damn stand being shaken out of my bones anymore. The roads are the German coblestone type and they are not crap because of the potholes. That is already a taken, no. The whole roads have severe long period troughs and hills that together with the pot holes make the experience a nightmare. Sprinkle that with tramlines, activated or not and I am currently considering moving out. The trams and buses work well but politicians and well meaning people often forget you need the car for things like the supermarket? I have a family of several so i cannot just take the tram or by bike for groceries. Oh my, i need a car. The sin, we are all \"patola\"[1] :). And this is not just in the city proper, the surroundings' roads are awful as well. I just damaged my rim and tire driving on a normal road 40Km/h while doing this gas guzzling hobby of taking my children to a local forest. I am a bit upset writing this because all these people in power in Europe dont have traditional families and exist in their own heaven on earth where they are independent in a very pure state. When i was 20 or if I would be a single I would get it, but with a family, please take your silly ideals elsewhere(this is for the mayor Jacek Sutryk who is unironically a bachelor). Portugal is a bit better in that the left leaning well-doers preach but people are too real to let things get ridiculous. The talking heads sometimes fantasize about bikes everywhere but then the cities are hilly and old so it is unfeasible to add bike lanes. [1] Patola is a derrogative name from pathological [family]. It is used to insinuate you come from a dysfunctional, often alcoholic family. Very common insult in Poland which I am fascinated about.

In this specific case the abuse is even pretty openly stated :( > The Supreme Court’s ruling cements a decision to remove more than three-fourths of its once-standing 172 billboards from the town, keeping the remainder available for culture and sports ads. By \"culture and sports ads\" they surely mean adverts by the government for its own subsidized services. Local government is a huge spender on billboard advertising around here, often for its own state run sports or events (invariably stuff that's popular with lefty civil service types like obscure dance performances). Lately they also love to paint trains and trams in garish colors, in an open advert for diversity ideology: https://www.bahnonline.ch/27379/mit-dem-zvv-gemeinsam-vorwae... Die Farben und Formen des neuen visuellen Auftritts widerspiegeln die Buntheit und Diversität des gesamten ZVV-Netzes. ... and they don't seem to have a problem either with all the posters that get glued everywhere advertising May Day, Feminists for Anarchism and so on. The idea cantonal governments have a problem with \"visual pollution\" is kind of absurd, really. If that's actually the motivation then step one would be to stop buying billboard space with taxpayer money, stop flooding the city with rainbows, clean up all the pro-Gaza graffiti and go entirely without any of that for a few years.

The people that live in the city center probably already use public transit because, for them, public transit is probably a faster commute. That means that the cars congesting the center are driven by people that live in the periphery or even suburbs outside of the city. So these people will want those nasty cars out, because they actually live there, and they will vote them out. You can never accommodate the people from the suburbs, unless they have a station right next to their door and their office and a train coming every 5 minutes, a car will always be faster. They live in someone else's municipality, so the mayors can just ignore them. People in the periphery are more delicate, but usually they are also tired of congestions, and it's much easier to make at least minor improvements to public transit for them. But again, you can restrict and make improvements in parallel, and the improvement will almost never be perceived as matching the restrictions anyway. reply systemtest 9 hours agorootparent> No, you can also start by imposing restrictions on cars.

Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, The Hague. You need to earn in the top 5% if you want to buy a place there. The people commuting into the city by car provide the services for the people living there. Police officers, healthcare workers, sanitation workers, teachers.

The top 5% earners are not the ultra rich. To even afford a 50 square meter apartment somewhat near the center of Amsterdam you need to be at least an engineer, lawyer or doctor earning six figures. Those people do not live in suburbs, that is where the people earning modal income live. Is this some sort of American way of thinking you are projecting onto my country? And where should those essential workers relocate to? They already live as close to the city as their lending/renting capabilities allow them. And no they can't all use public transit otherwise they likely would be using it already. And yes we can increase density. Amsterdam only has 3700 people/km2. The metropole only has 900 people/km2. reply the_gipsy 4 hours agorootparentI'm a European enjoyer of car restrictions. You have a distorted view of what \"modal income\" is. If you can afford to live in the suburbs and drive one car (per worker) into the city, then you are rich. The poor live in the periphery and walk, use PT, or carpool. Then, the ultra-rich can afford to live in penthouses in the financial district and will always weasel a way in to be able to drive (or get driven) in a SUV, they are irrelevant to the discussion. You are relatively rich and want to have your way with your car and driving, and are using the poor as a bad excuse. What do you think will happen, that the system will collapse? Trains and buses spilling with people, no essential workers, police and healthcare unavailable, chaos, anarchy? No! Everything goes on normally in cities that have restricted car traffic. Because restrictions are gradual. If a job offer in the city center becomes less competitive (considering time and money), then it will attract different workers from better locations. And same for housing. > And yes we can increase density. Amsterdam only has 3700 people/km2. The metropole only has 900 people/km2.

You need to eat and pay rent (at least in the US where there's not much in the way of welfare). The rich and poor alike drive, but the rich can live close to work and the poor often can't. The very poor take the bus if it's available and just eat the extra time commuting, which in my city is usually 3x the time driving.

Randstad is one big metropolis without a coherent public transportation planning. I moved here from Istanbul 12 years ago. the progress there was positive in this timeframe while in Randstad it was backwards to be honest. public transportation became more expensive and unreliable. busses are often empty and they seem to compensate this by increasing prices and cutting down the frequency, so it becomes less reliable for people to use it.. my commute to work is 15 km. it's 20 min by car without traffic but post-Covid traffic is so bad that it's 50 mins in average (1 hour+ on Tuesdays). bus is 30 mins with 1 connection but often I miss the connection and wait 15 mins, so it's 45 realistically. both are bad options, so I cycle instead in half an hour with my e-bike. if it's bad weather I take the car because busses are not on time so I can't plan being at the office for a meeting or so. plus, bus is much more expensive than my not so fuel efficient old car. go figure. reply systemtest 10 hours agorootparentYes prices are problematic.

If oil companies and automobile manufacturers were forced to pay the cost of climate degradation they'd starve.

Those streets and sidewalks were created through public action, the public decided or elected people who decided that that was a good allocation of resources. Just like we decide that parking in some places is a good allocation of resources. Changing our minds on which thing to allocate resources to isn't an affront to our freedoms, when done in a way that is democratic or representative. The town deciding to build a park on some land instead of selling it to a developer to build a mall isn't an oppression of the mall builder's freedoms. It's just a choice. Personally I find having choices in how to move around is an increase in personal freedom. Needing to own, insure, maintain, and fuel a car to participate in a community is a financial burden, and a burden on those who have to deal with cars and traffic while trying to do things like walk across a giant parking lot to get between two locations that should be reasonable to walk between.

Legally speaking, billboards are only banned within 500 yards or some other distance from the highway with the most traffic (where billboards would be most valuable, namely, US 101) but actually there are no billboards anywhere in the county and this has been the case since the 1960s (according to an old newspaper article). My guess is that the community has some way to exert \"informal\" (not based on formal governmental processes) pressure on landlords. Real estate prices are very high here in part because it is a very attractive landscape with plenty of hills and greenery and bodies of water, so maybe most landlords perceive that billboards have the potential to depress prices and keep the occasional landlord who contemplates erecting billboards in line somehow. Also as an exception to the general rule, bus shelters (structures owned and maintained by the city or the county to keep the rain and the sun off people waiting for a bus) near US 101 have ads on them (4' by 6' or so) and the buses themselves do, too, or at least they used to--it's been a few years since I noticed. reply dredmorbius 11 hours agorootparentMarin's billboard ban is older than I'd thought, having been adopted in 1936 according to this article:At least one billboard, along 101 at the highway cut between San Rafael and Larkspur, survived until the late 1970s or early 1980s, but was burned down in what has been described as the closest an act of arson has come to earning an award of commendation by the Marin County Board of Supervisors.

To prevent \"ambush marketing\", the IOC demands control over advertising in the area around the games. Given what a big deal it was for a city like Atlanta to get to host the games, this was one of the few times when the public was going to win despite the money and influence of the advertising industry. To its credit, Atlanta has mostly stuck by those Olympic era billboard laws. The biggest exception probably is the huge video board next to the Ernst & Young building but it replaced a much more modest video sign that had already been there. Being a large city, Atlanta has the resources to fight court challenges against the well funded advertising industry. Several of the suburban and exurban communities I lived in had citizens and governments united in their hatred of billboards but they lacked the resources to prevent them as the billboard companies have lots of experience with bleeding local governments dry in court, sending a message to other local governments to not even bother trying to oppose them.

I think marketing has a net negative effect. I also think that maybe you cannot eliminate all marketing but you can easily eliminate most of it just by controlling the spending of big companies, so it's possible. I have no ethical problems with eliminating it, as I consider it a form of manipulation and falsehood spreading, and anyway I don't consider companies have a right to free speech, or any real rights for that matter. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agoparentSo I'm curious. Suppose you're starting a new small business. You're selling a quality product but nobody knows about you. How do you propose they find out? reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentWord of mouth, to start. If there's no marketing, consumers in general will understand that they need to seek out products that they want and need, and will eventually find your new product. A side bonus is that this will eliminate a lot of useless garbage. Without advertising to manipulate people into buying things they didn't need and otherwise would not want, companies that sell junk will fail. At any rate, finding customers within the constraints of the law (including a hypothetical advertising ban) is not society's problem, it's the company's problem. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparent> Word of mouth, to start.

Spend your marketing budget on your fixed costs. Also, is your product direct-to-consumer? Because if it isn't, there are established channels to sell it to distributes, and if it is, you're likely a big part of the problem (since marketing of direct-to-consumer products is not usually a tool to let people know about new quality products). reply card_zero 8 hours agorootparentprevDo independent reviews and product testing count as marketing? There's some element of magicking away the payola in this thought experiment. reply AnthonyMouse 7 hours agorootparentWe already have those things. To the extent that people can use them to get the good product instead of the junk one, don't they already do it? And, of course, we know that these things are often corrupted. One of the major problems is that people want this most for products that are expensive, but manufacturers only send free/pre-release test samples to reviewers they think will publish a favorable review. To do it right you need the reviewer to not have this dependency on the manufacturer for access, so they need money to buy the product themselves. Which is what you get with Consumer Reports, but they (haha) aren't funded by advertising, and then people on a tight budget forego subscription and don't know what to buy. reply account42 7 hours agorootparent> To the extent that people can use them to get the good product instead of the junk one, don't they already do it?

You want to read a review before you buy a car, but by and large people actually do that already. Low cost items don't need that because this isn't going to be the only sandwich or bottle of laundry detergent you buy this decade, so it's as easy to take a chance on it once and try it yourself as to read a review which may or may not be biased, and then if it sucks you don't buy it again. reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentprevSomehow you have to get your product in front of (and probably give it away) to the people doing the independent reviews and product testing. That's marketing.

People would sign up, product place stuff in regular talks about weather near the office coffee machine. You would visit your parents and they would told ask you to buy some stuff you don't need because they would get a cut. Would you prefer that? I surely wouldn't. People have no idea how the world works, yet want to design laws and would like to force other people to act according to their preferences. It's so egocentric it's unbelievable. reply breuleux 2 hours agorootparentprevA world without marketing would still allow for products to be registered, reviewed, rated, and for people to talk about it. It would still allow you to have a website and a newsletter that people can opt into. The only restriction would be that you cannot pay for better visibility, reviews or references from influencers. So the way I imagine it would work is that you would register your product into an official registry (free of charge). Then if I need something specific I can search the registry for what I need, and your product might pop up, with links to your website, your videos, as well as all reviews and ratings. There could be a subsidy system that makes unreviewed products cheaper. If your product is really awesome, the awesome reviews should, in principle, suffice to make your business thrive. Of course, whatever the system in place is, there needs to be work done to make sure it cannot be cheated: if people can pay to prop up their product, they will. But it shouldn't be necessary to pay to make people aware of a product that could improve their lives. Surely it should be possible to set up some kind of discovery system. reply robxorb 9 hours agorootparentprevA product which needs help beyond its own merits to make a sale likely doesn't meet most people's definition of quality.

I'd love to live in a world where there's no advertising and so therefore the only products available have to be genuinely fantastic. I can't see a downside - just as many products will still be needed for just as many people, so it shouldn't affect the economy negatively.

Its literally manipulation of those who have money to spend them on product they otherwise wouldn't, has absolutely 0 relationship on quality on the product (in extreme cases it goes directly against it). Word of mouth, unbiased reviews (yes, they cost something to keep the interference away but save you tons of money and time down the line). Its 2024, we are more connected than we probably should be. Manipulation always = lies, it doesn't matter how you wrap them around. We all have moral compass (barring sociopaths/psychopaths et al), and we all have opinion on such behavior. Sure its like nuclear armament, once one does it many feel they also need to do it. But its purely emotional business on both ends (customers and companies feeling the need to pay for ads), where literally the only person truly winning is the advertiser (something about selling shovels during gold rush). Mankind as it is only loses, I don't see any way its morally justifiable. Even having less services say online available for free ain't a losing proposition if you look at long term damage of advertising. reply baryphonic 2 hours agorootparent> Its literally manipulation of those who have money to spend them on product they otherwise wouldn't, has absolutely 0 relationship on quality on the product (in extreme cases it goes directly against it). This is an extremely strong claim. Certainly you'd concede that some ads contain truthful information. Like there exists at least one ad that is true. So then how is it \"manipulation\" for someone to post that information in a public space? We jumped from \"billboards are ugly\" to \"ads are categorically evil,\" and based on some pretty strong assumptions. > Word of mouth, unbiased reviews (yes, they cost something to keep the interference away but save you tons of money and time down the line). Okay, so how do you get the first person to buy your product if advertising is illegal? The base case would seem to require it. Same goes for \"independent reviews.\" How do you find the independent reviewer? And this is ignoring getting a critical mass of customers for word of mouth to even work. reply xkcd-sucks 2 hours agorootparentprevOne caveat being, some high quality things really do get drowned out or conceptually polluted by loudly advertised crap.

Also it would be more efficient to do semi-targeted advertising by buying space in related places: magazines related to your product, sponsor spots in youtube videos, ads in specialty stores, etc. Start small by targeting an audience likely to be interested, not by mass-advertising in a spray-and-pray fashion. Example: I found out about JLCPCB from sponsor segments on electronics youtube channels, when they started their offering. Granted this is not a small business (the company behind JLC is a behemoth), but it is a Chinese company unknown in the west, that only did B2B before. They advertised directly to audiences that might be interested. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparent> Also it would be more efficient to do semi-targeted advertising by buying space in related places: magazines related to your product, sponsor spots in youtube videos, ads in specialty stores, etc. Those are all still marketing. Whether they're better than billboards depends on what the product is. > You won't have the money to buy such billboards anyways. Billboard space is available starting at on the order of $1000/month. This is well within the reach of a small business for a one month campaign and the dynamic billboards will even sell space on an interval of 15 minutes. The fixed billboards in the most expensive cities are all Coca Cola and McDonalds because those cost the most and that's who can afford them, but the proposal is \"ban all marketing\" not \"ban all marketing by multinational corporations\". The latter might be a good time though. reply JKCalhoun 6 hours agorootparentI thought we were talking specifically about banning billboard marketing. Or outdoor marketing if you want to be broad.

I have gotten precisely one piece of marketing communication that had a positive value in my entire life and it was from an online restaurant supplier. One. Solitary. Closer to forty than I am thirty. I just don't think the value proposition that you're talking about actually exists. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparentYou're just observing the long-term effects. If you're a new business and you're any good and you do effective marketing, in a couple years you're an established business. Then you see their ad and you say \"well yeah but they're an established business.\" Now they are, but at one point they weren't. And at that point they weren't buying as much advertising because they didn't have as much money, but if they hadn't bought any they'd be gone instead of established. I also kind of suspect that big companies buy a lot of advertising specifically to outbid their smaller competitors on the ad slots, because the ROI is much higher for the company that wouldn't have been the customer's default, so the bigger company isn't buying the slot to build awareness, they're buying it to keep their challenger from doing that. And then most of the ads you see are for big companies. But not all of them. reply burnished 31 minutes agorootparentAnd I'm saying that their marketing has had a negative impact on my life, I don't want it, and if your case represented a true and effective strategy then at some point I would have been exposed to it.

So instead of marketing directly to consumers, the maker can just go and pitch to the store owner, who then carries the product. If there are enough stores out there (not a world full of Walmarts), then most makers will find many stores to carry their product.

The thing is you cannot pay to promote it. I agree it would be a challenge to solve, maybe some kind of compromise could be achieved. reply BobaFloutist 1 hour agorootparentprevYou know what, how about this: A corporation gets to spend let's say up to 5% of its total budget on advertising in the first two months of its existence, as long as it has a new product that is exclusive to the company and as long as the company is advertising exclusively for itself and for the new product, and as long as the corporation is financially and structurally independent from established corporations. Any loopholes that let Coca-Cola take advantage of this are systematically closed, the intent of the law is clearly communicated, and the FTC fines any established corporation trying to work around it. This advertising is only legal to put in free versions of media that have paid ad-free versions, and to opt-in newsletters organized by product (so that people can pay to keep it out of their lives but if they're curious about innovations in a space or just want to know what's coming out they can get a slight discount for it). This also gives an advantage to new companies, which is probably a good thing, though could of course be abused by a billionaire with fly-by-night companies, at which point we'd have to patch that loophole.

Ban SEO. If i make a page that has my product offerings on it, it should compete on my copy, not SEO or how much i spent at google, bing, FB, etc. This is a solvable problem with specifically search technology, but also as a society we also have access to more people to ask for recommendations, to see other people talking about some new toy (or whatever) they bought. As far as search engines go, the search provider can wholesale ban everyone who even accidentally games the system. Put your widget catalog on a web page, be honest about your products and/or services, and you should be fine. I will repeat that, because i think this is the part that gets marketing graduates in a tizzy - be honest about your products and/or services. If you gotta lie about what you offer or can do, then i really could not care less if your business survives; there's already enough dishonesty in our society. reply fzeroracer 7 hours agorootparentprevThe same way humanity has done for thousands of years? Word of mouth and reputation. This isn't a new problem, what's new is the ubiquitousness of advertising and the amount of money that gets pissed away on marketing. So what ends up happening is that local businesses don't get any of the marketing opportunities which get bought out by big businesses with a large ad spend budget. reply kortilla 10 hours agoparentprevA lot of marketing is not falsehood spreading. It’s literally just trying to get the word to potential customers that a thing exists that might be useful to them. Most b2b marketing is like that. I agree that marketing where they have an attractive person just show something is manipulative though. reply barnabee 4 hours agorootparentThis is just so wide of the mark in my experience, especially B2B where the sales and marketing tactics are just, well, awful. What I have observed is that almost without fail, I find out about really good, high quality products and services from friends and colleagues, through more general word of mouth, by reading reviews, and by research, not through ads. In fact, it is so noticably true that what is being advertised to me is rarely what I want that I use advertising as a negative signal. If I recall seeing ads for something, I will consciously avoid buying it and that usually works out for the best. So I conclude advertising is mostly important for duping people into buying things they don't really want or need, that are more than likely nothing special, and that society would benefit greatly from a ban on advertising. reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentprevShow me an ad that you think is just \"trying to get the word out\" and I'll show you the lies. reply kortilla 4 hours agorootparentSure, google “skid steer rental Chicago”. One of the sponsored results is for an electric skid steer that I didn’t know existed. This is genuinely useful to know for small jobs. Another sponsored result is for a delivery rental service that can bring them anywhere. Also good to know for jobs where I don’t want to go to an equipment rental place in the city to haul it myself to a site 150 miles away. A separate example is that lots of airports have 3rd party off airport parking that is cheaper. A billboard on the highway to the airport that says “off-site aport parking $20/day, $80/week with 24/7 shuttle service every 15 mins” is literally all just useful information about a way to save money using a third party at a convenience cost that you wouldn’t think to look into. reply account42 7 hours agorootparentprev-Xoogler working in the startup world Please consider that your worldview may be warped. reply kortilla 5 hours agorootparentPlease consider you might not understand why I left. reply baxtr 10 hours agoparentprevYour post is actually a form of marketing.

If, while going through my day, I am interrupted by your billboard, banner ad, spam email, promotional app notification, street marketing person, etc. in an attempt to manipulate me into action, that is the thing that should be illegal. If I walk into a shop and say \"I'm looking for a camera\", invite a business in to pitch for work, call somoene up for a quote, directly enter a query like \"buy camera uk\" into a search engine, etc. then I think that is ok.

These products are recklessly crawling many sites across the web, and we've already had to block several sources of abusive traffic. It feels like a new AI gold rush, and in their haste, some of these crawlers are behaving in a way that harms the sites they depend on. At Read the Docs, we host documentation for many projects and are generally bot friendly, but the behavior of AI crawlers is currently causing us problems. We have noticed AI crawlers aggressively pulling content, seemingly without basic checks against abuse. Bots repeatedly download large files hundreds of times daily, partially from bugs in their crawlers, with traffic coming from many IP addresses without rate or bandwidth limiting. AI crawlers are acting in a way that is not respectful to the sites they are crawling, and that is going to cause a backlash against AI crawlers in general. As a community-supported site without a large budget, AI crawlers have cost us a significant amount of money in bandwidth charges, and caused us to spend a large amount of time dealing with abuse. AI crawler abuse We have been seeing a number of bad crawlers over the past few months, but here are a couple illustrative examples of the abuse we're seeing: 73 TB in May 2024 from one crawler One crawler downloaded 73 TB of zipped HTML files in May 2024, with almost 10 TB in a single day. This cost us over $5,000 in bandwidth charges, and we had to block the crawler. We emailed this company, reporting a bug in their crawler, and we're working with them on reimbursing us for the costs. This was a bug in their crawler that was causing it to download the same files over and over again. There was no bandwidth limiting in place, or support for Etags and Last-Modified headers which would have allowed the crawler to only download files that had changed. We have reported this issue to them, and hopefully the issue will be fixed. We do have a CDN for these files, but this request was for an old URL that had an old redirect in place. This redirect went to an old dashboard download URL, where we don't have CDN caching in place for security reasons around serving other dynamic content. We are planning to fix this redirect to point to the cached URL. Example web requests 10 TB in June 2024 from another In June 2024, someone used Facebook's content downloader to download 10 TB of data, mostly Zipped HTML and PDF files. We tried to email Facebook about it with the contact information listed in the bot's user agent, but the email bounced. We think this was someone using Facebook's content downloader to download all of our files, but we aren't really sure. It could also be Meta crawling sites with their latest AI project, but the user agent is not clear. Actions taken We have IP-based rate limiting in place for many of our endpoints, however these crawlers are coming from a large number of IP addresses, so our rate limiting is not effective. These crawlers are using real user agents that identify them, which is a good thing. However, we can't simply rate limit all user agents to our platform because many real users use the same browsers with the same user agent. (CDN providers: if you're reading this, there's an opportunity here!) We have taken a few actions to try to mitigate this abuse: We have temporarily blocked all traffic from bots Cloudflare identifies as AI Crawlers, while we figure out how to deal with this. We have started monitoring our bandwidth usage more closely and are working on more aggressive rate limiting rules. We will reconfigure our CDN to better cache these files, reducing the load on our origin servers. Outcomes Given that our Community site is only for hosting open source projects, AWS and Cloudflare do give us sponsored plans, but we only have a limited number of credits each year. The additional bandwidth costs AI crawlers are currently causing will likely mean we will run out of AWS credits early. By blocking these crawlers, bandwidth for our downloaded files has decreased by 75% (~800GB/day to ~200GB/day). If all this traffic hit our origin servers, it would cost around $50/day, or $1,500/month, along with the increased load on our servers. Normal traffic gets cached by our CDN, and doesn't cost us anything for bandwidth. But because many of these files are not downloaded often (and they're large), the cache is usually expired and the requests hit our origin servers directly, causing substantial bandwidth charges. Zipped documentation was designed for offline consumption by users, not for crawlers. Next steps We are asking all AI companies to be more respectful of the sites they are crawling. They are risking many sites blocking them for abuse, irrespective of the other copyright and moral issues that are at play in the industry. As a major host of open source documentation, we'd love to work with these companies on a deal to crawl our site respectfully. We could build an integration that would alert them to content changes, and download the files that have changed. However, none of these companies have reached out to us, except in response to abuse reports. We also ask that they implement basic checks in their crawlers for all sites. A good example is the RFC2616Policy downloader from Scrapy, which implement many of these policies. If these companies wish to be good actors in the space, they need to start acting like it, instead of burning bridges with folks in the community. See more posts from our blog",

    "commentBody": "AI crawlers need to be more respectful (readthedocs.com)217 points by pneff 23 hours agohidepastfavorite111 comments everforward 22 hours agoI'm curious if there's a point where a crawler is misconfigured so badly that it becomes a violation of the CFAA by nature of recklessness. They say a single crawler downloaded 73TB of zipped HTML files in a month. That averages out to ~29 MB/s of traffic, every second, for an entire month. Averaging 30 megabytes a second of traffic for a month is crossing into reckless territory. I don't think any sane engineer would call that normal or healthy for scraping a site like ReadTheDocs; Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn/etc, sure, but not ReadTheDocs. To me, this crosses into \"recklessly negligent\" territory, and I think should come with government fines for the company that did it. Scraping is totally fine to me, but it needs to be done either a) at a pace that will not impact the provider (read: slowly), or b) with some kind of prior agreement that the provider is accepting responsibility to provide enough capacity. While I agree that putting content out into the public means it can be scraped, I don't think that necessarily implies scrapers can do their thing at whatever rate they want. As a provider, there's very little difference to me between getting DDoSed and getting scraped to death; both ruin the experience for users. reply simonw 22 hours agoprev\"One crawler downloaded 73 TB of zipped HTML files in May 2024, with almost 10 TB in a single day.

They are a persistent source of spam email servers, scrapers, and bot probes. The simple reason is the operators quickly dump a host, and the next user is left wondering why their legitimate site is instantly spelunking spam ban lists. It is the degenerative nature of cloud services... and unsurprisingly we end up often banning most parts of Digital Ocean, Amazon, Azure, Google, and Baidu. Have a wonderful day, =3 reply immibis 22 hours agorootparentIt's the degenerative nature of assuming an IP corresponds to a user. They have not corresponded to users for over a decade. I once discovered I'm banned on my mobile phone connection from at least one app which doesn't know that CGNAT exists (a very poor assumption for mobile phone apps in particular). If you must block IPs, do it as a last resort, make it based on some observable behavior, quickly instated when that behavior occurs, and quickly uninstated when it does not. reply Joel_Mckay 21 hours agorootparentReally depends on the use-case, but yeah the response happens in a proportional manner. We also follow the tit-for-tat forgiveness policy to ensure old bans are given a second chance. Mostly, we want the nuisance to sometimes randomly work, as it wastes more of their time fixing bugs.

There is page referral monitoring, context cookies, and dynamically created link chaff with depth-charge rules.

Domestic \"Users\" functioning as proxies will be tripping usage limits, and getting temporarily banned. Google does this by the way, try hammering their services and find out what happens. Context cookies also immediately flag egregious multi-user routes, and if it is a ISP IP you know its a problem user. If it is over 15 users an hour per IP, than you can be 100% sure its a Tor proxy. we ban over 243000+ IPs, and saw zero impact to our bottom line. Have a nice day, =) reply DamonHD 11 hours agorootparentThose of us running sites for public information rather than sales cannot make the simple cut-off that you do.

If someone paid for that list they were almost certainly conned, as the black hats regularly publish that content on their forums.

But ofc pointing this out to them gets some sort of \"oh this is normal, we don't care\" response because they are big enough to know that eg podcasters need them. reply bastawhiz 19 hours agoparentI run pinecast.com. If there was a leaderboard for hn users serving XML, I'd almost certainly be in the top five. I don't disagree with your post. But: RSS downloads are at an all time low, and that's a bad thing. They're at an all time low because Spotify and Apple both fetch feeds from centralized servers. 1000 subscribers no longer means 24000ish daily feed fetches, it means 48. With keep alive or H2, these services simply don't reconnect. The number of IPs that hit me from Apple, for instance, is probably only double digits. Since Apple and Spotify both sit between me and the listeners, they eliminate the privacy that listeners would otherwise enjoy. It also forces podcasters to go to them to find out how many people are subscribed, which means lots of big databases instead of one database that I host for my customers. Centralization of feed checking carries huge risks, in my opinion, especially as both Apple and Spotify make moves to also become the hosting providers. reply DamonHD 11 hours agorootparentDo you have a CDN between you and Apple / Spotify? Because if you do I think that Apple/Spotify are polling that CDN every few minutes and the CDN is having its bandwidth wasted invisibly, but presumably priced in.

(I'd like to move to email to discuss this further, if possible: I have an arXiv paper to write!) reply bastawhiz 3 hours agorootparentThe data I'm giving you is based on logs from the CDN.

As someone who written a lot of crawling infrastructure and managed large scale crawling operations, respectful crawling is important. That being said it always seems like google has had a massively unfair advantage for crawling not only with budget but with brandname, and perceived value. It sometimes felt hard to reach out to websites and ask them to allow our crawlers, and grey tactics were often used. And I'm always for a more open internet. I think regular releases of content in a compressed format would go a long way, but there would always be a race for having the freshest content. What might be better is offering the content in machine format, XML or JSON or even SOAP. Which is usually better for what the sites crawling want to achieve, cheaper for you to serve, and cheaper and less resource intensive compared to crawling.

I intentionally made sure my crawler was slow (I prefer batch processing workflows in general, and this also has the effect of not needing a machine gun crawler rate) 2. For data updates, I made sure to first do a HEAD request and only access the page if it has actually been changed. This is good for me (lower cost), the site owner, and the internet as a whole (minimizes redundant data transfer volume) Regarding individual site policies, I feel there’s often a “tragedy of the commons” dilemma for any market segment subject to aggregator dominance: - individual sites often aggressively hide things like pricing information and explicitly disallow crawlers from accessing them - humans end up having to access them: this results in a given site either not being included at all, or accessed once but never reaccessed, causing aggregator data to go stale - aggregators often outrank individual sites due to better SEO and likely human preference of aggregators, because it saves them research time - this results in the original site being put at a competitive disadvantage in SEO, since the their product ends up not being listed, or listed with outdated/incorrect information - that sequence of events leads to negative business outcomes, especially for smaller businesses who often already have a higher chance of failure Therefore, I believe it’s important to have some sort of standard policy that is implemented and enforced at various levels: CDNs, ISPs, etc. The policy should be carefully balanced to consider all these factors as well as having a baked in mechanism for low friction amendment based on future emergent effects. This would result in a much better internet, one that has the property of GINI regulation, ensuring well-distributed outcomes that are optimized for global socioeconomic prosperity as a whole.

The mere concept of generative AI is disrespectful. reply apantel 16 hours agoparentThe concept of generative AI is not disrespectful. You could have generative AI trained on licensed data - would that be disrespectful? reply Joel_Mckay 22 hours agoprevHad a conversation with a firm that wanted a distributed scraper built, and they really did not care about site usage policies. You would be fooling yourselves if you think such a firm cared about robots.txt or page tags. We warned them they would be sued eventually, to contact the site owners for legal access to the data, and issued a hard pass on the project. Probably they assumed if the indexing process was out of another jurisdiction their domestic firm wouldn't be liable for theft of service or copyright infringement. It was my understanding AI/ML does not change legal obligations in business, but the firm probably found someone to build that dubious project eventually... Spider traps and rate-limiting are good options too. =3 reply reaperman 22 hours agoparentRobots.txt doesnt create a legal obligation. It’s just a set of rules saying “if you don’t follow these rules to politely crawl our site, we’ll block you from crawling our site”. Obviously “anything goes” in civil suits however - if someone is being absurdly egregious with their crawling there’s usually some exposure to one tort or another. reply Joel_Mckay 21 hours agorootparentThe posted site access/usage policy is legally enforceable in most jurisdictions as far as I know... And Reddit has definitely become more proactive about scrapers. ;-) reply reaperman 16 hours agorootparentPlease review HiQ vs. LinkedIn - it hinged on the fact that HiQ hired crowdsourced workers (“turkers”) to create fake profiles through which to access LinkedIn’s platform (who had to agree to the ToS to create these accounts). The court found that hiQ expressly agreed to the user agreement when it created its corporate account on LinkedIn’s platform. This doesn't apply if you don't ever agree to anything - which is the case if the information is not locked behind account creation. reply Joel_Mckay 15 hours agorootparentThis gets complex fast, as a click-army is not necessarily violating the EULA. However, if they scraped the content using these account credentials, than it becomes a problem in a commercial context. If I recall, only journalists and academics could argue Fair use at that point. Anyway, I didn't touch the project mostly for copyright and trademark risk concerns. Have a great day =3 reply echoangle 20 hours agorootparentprevLegally enforceable as in “you can block people who don’t follow the policy” or enforceable as in “you can sue them for money”? reply Joel_Mckay 17 hours agorootparentIf I recall it is considered theft-of-service if you bypass the posted site usage terms with an agent like a spider, and certainly a copyright violation for unauthorized content usage (especially in the context of a commercial venture.) One may be sued, but not because you parsed robots.txt wrong =3 reply reaperman 16 hours agorootparent> it is considered theft-of-service if you bypass the posted site usage terms My understanding is that this is not accurate. HiQ v LinkedIn established that this is only the case if you actually agreed to the terms of service. Such \"agreement\" only happens if the information is walled behind an account creation process, e.g. Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. If it's just scraping publicly available webpages, the only legal issue with scraping would be unreasonably or obviously negligent scraping practices which lead to degradation or denial-of-service. And obviously the line for that would have to be determined in civil court. eBay v. Bidder's Edge (2000) is the last case that I could find which even considered violation of robots.txt as very minor part of the judgement, but the findings were based far more on other things. Intel Corp. v. Hamidi also implicitly overruled the judgement in that that ruling (though not related to robots.txt, which was really just a very minor point in the first place). reply Joel_Mckay 15 hours agorootparentHard to say, I seem to recall it was because some spider authors used session cookies to bypass the EULA (the page probe auto-clicks \"I agree\" to capture the session cookie), and faked user agent strings to spoof gogglebot to gain access to site content. One thing is for certain, is its jurisdictional... and way too messy to be responsible for maintaining/hosting (the ambiguous copyright protection outside a research context looked way too risky.) =3 reply Atotalnoob 22 hours agoparentprevAI/ML has created a race to suck all the data on the internet regardless of copyright or status and use it.

It seems that most crawlers are actually respectful. reply PaulHoule 22 hours agoparentI used to run a site with a huge number of pages that had high running costs but low revenue. The only web crawler that did anything for me was Google, as Google sent an appreciable amount of traffic. Referrers from Bing were almost undetectable: the joke among my black hat SEO friends at the time was that you could rank for money keywords like \"buy wow gold\" and get 10 hits. Then there were the Chinese crawlers like Baidu that would crawl at 10x the rate of Google but send zero referrers. And then there were crawlers looking for copyrighted images that cost me money to accommodate even if they never sent me cease and desist letters. As much as I hate the Google monopoly I couldn't afford having my site crawled like that without any benefit to me. It's an awful situation for the long term though because it prevents new entrants. Right now I am thinking about a new search engine for a vertical where a huge number of products are available from different vendors and when you do find results from Google they are sold out at least 70% of the time. I hate to think it's going to get harder to make something. reply Centigonal 22 hours agoparentprev [–] How many foundation AI companies are there? 2 is a pretty big chunk of that pie. reply corbet 22 hours agorootparentI think there are a thousand wannabe companies all trying to suck up as much data as they can; not a sustainable situation in any way. reply PaulHoule 22 hours agorootparentThere was a paper about webcrawlers circa 2000 that pointed out that the vast majority of academics who ran webcrawlers never published a paper based on their work. reply morkalork 22 hours agorootparentSounds like all the kids who want to make a video-game and start with building a game engine. reply croemer 22 hours agorootparentprev [–] What makes you think that only a dozen or so foundation AI companies are scraping? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "PyDPainter A usable pixel art program written in Python About PyDPainter, pronounced \"Pied Painter\" (like Pied Piper), is an attempt to create a usable pixel art program in Python using PyGame. The original inspiration came from the Commodore Amiga version of Deluxe Paint released by Electronic Arts in 1985. Back then, Deluxe Paint helped define the user interface of a paint program with tool bars, menus, and the novel use of left and right mouse buttons for painting and erasing. After pixel art gave way to photo-realism and high-resolution 24 bit color, Deluxe Paint was largely forgotten for artistic work -- left behind in the ever-progressing march of technology. Recently, with a resurgence of all things \"retro,\" low-resolution pixel art and limited color palettes have become popular once again. Many tools to deal with this medium are either too complicated or too crude. This project is an attempt to bring back an old but reliable tool and enhance it with some features to help it better coexist in the modern world.

    "title": "Startup Finance for Founders – Part I, Accounting (2016)",
    "originLink": "https://rein.pk/startup-finance-for-founders-part-i-accounting",
    "originBody": "Startup Finance for Founders — Part I, Accounting January 8, 2016 When we started Segment, we knew nothing about business finance. My background was in aerospace engineering, and my co-founders came from computer science and design. Beyond the hilariously overcomplicated spreadsheet we used to manage grocery bills as roommates, we really had no experience in finance when we started the company. In the past 2 years Segment has grown from 4 to 60 people, signed up thousands of customers, and raised $44m over a few rounds of financing. Out of necessity we’ve learned the basics of accounting, invoicing & contracts, billing periods, bank account structures, strategic finance and growth models. But it’s been hard to piece together. Bits and pieces from accountants, lawyers, our CFO and reading a random book or two off Amazon that looked promising. Although startups have developed a culture of sharing learnings, finance generally remains pretty hush hush. Notable exceptions are Everpix’s eye-opening post-mortem, Baremetric’s Open Startups, Mattermark’s complex fundraising tale and oodles of general advice about fundraising. It’s a tricky topic. This article is part of a two-part series outlining what I’ve learned about startup finance, from a practical perspective. I’ve tried to include diagrams, charts, and redacted docs where helpful. Part I covers some of our learnings in accounting: accurately recording the past. Accounting is rigorously pedantic to record exactly what’s happened. Then, in Part II I’ll talk about some adventures in strategic finance. Strategic finance is exactly the opposite of accounting. It looks to the future, attempts to guesstimate the fuzzy unknowns, and searches for ways to mitigate risk and increase growth. Part I: Accounting — Bank Accounts, Credit Cards, Invoices & Contracts Part II: Strategic Finance — CFOs, Annual Prepayment, Venture Debt & Shadow Budgets Accounting I learned the basics of accounting from “Accounting for Developers” and this little book, not to actually do the accounting for ourselves, but to understand what our bookkeeper was taking care of for us. As we grew, problems came up that weren’t covered there, like structuring bank accounts, dealing with lack of credit history, and how contracts and invoicing actually work. Bank Account Structure When we were just getting started, we set up a company bank account like any normal person. We opened a checking account. Done! But then we raised a new round of financing (very exciting), and started to build the team. With $2m in the bank and a payroll to hit, we started to get nervous about that $2m being so easy to access. Our customer base was growing, and we were giving our bank account number to receive ACH payments from customers… the same bank account that held the entire livelihood of the company in cash! According to warnings from our peers on the ycfounders forum, it’s reasonably common for leaked bank account numbers to get hit with fraudulent withdrawals. After we raised our Series A and added another $15m to the account, our simplistic checking account structure made us even less comfortable. We needed to be able to spend money easily, but we wanted the majority of the balance set aside securely. This is when our CFO put in place a new bank account structure. First, since our new $15m+ balance was way above FDIC insurance limits (the government insures up to $0.25m per entity, per account type, per bank), cash backed by the bank was no longer the safest asset. We moved most of our cash to a money market account invested purely in US treasury bills, which are considered a bit more secure in case the bank collapses or places a temporary hold on funds during a bank run. You may think this is unlikely, but 140 banks failed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and Greece just had a bank run in July. We wanted to be safe. Second, we created a receivables account that can only accept deposits. The bank simply rejects attempted debits to the account. We hand out the receivables account number to customers with abandon, because it only exists as an endpoint for customer payments. It also makes it easy for accounting to see an isolated list of customer payments. Third, we created a payables account that we keep more private. We maintain a small balance in this account that comfortably covers daily expenses. Fourth, we asked our bank to set up an automatic “sweep”. At the end of every day it automatically transfers everything from receivables to the treasury bills account, and refills payables. This account structure simplified our cash management, so that we spend less time running around making internal transfers. Plus, it gives us better security and reduces financial risk. It’s an easy way to sleep better at night. Credit Cards Many founders I’ve talked to have struggled with banks giving their startups low credit limits. We’ve also been stonewalled, but hopefully this story gives you some negotiating tips. Initially each founder just had a simple debit card, because that’s what automatically came with our checking account. Wonderful! Then we hit a problem: there are limitations to debit cards (e.g. you can’t rent cars). So, we switched from debit to credit cards to solve the problem. But alas, credit limits for startups are downright draconian. For example, Silicon Valley Bank credit card requires you to pay the entire credit limit in cash, which they hold on deposit, and then they still charge interest if you’re late on a payment. More than once we had late fees when autopay didn’t work. We switched to Bank of America after that, but were only allowed a laughably low credit limit: —February 2014— BoA: What credit limit are you looking for? Me: We’ll need at least $20k for our monthly operating expenses. BoA: Ok, I have a few questions. What was your revenue last year? Me: Around $40k. BoA: Got it, what do you expect your revenue to be this year? Me: Over $2m. BoA: Uh huh... [suppressed laughter]… ok, um, I’m going to approve you for a credit limit of $5,000 per month. Me: [hahaha, what am i supposed to do with that? pay it off four times a month?] Every six months or so we had the same predictable conversation with a BoA risk analyst, inching up our credit limit. Ultimately I found we could get more reasonable limits by steering the conversation away from revenue, where high growth startups sound incredibly strange, and focusing instead on our cash balance, which was inflated by fundraising. The line we resorted to (with narrowly suppressed laughter at the absurdity of it) was “We could transfer in a couple million in cash, if it would help?” BoA is not used to dealing with snarky, frustrated startup founders, and the line worked: we got significantly higher credit limits. We were fortunate in being well-funded, and this was a useful moment to flaunt it. Eventually, Bank of America wasn’t able to keep up with our credit limit needs (when we needed to jump from $75k/mo to $200k/mo). And worryingly for me personally, in a disaster scenario I was personally liable for the card balance in lieu of the company. So, we’ve switched back to SVB to increase our credit limit (which they’ll hold on deposit, sigh). Contracts and Invoicing Two years ago we had no idea how selling to other businesses worked at a operational level. None of us had ever done it before, or even worked at a company that had done it before. We started by accepting payments through Stripe, which was nice and simple. But as our customers grew, so too did the size of payments and the need for customized terms of service. We learned that for software contracts above $20k per year, most companies didn’t expect to put it on a credit card. They expected to be invoiced once, with signed terms of service reviewed by their legal team. So when we started closing our first “business tier” contracts in Fall 2013, we expanded our accepted payment methods beyond Stripe to include paper contracts and invoices. If you haven’t seen this before, here’s the basics of how it works: Contracts are usually structured as a Master Services Agreement (MSA) with one or more Order Forms. The master services agreement covers the contractual agreement about liability, confidentiality, payment and termination. The order form is meant to be an easily readable description of what’s being sold and paid in what timeframe, to whom. Here’s an anonymized order form from Segment: The master services agreement is designed to allow future orders at the same company (e.g. additional teams or departments) to be executed as quick signatures on a new order form, without another legal review process. This makes it easy for a customer to expand their account, no muss no fuss. We’ve found that the liability terms of the master services agreement are the most hotly contested. No one wants to be on the line if things go south. If you’re selling these kinds of contracts, you’ll likely need to purchase general business liability insurance (and we have extra insurance for data security). From what we’ve seen, insurance for several million in liability seems to start around $10-20k per year. Then, in the contract you hold the line on your maximum liability as the amount you have insured! Invoicing was new to us back then as well. Here’s an example invoice, which simply gets sent to the financial contact listed on the order form.This article covers some of the common practices we’ve learned in startup accounting.

Example, $0 balance, card limit $1k, pay onto the card $10k, card limit is now $11k. $10k of that is really prepaid and $1k is truly credit, but it would have solved their problems given they had the cash on hand and mostly wanted to avoid declines on their cards due to draining the credit limit to $0. The problem with other forms of payments is they're only usually accepted on a contract annual basis and you're now vendor locked for the remainder of the contract. You're also up fronting the capital to that vendor. reply stpn 2 hours agoparentWhat banks has this worked with for you? I just tried to do this with chase, capital one, and citi. The first two only let you pay up to 10% more than your balance (balance, not credit limit) and citi only 7.5% - nowhere near 10x your credit limit. reply berelig 4 hours agoparentprevNote that by doing this most (or maybe all) credit card companies will only honour whatever protections and insurances they offer on the original portion of the limit. So if you make an $11k payment, $10k of that is like handing cash to the vendor. reply manishsharan 3 hours agoparentprevThis boggles my brain. Why would you give credit card companies extra money to hold for you? Get an AmEx with the balance you need and use that . Much better service and protections.

One thing I’d suggest doing different - instead of trying to inch up credit limits rather have that conversation at same time as the investment. ie we’re looking for a provider to park 15m but we also need a credit line/cards/whatever.

Here in Europe you certainly can rent a car with a debit card. reply jbstack 4 hours agoparentI've traveled fairly extensively around Europe and you do indeed need a credit card in the majority of cases. Some rental agencies will accept a debit card but it's risky to just turn up on the assumption that they will. You can find yourself without a car or forced to take up very expensive excess insurance. I've personally had this happen to me more than once and I now travel with a credit card which I have just for car rental purposes. When you book a rental car through an online comparison site, you will almost always see in the small print that bringing a credit card with you is one of the requirements. If you're taking out insurance by default then you may not notice that this is an issue because you're effectively paying to reduce the excess to £0 instead of blocking a deposit on a credit card for them to charge from in the event that you damage the car. reply r0s 5 hours agoparentprevYou certainly can in the US too, they \"pre-authorize\" some token amount to be sure you have the funds and off you go. reply nh2 5 hours agorootparentThis did not work for me in the USA and Canada, where the pre-authorisation attempt failed with a debit card but worked with a credit card (from the same bank) in 3 different places when renting cars. reply slackfan 4 hours agorootparentPre-auth amounts over hit over maximum withdrawal limits for debit cards.

I suppose having an “old bank” also affects things. For example, some times in other situations my debit card also rejects big purchases or new countries or some reservations of funds from some new hotel when I check in. But because they are pretty modern they also have an app that notifies me of the rejection at the same time as the terminal is told that it was rejected and so I can go in to the app and say this is actually ok and then I try again and then it goes through. Maybe what people need is really this kind of thing like what I have with my card and the app. reply mcc1ane 11 hours agoprev [–] (2016) reply tickbw 3 hours agoparent [–] SVB failed in March 2023.

    "title": "Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data",
    "originLink": "https://aml4td.org/",
    "originBody": "Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data Authors Max Kuhn Kjell Johnson Published 2024-06-17 Preface Welcome! This is a work in progress. We want to create a practical guide to developing quality predictive models from tabular data. We’ll publish materials here as we create them and welcome community contributions in the form of discussions, suggestions, and edits. We also want these materials to be reusable and open. The sources are in the source GitHub repository with a Creative Commons license attached (see below). Our intention is to write these materials and, when we feel we’re done, pick a publishing partner to produce a print version. The book takes a holistic view of the predictive modeling process and focuses on a few areas that are usually left out of similar works. For example, the effectiveness of the model can be driven by how the predictors are represented. Because of this, we tightly couple feature engineering methods with machine learning models. Also, quite a lot of work happens after we have determined our best model and created the final fit. These post-modeling activities are an important part of the model development process and will be described in detail. We deliberately avoid using the term “artificial intelligence.” Eugen Rochko’s (@Gargron@mastodon.social) comment on Mastodon does a good job of summarizing our reservations regarding the term: It’s hard not to say “AI” when everybody else does too, but technically calling it AI is buying into the marketing. There is no intelligence there, and it’s not going to become sentient. It’s just statistics, and the danger they pose is primarily through the false sense of skill or fitness for purpose that people ascribe to them.

Intended Audience Our intended audience includes data analysts of many types: statisticians, data scientists, professors and instructors of machine learning courses, laboratory scientists, and anyone else who desires to understand how to create a model for prediction. We don’t expect readers to be experts in these methods or the math behind them. Instead, our approach throughout this work is applied. That is, we want readers to use this material to build intuition about the predictive modeling process. What are good and bad ideas for the modeling process? What pitfalls should we look out for? How can we be confident that the model will be predictive for new samples? What are advantages and disadvantages of different types of models? These are just some of the questions that this work will address. Some background in modeling and statistics will be extremely useful. Having seen or used basic regression models is good, and an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as variance, correlation, populations, samples, etc., is needed. There will also be some mathematical notation, so you’ll need to be able to grasp these abstractions. But we will keep this to those parts where it is absolutely necessary. There are a few more statistically sophisticated sections for some of the more advanced topics. If you would like a more theoretical treatment of machine learning models, then we recommend Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2017). Other books for gaining a more in-depth understanding of machine learning are Bishop and Nasrabadi (2006), Arnold, Kane, and Lewis (2019) and, for more of a deep learning focus, Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (2016) and/or Prince (2023). Is there code? We definitely want to decouple the content of this work from specific software. One of our other books on modeling had computing sections. Many people found these sections to be a useful resource at the time of the book’s publication. However, code can quickly become outdated in today’s computational environment. In addition, this information takes up a lot of page space that would be better used for other topics. We will create computing supplements to go along with the materials. Since we use R’s tidymodels framework for calculations, the supplement currently in-progress is: tidymodels.aml4td.org If you are interested in working on a python/scikit-learn supplement, please file an issue Are there exercises? Many readers found the Exercise sections of Applied Predictive Modeling to be helpful for solidifying the concepts presented in each chapter. The current set can be found at exercises.aml4td.org How can I ask questions? If you have questions about the content, it is probably best to ask on a public forum, like cross-validated. You’ll most likely get a faster answer there if you take the time to ask the questions in the best way possible. If you want a direct answer from us, you should follow what I call Yihui’s Rule: add an issue to GitHub (labeled as “Discussion”) first. It may take some time for us to get back to you. If you think there is a bug, please file an issue. Can I contribute? There is a contributing page with details on how to get up and running to compile the materials (there are a lot of software dependencies) and suggestions on how to help.

In practice, almost all tabular data problems I've encountered boil down to: 1. Make sure you don't have any impossible nonsense or data leakage in your features or target 2. Split your data in an intelligent way (temporally for time-series, group-wise for hierarchical data) 3. Try a really simple linear regression / logistic regression model to get a \"dumb\" baseline for your accuracy/error metric and make sure it is reasonable 4. If you need interpretability, consider a GAM, else, throw it into XGBoost and you'll get state of the art results reply jamesblonde 13 hours agoparentI am writing a tabular data textbook for O'Reilly - on building ML systems with a feature store. I try to be opinionated about modelling - XGBoost is all you really need, but the challenges are more like you say - how to prevent data leakage (ASOF LEFT JOIN (or use a feature store)), separating model-independent data transformations from model-specific data transformations, APIs for things like time-series splits, logging, monitoring, building and operating the pipelines.

It seems to have a systematic approach to fit models and improve them. reply code_biologist 11 hours agorootparentAt risk of being excessively cheeky, I think you should throw it into xgboost and not worry about it. I love Jeremy Howard, but if you're doing applied ML on tabular data, tweaking specifics of model construction probably won't get you anything beyond stock xgboost. The concerns highlighted by your sibling commenter jamesblonde end up eating most of your time in deployed ML products, not model construction. If you're looking to learn about ML model construction I'm sure it's a great book. reply antipaul 3 hours agoprevLike others say, usually just go for XGBoost, which is increasingly even shown (proven?) in literature, eg: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03253 You can also start with scikit-learn's `LogisticRegressionCV`, if a linear model is more palatable to your audience. The bigger challenge is to reliably estimate how good your model is. It's not about getting the best performance – it's about getting the \"real\" performance. How will your model _really_ do on future unseen datasets? The answer to this challenge is cross-validation. But what are the questions? There are 2 very different questions for which the answer is cross-validation. One is, which hyper parameters to use with your model? The second is, what is the generalization performance of the model? This requires 2 separate applications (loops) of cross-validation. The authors of this book talk about this in terms of having a \"validation set\" and a \"test set\" (Sometimes, these terms are switched around, and there is also \"holdout set\". It's critical to know how you, and the rest of your team, are using these terms in your modeling) A robust way to implement these 2 CV's is with nested cross-validation, readily available in many packages – and also, should be \"fast enough\" using modern computers. One exercise that remains is: with nested CV, which model do you pick as your \"production\" model? That is also a bit tricky. Reading things like the following can help: https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/65128/207989 EDIT: for those inclined, here is a paper on why you need 2 loops of CV: \"On Over-fitting in Model Selection and Subsequent Selection Bias in Performance Evaluation\" by Cawley and Talbot: https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/cawley10a/cawley1... reply wongarsu 2 hours agoparent> One exercise that remains is: with nested CV, which model do you pick as your \"production\" model? Why even pick one, just make an ensemble out of all of them. Unless you need your model to remain blind to one test or validation set for some reason, but then you should probably choose at random anyways to avoid bias. Of course this being HN somebody is going to mention some case where they only have the CPU or memory budget for one model. But in general making ensembles of multiple XGBoost models is a great way to get better model performance. reply mjhay 5 hours agoprevI appreciate the section on independent component analysis (ICA).

Our RAM should all be ECC and our OSes should all be on self-healing filesystems. reply amluto 9 hours agoprevHere’s my pet peeve regarding RAID: no RAID system I’ve ever used gracefully handles disks that come and go. Concretely: start with two disks in RAID1. Remove one. Mount in degraded mode. Write to a file. Unmount. Reconnect the removed disk. Mount again with both disks. The results vary between annoying (need to restore / “resilver” and have no redundancy until it’s done; massively increased risk of data loss while doing so due to heavy IO load without redundancy and pointless loss of the redundancy that already exists) to catastrophic (outright corruption). The corollary is that RAID invariably works poorly with disks connected over using an interface that enumerates slowly or unreliably. Yet most competent active-active database systems have no problems with this scenario! I would love to see a RAID system that thinks of disks as nodes, properly elects leaders, and can efficiently fast-forward a disk that’s behind. A pile of USB-connected drives would work perfectly, would come up when a quorum was reached, and would behave correctly when only a varying subset of disks is available. Bonus points for also being able to run an array that spans multiple computers efficiently, but that would just be icing on the cake. reply dale_glass 9 hours agoparent> The results vary between annoying (need to restore / “resilver” and have no redundancy until it’s done; massively increased risk of data loss while doing so due to heavy IO load without redundancy and pointless loss of the redundancy that already exists) to catastrophic (outright corruption). I'm not sure what you expect? RAID1 is a simple data copy, you made sure to make both disks contain different data. So there's two outcomes possible: either the system notices this and copies A to B or B to A to reestablish the redundancy, or it fails to notice and you get corruption. Linux MD allows for partial sync with the bitmap. If the system knows something in the first 5% of the disk changed, it can limit itself to only syncing that 5%. > Yet most competent active-active database systems have no problems with this scenario!

From what I remember (could be wrong about the precise details), they actually run mdadm on top of btrfs, and use mdadm in order to get the erasure coding and possibly the cache NVME disk too.

Just out of curiosity: is there a specific reason you're not using plain-vanilla filesystems which _are_ stable? Personal anecdote: i've only ever had serious corruption twice, 20-ish years ago, once with XFS and once with ReiserFS, and have primarily used the extN family of filesystems for most of the past 30 years. A filesystem only has to go corrupt on me once before i stop using it. Edit to add a caveat: though i find the ideas behind ZFS, btrfs, etc., fascinating, i have no personal need for them so have never used them on personal systems (but did use ZFS on corporate Solaris systems many years ago). ext4 has always served me well, and comes with none of the caveats i regularly read about for any of the more advanced filesystems. Similarly, i've never needed an LVM or any such complexity. As the age-old wisdom goes, \"complexity is your enemy,\" and keeping to simple filesystem setups has always served my personal systems/LAN well. i've also never once seen someone recover from filesystem corruption in a RAID environment by simply swapping out a disk (there's always been much more work involved), so i've never bought into the \"RAID is the solution\" camp. reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparent> Just out of curiosity: is there a specific reason you're not using plain-vanilla filesystems which _are_ stable?

I wouldn't recommend it professionally, but I can see the joy in using something unusual on a personal system. Keep backups of anything you really can't afford to lose.

If the file isn't in source control, a backup, or auto-synced cloud storage, it can't be _that_ important.

Shrug. reply remexre 1 hour agorootparentZFS is the mechanism by which I implement local (via snapshots) and remote (via zfs send) backups on my user-facing machines. - It can do 4x 15-minute snapshots, 24x hourly snapshots, 7x daily snapshots, 4x weekly snapshots, and 12x monthly snapshots, without making 51 copies of my files. - Taking a snapshot has imperceptible performance impact. - Snapshots are taken atomically. - Snapshots can be booted from, if it's a system that's screwed up and not just one file. - Snapshots can be accessed without disturbing the FS. In my experience it hasn't required more hand-holding than ext4 past the initial install, but the OSes that most of my devices use either officially support ZFS or don't use package managers that will blindly upgrade a kernel past what out-of-tree modules I'm using will support, which I think fixes the most common issue people have with ZFS. reply tuetuopay 6 hours agorootparentprevFunny because I have the opposite experience. The main issue with btrfs is a lack of tooling for the layperson to not require btrfs-developer level knowledge to fix issues. I've personally had drive failures, fs corruptions due to power loss (which is supposed not to happen on a cow filesystem), fs and file corruption due to ram bitflips, etc. All the times btrfs handled the situation perfectly, with the caveat that I needed the help from the btrfs developers. And they were very helpful! So yeah, btrfs has a bad rep, but it is not as bad as the common feeling makes it look like. (note that I still run btrfs raid 1, as I did not find real return of experience regarding raid 5 or 6) reply cpuguy83 6 hours agorootparentfs corruption due to power loss happens on ext4 because the default settings only journal metadata for performance.

For a small and cheap setup, this is perfect since a broken disk can be replaced with a bigger one and immediately (part of) the extra new disk space can be used. Other filesystems seem to only increase the size once all disks have been replaced with a bigger capacity one (last time I checked this was still the case for ZFS) reply jiripospisil 10 hours agorootparentExactly. Provisioning a completely different set of disks when running out of capacity might be fine for a company but not for home office. reply kevincox 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, BTRFS is really not good for any sort of redundancy, not even very good for multi-disk in general. 1. The scheduler doesn't really exist. IIRC it is PID % num disks. 2. The default balancing policy is super basic. (IIRC always write to the disk with the most free space). 3. Erasure coding is still experimental. 4. Replication can only be configured at the FS level. bcachefs can configure this per-file or per-directory. bcachefs is still early but it shows that it is serious about multi-disk. You can lump any collection of disks together and it mostly does the right thing. It tracks performance of different drives to make requests optimally and balances write to gradually even out the drives (not lasering a newly added disk). IMHO there is really no comparison. If it wasn't for the fact that bcachefs ate my data I would be using it. reply e12e 8 hours agorootparentprevHow does that work? You have two 100gb drives in raid1, 80% full, you replace one with a 200gb disk and write 50gb to the array - how is your 130gb of data protected against either drive failing? reply dspillett 7 hours agorootparentI don't know the ins-and-outs of btrfs in detail, but having dug into other systems that offer redundancy-over-uneven-device-sizes and assuming btrfs is at least similar: with your two drive example you won't be able to write another 50gb to that array. For two devices, 1x redundancy (so 2x copies of everything) will always limit your storage to the size of the smaller device otherwise it is not possible to have two copies of everything you need to store. As soon as you add a third device of at leats 100gb (or replace the 100gb device with one at least 200gb) the other 100gb of your second device will immediately come into play. Uneven device size support is most useful when: ♯ You have three or more devices, or plan to grow onto three or more from an initial pair. ♯ You want flexibility rwt array growth (support for uneven devices usually (but not always) comes with better support for dynamic array reshaping). ♯ You want better quick repair flexibility: if 4Tb drive fails, you can replace it with 2x2Tb if you don't have a working 4Tb unit on-hand. ♯ You want variable redundancy (support for uneven devices sometimes comes with support for variable redundancy: keeping 3+ copies of important data, or data you want to access fastest via striping of reads, 2 copies of other permanent data, and 1 copy of temporary storage, all in the same array). In this instance the “wasted” part of the 200gb drive in your example could be used for scratch data designated as not needing to be stored with redundancy. reply rubenbe 7 hours agorootparentprevIt only works with 3+ disks. All data needs to be on two disks. e.g. you have 3 100GB drives, total capacity in raid 1 is 150GB. If you replace a broken one with a 200GB one, the total capacity will be increased to 200GB. reply assbuttbuttass 6 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that RAID1 is just a mirror, and all disks have identical contents. Are you talking about something else? reply tuetuopay 6 hours agorootparentTraditional RAID1 will mirror whole drives, yes. BTRFS RAID1 will mirror chunks of data (iirc 1GB) on two drives. So you can have e.g. two 1TB drive and a 2TB one just fine. reply magicalhippo 2 hours agorootparentYou can do this with ZFS, you just have to do it manually, ie by partitioning up the disks in say 100GB or 1TB partitions, then construct vdevs using these partitions. You can then extend the pool by adding more such partition-based vdevs as you replace disks, just add the new partitions and add new vdevs. So if you have a 1TB disk, a 2TB disk and a 4 TB disk, you could have mirrors (d1p1,d3p1), (d2p1,d3p2), (d2p2,d3p3) with a total of 3TB mirrored, and 1 TB available. If you swap the 1TB for a 2TB disk, partition it, replacing the old d1p1 partition with the new and resilver, and once that's done you can add the mirror (d1p2,d3p4) and get the full 4TB redundant storage. Not a great solution though, as it requires a lot of manual work, and especially write performance will suffer because ZFS will treat the vdevs as being separate and issue IOs in parallel to them, overloading the underlying devices. reply assbuttbuttass 5 hours agorootparentprevThanks, that makes sense.

Something that takes a long time to be declared stable/reliable because of its complexity, needs to spend a long time after that declaration without significant issues before I'll actually trust it. Things like btrfs definitely live in this category. bcachefs even won't be something I use for important storage until it has been battle-tested a bit more for a bit longer, though at this point it is much more likely to take over from my current simple ext4-on-RAID arrangement (and when/if it does, my backups might stay on ext4-on-RAID even longer). reply humanfromearth9 10 hours agorootparentprevI think it's not quite so simple. The problem of organising storage is at least complex, on a scale of \"simple complicated complex chaotic\". The inherent complexity might be impossible to reduce to something simple or even just complicated, except _maybe_ with layering (à la LVM2), each layer tackling one issue independently of the others. But then it's probably at the cost of performance and other efficiency. Each layer should work such that it does not interfere too much with the performance of other layers. Not easy. Given the rather cheap price of durable storage these days, I would favour rock solid, high quality code for storing my data, at the expense of some optimisations. Then again, I still like RAID, instantaneous snapshots, COW, encryption, xattr, resizable partitions, CRC...

Plus all the reports and personal experiences of getting and trying to recover exotically shaped bricks when volume fills to 100% (which could happen at any time with btrfs). Is it all good now? Where can I read about btrfs behaving robustly when no free space is left? reply linsomniac 5 hours agoparentprevIt's not simply that it took a long time to become stable; it's that during this time where it was unstable a lot of people got exposed to btrfs by having it lose data. Personally, I was one of those people. Very excited about the prospects of btrfs, switched several machines over to it to test, ended up with filesystem corruption and had to revert to ext. Now, whenever I peek at btrfs, I never see anything that's compelling over running ZFS, which I've run for close to 15+ years, and run hard, and have never had data loss. Even in the early days with zfs+fuse, where I could regularly crash the zfs fuse; the zfs+fuse developers quickly addressed every crash I ran into, once I put together a stress test. reply GrayShade 10 hours agoparentprevOne interesting titbit I've only recently found out is that btrfs can't really serve reads from different drives in RAID1, it picks a drive based on the process id.

I think the point of raid1 is to minimize downtime when losing a device and if you lose the other device before returning it to good state, that's 100% on you. - Poor management tools compared to md (though bcachefs might be in the same boat). Some tools are poorly thought, e.g. there is a tool for defragmentation, but it undoes sharing (so snapshots and dedupped files get expanded). - If a drive in raid1 drops but then later comes back, btrfs is still quite happy. - Need of using btrfs balance, and in a certain way as well: https://github.com/kdave/btrfsmaintenance/blob/master/btrfs-... . - At least it used to be difficult to recover when your filesystem becomes full. Helps if you have it on LVM volume with extra space. - Snapshotting or having a clone of a btrfs volume is dangerous (due to the uuid-based volume participant scanning) - I believe raid5/6 is still experimental? - I've lost a filesystem to btrfs raid10 (but my backups are good). - I have also rendered my bcachefs in a state where I could no longer write to the filesystem, but I was still able to read it. So I'm inclined to keep using bcachefs for the time being. Overall I just have the impression that btrfs was complicated and ended up in a design dead-end, making improvements from hard to difficult, and I hope that bcachefs has made different base designs, making future improvements easier. Yes, the number of developers for bcachefs is smaller, but frankly as long as it's possible for a project to advance with a single developer, it is going to be the most effective way to go—at the same time I hope this situation improves in the future. reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparent> I never agreed with the btrfs default of root raid 1 system not booting up if a device is missing.

Indeed, I believe this is the default operation of all other multi-device systems, but of course I cannot verify this claim. I dislike all features that by default prevent from booting my system up. The annoying part of this is that if you do reboot the system, it will never end up responding to a ping, meaning you need to visit the host yourself. In practice it might even have other drives you could configure remotely to replace the broken device.

Not doing so is especially upsetting when you discover you forgot to flip the setting only when a drive fails with the machine in question several hours' drive away (standalone remote servers like that tend not to have console access). I think 'refusing to boot' is probably the right default for a workstation, but on the whole I think I'd prefer that to be a default set by the workstation distro installer rather than the filesystem. reply cesarb 8 hours agorootparentprev> and the device not booting means you'll actually notice and take action. How often do people reboot their systems? IMO, if it's running (without going into \"read-only filesystem\" mode) with X disks, it should boot with the same X disks.

Among the large Linux distributions, ZFS is only really supported by Ubuntu, and even that is on the level \"Canonical lawyers reviewed this and believe they're safe\". If the unmentionable company ever goes to court against them, you're in hot water. You'll have to migrate to FreeBSD or support yourself by building dkms modules. So you're taking a non-zero risk by adopting ZFS. If you're really conservative with these things, as some of us are, you currently don't really have a single safe COW pick.

So you're taking a non-zero risk by adopting ZFS. DKMS works fine. And you can also take the NixOS approach where it's not built into the kernel but the system will never actually install a new kernel unless ZFS is supported on it and successfully builds for it. I agree that it's still not ideal, though. I hope bcachefs thrives and takes a place of pride in the Linux world! reply _flux 10 hours agoparentprevThe key difference is that we don't need to agree on a certain FS, whereas the reason for standards is interoperability.

    "originBody": "MAJOR RELEASES, RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENTS Zulip 9.0: Organized chat for distributed teams Tim Abbott Jul 25, 2024 • 15 min read We’re excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 9.0, containing hundreds of new features and bug fixes! Zulip is an open-source team chat application designed for seamless remote and hybrid work. With conversations organized by topic, Zulip is ideal for both live and asynchronous communication. Zulip’s 100% open-source software is available as a cloud service or a self-hosted solution, and is used by thousands of organizations around the world. Zulip Server 9.0 is a major release, with over 5,300 new commits merged across the project since the 8.0 release in December 2023. Notable new features include a UI redesign with larger font size and line spacing, major improvements for composing messages, and much more! A total of 124 people contributed commits to Zulip since the 8.0 release, bringing the project to over 1,450 code contributors. Zulip is remarkable for its number of major contributors, with 89 people who’ve contributed 100+ commits. Huge thanks to everyone who’s contributed to Zulip over the last several months, whether by writing code and documentation, reporting issues, translating, supporting us financially, participating in discussions in the Zulip development community, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community. Project highlights Today marks a release of the Zulip server and web application. We’d also like to share news and updates for the project as a whole since the 8.0 release last December: Apps We’ve been hard at work on Zulip’s next-generation mobile app for Android and iOS, built with Flutter. Users can look forward to redesigned apps and a faster, smoother experience. We published a first community beta release last December, and have made 9 more releases since then, packed with features. There are over 1,700 commits in the latest release, and progress has been accelerating, with another full-time developer and three Google Summer of Code participants joining our mobile team this summer. Later this year, we’ll announce a public beta here on the Zulip blog, so that you can try it out and see the new smoother experience for yourself. In the months after that, we’ll roll out the new app for everyone as the next version of the official Zulip mobile apps on both iOS and Android. Meanwhile, we’ve continued updating the existing mobile apps for key Zulip Server 9.0 features you’ll read about below, as well as fixing selected bugs. Zulip Terminal features new since last December include easy-to-read themes when using a transparent terminal, improved in-app help, the ability to compose and edit messages in external editors, and a prompt to avoid accidentally closing — and losing — the message you are composing. Reviews An in-depth review of Zulip on HostingAdvice.com described it as “an excellent solution for teams collaborating across different time zones.” Zulip was recognized as a GetApp 2024 category leader for team communication. Huge thanks to our users for sharing their feedback and helping others find us! Customer stories In a new case study, the folks at GUT contact shared how they use Zulip to manage 1,000 employees spread across 3 countries. They love how easy it’s been to self-host the software and onboard their team. “Zulip was quite easy to set up, and worked instantly. 1,000 people — no problem.” — Erik Dittert, Head of IT at GUT contact In another new case study, the InsurTech startup Semsee shared how Zulip has created breathing room for focused work and different work schedules for their distributed team. “I don’t like going back to Slack now. It’s just not as efficient a way to organize communication.” — James van Lommel, Director of Engineering at Semsee The Lean Prover community has kicked off a multi-year collaboration on Zulip to formalize a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. We wish them the best of luck! “The project will be run on the FLT channel on the Lean Zulip chat, a high-powered research forum where mathematicians and computer scientists can collaborate in real time, effortlessly posting code and mathematics using a thread and channel system which admirably handles the task of enabling many independent conversations to happen simultaneously.” — Kevin Buzzard, announcing The Fermat’s Last Theorem Project If using Zulip is making a difference for your organization, we’d love to hear about it! Mentorship Our community is fully committed to helping bring up the next generation of open-source contributors. 2024 is the ninth consecutive year that Zulip is participating in Google Summer of Code. Our 17 GSoC 2024 participants have contributed to many of the features described in this post! “The mentorship I’ve received here is unparalleled in my life, it’s the best I’ve ever had.” — Niloth, Google Summer of Code 2024 participant Sponsorships We proudly sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for more than 1,500 open-source projects, non-profits, educational institutions, and academic research groups. All eligible organizations are encouraged to join this program, or sign up for the Community plan for self-hosted organizations. “We are a public university that offers free education to 33,000 students across 13 cities in Brazil. We started using Zulip in early 2020, and it works perfectly for our needs. Zulip’s interface is simple and intuitive.” — Rafael Cordeiro, head of IT at UTFPR “As a research consortium spread across 14 locations in Germany, we use Zulip to communicate with each other in a low-threshold manner, without the overhead of email. Even with more than 200 users across different institutions, Zulip’s model of topic-labeled conversations makes it easy for our team members to keep up-to-date on what’s relevant, and work productively together.” — Christina Schüttler, IT department Team Lead at University Hospital Erlangen Release highlights This section gives an overview of the major features and improvements in Zulip Server 9.0. Alongside the major changes, this release contains hundreds of refinements beyond what can be described here. We believe that getting the little details right makes a big difference in a product that’s so central to people’s daily work. To make Zulip a joy to use, we relentlessly fine-tune the user experience, and consider it a priority to investigate and fix even minor bugs. “Streams” renamed to “channels” To better match terminology familiar from other apps, “streams” have been renamed to “channels” across the app in this release. The functionality remains exactly the same, and integrations do not need to be updated for this transition. In-app feature announcements To make it easier to discover what’s new in Zulip, important product changes are now announced via automated messages. These messages are sent to a “Zulip updates” topic in a channel selected by organization administrators. Users can read the announcements when it’s convenient, and chat about them in the same topic. On self-hosted servers, these configurable notices are shipped with the Zulip server version that includes the new feature. Improved reading experience To make reading more comfortable, Zulip has been redesigned with a larger font size and line spacing. Because personal preferences vary, the previous design remains available via the compact mode setting, and we plan to offer flexible controls for font size and line spacing in the next major release. For a more focused reading experience, you can now hide the left and right sidebars even in a full-size window. When the left sidebar is hidden, keyboard navigation lets you jump to the next unread topic or to your home view. The right sidebar has been redesigned to highlight users in the current channel or direct-message conversation. Messages and topic names now load much faster when you open the web or desktop app. Improved experience for composing messages The compose box has been redesigned, with a cleaner, more modern look. When you start composing, the most recently edited draft for the conversation you are composing to now automatically appears in the compose box. You can always save a draft for later and start a new message. When you paste content into the compose box, Zulip will now do its best to preserve the formatting, including links, bulleted lists, bold, italics, and more. If you don’t need the formatting, you can undo it with Ctrl+Z, or paste as plain text. Pasted channel and topic link URLs are now automatically converted into nicely formatted links. To quote and reply to part of a message, you can now select the part that you want to quote. You can now scroll down in all typeahead menus to see more matches for what you’ve typed so far. More natural navigation For clarity and consistency, three key message views that show multiple conversations at once are now labeled “Combined feed” (previously “All messages”), “Channel feed”, and “Direct message feed”. To make it easier to read your messages topic-by-topic, channel links in the left sidebar now take you directly to the top topic in the channel. You can configure them to go to the channel feed instead (previously the only option). When you send a message to a conversation that you’re not viewing, Zulip now jumps you to that conversation, unless configured otherwise. New and improved ways to find messages The main search has been redesigned with pills for search filters, making it easier to use. You can use the new Reactions view to see how others have responded to your messages with emoji reactions. You can also search all messages with reactions. You can now search for messages in topics you follow, or see a feed of all messages (or just unread messages) in your followed topics. You can now filter direct message conversations in the left sidebar to show conversations that include a specific person. Easier user onboarding Zulip’s onboarding experience has been redesigned to introduce core Zulip concepts when they first become relevant. One-time modals now introduce the Inbox and Recent conversations views. Permanently dismissable banners explain complex situations, such as composing a message while viewing a different conversation, when they come up. To introduce starred messages, your mentions, and other views, we added descriptions in the bar at the top, and to the message area when the view is empty. Introductory messages have been rewritten to better explain how conversations labeled with topics work in Zulip, including how to reply to an existing thread, start a new conversation, and move messages if they are out of place. To make intro messages easier to find, they are now starred and marked as unread for new users. Design and usability improvements All the menus have been restyled, with a cleaner look, better icons, and improved screen reader accessibility. Also, you can now switch themes directly from your personal menu. You can now configure how previews of animated images show the animation (always, when you hover over them, or never). To better show key information, desktop and mobile notifications now abbreviate quoted content. The message edit history view has been redesigned for visual consistency and ease of use. If you’d prefer not to see notifications when others type, you can now disable them. Keyboard shortcuts A new Alt+P keyboard shortcut lets you toggle between edit mode and preview mode when composing or editing a message. A new Shift+V keyboard shortcut offers quick access to read receipts. Improved user management A new combined user settings panel lets you manage users, deactivated users, and invitations in one place. You can now filter the list of users in your organization by role. Profile pictures are now shown alongside user names in settings, making it easier to identify people at a glance. You can click on a name to open the user’s card. You now have a lot of flexibility for configuring direct message permissions in your organization, with new settings for who can authorize and start direct message conversations. These settings are designed so that users can always respond to a direct message they’ve received. You can now mark a custom profile field as required, to prompt everyone to fill it out. You can require users to choose unique names in your organization. When inviting users, you can now decide whether to receive a direct message when the invited user joins your organization. An updated design makes the UI for inviting new users easier to use. You can now link to a user’s profile, to share it with someone else. Improved channel administration Creating a channel is now a smoother experience: Adding subscribers is now a separate step from configuring channel settings. Advanced settings are collapsed by default. When you create a channel, you are now taken directly there if you are a subscriber. Channel settings now show additional details, including when the channel was created. Integrations There is now a convenient UI for configuring custom event filters for an integration. Documentation for over 60 integrations has been updated with simplified instructions. There are new integrations for Patreon and GitHub Sponsors, and the GitHub and Grafana integrations have been improved. We made extensive additions to Zulip’s API documentation, including handy navigation for real-time push event formats, articles on important concepts like thumbnailing, and new documentation for about a dozen previously documented API endpoints. Server This release adds support for Ubuntu 24.04, and drops support for Ubuntu 20.04. The Zulip server now serves thumbnails of uploaded images for previews in the message feed, greatly reducing bandwidth usage for most Zulip installations. Images now load much faster for users in all Zulip apps. The Zulip server has always scaled well, but this release comes with several further efficiency improvements, which will make a big difference for organizations with thousands of user accounts. Internationalization Our community translators have been hard at work keeping up with the product as it evolves. This release features translations that cover the majority of non-error strings in 25 languages, including Gujarati for the first time. Upgrading We highly recommend upgrading to Zulip Server 9.0 to take advantage of the hundreds of improvements in this release and future security updates. We work hard to ensure that upgrades are smooth; you can upgrade by following the straightforward upgrade instructions. The upgrade notes section of the changelog details changes you’ll want to understand before upgrading. Commercial support for server upgrades is available for installations that purchase a Business or Enterprise plan. For community support, everyone is welcome to drop by the Zulip development community. Zulip Cloud is always up to date with the latest Zulip improvements. Product roadmap We’re continuing to focus on improving the design of the Zulip web app, and shipping next-generation mobile apps for Android and iOS. We use project boards to publicly track goals for major server and mobile releases. These boards are updated on an ongoing basis as priorities evolve, and many community improvements integrated into Zulip are never specifically tracked as release goals. Release schedule This release is coming out about seven months after the Zulip Server 8.0 release last December. We are targeting a shorter interval for the next major release, which is expected in late 2024. Community If you appreciate Zulip, please recommend it to someone you know, for work or any other collaborative endeavor. If they say that Zulip won’t work for them, let us know why! You can email feedback@zulip.com, or post in the #feedback channel in the Zulip development community. Feedback from current and potential users is a vital part of how we design and prioritize improvements to Zulip.

    "commentBody": "Zulip 9.0: Organized chat for distributed teams (zulip.com)133 points by Tomte 13 hours agohidepastfavorite77 comments scoopr 12 hours agoI just recently started up zulip after a long break, to check some particular community discussions. Before it had felt a bit hacky/nerdy. But now, I was pleasantly surprised. The app and the service feels really fast and to the point, and I think it looks OK to. But also that jumping in to random community, and browsing through it made sense to me, I was able to read discussions that kinda seemed interesting and skip the rest, with pretty good confidence! Contrasting to say Discord, where I'm always overwhelmed by the number of channels in big communities, with very little way to efficiently check \"whats going on lately\", without just browsing through. (I'm sure sizes of communities matters here though) Or Matrix, where everything just seems so slow and janky. Though I think it is trying to solve a harder problem being so distributed. It has real potential bringing related communities closer by having a well curated spaces that organise them neatly. reply danpalmer 12 hours agoparentIt sounds like Zulip is optimising for productivity (and I've read similar from the team in the past), where Discord and Matrix certainly aren't. Matrix is optimising for security/privacy at the cost of UX in other ways, and I get why. Discord is an interesting one, as I think they're optimising for communities – moderation, having distinctive \"servers\" with their own personalities but within one \"service\". In many ways Discord is trying to replace phpBB, and no one ran internal company comms on phpBB (I hope). What's interesting to me is that many new companies are choosing Discord despite it clearly not being designed for internal company comms. I suspect some choose it on the basis of being \"open source\" companies who are trying to grow a community using their stuff, but I'm not sure how true that is in practice for most. I suspect the real reason is that most of these people starting companies already hang out in a bunch of Discord servers in their personal lives, and so there's a (small) network effect and they just default to Discord for their professional lives. reply sph 11 hours agorootparent> Discord is an interesting one, as I think they're optimising for communities Are they? It seems to me, with their desperate focus on monetisation and gaming (didn't they try to build their app store?) that all their focus is to optimise for \"engagement\" and keep \"gamers\" using their platform 24/7 Discord has become like many companies in the space a behemoth that has conquered a niche with a decent product and now are looking to extract as much revenue from each free user. What is the last genuinely killer or novel feature that Discord has released? How are they trying to make online communities better? They are just making their silo prettier and hoping you are interested in animated emojis to make bank. Companies like Discord are lucky open-source projects do not have any high-level coordination, but operate like headless chickens, because Discord isn't doing anything that is technologically ground breaking by any stretch and are around \"solely\" because of network effects. reply danpalmer 11 hours agorootparentI guess I'm trying to give them a charitable viewpoint. Discord is far more community focused than, say, Slack. You're right that they do seem to be going all in on monetisation now, but I see that less on the few open source project Discord servers I'm on. reply ksynwa 11 hours agorootparentprev> They are just making their silo prettier and hoping you are interested in animated emojis to make bank. You can now buy animated frames for your profile picture for 10 USD. reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentprev> Discord isn't doing anything that is technologically ground breaking by any stretch and are around \"solely\" because of network effects. Discord is handling identity management and anti-spam. Both of those are a gigantic PITA. Until open source gets a good answer for both of those problems, the federated solutions will always be also-rans. reply 3np 7 hours agorootparentprev> Matrix is optimising for security/privacy at the cost of UX in other ways, and I get why. I wouldn't say so. Have you used Element Messenger? The default trust policy is certainly optimised for something else. Similarly to default and encouraged synapse configuration. Not saying it's the wrong tradeoff but Matrix/Element are certainly not fundamentally putting privacy above their other goals. reply agumonkey 11 hours agoparentprevI don't understand how discord dev don't know about the multitasking hell they allow. reply tjoff 12 hours agoprevZulip had flown under the radar for me, looks interesting but the pricing makes me a bit sad. We are a small team, but would probably need like 11 accounts so with self-hosting that puts up us to just about $40 a month only for the sake of getting mobile notifications. In practice most people won't be on their phones but notifications are still required for off-hours or on-the-move communications. But very low volume, like at current pricing maybe $0.5 per notification that wouldn't have been served by a desktop client. I get it, it is a way to support development. But why does it always have to be per user? And why not keep first 10 users free, so that 11 users only pays for 1 user, 12 for 2 etc. That would mean a lot for small teams, and reflect value a ton better. I guess with every service having a free tier means there truly can't exist a cheap offering. And the minute you go over any of the arbitrary limits you need to suddenly pay a lot. Apparently notifications was completely free until December of last year. From completely free to $3.5 per user. It just feels weird (not saying free is sustainable, but $3.5 per user is a pretty arbitrary number). Sorry, this rant isn't really targeted towards Zulip, but the entire industry that somehow converged on pretty much the same terms. reply 112233 3 hours agoparentInstead of native push notifications, just configure email: https://zulip.com/help/using-zulip-via-email You get to reuse already existing filtering and what not, and everyone can keep using their email client reply nrr 11 hours agoparentprevI suspect that the cost for push notifications might have to do with the costs imposed by Apple and Google for their respective OSes' notifications backends, but don't quote me on that. The $3.5/user/month smells like a way to recoup that kind of cost without making it overly burdensome for folks within one standard deviation of the mean. That said, it appears that XMPP might be workable here: eJabberd is still actively maintained, and there are mobile clients (namely, Monal for iOS and Conversations for Android) that appear to support push notifications. Given your talk of self-hosting, I feel comfortable recommending something that requires some degree of system administration investment. reply cvwright 6 hours agorootparentI don’t think Apple charges for APNS do they? I have 500-600 users on my app and have never paid. Maybe it’s different at scale? reply cl3misch 11 hours agoparentprevI feel you. On the other hand, paying $40 a month for 11 people to efficiently communicate doesn't sound that much actually? reply cvwright 7 hours agorootparentAlso, that’s about half of what you’d pay for 11 users on most other group chat services. From what I can tell, the average is about $8/user/month. And no, I don’t understand it. For my former employer, a large public university, these services would cost about $240k/month before any special discounts. For that price you could hire a whole team to build and run your own product. Make it make sense. reply tjoff 11 hours agorootparentprevEvery single service is per user and it adds up. Communications are essential, but there doesn't have to be much to it either. Most communications are 1-1 anyway. We could do everything by SMS and email I guess, it is just not built for that. As a company grows it becomes the backbone but right now I might was well yell out the corridor. Only partially joking. reply dijit 11 hours agoparentprevMobile notifications are almost an antipattern, especially with the Zulip mobile app being what it is. Definitely try it out without bearing the mobile experience any mind. reply stavros 11 hours agoparentprevI know what you mean, but I'm happier paying for one specific feature that I know costs them than for an arbitrary tier, although the latter is fine too (they have to make money). Generally, Zulip is one of those tools that I'm happy to pay for even if I don't need any of the non-free features. At $40/mo, it's worth it for the multiples of time it'll save you. Definitely try it. reply singhrac 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe they need purchasing power parity adjustment for those outside the US? $3.5/user/month seems lowish compared to peers in the US, though I agree with what you’re saying about how to charge at 10+ users (that is a nice business model that keeps your free tier alive while not changing the economics of the enterprise at all). reply aembleton 3 hours agoparentprevHave you tried Mattermost?

It is like the olden days, where piracy of Photoshop didn't put a dent in Adobe. They got free advertising and everyone grew up learning their product. But since you could get the \"best\" tool for free that meant you wouldn't pay for a cheap alternative (that actually had you as their target group), completely killing an entire section of applications - they were the true victims of piracy. I feel like that is happening with these kinds of tools. Slack et al do have free options that are completely obliterating the hope to target businesses that don't need as much. 99.9% of all the features you are paying for is pure bloat. It costs money to develop and I get that, but then I don't want it either. reply meiraleal 7 hours agorootparentThere are too many things you don't wanna buy, it will really take a lot of your time if you go out of your way to tell people you don't wanna spend money on what they have worked.

So at the cost of self hosting and management and storage and administration i am only getting a discount of $3.33? again, why bother at this point? reply cvwright 6 hours agorootparentThese prices make sense when you consider that the bulk of the cost of providing Zulip to you is not the cost of the compute and storage and bandwidth - those are fairly minimal. It’s the cost of the developers who fix bugs and keep the product moving forward. Those cost a lot more, and you need them regardless of where your instance is hosted. reply dijit 11 hours agorootparentprevActually since push notifications for an app are centralised: there is a hosting cost for the app maintainer. There was a blog article from Zulip explaining this. https://blog.zulip.com/2023/12/19/self-hosting-without-comme...

Unfortunately, the limitation of push notifications to 10 members puts it into the B- category of self-hosted OSS for me. I understand that costs do exist by providing a push service, but forcing Orgs into the same plan as everyone else kind of feels like it's an intentionally set boundary to lurk people in and then force them to go all-in. I'd much rather see another tier that only includes the cost for push notifications. reply jonrosner 5 hours agoparentE: just checked and they did update their pricing to be 3,50 now for the unlimited push.

Although \"$X per month, billed annually\" has become a popular and socially acceptable way to be deceptive, it's still deceptive. There are few better ways I can think of to signal that you'd happily lie about a bunch of other stuff if it meant making slightly more money for yourself and you could continue to get by in polite society (limiting yourself to the same deceits that everyone else is engaging in). reply stavros 11 hours agoparentI made a service (https://imgz.org) and showed the pricing as \"$5/year\".

Maybe providing also year-long pricing examples of both would be even more helpful. reply cxr 3 hours agorootparentGrocery stores figured this out years ago. It's by giving that secondary number a subordinate position on the price tag. Not by redesigning the price tag to list the actual options in a misleading way (and then making the customer do even more arithmetic—not less—in order to answer the question, \"How much is this going to cost me TODAY?\") No one who is doing the \"$X per month, billed annually\" is doing it because they're trying to make it easiest for the customer. They're doing it because lower numbers on the price tag makes for more sales. reply airpoint 12 hours agoprevThey keep announcing \"design improvements\" but whenever I check all I see is an ugly, dated UI I just can't consider serious.

That said, I rather liked what Thunderbird and JetBrains did - let the user choose not only the fonts and stuff like that, but also the UI density that they want. reply price 1 hour agorootparentThat is in fact one of the new features in this 9.0 release! There's a new less-dense default, and the previous dense layout remains an option (which for myself I immediately turned on). We're also planning to give a wider array of options in an upcoming release, including independently setting the line-height and the font size. It's a lot of work to get even two options to both have a reasonable layout throughout the UI, though (among other things, it involved changing a lot of hardcoded values in px to be in relative units), which is why only the two-way switch made it into this week's release. reply zelphirkalt 9 hours agoparentprevAll alternative products I have used so far have worse UI. Slack is always laggy and does not even handle markdown well. Recently moved around buttons for huddles and people keep searching for where that button is. Also annoying, that pictures can only be attached to the end of a message, forcing me to reference with something like [1][2] and so on. MS Teams: haha just joking. Of course it cannot even be considered close to an alternative! Discord: Was good some time ago, becomes ever more bloated and heavy now. Element: When I tried it some time ago, it was very unclear how threads actually work and they did not seem to have any visual separation from other messages, that simply came later in a channel. Basically messages know they belong to a thread, but visually you almost cannot see it. Not sure, if that is still the case. Zulip is snappy and works well with markdown.

I get the impression Google has more people working on Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform. reply price 12 hours agoparentOne of the things that's made us at Zulip very happy with Flutter is that it's an honest-to-goodness functioning open-source project. The issue tracker is out in the open, as are the PRs and code reviews. You can (and we did) show up with bug reports and someone whose job is to develop Flutter will read it and make a cogent reply. And getting a change merged in Flutter is however easy or hard it is to do the change well, but no harder — the codebase is high-quality, and the maintainers are responsive. It's at quite a high percentile among all the open-source projects I've interacted with. I don't know much about Kotlin Multiplatform or Compose Multiplatform. But from what I've seen, the Android group in general doesn't live up to that high standard as an open-source project. You can report bugs and might get a reply, but can't really participate in the discussion; the public bug often gets linked to a bunch of internal bugs you can't see, and the code reviews for any fix happen in private. (I lead the Zulip mobile team, so the decision to use Flutter was primarily mine.) reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentI hope it works out well for you, at my company we made the decision to go with native because we were afraid of hitting a ceiling with non-native solutions, but I love Zulip and I hope your decision pays off. reply dzonga 8 hours agorootparentprevflutter is a complete game changer.

    "originBody": "Software Switzerland mandates government agencies use open-source software News By Jeff Butts published 2 days ago The new law requires the use of open-source software and the publishing of new government code under open-source licenses Comments (5) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Shutterstock) Switzerland has recently enacted a law requiring its government to use open-source software (OSS) and disclose the source code of any software developed by or for the public sector. According to ZDNet, this “public body, public code” approach makes government operations more transparent while increasing security and efficiency. Such a move would likely fail in the U.S. but is becoming increasingly common throughout Europe. According to Switzerland’s new “Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks” (EMBAG), government agencies must use open-source software throughout the public sector. It’s not an entirely new move for Switzerland. In 2011, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court published its court application, Open Justitia, using an OSS license. It was unpopular with legal software company Weblaw, and more than a decade of political and legal battles followed. The new law allows the codifies allowing Switzerland to release its software under OSS licenses. Not just that; it requires the source code be released that way “unless the rights of third parties or security-related reasons would exclude or restrict this.” In addition to mandating the OSS code, EMBAG also requires Swiss government agencies to release non-personal and non-security-sensitive government data to the public. Calling this Open Government Data, this aspect of the new law contributes to a dual “open by default” approach that should allow for easier reuse of software and data while also making governance more transparent. Other nations throughout Europe have made similar moves. France’s version of the U.S. FBI, known as the National Gendarmerie, uses Linux on most PCs. Schleswig-Holstein, one of Germany’s 16 states, recently migrated 30,000 computers from Microsoft products to Linux and LibreOffice. The European Union has also worked for years to help OSS become more secure through the Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA) project. At the same time, there could be some cause for concern about the future of OSS in Europe — there are concerns the European Commission might cut funding for an essential source of financing for OSS projects.

In the U.S., however, there’s much less support for OSS. The U.S. government does offer some support for open-source, but it’s much more constrained. For example, the Federal Source Code Policy requires government agencies to release at least 20% of their new custom-developed code as OSS. Also, the General Services Administration (GSA) requires its organizations to account for and publish any of their open-source code. The critical difference, though, is that no laws in the U.S. mandate the use of open-source software like Switzerland’s. If Switzerland’s new openness works well, it could be a model for further change throughout the rest of Europe and the United States.

Reply bit_user The article said: it requires the source code be released that way “unless the rights of third parties or security-related reasons would exclude or restrict this.” Well, that's a potentially large exception. In such cases, what they could theoretically do is have the vendor put the source code in escrow. Then, have whomever the 3rd party is that's holding it do the actual compilation. This would ensure the government is using the actual version for which the source code is stored. You could also define a set of circumstances in which designated individuals can gain limited access to the source code. Reply Co BIY Interesting ideas. How to get people to invest in the developmental effort without the financial backing. Especially in a highly competitive and high demand area like technology.

I don't understand why other governments don't follow suit, or why people are opposed to it. There might be some valid cons about requiring the use of FOSS (e.g. LibreOffice vs MS Office), but the part about requiring government sponsored code to be released as open source is clearly good for governments. Having the code freely open is good leverage against greed and good insurance for vendor failures. reply baq 21 hours agoparentThere’s no workable Excel alternative, FOSS, OSS or paid.

Open source software means they aren't locked into a single vendor and can hire anybody they wish (including their own internal developers) to modify their software to meet their needs. With proprietary software, a company like Microsoft or Apple can change your software whenever they want and however they want even if that isn't in your interest. From the perspective of a consumer, being able to hire your own developers to modify your software is basically useless. But this is very useful if you're the government and have relatively unlimited funds taxed from your subjects. reply hulitu 12 hours agoparent> This seems like something almost every government would have already done.

Losing productivity is money that's just being thrown away, even if you ignore all the additional operating costs, I don't think you'd have to lose much productivity to make up the difference. I'm not sure what the average pay of Swiss civil servants is, but I can't imagine one standard E5 license (~€40/month) is far off an hours work. reply medstrom 11 minutes agorootparent> if you just want to give Swiss people some tax revenue back But they don't just want to do that. I'm not an economist, but I don't think RoI (\"return on investment\") means the same thing for a government that it does for a corporation. Any money \"thrown away\" comes back in some way, which creates many opportunities to kill two birds with one stone. reply panick21_ 20 hours agorootparentprevFirst, I am a Swiss developer so that's my perspective. Because long term if we invest in domestic ability to support, debug and improve software is a benefit. Getting actual control over the software deployed, rather then just what Microsoft want's you to get. Switzerland is behind in Digitization, and having an increase amount of open software to interact and build with makes a hell of a lot of sense. A you do digitization, every part of the software from every deparment needs to interact with every other software. Having this stuff be open source based on open standards, supported by local developers who can make this happen is vital. We should not just hand our IT infrastructure to Microsoft and Oracle, just as we are not handing of our railway system to Virgin (looking at you Britain). Of course if its just about LibreOffice, there is no point, we need a much more systematic, wide-reaching long term digitization plan, and open source must be a big part of that.

    "originSummary": [
      "Switzerland has passed a law requiring government agencies to use open-source software (OSS) and publish new government code under open-source licenses, known as the \"Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks\" (EMBAG).",
      "This initiative aims to improve transparency, security, and efficiency by making non-personal, non-security-sensitive government data publicly accessible.",
      "Switzerland's move aligns with similar European initiatives and could potentially inspire further adoption of OSS in Europe and the U.S."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Switzerland mandates that government agencies use open-source software, aiming to increase transparency and reduce dependency on proprietary vendors.",
      "Open-source software allows governments to modify and audit code, potentially leading to better security and cost savings by avoiding vendor lock-in.",
      "This move is seen as an investment in local capabilities and a step towards systematic, long-term digitization, despite potential short-term costs."

    "commentBody": "U.S. Department of Defense – Detecting Agile BS [pdf] (2018) (defense.gov)122 points by rareitem 21 hours agohidepastfavorite40 comments bane 20 hours agoThe fact that this had to be produced, reviewed (probably by lawyers) and cleared for open publication is a sign that the DoD has recognized that it's wasting a lot of time and money paying teams to make things that help the DoD...and not getting it -- despite agile's promise of delivering working software to users ever iteration. The document contains and is a symptom, the root cause analysis of why this document exists should be next. Reading between the lines, there's lots of complaining here about teams working with people who aren't users and having no mechanism to reach users. I suspect that there is a very large \"cottage\" industry of companies that basically sit between teams and end-users and act as \"intermediaries\" and basically just siphon tax dollars into their quarterly revenue reporting while breaking the connection between teams and users, guaranteeing successful software is never delivered, and making sure that software efforts essentially go on forever or are restarts of previously failed efforts. reply pylua 20 hours agoprevThis document has no teeth. It is more simple than this … does it have fixed scope and fixed timeline ? If so it’s not agile. reply nyrikki 20 hours agoparentIt is part of an effort that will have impact. Remember that the US federal government is the largest IT spender in the world. This is part of their efforts to move agencies internally I using a carrot first. Now that the GAO officially released an agile audit guide, the stick is in place. GAO Agile Assessment Guide https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105506 Note that in the public sector, appropriation committees have the power, and see how they are targeting states here. https://guides.18f.gov/derisking/state-field-guide/budgeting... TOGAF, ITIL and the other crusty frameworks all had to take steps to modify their long held dogma over the past few years. I would give it another 5 or 10 years or so before federal funding to even states depends on compliance. Remember that the military moved away from Taylorism to mission command a long time ago. This is moving IT the same way. If you have or aspire to have government contracts it is probably a good idea to pay attention. Note how that 18f page links to the above document and goes farther, saying that if there is a single individual who can insist on a Gannt chart , you aren't 'agile' There is two centuries of experience in the military setting, with only about 70 in the biz world, the feds are quite clear that they won't wait for IT. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 19 hours agorootparentThey're right though- teeth means enforcement. These DOD recommendations/guidelines aren't worth the paper they're printed on if they aren't don't make into the contracts. reply havkom 20 hours agoparentprevThe document vibe to me is like it is written by some junior engineers who have just read a blog post about the Netflix stack and think they know it all now. reply dzonga 20 hours agoprevahh agile, what every tech company likes to say they adhere to. the church of agile. yet it feels to deliver good quality software on predictable timelines. agile is simply a way to cover management's ass and shift blame to programmers or other stakeholders. worse more with microservices or more appropriately \"distributed monoliths\" you can easily shift the blame to - the other team has been blocking our progress since we need an api they provide. seen this playout so many times at $lastjob. reply jopsen 20 hours agoparentIs that such a bad idea: > 37. (Henshaw's Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame. reply rqmedes 20 hours agoparentprevImage delivering a race car to a customer via Agile, starting with first delivering a bicycle reply the__alchemist 20 hours agoprevMeanwhile, in order to deploy web-based software in the USAF, you need to use something called Platform One, due to something called a \"Continuous Authority to Operate (ATO)\". Platform One has a baby Yoda, and it is Agile to its core. The whole thing is based on the Agile core concepts like TDD, pair programming etc, and it uses \"DevSecOps\". This means is it is a huge time commitment just ticking the various boxes. There's something called a \"pipeline\", which is a set of many third party tools that all have to pass various arbitrary metrics. The pipeline breaks at arbitrary point at arbitrary times, and only Platform One team members are allowed to fix it. reply johnbellone 20 hours agoprevThe additional documents that are linked in the footnotes are great, too. https://media.defense.gov/2018/Apr/22/2001906836/-1/-1/0/DEF... https://media.defense.gov/2018/Jul/10/2001940937/-1/-1/0/DIB... reply neilv 20 hours agoprevThe title made me suspect it was about Here's some signs that Agile buzzwords and rituals are being used as a smokescreen for project crisis, organizational dysfunction, and team capability deficit. And I was all ready to high-five them. But it seems to start with the implicit assumption that Agile is good, and non-Agile is bad, and the information is some almost off-the-cuff notes on their own particular definition of Agile. reply alexfromapex 20 hours agoprevIt feels like we’re getting closer and closer to Idiocracy with these published government articles where the title lacks decorum reply mckn1ght 20 hours agoparentActually I think that overcorrecting for decorum is taking us to Idiocracy faster. It’s right there in the name: we need to stop coddling idiots, grifters and otherwise unqualified people that work their way into positions of power. Agile gives these types of people nearly limitless recourse to maintain their grip (although it is not solely Agile’s fault, it’s the broader culture). reply pjmorris 20 hours agoprevWarning in the article: > \"Meeting requirements is treated as more important than getting something useful into the field as quickly as possible.\" I've got a bad feeling about this. It seems like the kind of attitude that leads to last Friday's Crowdstrike update. reply kevinmchugh 20 hours agoparentI think there's domains where rigorously establishing requirements ahead of time is necessary and creates better outcomes than shipping quickly and iterating. Especially safety-critical domains. If your product can kill someone (either on failure or success), defining expectations, behaviors, and specifications ahead of time is responsible. I really like this article, about the space shuttle dev teams: https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff reply galangalalgol 20 hours agoparentprevI see where you are headed, and certainly unscrupulous entities will it as an excuse to cut corners, but I think they are talking about the case where someone produces something that will clearly not work, while still meeting the letter of requirements. Having good requirements is important, but making them is iterative as well, and having to treat software developers like an evil DM when you are casting the wish spell is not ok. reply pjmorris 19 hours agorootparentYes, I agree with 'Working software over comprehensive documentation.' It's that 'working' part that sometimes depends on getting the requirements right. reply bluefirebrand 21 hours agoprevI love this document. I'm absolutely going to be sharing this around a bit at my company reply wiradikusuma 20 hours agoparentShare the link, not just the PDF, to give more legitimacy ;) reply galangalalgol 20 hours agorootparentI strongly dislike it on one count. It actively promotes using the choice of tools as a marker for \"true agile\". They go so far as to reword the first item to exclude any references to tools. I have seen plenty of groups using all the right tools, full of individually skilled developers, producing garbage late to schedule. The reason is that they did not interact with each other in a way that lead to success. They drew lines about whose problem things were and then used them to assert problems weren't theirs. They set up their own (or modified shared) interface documentation and let it be out of synch with what the other end specified. And on down the line. Tools can help, sometimes. But if someone is using cvs or subversion instead of git, I'm not going to label them as nonagile. If they didn't pick c++'s build system of the week, that doesn't meen the product isn't quality. reply wiradikusuma 18 hours agorootparentReminds me of a slide made by armchair architect in the previous company I worked for :) reply galangalalgol 17 hours agorootparentI am inclined to think there was some incentive to formally support those tools with the paper. Maybe nothing as blatent as free trips and meals, but who knows. reply nvr219 20 hours agoprevCan they make one for AI please? reply strken 20 hours agoprevIt annoys me a bit that \"it depends how you define a programmer\" is a wrong answer. \"12 full-time software engineers, 4 data scientists who touch the SQL reports sometimes, and we contract out some front-end UI work plus we have a full-time email marketing guy who does HTML templates\" would be better, but that's still just a more complicated way of saying \"it depends\". reply ChrisArchitect 17 hours agoprevPrevious discussion: 1 year ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34957523 4 years ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23962722 reply aetherspawn 20 hours agoprevAgile can be waterfall-like when the minimum viable product is otherwise too large to avoid waterfall analysis paralysis. For example, zonal controller for an electric .. tank. Under relaxed Agile you would deliver a high-level plan (module architecture) as a deliverable, and then do JIT design of each module as a deliverable followed by implementation as a deliverable. If you follow guru agile for this and deliver 1 feature at a time, it will take 10 years to get your desired feature set. Because you’ll rework and refactor each module 100 times, followed by tear up and tear down of physical testing, 100 rounds of regression testing… reply travisgriggs 20 hours agoprevJust identify your \"gatekeeper\" points. If you have lots, there's no way you're really doing any form of agile. reply jiveturkey 20 hours agoprev(2018) reply doctor_eval 20 hours agoprevWhile this document starts strong and has some good points, it strongly conflates “scrum” with “agile” and goes downhill pretty quickly. > wrong answer: what’s a sprint cycle? You don’t have to have sprints to be agile. What’s important are the four values. The manifesto says, “Individuals and interactions over process and tools” but this document then goes on to talk a lot about specific processes and tools. It’s a trap! reply sirwhinesalot 20 hours agoparentA trap every freaking \"Agile\" company falls into. Don't get me started on fixed scope + fixed timeline that they all still do anyway, only now broken into \"sprints\". reply simondanerd 20 hours agoprevSharing this link to a buddy...

NPM can be an attack vector if you don't understand how it works and what it does. reply havkom 20 hours agoprevFirst parts of the document are pure BS focusing on hype technologies rather than “Agile”. I mean, questions about ”Kubernetes or Docker Swarm?” etc. The last section with flow chart is good though. reply polemic 20 hours agoparentThey aren't \"hype\" technologies - but it does seem badly framed. If it were to say \"the team uses version control, CI frameworks, agile tracking tools then they might be agile\" it would make more sense. That would be especially useful if , say, much of their existing softare is delivered once a month via zip files on an ftp server. reply havkom 20 hours agorootparentUsing these technologies or frameworks may just as well indicate that they are not agile. Nowadays much more common that the wrong technologies are used in the wrong places. reply rqmedes 20 hours agoprevDisappointed, I was hoping they came out with Agile is BS. Which it mostly is. reply jiveturkey 20 hours agoprevMaybe there's some assumed context, but this doc doesn't clarify whether agile is actually desirable or not, for any given project. If it doesn't matter, say if there is a fixed budget for example, then ... who cares what the team calls their process. Lovely: > Are teams empowered to change their process based on what they learn?

    "originBody": "Intel/ Tech/ Desktops There is no fix for Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen CPUs — any damage is permanent There is no fix for Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen CPUs — any damage is permanent / Here are the answers we got from Intel. By Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. Jul 26, 2024, 3:54 PM UTC Share this story An Intel Core i9-13900K CPU, one of the first types that was identified to sometimes crash games this way. Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge On Monday, it initially seemed like the beginning of the end for Intel’s desktop CPU instability woes — the company confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should address the “root cause” of exposure to elevated voltage. But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already crashing, that patch apparently won’t fix it. Citing unnamed sources, Tom’s Hardware reports that any degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is “confident” the patch will keep it from happening in the first place. (As another preventative measure, you should update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the problems. And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren’t the only reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson Thomas Hannaford confirms it’s a primary cause, but the company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be traced back to an oxidization manufacturing issue that was fixed at an unspecified date last year. This raises lots of questions. Will Intel recall these chips? Extend their warranty? Replace them no questions asked? Pause sales like AMD just did with its Ryzen 9000? Identify faulty batches with the manufacturing defect? We asked Intel these questions, and I’m not sure you’re going to like the answers. Why are these still on sale without so much as an extended warranty? Intel has not halted sales or clawed back any inventory. It will not do a recall, period. The company is not currently commenting on whether or how it might extend its warranty. It would not share estimates with The Verge of how many chips are likely to be irreversibly impacted, and it did not explain why it’s continuing to sell these chips ahead of any fix. Intel’s not yet telling us how warranty replacements will work beyond trying customer support again if you’ve previously been rejected. It did not explain how it will contact customers with these chips to warn them about the issue. But Intel does tell us it’s “confident” that you don’t need to worry about invisible degradation. If you’re not currently experiencing issues, the patch “will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service.” (If you don’t know if you’re experiencing issues, Intel currently suggests the Robeytech test.) And, perhaps for the first time, Intel has confirmed just how broad this issue could possibly be. The elevated voltages could potentially affect any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor that consumes 65W or more power, not just the highest i9-series chips that initially seemed to be experiencing the issue. Here are the questions we asked Intel and the answers we’ve received by email from Intel’s Hannaford: How many chips does Intel estimate are likely to be irreversibly impacted by these issues? Intel Core 13th and 14th Generation desktop processors with 65W or higher base power – including K/KF/KS and 65W non-K variants – could be affected by the elevated voltages issue. However, this does not mean that all processors listed are (or will be) impacted by the elevated voltages issue. Intel continues validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. For customers who are or have been experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors, Intel continues advising them to reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance. Additionally, if customers have experienced these instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors but had RMA [return merchandise authorization] requests rejected we ask that they reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance and remediation. Will Intel issue a recall? No. Will Intel proactively warn buyers of these chips about the warning signs or that this update is required? If so, how will it warn them? Intel targets to release a production microcode update to OEM/ODM customers by mid-August or sooner and will share additional details on the microcode patch at that time. Intel is investigating options to easily identify affected processors on end user systems. In the interim, as a general best practice Intel recommends that users adhere to Intel Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date. Has Intel halted sales and / or performed any channel inventory recalls while it validates the update? No. Does Intel anticipate the fix will be effective for chips that have already been in service but are not yet experiencing symptoms (i.e., invisible degradation)? Are those CPUs just living on borrowed time? Intel is confident that the microcode patch will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service, though validation continues to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. Intel is investigating options to easily identify affected or at-risk processors on end user systems. It is possible the patch will provide some instability improvements to currently impacted processors; however customers experiencing instability on their 13th or 14th Generation desktop processor-based systems should contact Intel customer support for further assistance. Will Intel extend its warranty on these 13th Gen and 14th Gen parts, and for how long? [No answer yet.] Given how difficult this issue was for Intel to pin down, what proof will customers need to share to obtain an RMA? (How lenient will Intel be?) [No answer yet.] What will Intel do for 13th Gen buyers after supply of 13th Gen parts runs out? Final shipments were set to end last month, I’m reading. Intel is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. This includes working with Intel’s retail and channel customers to ensure end users are taken care of regarding instability symptoms with their Intel Core 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors. What will Intel do for 14th Gen buyers after supply of 14th Gen parts run out? Same as above. Will replacement / RMA’d chips ship with the microcode update preapplied beginning in August? Is Intel still shipping replacement chips ahead of that update? Intel will be applying to microcode to 13th/14th Gen desktop processors that are not yet shipped once the production patch is released to OEM/ODM partners (targeting mid-August or sooner). For 13th /14th Gen desktop processors already in service, users will need to apply the patch via BIOS update once available. What, if anything, can customers do to slow or stop degradation ahead of the microcode update? Intel recommends that users adhere to Intel Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date. Once the microcode patch is released to Intel partners, we advise users check for the relevant BIOS updates. Will Intel share specific manufacturing dates and serial number ranges for the oxidized processors so mission-critical businesses can selectively rip and replace? Intel will continue working with its customers on Via Oxidation-related reports and ensure that they are fully supported in the exchange process. Why does Intel believe the instability issues do not affect mobile laptop chips? Intel is continuing its investigation to ensure that reported instability scenarios on Intel Core 13th/14th Gen processors are properly addressed. This includes ongoing analysis to confirm the primary factors preventing 13th / 14th Gen mobile processor exposure to the same instability issue as the 13th/14th Gen desktop processors. That’s all we’ve heard from Intel so far, though Hannaford assured us more answers are on the way and that the company is working on remedies. Again, if your CPU is already damaged, you need to get Intel to replace it, and if Intel won’t do so, please let us know. In the meanwhile, you’ll want to update your BIOS as soon as possible because your processor could potentially be invisibly damaging itself — and if you know your way around a BIOS, you may want to adjust your motherboard to Intel’s default performance profiles, too. Lastly, here is that Robeytech video that Intel is recommending to Redditors to potentially help them identify if their chip has an issue. Intel says it’s looking into other ways to identify that, too.

It's not known, but reasonably likely that this microcode patch will lower performance of the intel processors, so benchmarks between Ryzen 9000 and Intel 13th/14th gen will be artificially favorable to Intel's CPU's. Taking a wider view - there's widespread belief that both AMD and Intel are pushing the clocks of their CPU's too hard from the factory, and it's a bit of a prisoner's dilemma. If these types of issues force one company to set less aggressive clock speeds, the other company should be able to follow suit. Then end-users / partner channels would get more stable CPU's and enthusiasts would get a little extra headroom for overclock potential to play with if they are lucky with getting a \"golden\" CPU that can handle slightly higher voltages. Back in the day, overclockers expected to get a 25% chance of failure from aggressive overclocks, but it was just an accepted risk on their end. Obviously CPU's shouldn't have clock/voltage/temperature curves with 25% failure straight from the factory - which Intel's currently do! reply SketchySeaBeast 2 hours agorootparentThe dark side of having healthy competition in a particular market. Though honestly, it doesn't much matter what Intel does, my next chip will be AMD.

Already priced in. Thus no reason to tank. reply billconan 2 hours agorootparentbut the root cause is worse than previous believed and there is no plan for a fix. this is something new I think. reply geor9e 1 hour agoparentprev3-year warranty, not all customers are going to bother with an RMA exchange, a lot customers will make it the 3 years since the patch prevent further damage, an exchange costs Intel whatever manufacturing one more of the same old cpu costs, plus bulk shipping cost and overseas customer service agent hours. It's expensive but I don't know how high up it will be on the balance sheets after it's all said and done. reply kelthuzad 2 hours agoparentprevit's \"up\" by +0.31$ (1.01%) for today, but Intel is down -1.90$ (-5.69%) over the past 5 days and down -12.24$ (-28.03%) over the past 6 months and down -16.38$ (-34.28%) year to date and down -20.19$ (-39.14%) over the past 5 years. reply more_corn 1 hour agorootparentI think what people outside the industry fail to realize is that people placing orders for tens of thousands of datacenter cpus don’t have time to fuck around with this. The preference for intel over AMD is very slight. They’re shifting orders from intel to AMD and will continue to do so till there’s a reasonable long term plan from intel.

I was just in my portfolio to make sure I didn’t have any and noticed it’s up. Wallstreet will catch on soon. It’d be crazy if they didn’t notice till earnings were down for the next few quarters.

I've got a 13th gen i7 in my laptop that so far has not had any problems (well, except keyboard issues that seem to be due to the manufacturer), but would like to know if there's a risk of CPU issues in the future. reply Ataraxic 2 hours agoparentFor certain chips like the 13900HX (mobile) vs 13900K, I believe they are the exact same chip. The difference is the mobile version is binned for power usage so that it can run on a laptop. To the extent that this degradation is wholly voltage/power related, laptop chips are much less likely to degrade. They are selected to run at lower voltages and power AND their peak boost frequency is lower. To the extent that this degradation is caused by poor design, the laptop chips that are binned versions of their desktop chips are vulnerable to the same sorts of issues. edit: I am familiar with the 13900HX because that's what I have in my laptop and I have been trying to follow along in case I need to RMA my laptop or do some microcode update for it. reply thanksgiving 2 hours agoparentprevI’ve seen videos on YouTube where they say intel claims the issue with laptop chips is a separate issue which the videos go on to say that it is a strange thing to say if intel isn’t sure about the root cause of either issue. reply nequo 2 hours agorootparentCould it be that the manufacturing defect only crashes the CPUs at a higher voltage, and the 13900HX/14900HX mobile CPUs run at a lower power (157 W) than the 13900K/14900K desktop CPUs (253 W)? If so, then Intel might be trying to spin this as the high voltage being the cause rather than oxidation or some other manufacturing problem. reply more_corn 29 minutes agorootparentMy understanding is that the chip is able to request higher voltage from the mainboard as demand increases. And it’s allowed to request an unsafe level of voltage. This is particularly problematic under high load. reply akmittal 2 hours agoparentprev> The elevated voltages could potentially affect any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor that consumes 65W or more power, not just the highest i9-series chips that initially seemed to be experiencing the issue. reply ec109685 2 hours agoparentprevIt’s answered in the FAQ at bottom of article that they are still investigating. reply cptroot 2 hours agoparentprevTFA sources Intel as saying even they don't know whether Laptops are affected, given similar circumstances. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 2 hours agoprevI think my last job had a bunch of 11th Gen nucs, hope they didn't upgrade into this. reply georgeburdell 2 hours agoprevPat’s toast. I held onto my INTC shares for about 5 years longer than I should have, in the hope of a turnaround, but BOD will seek to clean house to try and repair the company’s image. reply antisthenes 56 minutes agoprevThere's a video on YT with someone doing a multimeter inspection of the 13/14 gen CPUs. In order to achieve their clocks, they boost to insane voltages, which causes both instability and damage. Intel just fucked with raw physics and lost. They tried to play the \"overclocker friend\" for everyone and this is the result. You can't expect to run modern CPUs at 1.5-1.6V 24/7 and not have stability/failure issues. reply LegitShady 2 hours agoprev [–] this is a design/manufacturing defect and I expect Intel will replace any defective chips. reply cmsj 2 hours agoparentLiterally addressed in TFA: \"Intel has not halted sales or clawed back any inventory.

And the FDIV issue is a number of steps down in severity from this issue; those CPUs didn't die. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug , for those who may be too young to instantly know what I'm talking about. It was a big deal at the time, and as you can see by reading it, less critical than CPUs actually dying. Read the timeline of disclosure and remember what you're reading in seconds occurred over a couple of months. reply NikkiA 1 hour agorootparentThe cc820 fiasco would probably be a more recent analogue, and it took Intel a while to admit fault there too; and some OEMs never accepted fault - looking at you Asus. reply ronsor 2 hours agorootparentprevThey will, however, inevitably be sued. reply drdaeman 2 hours agorootparentAnd end up with a settlement of a few dollars per claimant, which is drastically cheaper than a recall. reply ronsor 2 hours agorootparentNot necessarily. You're forgetting the lawyers' cut. reply Night_Thastus 2 hours agoparentprevIntel will absolutely minimize any concern about the manufacturing problem and focus on the microcode, quietly deny any permanent damage concerns, and do everything in their power to avoid a recall. For big buyers like data centers they'll capitulate, but for everyday consumers they'll resist as much as they can. reply paulmd 1 hour agorootparentthis is funny because it’s going to be the opposite. tray processors and even retail units both get reduced warranty in the datacenter and the people who are going to get screwed are those with a chip failing at 18 months or whatever, since that’s technically still out of warranty and consumer protections don’t typically apply to commercial operators. Consumers will be fine. reply wongarsu 2 hours agoparentprevIntel's statements in the article make it sound like they want to just sweep it under the rug. They don't plan to halt sales, won't do a recall, don't plan to inform customers, tell you not to be worried about permanently damaging your CPU because a future microcode update will make sure that from that date onward it won't be damaged from this specific cause (which seems to be one of multiple) and they don't have a comment on whether they will extend the warranty reply integricho 2 hours agoparentprev [–] I think nobody expects any major corporation to admit any fault on their part today, they are all too afraid to do so, thinking they will preserve their share prices this way. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Lemon Drops 🍋 Stripe acquires Lemon Squeezy JR Farr Product Author JR Farr Date July 26, 2024 Category Lemon Drops Woohoo! We're excited and humbled to announce that @stripe has acquired @lmsqueezy. In 2020, when the world gave us lemons, we decided to make lemonade. We imagined a world where selling digital products would be as simple as opening a lemonade stand. We dreamed of a platform that would take the pain out of selling globally. Tax headaches, fraud prevention, handling chargebacks, license key management, and file delivery, among other things, are complicated. We believed it should be simple. We believed it should be easy-peasy. As founders, we've spent a decade selling digital products, and so we created a solution that met our own needs. But what started as an idea to solve the day-to-day problems of selling digital products evolved into something much bigger. Nine months after our public launch in 2021, we surpassed $1M in ARR and never looked back. We worked tirelessly through growing pains while also celebrating major milestones along the way. Each step reinforced that we were onto something remarkable. Along the way, we received many acquisition offers and (Series A) term sheets from investors. But despite the allure of these opportunities, we knew that what we had built was truly special and needed the right partner to take it to the next level. We're proud to say that we've found that partner in Stripe and have gone from idea to acquisition in under three years. A perfect blend: Lemon Squeezy x Stripe Stripe continues to set the bar in the payments industry with its world-class developer experience, API standards, and dedication to beauty and craft.

There hasn't been a single VAT-compliance case to my knowledge and the need for MoR is unclear. It's not just the EU that charges VAT (or VAT-like taxes).

Always good to comply with tax laws (if not for the obviously good moral/ethical reasons, then definitely for legal reasons!) reply drewda 20 minutes agorootparentIn addition to the overall benefits of not having non-compete agreements, California's software startup ecosystem also benefits from not having to deal with charging sales tax when selling SaaS[1][2] [1] https://www.taxjar.com/blog/saas-california-sales-tax [2] https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol1/sutr/1502.html reply l5870uoo9y 39 minutes agorootparentprevUS states have a minimum threshold of $100,000 and upwards so you can be compliant without having to worry about it until you start making larger revenue.

There is an ideal amount of M&A activity in an economy which is more than \"no startup ever gets acquired\" and less than \"every startup is bought out by big tech\". In recent years we have been closer to the first extreme, and very few startups have had exits of any kind. reply mrguyorama 52 minutes agorootparentprevA startup made for the purpose of acquisition was never a competitor. If you are willing to sell to the big player in your industry you are not competing, you are an opportunist. A startup that wants to compete will run very differently from a startup that wants to be purchased. A big whale company that gobbles up some of the fifty startups that only have like 2% of the market total is not a competitive market at all. reply seanwilson 1 hour agoprevAre there any plans to adjust the extra % fees that get added to international, PayPal, and subscription payments, and payouts?

    "originBody": "A French gendarme walks on a deserted platform near a high-speed TGV train at the Gare Montparnasse train station in Paris on July 26, 2024. THIBAUD MORITZ / AFP France's high-speed rail network was hit by \"malicious acts\" including arson attacks that have disrupted the transport system, national rail operator SNCF said on Friday, July 26, hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. \"This is a massive attack on a large scale to paralyze the TGV network,\" SNCF told Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that many routes will have to be canceled and the situation would last \"at least all weekend while repairs are conducted.\" \"SNCF was the victim of several simultaneous malicious acts overnight,\" the national train operator said, adding that the attacks affected its Atlantic, northern and eastern lines, at a time of particularly heavy traffic for summer holiday travel. The southeastern line was not affected as \"a malicious act was foiled.\" \"Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities,\" it said, adding that traffic on the affected lines was \"heavily disrupted.\" SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said that the attackers had started fires in \"conduits carrying multiple (fibre-optic) cables\" that carry \"safety information for drivers\" or control the motors for points. \"There's a huge number of bundled cables. We have to repair them one by one, it's a manual operation\" requiring \"hundreds of workers,\" he added. French officials described the attacks on France's high-speed rail network as “criminal actions\" and said they were investigating whether they were linked to the Olympic Games. The Paris prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the attacks on the rail network. It said it was investigating into \"the deterioration of property that threatens the fundamental interests of the nation.\" This crime, it added, carries a potential 15-year sentence and fines of €225,000. Further, it said crimes involving \"degradation and attempted degradation by dangerous means in an organized group\" can carry a 20-year prison sentence and fines of €150,000. 800,000 passengers affected Trains were being diverted to different tracks \"but we will have to cancel a large number of them,\" the statement said. The SNCF has urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations. Farandou added that 800,000 passengers were affected. SNCF railway company workers and police officers work at a site where unknown actors targeted France's high-speed train network, ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony, in Croisilles, northern France, July 26, 2024. BRIAN SNYDER / REUTERS Passengers gather around the departure boards at the Gare Montparnasse train station, in Paris, on July 26, 2024. THIBAUD MORITZ / AFP SNCF has announced that there will be no trains at Paris' Gare Montparnasse station, which serves the west of the country, until 1 pm, with some delays and a few cancellations. \"All customers affected will receive a 100% refund on all train tickets,\" it added. Partner service Learn French with Gymglish Thanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day. Try for free At Montparnasse, passengers were waiting for more information about their trips, with display boards showing delays of more than two hours. \"Normal traffic is expected to resume on Monday, July 29,\" read one of the signs in the departure hall. The station's loudspeakers told passengers that conditions to exchange and refund tickets would be more flexible. Passenger services chief Christophe Fanichet said there were delays of 90 minutes to two hours on services between Paris and France's north and east. The company also stated that all travelers would be \"progressively notified by SMS and email over the next few hours.\" \"We ask you not to come to the station; if we haven't warned you, your train isn't running,\" said Fanichet. Eurostar trains delayed Several Eurostar trains between Paris and London were also canceled Friday, the company said. \"All high speed trains going to and coming from Paris are being diverted via the classic line today,\" Eurostar said on its website, meaning they will take an extra 90 minutes on a route that usually takes around two hours and 20 minutes. Eurostar also told AFP the line between Paris and Brussels was disrupted. Around 25% of Eurostar trains between Paris and London were canceled on Friday, the company said. \"This will also be the case on Saturday 27 and Sunday 28\" July, Eurostar said in a statement. The company expects the disruption to be cleared by Monday morning. Passengers wait for their train departures at the Bordeaux-Saint-Jean train station in Bordeaux, western France on July 26, 2024. CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT / AFP \"Early this morning, coordinated and prepared acts of sabotage were perpetrated against installations of the SNCF,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said. \"There are huge and serious consequences for the rail network,\" he added, while security services are hunting the culprits. In a later statement, Attal said the sabotage acts had \"a clear objective: blocking the high-speed train network.\" The \"massive attack\" against the high-speed rail network was an \"outrageous criminal act,\" Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said Friday. There would be \"very serious consequences\" for rail traffic throughout the weekend with connections towards northern, eastern and northwestern France halved, Vergriete said. The attacks were launched as Paris prepares for the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with 7,500 athletes, 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said he had \"full confidence\" in the French authorities despite the sabotaging of the train system hours before the Paris Games opening ceremony. \"I don't have concerns,\" the German told the media at the Olympic Athletes' Village. The sabotage on the rail network will have \"no impact on the ceremony,\" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said. But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer changed his travel plans to get to the Olympics on Friday after Eurostar trains were disrupted, Downing Street said. Starmer was meant to be traveling on the cross-Channel rail service from London to Paris for the Olympics opening ceremony. A spokeswoman said he flew instead due to the delays and cancellations. However, two German athletes in showjumping, who were on a train to Paris to take part in the opening ceremony, had to turn back in Belgium because of lengthy delays. They will now miss the ceremony, German news agency dpa reported. \"It’s a real shame but we would have arrived too late,\" rider Philipp Weishaupt, who was traveling with teammate Christian Kukuk, told dpa. \"There was no longer a chance of making it on time.\" Read more Subscribers only Paris 2024: The opening ceremony's many challenges Le Monde with AP and AFP Reuse this content",

Cars with so much electronics on board are just vulnerable as the worst cellphone out there; always connected may seem a cool buzzword, but in reality means always ready to be exploited.

From there he flew on to Paris. During one of his beach-side dinners he got drunk again and let slip to the neighbors that he had a special assignment this summer in Paris to disrupt the opening ceremony of the Olympics. At first the neighbors were incredulous. That’s when Griaznov brandished his FSB ID, witnesses told The Insider. A few days later, Griaznov made his way to Varna and took a flight from there.

A bunch of optic fibers have been cut, but the network was badly designed without redundancy (as evidenced by the current denial of service). Strategic points (the attacks occurred at junctions of several axis) were left insufficiently guarded. The location of these points also shouldn't have been made available to bad actors. French people are not surprised because there are always problems with train when lots of people need them to go on holidays. Usually at this time of the year it's getting hot, and it's one or more electrical transformer that gets burned by high heats. When copper price get high, cables are usually stolen to be sold as metal. And there are also strikes. There is an economic balance to be found between the cost of securing and maintaining the infrastructure vs fixing the problems once they occur.

My apologies. I didn't intend any slight to French infrastructure or those designing and securing it, just the dynamics of the problem. It is easier to attack than to defend, particularly in physical security. I'm sure critical infrastructure is well taken care of. Do you know if TGV is considered as critical as the other sites you noted? I'm curious of your opinion about what level of expertise and intelligence collection it required to carry this out. reply liotier 5 hours agorootparentNetwork redundancy (sometimes up to quadruple for some of the French electrical infrastructure) is indeed vulnerable to asymmetrical attack, if the attacker knows what secures what. I can throw burning fuel into a manhole or at a street cabinet, and it doesn't take much insight to find one that carries important traffic - take your pick near a military base or a nuclear power plant. But the attack will be ineffective, because the attacker needs to know what other bits of infrastructure carry the backup circuits - and take them out simultaneously. And, of course, for the important stuff such information is classified. So, an effective attack on French critical infrastructure is more difficult than it seems at first glance. reply sofixa 9 hours agoparentprevTo be fair the Ministry of Interior has warned that cyberattacks are expected too.

If nation states are indeed competitive, then a relatively decent strategy would be presume automation is going to rapidly allow for an alternative systems in societies, and while that shift is happening, cause as much problem as you can for the folks unable/unwilling/unknowing, while you start shifting behind the scenes. Marx literally articulated deeply, the idea that socialism, and eventually communism, would arise as a natural progression from capitalism.

I try hard to avoid getting conspiratorial in my head, so I tend to leave the thought around that point, after all, it's just a thought. :) reply crabbone 6 hours agorootparentprevTo understand anything Russian government does, you need to understand that they aren't a government in the way Western democracies / republics / monarchies understand the function of the government. For someone with largely humanistic outlook on life, the function of the government is to try to make sure that what's being governed prospers. Prosperity may be understood as \"more riches for the rich\" or \"redistribution of wealth\" or anywhere in between. But the basic idea is to make things better, at least for some sub-group of thus governed subjects. Russia is operated by straight-up criminals. And I don't mean white-collar corrupt politicians. They are literally people who committed often very violent crimes. For instance, Putin is implicated in a number of \"hits\" on law enforcement officers, investigators etc. He was not the one executing the \"hits\", but he was likely directly involved in the crime. A lot of his associates have done often long time behind bars. For example, his puppet assigned to rule over Ukraine (the one who was deposed in the \"revolution of dignity\" which set in motion the present conflict) started his career as a gang robber: he, with his friends broke into an apartment, tortured the owners while taking their belongings. These people have a mental model of the world defined by the prison lore. They have a bizarre set of rules which define what honor is: \"honor\" (the prison kind of) is the central value / virtue in this system. In this model, the world is divided into \"suckers\" and \"men\". \"Men\" are allowed to humiliate the \"suckers\" in whatever way they want. In fact, if they don't, they might as well join the \"suckers\". In this system, anyone who shows any kind of compassion to the \"suckers\" is him/herself a \"sucker\". Europeans or anyone who wants to live in a society that values any human life thus is automatically a \"sucker\". This is why Russians think and treat Europeans with contempt and disdain. They don't think it to be immoral to steal from a European, or to assault one etc. It's also \"honorable\" to accept the risks associated with humiliating the \"suckers\". To prove how much of a \"man\" someone is that is. It's actually better to die while proving your place is among \"men\" than to surrender and live like a \"sucker\".

No international authority has declared or recognized what's going on as genocide. Looting and raping is what happens in any war. The Americans know it very well. The question is: if you consider what's going on in Ukraine a genocide, with 10k civilians killed over 2 years and a half of war, how do we define what's going on in Israel/Palestine, with 40k civilians killed over 10 months of war? What about the ~200k civilian killed during USA's unjustified invasion of Iraq? How come we ended up appeasing the warmongers in that situation? So you see, if it's not worth causing a WWIII for Palestine, or for Iraq, then it's objectively not worth it for Ukraine. These are the rules, and it wasn't Russia who set them.

Rape and other forms of sexual abuse on the scale unleashed by Russia is at levels unseen in many other armed conflicts. The behavior of Russians in the final months of the WWII, compared to the behavior of western allies, is a prime example of the sharp difference.

France has a number of large businesses that are still cosy with Russia: Auchan, Leroy Merlin, Decathlon, L'Oreal, Sanofi, Lacoste, BIC… the list is very long (see https://leave-russia.org/). I thought these companies would be concerned with customer boycotts, but it doesn't seem that people care that much, I guess until rockets and drones start falling on their heads… reply ossobuco 9 hours agoparentprev> I'd be very interested to see how France responds. Nuking Moscow would of course be too much No evidence to be shown of Russia's involvement in this, but let's mention a nuclear escalation. This is absolutely delirious. I hope the people who actually take decision are just a tiny bit more level-headed than you are. reply sofixa 6 hours agorootparent> No evidence to be shown of Russia's involvement in this Only it fits their modus operandi perfectly, they were caught in similar acts all around Europe, Russian operatives were arrested in France as recently as last week (and a few weeks prior there was a guy who burned himself with chemicals trying to build a bomb in his hotel room), and a russian operative was arrested in Bulgaria yesterday bragging about Russian plans to disrupt the Olympics. It's hard to imagine anyone else being involved. Of course there will be a thorough investigation. reply ossobuco 4 hours agorootparentHard for you maybe. Israel is already calling it an act of sabotage by Iran. reply sofixa 1 hour agorootparentWithout any proof, while France has literally arrested multiple Russians in France preparing for sabotage. reply rsynnott 9 hours agoparentprev> Nuking Moscow would of course be too much ... Yes, that might be a _little_ extreme for [check notes] disrupting the trains. I mean, maybe if it was Switzerland, but I don't think France takes train punctuality quite _that_ seriously. (But yeah, I'd assume this was Putin.) reply pelasaco 9 hours agoparentprevnext [9 more] [flagged] basicpython 8 hours agorootparentIt's a completely mistaken personal viewpoint. The M51 (fully manufactured in France) is highly reliable and well tested. Over the past 18 years, there has only been one failure out of the twelve missiles tested. The most recent successful test took place on November 18, 2023. The missile has a classified range estimated to be around 10,000 km, which is pretty opposed to your statement. reply cpa 9 hours agorootparentprevNuclear deterrence relies on credibility, so test launches are regularly announced and conducted publicly. eg : https://www.france24.com/en/france/20231119-france-test-fire... reply Kuinox 9 hours agorootparentprevContrary to UK our nukes don't have launchs issues. reply pelasaco 9 hours agorootparentLOL.

I hope we never come to a point to depend on France to save World/Europe.. they cannot even take care of their own internal problems. reply tuetuopay 9 hours agorootparentWell most of the world depends on the US and I don't find them to take a better care than us of their own internal problems. reply williamdclt 9 hours agorootparentprev> they cannot even take care of their own internal problems. that's a silly take, who can? France, UK, US, pretty much all european countries... it's all a shitshow, every major country has huge internal problem they can't take care of (incl Russia, for that matter) reply pelasaco 9 hours agorootparentright, and do you think that Macron or Kamala would press it? reply williamdclt 8 hours agorootparentPress what? I don't understand the question reply Zealotux 9 hours agoparentprevIt could be Russia, but it could also be any political movement in France, such as far-left movements, opposing the Olympics or the government in general.

Edit: to clarify, I'm French, and this exact same modus operandi has been used by far-left movements in the past to disrupt high-speed lines; if you have solid arguments against my theory, I suggest you address them before blindly downvoting. reply xjm 6 hours agorootparentI'm struggling to try and find information on \"exact same modus operandi has been used by far-left movements in the past to disrupt high-speed lines\" can you provide some links?

The only remotely similar case is Tarnac, and it is ludicrous to even compare it with what is happening today. Tarnac was one line interrupted with a very different (and less destructive) method. Today was a coordinated attack at a much wider scale in a short amount of time. You would be hard press to find any far-left organization in France with the capacity to even approach such an operation. reply mamonster 7 hours agorootparentprevIts also SNCF, which less than a year ago basically threatened to go on strike during these olympic games unless they got an exception to the retirement age reform (exception which they got). CGT-Cheminots (which is the main union) is the most despicable railworkers union in the world. reply pjerem 6 hours agorootparentlol. Think what you want about cheminots, but one thing they all love and will never attack is railway infrastructure. SNCF may be a shitty company (mainly because it have been voluntary sabotaged by governments) but the people making those thousands of trains run everyday all over the country are almost the most passionate workers you could imagine. Yes they do have revendications, yes, they are good at striking, but they’ll never destroy the hardware and infrastructure they love and defend. Mainly because they respect it (railway is working because thousands people are working together to make it work) and also because of safety reasons : SNCF is one of the safest train network in the world because the cheminot culture puts safety on top of any other preoccupations. They’ll never harm infrastructure and never, never ever in a coordinated way. Also, when you criticize cheminots and SNCF, which I agree are far from perfect corporation and company and deserves criticism, don’t forget to look at the rest of the world and you’ll discover that most countries in the world would love to have our train network. It’s easy to brag about having imperfect things but it’s also easy to forget that at least we have them. reply mamonster 5 hours agorootparent>people making those thousands of trains run everyday all over the country are almost the most passionate workers you could imagine. I would probably also be really passionate about all the treasures I amassed by successfully threatening to strike at opportune moments. France is lucky EDF workers at nuclear plants or other critical infrastructure aren't so \"passionate\". >They’ll never harm infrastructure and never, never ever in a coordinated way. I mean, given the sort of attacks that happened, you can already be pretty certain that whoever did them had very good inside information about how the network works. reply liotier 5 hours agorootparentNo. Pjerem obviously knows cheminots - they worship rail infrastructure. Labour conflicts involving cheminots are often brutal, but harming the rail infrastructure is a taboo never transgressed. In general, in labour conflicts across any industry, destroying the very instruments that provide legitimate power as a worker is so stupid that it is just not done. reply mamonster 5 hours agorootparentI would love to think like you, but one of the legacies of Martinez(and now Binet) is that CGT is now so openly political in terms of higher ups that such things can be outsourced to some left wing militias. Not suggesting Figaro is unbiased, but they are already reporting possible left wing involvement: https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/sabotage-sur-le-reseau-... reply aklfsi 9 hours agoparentprevEven the Western intelligence agencies do not believe that Russia has blown up Nordstream. The closest narrative they produced were \"independent Ukrainians using a sailboat\", after which they closed the investigation. So, whose style is Nordstream? Under Reagan, another Russian-German pipeline was sabotaged. It is of course possible that Russia did this particular one, but it is not Russia's style. Why now and not in 2022? Why don't they cut Internet cables? Why would they do it when they know there will just be a backlash? reply Yoric 9 hours agorootparentWell, blowing up Nordstream was clearly against Russian interests, so yeah, nobody believe that the Russian government did. This one? Anything that messes up with the credibility of NATO governments (and France is one of the pillars of NATO) could help Russia. Which of course doesn't prove that it is Russia, either. reply dralley 6 hours agorootparentIt's not \"clearly\" against Russian interests given that Russia was already withholding supply with a myriad of various transparent excuses at the time, and using their German-based but Russian-owned companies to prevent Germany from stockpiling natural gas (they owned the storage), which ultimately resulted in Germany nationalizing those companies. reply ptjahb 6 hours agorootparentprevThat is not the case. The initial Western reaction in the weeks after the event was: - Russia did it as a false flag operation to sow distrust between NATO members. - Russia did it because the long term contracts for Nordstream 1 required them to supply cheap gas, whereas they'd get market prices for the remaining pipeline of Nordstream 2. It is remarkable that all Western agencies have backed off from both claims. reply kagdf 6 hours agorootparentInitial reaction (of course only one side always has to source their assertions, while the people calling for a nuclear retaliation do not): https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/qa-nord-stream-gas-sabo... Plenty of people claiming that Russia did it. reply pbhjpbhj 9 hours agorootparentprev>Why don't they cut Internet cables? Terrorists surely want as much, rapid, coverage of their acts as possible (even if not wanting anyone to know they're terrorist acts). If internet were out that probably makes the acts less impactful. reply raverbashing 9 hours agorootparentprevThrowaway account to defend Russia, do not worry about Russia until facts are officially denied > It is of course possible that Russia did this particular one, but it is not Russia's style. Why now and not in 2022? Why don't they cut Internet cables? Why would they do it when they know there will just be a backlash?

Why now and not in 2022? Because now there's a major event happening in France, where disruptions will be shown globally and affect people from many places congregating for a singular event. It shames France on the global stage, Putin likes shaming leaders who he thinks are weak. > Why don't they cut Internet cables? Why would they do it when they know there will just be a backlash? Internet cables have much more redundancy than a rail network, you can't route trains around the world to get to their destination just some hundreds of milliseconds delayed, it's disruptive but workarounds are embedded in the design of the system, not so much with rail during peak summer season in a very touristic country while hosting a major sporting event. Do you think Russia really cares about the backlash? They keep pushing the boundaries to test responses, what kind of backlash do you think France would give to a nuclear power while they can't show with 100% certainty was Russian? That's the MO of Russia, I don't understand why you are trying to defend it. It might as well not be Russia but the suspicions aren't far fetched, given stuff like this: https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/07/24/russian-... reply cyberpunk 9 hours agorootparentprevI thought it was pretty well understood to be the Brits who did it, with the blessing of the US. Of course, we will never know. reply a-french-anon 8 hours agoparentprevSo quick to create or fully believe in speculations and obviously biaised media (well, I don't believe one moment that there's purely neutral media or that I would be able to recognize it with certainty, but the BBC, lol). I'd like to remind you that the World Wars started because of alliance networks like these, with countries like mine clearly taking sides for not-so-obvious reasons. And not because of caricatures of cartoon baddies that dwarf what the Catholics and Ottomans made of Vlad Tepes. reply rscho 9 hours agoparentprevI'll tell you what France can do: exactly nothing. France is not playing with the big boys anymore. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparentA nuclear submarine on 24/7 patrol with 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles, each with 6-10 independent nuclear warheads, says otherwise. So does the capabilities to deploy forces and fully sustain them independently anywhere in the world, something which at most 4-5 other countries can do. reply pelasaco 9 hours agorootparentIn the theory yes. I can imagine that when shit hits the fan, France isnt able to answer accordingly. reply sofixa 9 hours agorootparentSo you think France spends collectively tens of billions of euros to have nuclear strike capabilities, but wouldn't use them because... \"France\"? reply pelasaco 9 hours agorootparentA country that has the courage to press the button, would never allow it become the social chaos that it is today. reply another2another 7 hours agorootparentMost democracies tolerate a degree of social chaos since self expression and freedom of action are part of the culture. Dictatorships on the other hand are terrified of their own people, and so crush and expression of freedom that they don't directly approve (see for instance the lady that was arrested in Moscow for standing in public with a blank piece of paper). However in times of threat from an external force, then people group together and there's more cohesion. Would a democracy like France press the button to protect themselves or an ally under such circumstances? Yes, I think they would. However these societies are not run by a single small cell of egotistical leaders like feudal courts of old as current autocracies are. The question is more, would these deranged autocracies have the dumb courage to risk annihilation by directly attacking the democracies they hate? Doubt it. reply rsynnott 9 hours agorootparentprev... Wait, which are these _non_-chaotic nuclear armed countries? Like, US: Jan 6th and all that. Russia: At least one major military coup in the last year. Britain: Brexit, new prime minister every three weeks, all infrastructure more or less at point of collapse. France: well, 'nuff said. You could maybe argue China, I suppose? Though I think they're just better at keeping the chaos boiling just below the surface. reply chgs 6 hours agorootparentprev!remindme Jan 20 reply basicpython 8 hours agorootparentprevSocial chaos? Revolt is part of France's DNA, since 1789. What country can claim to have no social problems? Moreover, military action and social issues are separate matters and I don't see the link with \"pressing the button\". Stop french bashing please. reply williamdclt 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can imagine whatever you want. The fact is that France is concretely prepared, \"when shit hits the fan, it won't be able to answer accordingly\" is a random dude-on-the-internet opinion reply benterix 9 hours agorootparentprevIt makes no sense. The whole point of nuclear weapons is deterrence (so \"theory\"). The moment you actually have to use them (\"practice\") everybody involved loses.

Great buddy, you launched your nukes with your big ass subz... now what do you think is going to happen? You think superpowers got no nukes close to France ? You'll be vaporized into nuclear waste gas before most of your nukes fly half the way. More realistically, you'd try to think how can France hurt superpowers economically: guess what, it can't. reply stirlo 9 hours agorootparentprevAs a nuclear armed power that has shown far more propensity for military intervention outside their borders (see Africa) than all other nato members I wouldn’t bet against the French here. reply iamacyborg 9 hours agorootparentprevFrance is now the de-facto most important political player in Europe. reply rscho 8 hours agorootparentOn what basis ?
