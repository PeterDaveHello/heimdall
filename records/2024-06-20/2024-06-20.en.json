The proposal this time around came from the Belgian presidency, so it was up to them to withdraw the vote. It's unlikely we'll see any admission on why exactly the vote was withdrawn, but it's probable that the situation became untenable for the political parties involved, one of which lost massively in the Belgian elections about two weeks ago. In an short interview in De Tijd [1] with one of the Belgian MEPs pushing this (Hilde Vautmans, OpenVLD, liberal, lost big), and another short line in De Morgen [2] from outgoing Belgian Minister of the Interior who was part of the talks for this new version (Annelies Verlinden, CD&V, Christian democrats), both of them made it appear like they mostly just care about getting it done (because nobody else has succeeded yet). There is a lot of \"but think of the children\", and zero technical expertise. This morning, after the press attention, high rank party officials across the spectrum (and from the parties mentioned above) publicly called the proposal dangerous, so it's likely the pressure worked this time. Next time this can come up for the vote will likely be from Hungary. They are taking over the EU presidency in a few weeks, and have already said this is on the agenda for them. Considering the current political climate there I would assume they are more likely to bring it to a vote, but hopefully that vote is less likely to succeed. Still, there's no time to rest, the proposal isn't dead. [1] https://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/technologie/fel-privacyprotes...

There is always some privacy-defeating 'online safety' bill going through the parliament. Every time it gets knocked down, but almost immediately returns with slightly different wording. reply navane 54 minutes agorootparentprevCan't we just pass a law that is incompatible with this proposal? Or can a new law always overrule existing laws? reply moffkalast 2 hours agorootparentprevProblem is that they can just keep rewording and repackaging it endlessly until the checksum doesn't match but the final effect is mostly the same. reply soraminazuki 2 minutes agorootparentHow about letting people take the issue to court, and if a judge decides that politicians brought up the same law over and over again in bad faith, they face actual consequences? reply rmbyrro 2 hours agorootparentprevI know a similar principle is successfully applied in judicial courts, in some cases. If it's possible in justice, why not in law making? reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentPerhaps because courts are not a democracy? This class of problems gets much easier when an individual is designated to make a binding declaration (e.g. that these three seemingly different feelings are effectively the same) that's hard to challenge. Democracy has a hard time dealing with \"obvious when you see it\" problems. reply puzzledobserver 1 hour agorootparentThe US House and Senate have parliamentarians, who have some power about what bills can be voted on. This was in the news some years ago, when they (if memory serves) blocked some bills from being voted on. I am unsure of the limits of this power, and how easy it is to change parliamentary rules in the first place. reply didntcheck 1 hour agorootparentSimilarly in 2019 John Bercow (then speaker of the British House of Commons) notably rebuffed the government when they attempted a third vote on what he considered to be basically the same motion https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47614074 > Mr Bercow cited a convention dating back to 1604 that a defeated motion could not be brought back in the same form during the course of a parliamentary session. reply Bluestein 1 hour agorootparentprevSolution, perhaps, is equally persistent opposition.- reply rmbyrro 36 minutes agorootparentOpposition needs public support.

People get tired of having to fight against the same thing over and over and over. Put another way, we have to successfully oppose things like this every single time it comes up. But the people pushing it just have to win once. reply moffkalast 29 minutes agorootparentWell then again, we've been fighting against tyranny for thousands of years and things have slowly gotten better. There are always new people, new generations, prepared to fight for the same thing their parents did and they are not tired. reply barrenko 7 hours agoparentprevAs mentioned, the shittiest part of the EU is that we don't ever get any insight. I wish we could launch some civil legal probe into EU institutions themselves, but that would probably end up being like staring at floating points of a tensor. reply Vinnl 7 hours agorootparentWe don't get a lot of insight, but we do get some. For example, when it does come up for a vote in the Council, we'll know which countries voted in favour (something you can take into account in your next national elections). Then the Parliament will have to agree as well, and we can see which parties there voted in favour, which you can take into account in the next European elections. The Commission is toughest to hold accountable. The Commissioner pushing it (Ylva Johansson in this case) was nominated by a country's (Sweden, in this case) government, so Swedish voters could hold the parties in that government accountable in their next national election, I suppose, but that's a very weak signal. reply agilob 3 hours agorootparent>when it does come up for a vote in the Council, we'll know which countries voted in favour Isn't it kinda late to act? reply Vinnl 26 minutes agorootparentThat is something you could say about almost any legislation, and it's correct to some extent. That said, politicians do seem to try and predict what they'll be held accountable for, and pre-empt that. So it's not so much the voting afterwards that potentially influences the behaviour, but the threat of doing so. I also assume that this is why contacting your representatives is important - that is, essentially, making the threat. I'll give you that it's not a terribly strong signal. reply bux93 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd you know, fund lobbyists. Shocking I know, but it's not just corporations who have lobbyists, NGOs too. reply toomuchtodo 3 hours agorootparentI've been donating forever to Signal, and at this point, I'm resigned that it won't reach WhatsApp parity. Just hire some lobbyists to keep encrypted communications legal as a human right. reply Renaud 2 hours agorootparentThat wouldn’t help. The proposal “got around” weakening encryption without outright removing it. They “just” wanted anything you sent to be scanned before it was sent encrypted. Stupid and dangerous, the even have sections in the proposal that talk about encryption being important, but somehow less important than thinking about the children and putting a cop looking over the shoulder of every single citizen. reply Log_out_ 1 hour agorootparentprevI wonder why NGO advice does not correlate with decision directions at all. Remember the CCC talks by NGO lobbists, usually culminating for everything they do in a\"anyway that was what we advised, they however would vote/do/the thing we advised against\". Had a huge speakerscorner going nowhere vibe and europes youth kicked that play pretend democracy in the nuts last election. reply moffkalast 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's like saying only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun. The solution is to remove guns/lobbyists, not attempting to beat them at their own game because you will absolutely lose. reply WaitWaitWha 2 hours agorootparentWith your solution bureaucrats only have access to registered lobbyist to be eliminated. Bribery remains. reply throwAGIway 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat can I do about foreign politicians? reply DoughnutHole 3 hours agorootparentYour MEPs are likely part of a parliamentary group with foreign politicians and coordinate with them on policy. If your commissioner and MEPs have been solidly opposed to a policy there might not be much you can do. But do you know that that’s a case? Many governments tend to blame unpopular proposals on the EU while the commissioner that they themselves chose vote in favour. reply toyg 4 hours agorootparentprevPush your own politicians to talk to them. Most serious EU Parliament groups are trans-national. It's like asking what can you do about parliamentarians elected in other districts. reply Vinnl 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's always problematic. The best shot you have is pressure your own politicians (at whatever level) to try to strongarm them. For example, US policy has quite a lot of influence on me, but I can't vote for US politicians. Or Russian policy, for that matter. reply wasmitnetzen 4 hours agorootparentprevYlva Johansson was proposed by the previous Swedish government though (a Social Democratic one), which (sort of) lost the last election. No idea why the current (right wing) government is keeping her in place. In practise, that means she's supported by all except one of the relevant Swedish parties. reply toyg 4 hours agorootparentCommissioners are typically not replaced when a national government changes, which is a good thing from a stability perspective (countries can often have two or three different executives in a single year). In the end, a Commissioner is proposed by a country but is then meant to work in the interest of the entire Union, in what is largely an administrative role (Council and Parliament are the real political entities). They are supposed to be uncontroversial people, respected across the entire political spectrum, and typically will stay in post for the duration of their mandate unless embroiled in scandals. reply sakjur 3 hours agorootparentprevThe commissioner before her was Cecilia Malmström 2010-2019, a liberal party politician (right bloc) whose second term was wholly during a social democratic (left bloc) government because the nomination happened before the election. Unfortunately, both Sweden’s most recent commissioners have been prominently advocating against encryption and for mass surveillance. I really hope our new commissioner for the 2024-2029 period ends up with a better track record on privacy advocacy. reply EasyMark 3 hours agorootparentprevI think this is what happens when you get an appointed council making decisions rather than a democratically elected one. It's a bad idea because it lets the appointees and appointers to point fingers and dilute blame, which is another weapon the 1% can use to get policies in their best interest (often the opposite of those for the 99%) passed. reply sandworm101 2 hours agorootparent>> which is another weapon the 1% can use to get policies in their best interest Mass surveillance is one of the few areas where the 1% generally align with the other 99%. Rich or poor, we all use the same communication infrastructure. Rich people don't want their chats monitored either. People don't want this. Intelligence agencies want this. But ask the people working at those agencies, ask them as individuals, and they won't want this on their phones either. reply chongli 2 hours agorootparentMass surveillance is one of the few areas where the 1% generally align with the other 99% Ideally, yes. In practice, the 1% have resources the 99% don't which allow them to minimize their exposure to mass surveillance. Whether this means carving out exemptions for their own communications or conducting their meetings in person, in private, in other jurisdictions. reply quonn 1 hour agorootparentWho do you imagine the 1% to be? Probably I‘m the 1% in my country. I have no extraordinary power whatsoever. Maybe you mean the 0,1% or the 0,01%. reply chongli 1 hour agorootparentYes, your family doctor is also likely part of the 1%. Unfortunately, the term 1% has shifted to basically mean \"the people with most of the wealth and power in a country\" which is a much smaller group of people, perhaps even less than 0.01%. Quibbling over the mathematical inaccuracy of the term is tilting at windmills. You'd have better luck getting people to stop using the word \"literally\" to mean its opposite. reply barbazoo 3 hours agorootparentprev> As mentioned, the shittiest part of the EU is that we don't ever get any insight. You can get quite a bit of data, what are you looking for? reply Vinnl 22 minutes agorootparentOne thing would be interesting was to know who pushed for it to be withdrawn for now, and why. reply tpm 7 hours agorootparentprevThat wouldn't help anyway because most important things happen between national governments and the people they nominate. The EU institutions would work very differently if they were directly formed and managed by the European parliament. Alas the national governments know very well why they won't ever allow that. reply fredgrott 7 hours agorootparentprevmakes a nice plot for a Dr. Who episode. reply justinclift 5 hours agorootparentDidn't they can Dr Who finally? reply swarnie 4 hours agorootparentNo its still going on as \"The most BBC show ever made by the BBC\" reply maleldil 3 hours agorootparentprevThey did a soft reset, with Ncuti's new season being marked as the Season 1 of the 2023 version.

Not that they didn't pass any shitty laws, but that the question \"how can this be misused?\" always was present. reply ds_opseeker 1 hour agorootparentThis is one of the traits I admire the most about German culture; awareness that government can abuse its power. In the US, by contrast, I see one political power eager to give powers to their candidates which they would hate to give to the rival party. It's like they've forgotten that they are giving power to the Government, not to a party, and if the other party gets power they get those powers. reply inglor_cz 37 minutes agorootparent\"This is one of the traits I admire the most about German culture; awareness that government can abuse its power.\" This trait can be found all over the former Soviet Bloc, because we have had enough experience with either one or two homicidal authoritarian regimes (the Nazis and the Communists). That experience was paid in a lot of pain and blood. Places like Sweden, the UK, Canada, Australia or the US, where governments within living memory weren't as oppressive against their own population, have a lot of naive people, \"well, they mean it well\". reply sebastianz 12 minutes agorootparentI agree but I fear this is now fading too. '89 was 35 years ago, and for all generations younger than mine (i'm 40) this part of history will be much more abstract and 'out of living memory'. inglor_cz 5 minutes agorootparentYes, such is the nature of the world, that it buries horrors under layers of time. In some ways, such healing is necessary, even though it comes with risk of repeating the same mistakes. A week ago, I was in Zaragoza and there is a Goya Museum there. His prints of the horrors of the Napoleonic Wars are absolutely terrifying and ghastly. Today, the French and the Spanish people are on friendly terms. In a hypothetical world where the witnesses of such horrors still lived, those nations would probably be a lot less friendly and more resentful. pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentprevThe point that you have to ask that question, in the context of state surveillance, is quite telling. reply Vinnl 7 hours agoparentprev> They are taking over the EU presidency in a few weeks, and have already said this is on the agenda for them. Considering the current political climate there I would assume they are more likely to bring it to a vote, but hopefully that vote is less likely to succeed. Even if it does succeed, that would mean the Commission and the Council are in favour, but they'll still have to reach an agreement with Parliament as well. Parliament has already come out strongly against the proposal, but we just voted in a new, more conservative, Parliament, so I'm a bit anxious to see whether it'll stick to that stance. reply arlort 7 hours agorootparentThis doesn't really fall across conservative / progressive lines, and those lines are already pretty blurred in the EP We'll see how it goes but it's hard to say what the result will be purely based on the elections results. reply Vinnl 3 hours agorootparentThat is absolutely true, and the best thing to do is indeed to wait and see. And cross our fingers. reply cbeach 4 hours agorootparentprevI get the feeling most of those conservatives entering the parliament are of the libertarian and anti-establishment variety. Within the European Parliament, The ID Party represents many of the rising rightwing national parties, such as AfD, RN, Lega, PVV. Among other things, the ID Party stands for \"Defense of individual freedoms and protection of freedom of expression, in particular digital freedoms\" https://id-party.eu/program The concept of a centrally-managed surveillance apparatus in the EU runs contrary to the stated beliefs of the Euro-skeptic ID Party, which wants to reverse the centralisation of power within the EU. reply Fredkin 4 hours agorootparentThere are definitely factions of both the extreme right and extreme left (outdated terms) that understand privacy and dislike mass surveillance. Authoritarianism is on the rise in the 'Third-Way' corporatist, technocratic 'center' which is increasingly worried about losing control to perceived or real extremist parties that threaten their funding model and rock the boat. reply AJ007 2 hours agorootparentI wonder if conservative/progressive and right/left were false dichotomies. At the extremes there are remarkably similar outcomes. Corruption is present at the extremes and the more moderate center. Some of the corruption is more explicit and illegal (pay me and I'll do this), other less so and legal (you did this while in office so now we hire you for big $ to do little.) reply orwin 2 hours agorootparentprevAuthoritarian center is called 'extreme center' for a reason. reply Vinnl 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm not so much concerned about the rise of the ID party in this regard, but instead the growth of EPP and decline of the Greens.

This is one of the things that irks me the most: The abusive, emotional \"mislabeling\". Children have nothing to do with this, and it is an abuse of public good faith to mislabel these sort of initiatives using \"children\" as leverage, preying upon a tech-lliterate public.- In fact, that is also an issue here: The public needs to be brought up to speed (technically) and/or we should at least demand technical expertise from our politicians, when legislating or acting upon mainly technological issues.- reply raverbashing 8 hours agorootparent> The public needs to be brought up to speed (technically) Yeah this is the main thing I think most people don't realize the value of privacy reply Bluestein 8 hours agorootparent> I think most people don't realize the value of privacy Sadly, like much of everything, only once you lose it ... reply Dalewyn 8 hours agorootparentprev>I think most people don't realize the value of privacy After like 2 decades of screaming at clouds, I think it's more that most people don't care about the value of privacy. reply squigz 8 hours agorootparentI imagine it's easy to blame other citizens. Alternatively though, corporate interests are just far more influential than we realize. reply memen 7 hours agorootparentI never really understood this line of thought. Corporate interests _are_ citizen interests right? Those corporations are made up of (a lot) of people, and if those corporate systems thrive in a certain condition, then the people within these corporate systems will largely want to maintain or create those conditions. Those citizens do vote as well, and from personal experience, a lot of people vote in their own interest rather than national or moral interest. From research, I could not find conclusive numbers regarding altruistic [0] vs self-interested voting rates. The more people are working for these corporations, the more we create and sustain the conditions that hold these systems in place. Whether that is 'good' is another debate.

I think you've betrayed your own argument, because talking with people would have been more effective than screaming at clouds, to use your metaphor. Just because you're putting something out there doesn't mean anyone else is receiving it. And if they're not receiving it, you can't judge whether or not they care. reply jorvi 6 hours agorootparentprevPrivacy is a very ephemeral thing. The retail service price of Gmail, Maps, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok etc. together probably would exceed a couple hundred dollars a year. People would rather pocket that money, especially with how tight budgets are becoming. reply dns_snek 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the difference? They \"don't care\" about it as long as they don't suffer any direct ill effects from their indifference. Once things get to the point where every facet of our lives is actively under surveillance, and authoritarians in power start abusing their power in ways that affect those who \"don't care\", they'll start caring really quickly but by then it's going to be too late.

This very proposal also is quite aggressively pushed by the Commission (see for example the advertising campaign: https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-complaint-against-eu-commissio...). reply eigenket 7 hours agorootparentSpecifically this is being pushed by Ylva Johansson [1] from Sweden, who has (reportedly) financial connections to the organisation Thorn which is hoping to sell this chat monitoring software. [1]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ylva_Johansson reply munksbeer 2 hours agorootparentprev> Only the Commission can propose new legislation. That is a technicality relying on a shallow look at the word \"propose\". The commission frequently takes direction from the council when deciding what to focus on which leads to them \"proposing\" legislation. In this case the push for this has come from the Council and certain national governments combined with a particular commissioner. reply toyg 3 hours agorootparentprevThe Commission agenda and mandate is set by the Council that nominates it, and periodically reviewed by the same Council. Items are set in meetings, the agenda of such meetings is typically public. If the Commission pushes, it's because the Council told it to push. reply tpm 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd the Commission is formed by national governments. reply Vinnl 7 hours agorootparentThe Commission is formed by commissioners, each of which has been nominated by a different nation's government. The Council consists of actual members of the national governments. The third party that can't propose legislation but has to approve it (and which strongly opposed this) is the Parliament, which is directly elected. reply tpm 6 hours agorootparentNo. The Commission is formed by the national governments and of commissioners. reply Vinnl 3 hours agorootparentOK, this is probably some nuance of the English language that I'm missing as a non-native speaker, but I meant that the people that make up the Commission are not part of the national governments. The people that are part of national governments each get to nominate one commissioner though, in addition to being part of the Council. reply arlort 7 hours agorootparentprevThe Council is as much part of the EU institution and as legitimate a part of them as the Parliament There's no avatar of the EU manifesting out of thin air in brussels so it makes sense for the EU as a whole to bear the blame for the actions it takes, regardless of where it originated reply avianlyric 4 hours agorootparentI think the point is that the EU hasn’t actually taken any actions yet. This is just infighting between different arms of the EU governance structures, trying to figure out what actions should be taken. So it is unfair to label rubbish coming out of the commission or council as something the EU has decided, when it’s only the first step of many for actually making a decision. It would be like taking any random bit of legislation proposed by a member of congress, and labelling it as the collective stance of the entire U.S. government, completely ignoring the fact there’s a long road from proposal to enactment. reply pohuing 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's only them and the commission who can make proposals right reply arlort 7 hours agorootparentOnly the commission But commission and council aren't acting in a void (parliament neither), if there's appetite for a legislation amongst national governments the commission will work on a proposal The same works to a lesser extent with the commission and parliament as well reply zero0529 7 hours agoprevReally important!

At that point, it would be naive to run a Mastodon server locally, wouldn't it? P.S. Mind you, the average consumer/user doesn't care as long as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok are up and running.

Technology can be used to cross political barriers and solve issues, that's what the government intends to stop.

They like people perceiving an iMessage/RCS duopoly because that's only 2 secure channels to backdoor[1]. Threatening you with jail-time is all they can do for escaping their ire, but that's an unjust and disproportionate response from any state-level actor. The \"average consumer\" has been joking about their 'FBI guy' and freaking them out with weird porn or spurious Amazon carts for a decade now.

One major advantage is that it works perfectly fine even in China which means there is one platform that everyone can use (WeChat is invite only, WhatsApp is blocked). reply Zak 1 hour agorootparentI find the barrier isn't usually lack of technical skill, but lack of interest and patience. The average American can reach everyone they know by SMS and it's hard to convince them to use Signal or WhatsApp, which take under a minute to set up, are fast and reliable, and have almost no learning curve for people already used to SMS.

Quick example: right to be forgotten vs record retention laws. A European who receives healthcare in the US can’t demand that the provider delete their medical record afterward because HIPAA says they must retain it. reply belorn 20 minutes agorootparentA European who receives healthcare in the EU can’t demand that the provider delete their medical record if the provider has a legal allowed reason to keep the record. This is a fundamental aspect of GDPR and part of the central message in the regulation. Companies and organizations are only allowed to keep personal information if they have a legal allowed reason to do so, and must honor requests for deletions unless they have a legal reason not to do so. What is and what isn't a legit reason depend on circumstance. What companies generally object with GDPR is that generate revenue through personal advertisement is not an legit reason to keep personal data. reply ivan_gammel 3 hours agorootparentprevRecord retention laws are not the only exception.

This position was already confirmed by German regulator at least once. reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparentprev> Quick example: right to be forgotten vs record retention laws. Record retention laws win, as explicitly stated in the GDPR. Same reason a murderer can't (successfully) issue a right-to-be-forgotten request to the cops investigating them. (There's also \"processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller\" as another exception, which allows, for example, your bank to retain the fact that you owe them $100k on your house still, even if you don't want them to.) reply TheCoelacanth 4 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't prevent a HIPAA covered entity from needing to delete marketing data that they've collected about you. Right to be forgotten still applies, there is just some limited data that will still be kept. reply macguillicuddy 4 hours agorootparentprevThe right to be forgotten has an explicit exception for circumstances where there's a legal obligation on retention, although it does reference Union and Member State law and not other international entites. https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/ reply rswail 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd they couldn't demand that the provider deletes it in EU either, because maintaining medical records is a legal requirement, which overrides the right to be forgotten.

This bill (only temporarily sidelined) would treat every single person as a suspect of child porn crimes. Previously, you'd need substantial cause to put someone under heavy surveillance. People talked about how that was due to principles of civil liberty, human rights, and freedom. But apparently it was actually just because it wasn't feasible to watch everything everyone says and does all the time. Now that the technology is here to enable it, our \"free democracies\" can't rush fast enough to put the boot to everyone's neck all the time. Pretty obviously this is just the first step. CP is a tactical choice of the first step since practically everyone can agree on how horrible it is. (Come to think of it, this is low key exploiting the vulnerability of children -- nice one, government!) Once everything you say or do is sent to the government for review, you can bet it won't be for just that one thing only. BTW, I think the government policy makers blow past all the problems with false positives that will inevitably occur because, when your goal is control of the population not the prevention of child abuse, that's a feature not a bug. You want everyone nervous and afraid. You want the stories of the lives of innocent people ruined to circulate. That helps keeps everyone cowed. reply constantcrying 4 hours agoparent>since practically everyone can agree on how horrible it is. I certainly do, but the German government does not. They recently lowered the sentences for it, is now roughly on par with theft. Which makes this whole thing even more disingenuous. Either it is so bad that half a billion people need surveillance or it is a crime where you can get a couple of months in prison. The third option is, of course, that it is just a cynical argument. reply aktenlage 3 hours agorootparentThe government not only lowered the sentence, but the \"categorization\" (lacking a better word) of it, downranking it from a felony. They did this, because with a felony it is not possible to stop prosecution for \"possession of child porn\" when common sense would suggest it, e.g. when minors send each other nude pictures of themselves. If you are 16, take a picture of your boobs, you are officially a criminal. According to this official page, those cases made up 41% of the cases: https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/pressemitteilungen/DE/202... And if the possessor of the image is not a minor, as in case of a mother who reported nude pictures from her daughters WhatsApp group to the school principal, they had to be sentenced to at least a year of prison. reply constantcrying 33 minutes agorootparent>They did this, because with a felony it is not possible to stop prosecution for \"possession of child porn\" when common sense would suggest it This is obviously a nonsensical justification. The law should be written in a way, which excludes these cases from prosecution to begin with. It's completely insane to reduce a sentence for a pretty bad crime just because you can't be bothered to formulate the law properly. And even if you were to do that it still proves that you aren't particularly concerned over that crime. If the politicians can't write a law which distinguishes a minor sending pictures of him/her to another minors, from organized CSAM distribution, then what can they do.

If you asked me, I think liberal democracies all around the world are going through a legitimacy crisis. People have not been feeling, for a while now, properly represented by their politicians so they are always seeking to vote for someone that seems like the outsider. Right now, that is represented by these sort of authoritarian, big demagogue politicians. I think a lot of the problems of the modern world require much more innovative ways of doing politics and our liberal democracies which are based on this concept of the \"vote for your representative\" are at the limits of what they can do. The systems we have are slow and inefficient in a world that changes rapidly and requires politics to adapt much more quickly than they can. For this reason, imo, people have grown dejected from politics and the response of the electorate is a sort of self-destruction where they will vote for anyone that can resonate with a message of \"i can fix it\". Whatever that character might be. It's easy for politicians to play certain cards; say, immigration is the problem and the fix is to stop it. That seems like a simple solution and it's a message that can be understood pretty easily. But what are the real problems of the 21st century, in Europe, in the USA, in the rest of the world? I think a lot of people might hyper-focus on certain problems and offer solutions just for those problems and act as if that could solve a much more systemic failure. Ultimately, it is my opinion that the problem is politicians/politics itself and so it is rather difficult for politicians to solve it. Politicians are quick to say \"we've failed you\" but they don't really mean it, it's true though. A couple books that have really changed my perspective on how politics should be and why our systems are failing are: Systemic Corruption by Camila Vergara and Open Democracy by Helene Landemore. If you wanna know more. reply toyg 3 hours agorootparentPart of the problem is just scale. National governments were formed to solve nation-sized issues (trains, taxation rates not changing every 50km, consistent languages and education systems, etc). Modern problems are bigger than that: globalized production chains, tax havens, climate change, migration flows, and superpower conflicts, simply cannot be fixed at the national level. I can guarantee that all the boats in the Mediterranean and the North Sea will be shot on sight by my navy, but people will still get into Europe from somewhere else. I can ensure all the manufacturers in the country respect stringent pollution laws, but people will still buy cheaper and more polluting Chinese goods. And so on and so forth. So we move to a super-national, continent-sized model, and we have a better chance to address these problems - but then we're adding more layers of indirection between citizenry and representatives, and we get an issue of legitimacy. It's a thorny subject. reply avianlyric 4 hours agorootparentprevEU citizens don’t directly elect these politicians. They’re made up of heads of state, so people are voting for whoever they think is their best state government, and those resulting heads of state go to the council. Also the EU isn’t some homogeneous entity, it’s made up of many different countries with many different views, that don’t all align. Asking why EU citizens vote for these types of politicians, is equivalent to asking why some Americans vote for abortion banning republicans. The answer as always is complicated, and there are many different issues that might feed into someone’s vote, and this specific issue might not have been the most important. reply jmull 4 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is, the kind of people who become politicians at all are predisposed to this -- they are the kind of people who want to be in charge, to control, to decide. (It's not just the EU, it's everywhere.) Without pushback, politicians will just naturally move toward increasing their own authority. The new technology has opened up a new opportunity, so of course they are making their push. Democracy, as messy, inefficient, and imperfect as it is, is the only form of government that gives all us non-politicians a reasonable chance to push back. Let's keep doing that. reply cbeach 4 hours agorootparentprevWhen the UK was in the EU we didn't care about the EU elections. Turnout peaked in 2004 at 38.9%, but could be as low as 24%. If you asked the average UK citizen who their MEPs were, they wouldn't be able to tell you. And if we didn't care enough to know their names, we certainly weren't paying attention to the policies they voted for. That makes MEPs very susceptible to lobbying, and the EU system very susceptible to corruption in general. I wrote to all the UK MEPs when the awful Copyright Directive was being proposed, with its completely impractical technical demands and chilling consequences. Most of the MEPs didn't have a clue what was going on, and they didn't seem to care, because they just parrotted the talking points that the Commission had put forward when it pushed the Directive through, and the MEPs planned to obediently vote for the Directive. The only ones that didn't plan to support the Copyright Directive were the Euro-skeptic MEPs, and thank goodness they were there in the mix. reply bilvar 5 hours agorootparentprevBecause if you don't want to vote for them you are immediately branded far-right and a racist, and Europe will fall into a slippery-slope of re-Nazifying itself. reply Fredkin 4 hours agorootparentYou may also be branded far-left too.

In fact, I think this kind of effort alienates people and turns them precisely into a direction where they vent their frustration with the system on wrong avenues. In many ways, the people are voting for far-right politicians because there's been an intellectual elite that has told them again and again \"your concerns don't matter, so just shut up for a moment\". It turns out, they do matter. We ought to respect each other and listen to each other truthfully to be able to reach agreements. Overall, I'd say, large groups of people are more than capable of reaching reasonable outcomes. The problem is our system of politics are not really encouraging dialogue and change of mind. In fact, a politician changing their mind is seen as a bad thing and is usually punished. But that's just how the system is set up to be, of course, a politician is supposed to represent an electorate so the politician needs to be rigid in their views and the electorate is the one that needs to change. But this comes with the problem that electorate cycles are slow and \"the people\" have a much harder time accessing and parsing information than a politician might have. Ideally we'd ought to have a system where our representatives are capable and encouraged to come into an issue with an open mind, and upon deliberation decanting into a certain position. Regardless of political color. And I think that's kind of completely the opposite to \"these people should shut up\", no, they should speak up and be heard. But it should be done in a context that allows for a fair and reasonable debate. reply agile-gift0262 5 hours agorootparentprevI'd prefer a society where when people say something stupid they are pointed out where they were wrong and why, instead of encouraging people to shut up reply wait_a_minute 4 hours agorootparentRight, but the hall monitors don’t grant that benefit of the doubt to others in the first place.

We grew up playing the Game Boy and Spectrum HoloByte PC editions. Erik is even a Tetris Master. Nowadays you can play in your browser or on a Switch or on PS4/PC/VR. Font design. Each letter and digit in this typeface is made up of exactly one of each of the Tetris pieces: (I), (J), (L), (O), (S), (T), and (Z). Furthermore, the letter is designed so that it can actually be constructed by stacking these pieces one at a time and be supported by previous pieces, as in Tetris. These designs were found by hand, aided by the BurrTools software which enabled searching for whether the Tetris pieces could fit inside a candidate outline for a letter. The piece colors roughly follow The Tetris Company's standard colors, or you can switch to black pieces. The initial rotations follow the standard Super Rotation System. Puzzles. In the puzzle font, the letters are at the correct rotations and horizontal positions, and their vertical position represents their drop sequence. Drop the pieces in your head (or via animate) to figure out what letter is encoded. • Even without puzzle font turned on, in the animated font, you can try to guess what the letter is before all the pieces have arrived. • One final set of puzzles: In the unanimated unpuzzle black-pieces font, try to figure out how one of each Tetris piece perfectly packs that shape. (This is the task that BurrTools is very good at.) Related mathematics. (Perfect-information) Tetris is NP-complete, meaning that it's computationally intractable to figure out whether you can survive, or clear the board, given an initial board configuration and a sequence of n pieces to come. Similar results hold for k-tris played with k-ominoes instead of tetrominoes. Most recently, we analyzed the complexity of Tetris with few rows or columns; this font appears in that paper. Acknowledgments. This font was inspired by a collaboration with Alex Streif and Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises during BRIDGES 2017, where we started designing a font using just 5 pieces: the “free tetrominoes” where S is the same piece as Z and J is the same piece as L. Relatedly, Kate Jones designed other polyomino fonts included in some Kadon manuals. By contrast, this typeface aims closer to the rules of Tetris, where reflection matters and the pieces must stack and be supported.

One of most practiced pattern is the chevron, where you draw a > shape with holes, but otherwise fill the whose board. This stemmed from the Japanese arcade version of Tetris by Sega (or Segatet for those in the known). This version was hugely popular in the arcade (it stayed for an incredibly 10 years in the top100 earner in some arcade magazine), and some player were destroying the game so much that they invented this challenge. This was recognized in Segatet successor Tetris the Grand Master (TGM3), and formally named \"Secret Grade\".

    "originBody": "Announcements Claude 3.5 Sonnet Jun 21, 2024●4 min read Try on Claude.ai Today, we’re launching Claude 3.5 Sonnet—our first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. Claude 3.5 Sonnet raises the industry bar for intelligence, outperforming competitor models and Claude 3 Opus on a wide range of evaluations, with the speed and cost of our mid-tier model, Claude 3 Sonnet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app, while Claude Pro and Team plan subscribers can access it with significantly higher rate limits. It is also available via the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. The model costs $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with a 200K token context window. Frontier intelligence at 2x the speed Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval). It shows marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone. Claude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus. This performance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing, makes Claude 3.5 Sonnet ideal for complex tasks such as context-sensitive customer support and orchestrating multi-step workflows. In an internal agentic coding evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of problems, outperforming Claude 3 Opus which solved 38%. Our evaluation tests the model’s ability to fix a bug or add functionality to an open source codebase, given a natural language description of the desired improvement. When instructed and provided with the relevant tools, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can independently write, edit, and execute code with sophisticated reasoning and troubleshooting capabilities. It handles code translations with ease, making it particularly effective for updating legacy applications and migrating codebases. State-of-the-art vision Claude 3.5 Sonnet is our strongest vision model yet, surpassing Claude 3 Opus on standard vision benchmarks. These step-change improvements are most noticeable for tasks that require visual reasoning, like interpreting charts and graphs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also accurately transcribe text from imperfect images—a core capability for retail, logistics, and financial services, where AI may glean more insights from an image, graphic or illustration than from text alone. Artifacts—a new way to use Claude Today, we’re also introducing Artifacts on Claude.ai, a new feature that expands how users can interact with Claude. When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows. This preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate. Commitment to safety and privacy Our models are subjected to rigorous testing and have been trained to reduce misuse. Despite Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s leap in intelligence, our red teaming assessments have concluded that Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains at ASL-2. More details can be found in the model card addendum. As part of our commitment to safety and transparency, we’ve engaged with external experts to test and refine the safety mechanisms within this latest model. We recently provided Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the UK’s Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) for pre-deployment safety evaluation. The UK AISI completed tests of 3.5 Sonnet and shared their results with the US AI Safety Institute (US AISI) as part of a Memorandum of Understanding, made possible by the partnership between the US and UK AISIs announced earlier this year. We have integrated policy feedback from outside subject matter experts to ensure that our evaluations are robust and take into account new trends in abuse. This engagement has helped our teams scale up our ability to evaluate 3.5 Sonnet against various types of misuse. For example, we used feedback from child safety experts at Thorn to update our classifiers and fine-tune our models. One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development is privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models. Coming soon Our aim is to substantially improve the tradeoff curve between intelligence, speed, and cost every few months. To complete the Claude 3.5 model family, we’ll be releasing Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Opus later this year. In addition to working on our next-generation model family, we are developing new modalities and features to support more use cases for businesses, including integrations with enterprise applications. Our team is also exploring features like Memory, which will enable Claude to remember a user’s preferences and interaction history as specified, making their experience even more personalized and efficient. We’re constantly working to improve Claude and love hearing from our users. You can submit feedback on Claude 3.5 Sonnet directly in-product to inform our development roadmap and help our teams to improve your experience. As always, we look forward to seeing what you build, create, and discover with Claude.",

    "commentBody": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet (anthropic.com)426 points by squadrick 4 hours agohidepastfavorite175 comments netsec_burn 2 hours agoOpus remained better than GPT for me, even after the release of GPT-4o. VERY happy to see an even further improvement beyond that, Claude is a terrific product and given the news that GPT-5 only began its training several weeks ago I don't see any situation where Anthropic is dethroned in the near term. There are only two parts of Anthropic's offering I'm not a fan of: - Lack of conversation sharing: I had a conversation with Claude where I asked it to reverse engineer some assembly code and it did it perfectly on the first try. I was stunned, GPT had failed for days. I wanted to share the conversation with others but there's no way provided like GPT, and no way to even print the conversation because it cuts off on the browser (tested on Firefox). - No Android app. They're working on this but for now, there's only an iOS app. No expected ETA shared, I've been on the waitlist. I feel like both of these are relatively basic feature requests for a company of Anthropic's size, yet it has been months with no solution in sight. I love the models, please give me a better way of accessing them. reply sk11001 1 hour agoparentBoth GPT-4 and 4o have been completely useless for coding in the past couple of weeks for me - constant errors, and not just your typical LLM inaccuracies but incapable of producing a few lines of self-consistent code e.g. defines variables foo on one line and refers to it as bar on the next, or it misspells it as foox. reply labrador 3 minutes agorootparentWaht language?

I wonder why reply netsec_burn 21 minutes agorootparentHave you tried 3 Opus or 3.5 Sonnet? Are you using it for programming, or something else? reply SubiculumCode 20 minutes agoparentprevI do wonder if GPT quality fluctuates seasonally, or with electricity costs, in an engineering effort to balance costs with performance. I agree on all your points, but would like to emphasize that I really do enjoy the voice input voice output thing that chatgpt's app has. Its not how I use it when working, but when commuting, a lot of times, I'll turn on the the chatgpt app and have a conversation with it exploring ideas related to work or side projects. Its better than NPR, and I can't listen to the '3d6 Down the Line' podcast everyday, just once a week. I've been subscribed to PHind, which is a decent service allowing access to their models, chatgpt 4 turbo and o, and claudes. Its been incredibly useful, especially with their search integration. Unfortunately, while chatgpt can be used 500 times a day, Claude is only 10, although I guess it goes into an API like payment mode after that on top of subscription. I sure wish I'd buckle down and calculate my usage to really get an idea of whether subscription is cheaper or more expensive for me compared to API. reply henry_viii 15 minutes agoparentprev> Lack of conversation sharing... [there is] no way to even print the conversation because it cuts off on the browser (tested on Firefox).

But for this specific model it seems to be broken... I hope that gets noticed and fixed soon. reply gotrythis 2 hours agoparentprevWhat I understand is that it's GPT 6 that just went into training, and that GPT 5 is complete and being delayed until after the U.S. election. reply ilaksh 27 minutes agorootparentI also believe that gpt-4o was originally called gpt-5. If you look at the image generation on their website from gpt-4o which has not been released, I believe that along with the voice caused Ilya to declare mission accomplished (AGI) and that is why there was a coup. The coup failed because no one wanted to wrap up the company or change the way it operated because they would lose a lot of money. The reason the name was changed was because there was a big public scare about gpt-5 taking over and so Altman had to promise not to release gpt-5 soon. So they changed the name to gpt-4o (omni). Which is A) obviously dramatically a different architecture, B) a huge step up in capabilities (most still unreleased) C) very general purpose. Because of A) and B), this should obviously be a new major version (5). Yes, this is speculation, but it's very obvious speculation to me. It's weird for me that most people not only don't share this view but seem to absolutely hate when I say it. reply PaulWaldman 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd after GPT-5's release, what would be the plan for subsequent elections? This seems to be a temporary play in delaying AI regulation if public sentiment further becomes that AI can have a strong influence in the elections. reply futureshock 1 hour agorootparentIt’s absolutely temporary, but 4 years feels like an eternity in this field and the m sure the major players would love to have that much time to entrench themselves before they have to battle “AI ban” legislation. reply imjonse 1 hour agorootparentprevGPT-5 will make elections obsolete :) reply Sysreq2 40 minutes agorootparentRoko would be proud of you.

The big AI players really don’t want AI to become an election year punching bag and don’t want any major campaign promises around AI to placate a spooked electorate. And they really don’t want it to be revealed that generative AI powered bot armies outnumber real human political discourse 10-1. And they absolutely do not want an AI generated hoax video to have a measurable effect on the polls. It’s a stopgap. If we get through this election without a major public freak out, it gives the industry 4 more years to take LLMs out to the point of diminishing returns and figure out safety before we get knee jerk regulation. reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is pure speculation, right? reply sva_ 1 hour agorootparentprevSource: trust me bro reply sebzim4500 1 hour agoprevUsing this is the first time since GPT-4 where I've been shocked at how good a model is. It's helped by how smooth the 'artifact' UI is for iterating on html pages, but I've been instructing it to make a simple web app one bit of functionality at a time and it's basically perfect (and even quite fast). I'm sure it will be like GPT-4 and the honeymoon period will wear off to reveal big flaws but honestly I'd take this over an intern (even ignoring the speed difference) reply mrinterweb 46 minutes agoparent> honestly I'd take this over an intern (even ignoring the speed difference) I'm sure you're not the only one who will feel this way.

No way to know what the future holds. reply jiveturkey 39 minutes agoparentprevi don't think the point of an intern is to have them do this kind of work. to me, it's just a side effect if they accomplish anything at all. if we take this to its logical conclusion, without the kind of basic training that comes from internships, where will we be in 5 years? reply vernon99 25 minutes agorootparentThe only hope is that intern level will also increase significantly with this, helping them to catch up with the fundamentals super quickly. reply seidleroni 3 hours agoprevI'm very impressed! Using Gpt-4o and Gemini, I've rarely had success when asking the AI models to create a PlantUML flowchart or state machine representation of any moderate complexity. I think this is due to some confusing API docs for PlantUML. Claude 3.5 Sonnet totally knocked it out of the park when I asked for 4-5 different diagrams and did all of them flawlessly. I haven't gone through the output in great detail to see if its correct, but at first glance they are pretty close. The fact that all the diagrams were able to be rendered is an achievement. reply swalsh 3 hours agoprevAfter about an hour of using this new model.... just WOW this combined with the new artificats feature, i've never had this level of productivity.

When I tell it it's off by a factor of a million it regenerates the output, and is wrong again. reply lumenwrites 3 hours agoprevI wish they'd implement branching conversations like in ChatGPT. And convenient message editing, that doesn't paste large chunks of text as an non-editable attachment or break formatting.

If you don't mind self-hosting, then it has branching, convo search, change models mid-chat, \"presets\" (save system prompts), and a whole lot more.

For a long while I've wanted a good \"pro\" UI that can connect to multiple different llm APIs Convenient editing and branching is one of the items in my roadmap already, what else do you think I could include? reply lumenwrites 3 hours agorootparentGood history search (including non \"main\" conversation branches) and convenient conversation management (bookmarking, folders, maybe something smarter) would be great. Also, maybe some convenient way to create message templates? I don't know how I'd implement this, I just know that I often write one long prompt that I reuse multiple times, with multiple minor tweaks/edits, and it'd be amazing to have a convenient tool to manage that. Also, good mobile/tablet support, convenient to use and without bugs (as I happen to spend most of my time writing prompts on my ipad, but that's just me).

I've been building an open source TypeScript agentic AI platform for work (DevOps related with an autonomous agent and software engineer workflow). The Claude 3 models had an influence on the design with their tuning on using XML and three levels of capabilities, and have been my preferred models to use. I remember having moments looking at the plans Opus generated and being impressed with its capabilities. The slow speed of requests I could deal with, but the costs could quickly add up in workflows and the autonomous agent control loop. When GPT4o came out at half the price it made Opus quite pricey in comparison. I'd often thought if I could just have Opus capabilities at a fraction of the price, so its a nice surprise to have it here sooner that I imagined! The agent platform isn't officially launched yet, but its up at https://github.com/trafficguard/nous I never liked the Langchain API when I looked at the examples so I built it from scratch. It has an autonomous agent with a custom XML-based function calling, memory and call history. The software engineer agentic workflow I initially dog-fooded with a prompt like \"Complete Jira XYZ-123\". So it gets the Jira description, finds the appropriate terraform project in GitLab, clones, edits (delegating to Aider), creates a MR and messages on Slack. It also has a UI for running agents, human-in-the-loop interactions etc. reply campers 1 hour agoparentFrom the Anthropic model guide: Agentic Coding Claude 3.5 Sonnet solves 64% of problems on an internal agentic coding evaluation, compared to 38% for Claude 3 Opus. Our evaluation tests a model’s ability to understand an open source codebase and implement a pull request, such as a bug fix or new feature, given a natural language description of the desired improvement. For each problem, the model is evaluated based on whether all the tests of the codebase pass for the completed code submission. The tests are not visible to the model, and include tests of the bug fix or new feature. To ensure the evaluation mimics real world software engineering, we based the problems on real pull requests submitted to open source codebases. The changes involve searching, viewing, and editing multiple files (typically three or four, as many as twenty). The model is allowed to write and run code in an agentic loop and iteratively self-correct during evaluation. We run these tests in a secure sandboxed environment without access to the internet. % of problems which pass all tests Claude 3.5 Sonnet 64% Claude 3 Opus 38% Claude 3 Sonnet 21% Claude 3 Haiku 17% reply modeless 1 hour agorootparent> The tests are not visible to the model > The model is allowed to write and run code in an agentic loop and iteratively self-correct during evaluation What does this mean?

I been a fan of Anthropic models since Claude 3. Despite the benchmarks people always post with GPT4 being the leader, I always found way better results with Claude 3 than GPT4 especially with responses and larger context. GPT responses always feel computer generated, while Claude 3 felt more humanlike. reply jamesponddotco 2 hours agoparentOne thing Anthropic did that I loved and think was very smart was building a prompt generator[1] into the developer console. The generator is tuned to generate prompts the way Claude prompts are supposed to be, which improves responses. And you can use it to improve your user prompt as well, not just your system prompt, which make responses even better. You can see examples of the prompts it generates here[2]. It significantly improved my experience with LLMs; I haven't touched GPT4 in quite a while, and GPT4o didn't change that. [1]: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-...

However, for a general potential well, the answer is more nuanced: Simple harmonic oscillator: In this case, the period T is given by: T = 2π√(m/k) where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. However, the frequency of oscillation ω = √(k/m), so T = 2π/ω. The spring constant k is typically proportional to m, making the period independent of mass. General potential well: For a non-harmonic potential, the period usually does depend on mass. The period is given by: T = 2∫dx/v(x) where v(x) is the velocity as a function of position. This velocity depends on the total energy and the potential energy: v(x) = √(2/m * (E - V(x))) Here, the mass appears explicitly, and generally doesn't cancel out as it does in the simple harmonic case. Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?\" >why do you say the spring constant k is typically proportional to m? a spring's force when stretched to a given length doesn't depend on what's attached to the end \"You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that error in my explanation.

Asking for some tweaks and refinements to adapt k-means to constrained cluster sizes produced some plausible algorithms and it was able to give a plausible time-complexity estimate. I eventually tripped it up by asking a maths question that a good secondary school student can answer: ------------------------------------------ Q: Let us say that a positive integer p is a \"prime-giver\" if the numbers p, p+2 and p+4 are all prime. Can you prove whether or not there are infinitely many prime-givers? A: This is an interesting number theory problem that touches on some deep unsolved questions in mathematics. Let's approach this step-by-step: First, let's consider what we know: For a number p to be a prime-giver, p, p+2, and p+4 must all be prime. This is a special case of prime triplets, which are three primes in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. Some observations: The smallest prime-giver is 3, as 3, 5, and 7 are all prime. The next prime-giver is 5, as 5, 7, and 11 are all prime. After this, all prime-givers must be odd numbers (as one of p, p+2, p+4 would be even if p were even). Now, for the main question: Are there infinitely many prime-givers? This question is actually related to some famous unsolved problems in number theory: It's a stronger version of the question: \"Are there infinitely many prime triplets?\" Which in turn is related to the more general Twin Prime Conjecture. The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2. This is still an open problem in mathematics, despite significant progress in recent years. If the Twin Prime Conjecture is true, it doesn't necessarily imply that there are infinitely many prime-givers. However, if there are finitely many prime-givers, it would imply some very interesting and unexpected behavior of the primes. Given the current state of number theory, we cannot definitively prove or disprove whether there are infinitely many prime-givers. Conclusion: We cannot prove whether or not there are infinitely many prime-givers. This problem is likely at least as hard as the Twin Prime Conjecture, which remains one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. What we can say is that if there are infinitely many prime-givers, they become increasingly rare as numbers get larger, due to the increasing scarcity of primes. However, their exact distribution and whether they are infinite in number remains an open question in number theory. ------------------------------------------ I think it got confused between my question and the study of \"prime triplets\" in which the first and last number differ by 6 (rather than 4). ------------------------------------------ Q: You seem to have confused prime-givers with prime triplets. In the second bullet point of your point 2, you claim that 5 is a prime-giver as 5, 7 and 11 are all prime. However, in my definition of prime-giver, it would need to be the case that 5, 7 and 9 are all prime, which is not true. Can you reconsider your answer in light of this? A: I apologize for that confusion. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for pointing this out. Let me reconsider the problem with the correct definition of prime-givers. Let's start over: Definition: A positive integer p is a \"prime-giver\" if p, p+2, and p+4 are all prime. Observations: The smallest prime-giver is 3, as 3, 5, and 7 are all prime. All prime-givers must be odd numbers (as one of p, p+2, p+4 would be even if p were even). Any prime-giver p > 3 must be of the form 6k+5 for some integer k, because: If p = 6k+1, then p+4 = 6k+5 is divisible by 5 If p = 6k+3, then p+2 = 6k+5 is divisible by 5 Now, for the main question: Are there infinitely many prime-givers? This question is actually easier to resolve than I initially thought. We can prove that there are finitely many prime-givers: Proof: Consider any prime-giver p > 3. We know that p, p+2, and p+4 are all prime. Now, p+4 ≡ 0 (mod 3) because: p ≡ 2 (mod 3) [since p is prime and not 3, it must give remainder 2 when divided by 3] So, p+4 ≡ 2+4 ≡ 0 (mod 3) But p+4 is supposed to be prime (by the definition of prime-giver). The only number that is both divisible by 3 and prime is 3 itself. So, p+4 = 3, which means p = -1. But p is supposed to be a positive integer. Therefore, the only prime-giver is 3. Conclusion: There is exactly one prime-giver, which is 3. The question of whether there are infinitely many is resolved: there are not. Thank you again for catching my earlier mistake. This problem has a much more definitive answer than I initially thought, and it's an excellent example of how a small change in definition can dramatically alter the nature of a mathematical question. --------------------------------------------------- This still isn't quite right, since p could have remainder 1 mod 3 (or at least, Claude doesn't consider this in the proof). I tried to get it to account for this but it then got very confused and claimed once again that 5 is a prime-giver. reply sshroot 2 hours agoprevWhat is the training cutoff for 3.5 Sonnet? reply bcherny 4 hours agoprevAwesome!!

(Cf. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719443) Prompt: Joe drove Sue to university. Afterwards he drove home again and drank a tea with her in the kitchen. ** There seems to be some inconsistency in the scenario you've described. Let me break it down: 1. Joe drove Sue to university. 2. Afterwards, Joe drove home. 3. Joe drank tea with Sue in the kitchen. The inconsistency arises in the third point. If Joe drove Sue to university and then drove home alone, Sue wouldn't be at home to drink tea with Joe in the kitchen. There are a few possible explanations: 1. There might be a mistake in the sequence of events. 2. Perhaps Sue returned home by other means before Joe had his tea. 3. Maybe \"her\" in the last sentence refers to someone else, not Sue. Could you clarify the intended sequence of events or if there's additional information that might explain this situation? ** \"If Joe drove Sue to university and then drove home alone, Sue wouldn't be at home to drink tea with Joe in the kitchen.\" Why not? ** I apologize for my mistake. You're absolutely right to question my assumption. There's actually no contradiction in the original scenario, and I made an incorrect inference. Let me explain: 1. Joe drove Sue to university. 2. Joe drove home. 3. Joe drank tea with Sue in the kitchen. I incorrectly assumed that these events happened immediately one after another, and that Sue stayed at the university. However, there's nothing in the original statement that indicates this time frame or that Sue remained at the university. Several perfectly reasonable scenarios could explain this sequence: 1. Sue's time at the university was brief (perhaps dropping something off or a short meeting), and she returned home before or around the same time as Joe. 2. The tea drinking happened later, perhaps in the evening after Sue returned from university. 3. Joe might have picked Sue up from the university before going home, even though this wasn't explicitly stated. Thank you for pointing out this flaw in my reasoning. It's a good reminder to avoid making assumptions not supported by the given information. The scenario as presented is entirely plausible without any contradictions. ** Why can't Sue be both at the university and at home at the same time? ** I apologize for my oversight. You're absolutely correct to challenge this assumption as well. The reason Sue can't be both at the university and at home at the same time is due to the principle of non-bilocation, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical reality. Let me explain: 1. Non-bilocation: In our everyday physical world, a single person cannot occupy two distinct locations simultaneously. This is a basic principle of classical physics and our common understanding of space and time. 2. Mutually exclusive locations: The university and home are understood to be separate, distinct locations. Being in one location precludes being in another at the exact same moment. 3. Continuity of existence: We generally assume that people exist continuously in one location at a time, moving between locations over time. However, it's worth noting that there are some scenarios where this principle might seem to be violated: 1. Quantum mechanics: At the quantum level, particles can exhibit properties that seem to defy this principle, but this doesn't apply to macroscopic objects like people. 2. Metaphorical or spiritual interpretations: In some philosophical or religious contexts, one might speak of a person being in two places at once in a non-literal sense. 3. Technology: Video calls or virtual presence might give the impression of being in two places, but physically the person is still in one location. Thank you for this question. It's an excellent reminder to examine even our most basic assumptions about reality. reply xfalcox 3 hours agoprevThey said it is available on Bedrock, but it isn't :( reply jasondclinton 2 hours agoparentIt's live now!

Use the shovel to dig a small trench near the shore. 2. Fill the boat with water and sink it in the trench. 3. Place the stoat in the boat and cover it with the handkerchief to keep it calm. 4. Use the rope to pull the sunken boat across the river. That's just a worrying degree of absent logic. Nothing about that makes sense. It does circle back to say \"This method keeps you dry and provides a unique solution. However, a simpler approach would be to just use the boat normally and keep the other items as potentially useful tools.\" And that really summarizes my whole problem with LLMs -- if I were using this in a scenario that wasn't so obvious, say programming, I would have no idea steps 1-4 were nonsense. If the LLM doesn't know what's nonsense, and I don't know, then it's just the blind leading the blind. reply zamadatix 1 hour agoparent> Claude 3.5 says to just bring the goat across in the boat, which is wrong but better than previous versions. So that's an improvement. Sometimes it's funny to me how we can have such a feeling the responses are so obviously wrong in some way but then don't even see it the same way between ourselves. Imagine someone strikes up a conversation with you saying they've got a truck & a sofa with them and they want to know how to get to Manhattan. You say \"just drive the sofa over the bridge\" and they say \"Good, but wrong. I don't need the sofa to get to Manhattan\". You'd probably say \"okay... so what are you going to do with this sofa you said you had with you\"? Of course, like you point out, LLMs sometimes take those associations a little to far and where your average person would say \"Okay, they're saying they are with all of these things but probably because it's a list of what's around not a list of what they need to cross with\" the LLMs are eager to answer in the form \"Oh he's with all of these things? Alright - let's figure out how to use them all for them regardless of how odd it may be!\". reply ModernMech 1 hour agorootparentFor me, the problem with LLMs is their infinite capacity to ad lib and improv; it feels like trying to solve real problems during a taping of \"Whose Line is it Anyway?\" Yeah of course it's not a realistic scenario for humans, but the LLM is not a human, it's a tool, and I expect it to have some sort of utility as a tool (repeatability, predictability, fit for purpose). If it can't be used as a tool, and it can't replace human-level inference, then it's worthless at best and antagonistic at worst. I started testing with the goat/boat prompt because it was obvious given the framing that the LLM was trying to pattern match against the logic problem involving a wolf. Really takes the magic out of it. Most people who hadn't heard the puzzle before would answer with straight up logic, and those who had heard of it would maybe be confused about the framing but wouldn't hallucinate an invisible wolf was part of the solution as so many LLMs do. To me this just highlights how I have to be an expert at the domain in which I'm prompting, because otherwise I can't be sure the LLM won't suggest I drown a ferret. reply qmarkgn 4 hours agoprevThe trial requires a signup with an email address.

    "originBody": "search TALISMAN general Information Unix serverDebut of X 19 June 1984 From: rws@mit-bold (Robert W. Scheifler) To: window@athena Subject: window system X Date: 19 Jun 1984 0907-EDT (Tuesday) I've spent the last couple weeks writing a window system for the VS100. I stole a fair amount of code from W, surrounded it with an asynchronous rather than a synchronous interface, and called it X. Overall performance appears to be about twice that of W. The code seems fairly solid at this point, although there are still some deficiencies to be fixed up. We at LCS have stopped using W, and are now actively building applications on X. Anyone else using W should seriously consider switching. This is not the ultimate window system, but I believe it is a good starting point for experimentation. Right at the moment there is a CLU (and an Argus) interface to X; a C interface is in the works. The three existing applications are a text editor (TED), an Argus I/O interface, and a primitive window manager. There is no documentation yet; anyone crazy enough to volunteer? I may get around to it eventually. Anyone interested in seeing a demo can drop by NE43-531, although you may want to call 3-1945 first. Anyone who wants the code can come by with a tape.

Still remember that feeling of first typing xeyes & and xlock & and inspecting the result on that 14\" color CRT screen (I was beaming more than it, perhaps). Then by winter term 1996 I owned a refurbished HP9000-715/75 running HP-UX 9.03 (also X11-based), pre-owned and via uni discount and still the price of a car at the time... the only undergrad on my corridor who had a workstation in the dorm room (its 21\" CRT filling most of the 9 m² space that was not occupied by the bed). My next goal then was to get all the manual books (X11 and HP-UX) - still got 'em. HAPPY 40th BIRTHDAY, X11! And thanks to the X11 authors for making it available for free - imagine, X11 supported mice with 16 buttons already back then! reply technothrasher 21 hours agoparent> the only undergrad on my corridor who had a workstation in the dorm room In 1993, I worked my way up to becoming the lab manager for the residential computer lab in my dorm (basically a bunch of Macs for people to use, as we were the dorm farthest away from the library's undergrad computing center). I did that so I could put my SGI Indigo XS24 directly onto the 10Base2 Ethernet, rather than connecting it via the university's phone system in my room using PPP at 57kbps. I went back for a reunion about five years ago and the lab was still running (although in a different dorm now). I talked to the kid running it, who was nice enough, but he said nobody used the lab really, and he didn't know the first thing about networking. He was a gamer who \"wanted to learn more about Linux\". I tried to keep an open mind, times have changed, and he was eager, but boy was it depressing that the old culture is long dead. reply linguae 19 hours agorootparentAs someone who has taught university courses recently, I’ve noticed that more colleges and universities are abandoning computer labs due to the ubiquity of affordable laptops, where many students are well-served by a cheap Chromebook or a used ThinkPad. I understand the costs of operating a lab, but I think we’ve lost a few things with the demise of the computer lab, from having a standardized environment in which students can run required software tools (many of my Cal Poly professors had a rule that all programming assignment submissions must compile and run on their servers running Solaris, solving the “it worked on my machine” problem), to the social experiences of being in a lab. I have fond memories of my times in the CS department’s lab at Cal Poly during the latter half of the 2000s. reply guenthert 10 hours agorootparent> the social experiences of being in a lab. Not sure, if I miss that. I read about hacker culture and such, but my own limited experience of the early nineties of the labs of a large university weren't all that romantic. I recall that some more experienced users poked fun at newbies (who didn't know of xauth) by making their workstation bloke like a sheep. While that was fun, there was no other interaction, quiet, anonymous and uninviting like a library reading room. Once me and a team mate shared a whole lab with only one third guy. My mate had a cold which he neglected and during the session passed out, hitting his head hard on the desk. I had to shout at the third guy to solicit his help. He seemed to be content hacking on his terminal and let my mate die as long as he'd be quiet about it. In the same lab (might have been the same session earlier, I don't recall) one fellow not being member of my team ran `crashme` on the shared server (pre-Solaris SunOS, iirc). He apologized with the words (paraphrasing) \"I didn't expect it would actually crash\" when the server in fact did. We were not amused. Mid nineties the labs got deserted as most everyone was working from home. reply bigger_cheese 17 hours agorootparentprev>professors had a rule that all programming assignment submissions must compile and run on their servers running Solaris This is what made me learn Linux, my universities comp sci also ran Solaris and required the assignments run under that environment. This was in early 2000's I hated the university computer labs they were full of Sun Hardware they all ran CDE desktop environment which I thought was ugly as all sin (it looked incredibly dated by 2000's). Someone in my class told me about SSH and that you could work from home. He gave me a stack of burnt cd's (with Mandrake - an old Linux distribution, which ran KDE) I was able to remotely work on my assignments from comfort of my home and I've been a Linux user ever since. reply CalRobert 10 hours agorootparentprevAny other Cal Poly folks around? Always seems like we're underrepresented compared to the Stanfords of the world. I wasn't even a CS grad (I tried to but CP wouldn't let me switch from physics, one of their less endearing policies) but being there in 2001, 2002 was a really cool time. I remember when the email went down and my roommate commented \"just SSH* in and use Pine\" and for some reason something clicked right then - \"oh yeah, you can do a whole lot more without the browser than with one\". I feel like that mindset was there when I was doing a coding exercise for a job a few years back and figured it made sense to just open a socket with netcat instead of building a whole REST API - it was fun (if non-robust!) I vaguely recall systems meant to help automatically register you for classes as soon as they became available, and even used their touch-tone based class reg system at one point. Anyway, ramblings. I ended up with a physics degree and going in to tech anyway; I wish they had just let me switch. * Hell, it might even have just been telnet. This was back when you could browse all your dormmate's media libraries and we shared freely, even unsecured wifi was common for a few years. reply adestefan 19 hours agorootparentprevI was the student manager of all Unix systems on campus in the late 90s. Included labs of Sun and HP workstations. Managed some system connected to various lab instruments around campus, too. We stood up the first Linux lab around 1998, but most students preferred the Solaris workstations. People were just starting to put their own Linux systems on the dorm networks. It was still pretty rare for most students to even have computers in their dorm at the time. Even supported the last remaining VAX because no one else dared dig into the wall of manuals to figure out how it worked. Was a fun time. reply technothrasher 17 hours agorootparentVery similar to my experience! By the time I was a senior in '94, I was the student employee for the University Computing Center's Unix group and had to run around fixing all the workstations on campus and spent a lot of time administrating the various departments multi-user servers. Didn't touch the VMS machines though, there was a different group for that. I don't believe they had a student employee. reply mhh__ 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was a student I did find myself longing for a kind of cozy computer lab experience but it was basically impossible. I consider myself as part of the one of tbe last generation where people had to use a computer (e.g. I remember windows XP and even older somewhat vividly but never owned a non-smart phone) and even then I was sat next to people who could barely type so could never really do anything without being taken out of the zone. The culture does exist but the average is so mediocre/disinterested that they don't bother (there's no reason to) \"going\" to the computer anymore. I think that's slightly sad in, nerds are much more social than most people realise. Thinking about it I did get a little bit of that experience at school in that I learnt a lot of the basics of programming by playing with compiler explorer in the back of my computing and D&T lessons. reply ielillo 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was an undergrad, the Linux and Mac computer labs were always empty since no one knew how to use them. It was great during end of semester, since all the Windows labs were crammed with desperate students trying to finish their papers, you knew that there was always computers available in those labs. reply linguae 18 hours agorootparentI remember the same thing at Sacramento City College around 2003-05 when I was taking classes as a high school student. It was hard to reserve a PC in the library running Windows XP; sometimes there were long lines. However, the Macs in the library running Mac OS 9 were usually available. Because I grew up on System 7 in elementary school, I had no problem using Mac OS 9. In addition, the graphics communication department had a lab open to all students whenever no classes were using the lab. That lab had dozens of Power Mac G4s running Mac OS X Jaguar. That was my favorite lab on campus. But once I started taking computer science classes, we had exclusive access to labs running Windows XP that were stocked with development tools such as Visual Studio. After high school I went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where the CS department highly encouraged the use of Unix, whether it was Solaris on servers, Linux on desktops, and Mac OS X, “bougie Unix” for those who could afford MacBooks. Most CS students at Cal Poly only used Windows for games and for non-CS courses that required Windows-only software tools. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agoparentprevI bought a NeXTStation after I graduated.

I guess streaming audio was considered too exotic in the 1980s, but getting sound to chase X applications around is still an unsolved problem. I think it would have forced Linux and other Unix-like OSes to fix their broken and crufty audio subsystems much earlier. It was a real nightmare getting audio out of sound cards back in the 90s and even 2000s. I still remember having startx finally work properly on my FreeBSD 2.1 system running on a Pentium-75 with 16MB of RAM (so luxurious!) back in 1995. The fixed sync monitor[1] coming to life with that black and white crosshatch pattern, and probably TWM decorating that terminal window that would shut down X if you closed it. Luckily at that time there were quite a number of window managers so you could try a bunch to see which one you liked the most. The hardest part of getting X running was tracking down those magic numbers you had to enter for the modeline in the configuration file, although old X used to ship with a database you could look up of older monitors that were no longer in production, but might be kinda close to what you had.

I made a TCL/Tk sound mixer that supported NetAudio for multi player SimCity on TCL/Tk. NetAudio really sucked. That's probably why nobody uses it (or X terminals) any more. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20313616 DonHopkins on June 29, 2019parentcontextfavoriteon: Red Hat Expecting X.org to “Go into Hard Maintenan... NCD (Network Computing Devices), who made X Terminals, came up with a sound server called \"NetAudio\", based on the X11 server, protocol and client library, with the graphics ripped out and sound stuck in. I used it in the early 90's to support the Unix/X11/TCL/Tk multi player version of SimCity, with a scriptable TCL/Tk audio server that could drive either /dev/audio on Sun/SGI/etc or NetAudio on NCD X Terminals. Other TCL/Tk clients like SimCity (but possibly others) communicated with it via the TCL/Tk \"send\" command, which bounced messages off the X server. http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcity-announcement... NetAudio had its problems, but basically worked. Except that it insanely mixed audio by AVERAGING (add waveforms then divide by the number of sounds) instead of adding and clipping, and I couldn't convince the NCD engineer that was the wrong way to mix sound, and to just add and clip instead, like sounds mix in the real world: When you talk over music, the music volume and the volume of your voice doesn't magically lower by half. Hopefully they've fixed that problem by now. https://donhopkins.com/home/archive/NeWS/sound-mixers.txt It evolved into the Network Audio System (NAS): http://www.radscan.com/nas.html I can't say how popular it is, or if anyone actually uses it, though: The Release version is now 1.9.4 (10/07/2013). reply jandrese 6 hours agorootparentIt kinda worked, but nobody used it.

Wayland disintegrates things that were integrated in X, like drawing pixels to the screen - now you have to do that with the graphics driver, and (I hope that) Wayland tells you which graphics device to use. Usual disintegrated style would be that your X root window would have some X properties containing the addresses and auth tokens of your dbus server, CUPS server, audio server, etc and if an app wants to access those things, it makes a separate connection to those services. reply convivialdingo 17 hours agoprevMy story about X windows... I was invited to the Atlanta Linux Symposium in the late 90s and met just about everyone around the Linux/Slashdot/X11 world. I had been hacking on OpenGL drivers and one of the first to \"integrate\" 3dfx 2d acceleration into X. I had a wonky alpha AXP desktop I'd built from random parts and porting X11 to 64 bits on Linux as the code & binary was actually still 32bit. I'm chatting with rasterman for a bit and up walks an older gentleman. He'd been listening in on our conversation and was eager to get my take on X. I told him straight-up I thought it was kinda crappy and it should have used blah blah bah. He said \"I'm Jim Gettys and I co-wrote X windows..\" I was aghast...Oh shit. He laughed and we had a long conversation about how X was implemented. reply debo_ 20 hours agoprevIt took 40 years to get its own social network, for shame. I remember the first time I saw an X terminal in my first year at college. I didn't have a computer of my own, and windows labs were overcrowded, so I figured I'd cut my teeth and learn this Unix thing a year earlier. It was SunOS with twm, and the defaults made the font size unreadably small. I went to the bookstore, bought some Unix beginner's guide (I made sure it had an xwindows chapter, since I mistakenly thought I was using an \"xwindows OS.\") I spent more time figuring out that environment than I did working on my assignments, but I had a great time. The advantage of working in a lab with older students is I could see what they had on their screen and ask them about it. Lovely memories.

Does anyone remember that era well enough to know the details? reply ssl-3 17 hours agoparentI used to use custom modelines to overclock CRT monitors. Monitors had a spec, of course -- and it was easy-enough to stay within that spec. They were bandwidth-constrained, but as analog devices that bandwidth was always somewhat flexible. So why have settle for 1024x768 at 75Hz that the book says will work, when that same 15\" monitor would do 1360x1020 or more at a similar refresh rate and still have readable tiny text? Why not run a 19\" monitor at 2130x1598? \"You can fit so many xterms in this baby!\" And why not shrink down the vertical blanking interval and front and back porches as far as possible before geometry got too bad, to maximize the number of pixels that could be pushed down the wire within a given bandwidth? And why not tweak the trimpots inside to put the monitor's front panel controls into a better range for this kind of service? Fun times, those. The quality of the VGA cable made a substantial difference in smear when pushing things hard enough (literally bandwidth-throttled video), and getting a better DAC to drive the kit with (for even more literal bandwidth) was a primary motivation for periodically finding a better video card. (No fires to report even after a decade and a half or so of these games. Sorry. I guess if any of this stuff ever caught on fire I'd have found a different approach.) reply jedberg 19 hours agoparentprevIt probably wouldn’t set the monitor on fire, but this was before they added confirm/revert for resolution changes, so if you put it in an unsupported mode, you couldn’t get it back without booting from the install media. And it could damage the monitor in the process. reply ssl-3 17 hours agorootparentThat's what ctrl-alt-backspace was for: To exit X and get back to a BIOS-based text terminal (ideally, one set to some absurd tinytext mode with SVGATextMode), so the modeline could be adjusted. reply immibis 9 hours agorootparentprevSome displays piggybacked the high voltage generator's oscillation on the horizontal sync signal because it was about the right frequency. Stopping horizontal sync in the right phase could lead to the high voltage generator acting as a short circuit. If you've got the kind of really cheap display that does this, maybe it also doesn't have a fuse... reply antod 19 hours agoparentprevI remembered the warnings, but was lucky enough to always have common predefined monitors that already had settings. Until probably about 2005 when dealing with an unusual monitor when I had to do my own modelines because nothing was working out of the box. Searched the web as much as possible to try and get horizontal scan rates etc, not quite feeling completely comfortable, then biting the bullet with my best guesses. Luckily it worked - to much relief that I hadn't burnt out one of the offices more expensive monitors. reply shirro 18 hours agoparentprevI had to configure modelines on my first PC, bought so I could run a *nix at home, specifically Linux. The video card was a Tseng ET4000W32 and that is about all I can remember about the hardware in that PC. PC monitors seemed to rejected frequencies that were out of spec and shut off so I think the hardware damage thing was an urban legend or it might have been a thing with screens that weren't designed for the consumer mass market. I didn't use X much initially because my version of the card wasn't properly supported in Xfree86 and had some colour/palette problem. Also the resolution and quality and size of cheap CRTs at the time made Xterminals less readable than the console IMO. The SVGA support in console for things like image viewers just worked. It was only when Mosaic came out that I started to run X more often and it wasn't my default for a few years I think. Before PCI, PlugnPlay and Windows 95 everything was configured with dip switches and port numbers and interrupts went into configs even on the DOS side. Partitioning a disk wasn't a trivial thing. Even so modelines seemed kind of silly even back then. When people say Arch is complicated I just chuckle to myself at how far things have come. reply ssl-3 17 hours agorootparentArch is complicated. It doesn't even come with man pages or documentation. \"Hi! Here's a Linux box with a getty and a shell, and you're lucky we even included that much. Good luck!\" At least when configuring XFree86 on Slackware in nineteen-ninety-something, I had local man pages and documentation to refer to out-of-the-box. reply tiberious726 15 hours agorootparentThe install medium had documentation loaded, and installing which forms of documentation you want to the persistent system is right in the installation guide reply ssl-3 15 hours agorootparentTIL. And that's great for people who know this, and who also know in advance what documentation they'll want in the future. It's less-great for people who have booted their new installation without knowing one or both of these things. I mean: I get it. I do realize that a line must be drawn somewhere on what to include or not include by default. I just don't like where that line is drawn in this particular instance. My feeling is that storage is cheap and plentiful... unless it isn't. It seems to me that the people who would benefit from superfluously-available documentation the most are the ones who are likely to have plenty of space available: They're newbs -- newbs who are not building something to fit into less than 2GB of flash, and who are not making a template that will be used for a thousand instances. They're just trying to get their feet wet. And it also seems that the people who would benefit most from a system that is a wee bit leaner due to a lack of auto-installed documentation are the same ones who would have the least amount of difficulty removing that documentation. reply bitwize 16 hours agorootparentprevXF86Config (or was it XF86Setup?) had some nice defaults for things like \"Monitor that can do 1024x768@70Hz\" in case you were like me and had an offbrand monitor not listed amongst the supported ones.

In contrast Wayland is mature enough that ChromeOS decided to go all-in on Wayland, and Microsoft uses it too, for WSL2. ChromeOS has been using Wayland in Crostini and ChromeOS's Android emulator for years, but only in the last year or so have versions of the OS rolled out to ordinary users that use Wayland also for the main UI (browser and task bar and such). Till then ChromeOS used a hand-rolled graphics system for that. Also Wayland was embraced many years ago by makers of graphical user interfaces for cars. reply guenthert 10 hours agorootparentApple didn't reject X, they acquired NeXT, which much earlier chose Display Postscript over X11 since Jobs was big on wysiwyg. The paperless office, promised decades ago, is finally here and with that wysiwyg a demand of the past. X had many competitors and outlived them all. reply hollerith 4 hours agorootparentThere is an Slashdot comment written in 2003 by Mike Paquete, who was working on graphics for the Mac, titled \"Why Apple didn't use X for the window system\": https://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=75257&cid=67... Note that the title of the comment implies that Apple had the option of incorporating X into OS X, as do these next 2 quotes: \"The window system . . . is graphics model agnostic, working equally well with QuickDraw, OpenGL, the Quartz drawing engine, X11\" (The final sentence) \"Been there, evaluated that,\" where \"that\" is a reference to X11. (If X11 was not ever an option for OS X, there would be no need for an Apple engineer like Paquete to evaluate it.) Although it makes points similar to the point you make (namely, some at NeXT or at Apple considered it important for hardcopy to look like it did on screen), Paquete's comment gives many other reasons that have nothing to do with hardcopy for why X was lacking for Apple's purposes. To summarize, Apple rejected X back in the 1990s for many reasons, most of which cannot be dismissed as demands from the past. reply ithinkso 20 hours agoparentprevI'm switching to Wayland on the New Year's Eve of the year of Linux desktop reply abridgett 21 hours agoprevI still remember playing Quake on Linux - with the X display being displayed on a different computer over the network.

This book is the missing tutorial, and it's been very useful to me. It even lead to the \"A little taste of HTMX\" series (https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-little-taste-of-htmx-part-1). After a year of using HTMX, I really like it and would encourage everybody to give it a try. It's nice for: - internal tools - midly dynamic websites It's not great for any web page you stay a long time on mobile on, though. I made a web app with it, and on my phone, you can't handle the fact the browser plays against you if you stay a long time with a tab open and goes in and out of the app. You really need a lot of control in JS for that. Also: don't try to avoid JS using it. It's a mistake many people do, and that's not how you get the best out of it. I regularly sparkle a little vanilla js or alpine in my htmx websites to make them nicer. And in some cases, I even have one lone page that loads a full vue/react because that particular section needs to be way more dynamic. It's not an XOR. You have now a whole spectrum of how dynamic and how much work you want to put in. Sometimes, I don't write JS at all, but it's not a requirement. reply dlisboa 8 hours agoparentCan you expand on it not being great for sites with long sessions? Why does that play into it at all, wouldn’t the tab just sit there and do nothing? Do you mean if you need interactivity when the user goes in and out of the page? reply BiteCode_dev 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately no, the tab doesn't sit there and do nothing. Mobile browsers will do all sorts of optimization, such as interrupting the network, slowing down the vm, putting it to sleep, caching and uncaching things without letting you know, and without a predictable pattern. If you use raw JS, you can deal with all kinds of errors manually, put in place recovery strategies, bust caches, etc. With HTMX, you just get sluggish behavior, or no behavior at all in your page, and you don't know why. Also like another person said, you expect your state to be the same, like the scrolling placement, but chrome might decide that no, you get a page refresh there, or you are somewhere else in the page on next switch. In this particular app, I have a raw JS counter, which is updated on the client to make it snappy, and by htmx to keep it up to date with other modifications. But the counter will be off randomly because Chrome messes with it. So I had to manually put many rules to know it's out of sync, and request the sync at the right moment. But the sync may not happen because Chromes decided so. So I should try several times, with exponential backoff, differentiates the different reasons of failures and update the DOM manually while handling various interactions with other components. At this stage, you are basically coding a lot in JS instead of getting the state from the server in HTML, so having VueJS + VueRouter + Pinia is going to be easier to manage, and you'll get more interactivity and optimistic updates on top. It's not worth it. Right tool for the right job and all that. It's mostly on mobile though. On Desktop, the HTMX app behaves perfectly. reply rmbyrro 7 hours agorootparentAbout the counter: without more details, it's hard to judge; by your description, though, it sounds to me as something you shouldn't be doing in the first place. About the state: there are plenty of ways to have a polymorphic backend responding with fragments or entire HTML pages, depending on state and what's required by the request. Can't see the limitation you guys are talking about. About the scrolling position, it's actually dynamically loaded content that messes everything. Browsers do a pretty good job keeping scrolling position, as long as the page loads with the same content as before. Which is easy with htmx and very hard to impossible with dynamic content. reply patates 6 hours agorootparent> as long as the page loads with the same content as before. Which is easy with htmx and very hard to impossible with dynamic content For example to implement an infinite scroll, you can use the htmx DSL to load additional rows like this: https://htmx.org/examples/infinite-scroll/ If I did this with react, I can use a session storage caching plugin, so how do you prevent the chain of load events on history back and page refresh with htmx? Now you are looking at service workers... I mean with a bit of extra JS and some additional APIs, nothing is strictly impossible but it's often that you go back to the architecture board when you are working with it. I don't dislike it though, not even close. React (and other similar tools) has (have) a place, so does htmx. reply rmbyrro 5 hours agorootparentWhy can't the number of rows loaded be stored in the URL? You could use hx-push-url [1] every time the scroll triggers loading more rows, updating the total number of rows loaded. When the browser refreshes the page, the backend will know how many rows to return. No need for complicated JS plugins and service workers. Just basic browser feature, HTTP and HTML. You have fewer ways of shooting your own foot. I think the modern frontend environment have a tendency to look for over complicated solutions. Most times I see people proposing JS to manipulate the browser, a simpler browser-based solution would be perfectly good. In most cases when I browse the web, the JS manipulation leads to very poor UX. Even when the developer is exceptionally good and can deliver better solution than the browser, the advantage gain is so small that it's not worth the effort. Unless you're Facebook and can dillute the high-quality development cost to billions of users. [1] https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/ reply wild_egg 5 hours agorootparentprevService workers seems like overkill HTMX has pretty simple controls for pushing history state from either the client or the server for each request. Add the current page into the URL every time you load a new section and when someone hits 'back', they can be given exactly the same content as they had before reply rmbyrro 5 hours agorootparentThat's one of the main problems I see in frontend development nowadays. Developers are taught to overkill everything. They implement things naively, admired of how \"smart\" their \"solution\" look, compared to a \"dumb\" browser. They shoot themselves in the foot all the time. Users suffer with bad UX. Projects move slowly and expensively. Everyone loses. reply rmbyrro 8 hours agorootparentprevI didn't understand either. Depending on RAM limitations, the mobile browser will kill the tab session. When the user comes back, it'll reload the page. But I don't see how this is different for htmx or JS websites. reply dietr1ch 8 hours agorootparentprevHe might be referring to the problem that URLs are not enough to get to a certain state, which you might run into when trying to share a specific view or when your browser heavily unloads your tab. I found this to be the biggest issue when building my webpage, I wanted to have a link like /blog/foo, but what exists out there is just / and the documents at /blog and /blog/foo are just the small fragments that get loaded once you click your way through / Ultimately I hacked around it by adding some js to every file beyond /, which redirected to / with some anchor, and having / restore the state through the anchor, but it doesn't look the same as regular links into a website (/#blog-foo vs /blog/foo) reply rmbyrro 7 hours agorootparentCan't see why you wouldn't be able to handle this with htmx. I see two scenarios: 1. User interacts triggering \"/blog/foo\", which should return a fragment You can add a \"?fragment=true\", or a custom header, or hidden input indicating the backend the desired behavior. 2. User's mobile browser reloads \"/blog/foo\" Respond with the entire page, including the fragments as if the user had interacted each step of the way. reply _heimdall 7 hours agorootparentThe \"HX-Request\" header is automatically included for every request triggered by HTMX.

Technically, it's a much bigger achievement than htmx, in that Adam Stepinski, the creator, had to create not only a hypermedia format but also a hypermedia client, which I've come to understand is the really hard part of creating a hypermedia system: https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-clients/ reply tengbretson 17 hours agoprevNo one appreciates this tide reversal back towards hateoas principles and semantic HTML more than me, but why does it always come with prescriptions to adopt some new tech?

It then incrementally improves this with htmx, because htmx extends HTML in a specific way: it generalizes hypermedia controls. It considers how to integrate scripting and JSON APIs into a hypermedia driven application. It then showcases Hyperview (https://hyperview.org) a novel hypermedia system for mobile application development. You can't implement things like infinite scroll or active search in plain HTML because plain HTML only supports hypermedia exchanges based on two hypermedia controls, links & forms, with two events, clicks and submits, and your target options are limited to the current window, an new window, iframes and a few other obscure options. htmx generalizes this, allowing you to implement more dynamic user interfaces within the hypermedia paradigm. reply jph00 17 hours agoparentprevThe unique and very special aspect of HTMX's approach is that it changes just 4 things in browser behavior (list from the Hypermedia book): - Any element should be able to make HTTP requests - Any event should be able to trigger an HTTP request - Any HTTP Action should be available - Any place on the page should be replaceable The default behavior of browsers (without HTMX) is that only A and FORM tags can make requests, only GET (A,FORM) and POST (FORM) HTTP actions are available, only click can trigger a request, and only the full can be replaced. By changing these 4 things, it opens up a huge range of possibilities, but requires learning very few new concepts. And it also lets you work in whatever language you're most comfortable with -- you don't generally have to use JS (e.g very useful for data scientists, who generally know python). reply Sephr 16 hours agorootparentThe changes you're describing are already here in standard HTML + JS. Every element can be replaced with custom Web Components that can cause requests. Content can be partially displayed with just a click, tap, keypress, etc. and it doesn't even require scripting! There are over 200 extant discrete methods that can be used to send network requests in web applications running in modern browsers. reply sahil-kang 16 hours agorootparentIf I understand correctly, the main selling point of htmx is that _html_ is extended with the attributes from GP: the idea being that a bulk of the interactivity of SPAs can be achieved via hypertext alone I think a more precise reading of GP's \"changes just 4 things in browser behavior\" is \"changes just 4 things in html behavior\" reply inhumantsar 14 hours agorootparent> the bulk of the interactivity of SPAs can be achieved via hypertext alone except that with htmx the backend is supposed to return htmx markup, so now the hypertext is smeared between two systems. this lack of separation is the main thing holding me back from using it in any serious effort. it feels like the \"full stack dev\" problem writ large. should my backend devs also be experts in front end? should my front end devs be digging into backend code? I'm a generalist myself but it's not reasonable to expect everyone to be a generalist, nor does it make good business sense. then there's the backend-for-frontend argument, which the manager in me always reads as \"we need to double the number of backend services\". it's a bit hyperbolic but still. reply simonbarker87 8 hours agorootparentYou should be using the same templates/partials/fragments/components that render in your initial page load as your responses to page updates. So to render a table you render each row from a row component - then in response to updating a row in the table your backend end point returns the row component and then htmx swaps it out and rebinds everything. Also, one big aim of htmx and this approach is to remerge the backend and frontend, like the old days. This is the aim of HATEOS (hypermedia as the engine of state) and if you came up in web dev in the past 12 years or so then it’s going to feel very alien. And honestly? Yes I think everyone should be a generalist otherwise you have just siloed your stack in away that increases both tech and business risk. Sure have someone who is an expert where needed but they should also be able to touch the full stack. Be a T, broad and deep on one thing. reply sahil-kang 13 hours agorootparentprevIf I was to tackle a simplified view of the problem I think you're describing: your frontend devs should provide the markup template the backend would interpolate and return In the scenario you've alluded to, your backend devs are currently producing json data and your frontend devs are interpolating that into markup in the browser. In the simplest case then, your frontend devs would just provide a markup template that can be interpolated with the json already being produced. In slightly less simple cases, they can provide a function to be called instead The gist is that the logic of taking data and producing markup should remain in the frontend dev's wheelhouse reply inhumantsar 7 hours agorootparentwith JSON, frontend devs can ignore chunks of it, or work with the backend devs to modify the payload. HTML, being a representation of a desired state rather than a neutral information exchange medium. is tricky to do that with. the frontend and backend devs would have to remain in lockstep with any changes made to the payload, ie the frontend and backend applications become tightly coupled. I don't really see how having front end devs hand off a spec saying \"we need this exact result format\" is better than a loosely coupled result in a standard format reply _heimdall 7 hours agorootparentIn a team where the backend devs can't work with the HTML templates for whatever reason, the frontend devs would be directly managing those. I definitely wouldn't ask my frontend dev to write a spec and hand it to me to make their template, the spec spec would effectively have to be the template source code anyway. Just get in there and work with the HTML templates themselves. reply dartos 8 hours agorootparentprevThe backend is expected to return html. HTMX is not a markup language reply noduerme 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich begs the question: Why mix logic with templates? reply sahil-kang 14 hours agorootparentI think this htmx essay [1] addresses the tradeoffs you may be getting at if you're thinking \"why html vs js+json\": the gist is that html is self-describing to the browser, so the backend can make changes to the html it produces and the browser will understand it without the frontend code needing to be updated If you're instead thinking more broadly in terms of \"structure vs layout\", I think the same reasoning for using something like tailwind css or higher-level web components may apply: i.e. the material you interact with is closer to your problem domain [1] https://htmx.org/essays/two-approaches-to-decoupling/ reply karmarepellent 9 hours agorootparentprevYou don't need to mix logic with templates. I just produce a context (result from database queries and some such) and pass it to a function that produces HTML from the data in the context. The data must not be changed in the templating function. This is something I try to avoid as well in order to maintain separation of concerns in the backend code. Edit for clarification: The context holds the data that is rendered as-is by the templating function. So any transformations from the \"raw\" database data and the context data happens beforehand and the templating function just turns it into HTML. reply recursivedoubts 15 hours agorootparentprevhtmx mixes logic with \"templates\" in the same manner that HTML mixes logic with templates: hypermedia control information is embedded in the hypermedia in the form of attributes reply _heimdall 7 hours agorootparentprevAccessibility is a royal pain in the ass if you replace every built-in element with a custom element. We'd be in a much better spot if browsers supported extending the built-ins. Without that, every custom element can only extend HTMLElement and all accessibility features in things like select menus are entirely up to you to reimplement. reply naasking 16 hours agorootparentprevExcept with htmx you don't have to leave your declarative html and dig into a whole other language. reply sapling-ginger 16 hours agorootparentYou might want to read the TFA, it's describing a \"whole other language\" they call Hyperscript on click send htmx:abort to #contacts-btn on htmx:beforeRequest from #contacts-btn remove @disabled from me on htmx:afterRequest from #contacts-btn add @disabled to me reply mega_tux 16 hours agorootparentHyperscript is totally optional, you can use vanilla js or something like alpinejs for extra stuff reply recursivedoubts 15 hours agorootparentprevhyperscript is a completely separate technology from htmx, it is designed to be an alternative to javascript and is very speculative htmx generalizes hypermedia controls, that's pretty much it, and it can be used with any scripting tool you'd like: AlpineJS, hyperscript (if you are brave), vanilla js, etc. reply troupo 11 hours agorootparentAll the hx-* attributes constitute a separate DSL with its own semantics and it requires the server to conform to this DSL that also subsumes a bunch of existing HTTP semantics like redirects. Get Some Content Control Click Me Get Info! Get Info!And so on. reply dartos 8 hours agorootparentThe point isn’t to erase the need for JavaScript entirely, but to make it possible to integrate and interact with a backend in a meaningful way using just mainly html. reply troupo 7 hours agorootparentThat literally isn't what I talked about. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparent3 out of 4 of your examples mentioned using js or a js-like DSL. Explain your point better reply troupo 6 hours agorootparentIt's enough to read the context of the discussion, don't you think? Original complaint: \"it's describing a \"whole other language\" they call Hyperscript\" Response: hyperscript is a completely separate technology. htmx generalizes hypermedia controls, that's pretty much it, and it can be used with any scripting tool you'd like My response: In reality [1] htmx defines its own non-optional DSL that you have to use. --- I will add that as with any organically grown nice-to-have utility DSLs it's quite haphazard (it's hyperscript-like in one place, js-like in another place, both in some other places etc.). But that's the nature of such ad-hoc informally specified DSLs [1] which can be easily verified by just visiting https://htmx.org reply recursivedoubts 6 hours agorootparentprevi agree we are tentatively working on a proposal with the chrome team that takes the most important concepts of htmx and integrates them into HTML using more standard attributes. Alex Petros, a core htmx dev, gave a talk at Big Sky Dev Con on this idea here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inRB6ull5WQ this will obviously be a much longer and more difficult process, but hopefully it will give HTML enough oomph that htmx will often be unnecessary all of that doesn't change the fact that the code above is hyperscript, not htmx reply naasking 5 hours agorootparentI'm convinced you can get most of htmx by extending standard attributes to other elements and using the standard on* attributes. htmx basically acts as a \"universal/general event handler\" that translates DOM events to requests and back to DOM events and modifications. It breaks down like this: * use on* html attributes to delegate events to a universal event handler * event handler pulls out the form attribute (if set), then pulls out action, method, target from element, or from the form if unset on the element (elements inherit these from the form they are tied to) * if action is a URL, then initialize a fetch request using specified URL and method; if method is POST, then add a FormData payload for the specified form * on fetch complete, the returned MIME type should match with the target attribute, which is extended to also accept a css selector: target=_self|_blank|_topcontent-type:text/html => redirectmorph/hx-boost + push-url target=css selectorcontent-type:text/html-fragment => morphinnerHTML So something like: click me I have ideas for extending beyond this, but this seems like the core of extending HTML to cover htmx semantics. reply recursivedoubts 5 hours agorootparentyep I think you could do a lot in this direction (see Alex’s talk) I would be hesitant to hijack existing attributes for more than a proof of concept at this point but maybe that’s me being too timid. reply wmanley 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's a shame that the list is in that order (both on the htmx website and in the book). Items 1 and 3 are simply not important, whereas 4 is by far the most important feature that HTMX offers. reply recursivedoubts 1 hour agorootparentsave the best for last! from the book: > This gives us our fourth, final and perhaps most important opportunity to generalize HTML: Opportunity 4 > HTML could be extended to allow the responses to requests to replace elements within the current document, rather than requiring that they replace the entire document. > This is actually a very old concept in hypermedia. Ted Nelson, in his 1980 book “Literary Machines” coined the term transclusion to capture this idea: the inclusion of content into an existing document via a hypermedia reference. If HTML supported this style of “dynamic transclusion,” then Hypermedia-Driven Applications could function much more like a Single Page Application, where only part of the DOM is updated by a given user interaction or network request. reply RodgerTheGreat 14 hours agorootparentprevThe downside being, naturally, that every single interaction requires a separate round-trip HTTP request, and a web backend that is far more stateful/sessionful than would otherwise be necessary. To some extent I can see the appeal for rapid prototyping, especially for those less familiar with JavaScript. In a production environment- especially a bandwidth-limited, high-latency environment like a mobile device- it incurs an outrageous overhead on end users and server resources for that developer convenience. reply jph00 13 hours agorootparentQuite the opposite, at least in some cases. The state lives in the HTML itself, and actual dev reports of large systems rewrites from react to htmx show faster systems as a result, not slower. In practice, it depends on what you're doing with it -- there isn't one right answer for all systems. reply wild_egg 14 hours agorootparentprev> every single interaction requires a separate round-trip HTTP request Why? It's not like JavaScript stopped existing. If you need something more interactive or dynamic, use JS. The two approaches are not exclusive. Some things can go to the server and some stay in the client. Your use case determines the balance. Easy. reply karmarepellent 9 hours agorootparentYes, I don't get why people always tend to drift into thinking in extremes when it comes to new tech. Like when using htmx or similar tech you would absolutely need to implement every piece of logic in the backend. Well, you don't. I have been very successful using htmx by using it only in interactions that make changes to my data, that is state. Other user interactions (e.g. strictly visual interactions) remain on the client. reply recursivedoubts 6 hours agorootparentprevhtmx does not require you to make a server request for every interaction: https://hypermedia.systems/client-side-scripting/ i would note that if you are going to make a server side request, HTML can be faster than the equivalent JSON: https://github.com/1cg/html-json-speed-comparison https://github.com/1cg/html-json-size-comparison reply hipadev23 13 hours agorootparentprevYou’re absolutely incorrect. reply simonbarker87 8 hours agorootparentprevRetuning the data as a json object vs sending it back with the relevant html really isn’t that much more data in the grand scheme of things. It’s more data but not very much, it’s not like you don’t need to sync with the backend with a json driven SPA. reply p_l 9 hours agorootparentprevFor a lot of applications, the size of request/response interaction might be comparable with what SPA would do anyway to synchronize data. If you need purely browser-side state to change, HTMX integrates quite well with writing such parts in JS (personally I like using Alpine.js for that) reply djeastm 42 minutes agoparentprev>You can implement all this stuff using literally any framework from the past 15 years if you want. Do you want to do that? I'd rather use what other people have done reply dgb23 11 hours agoparentprevHtmx is a very small, mostly AJAX related library with a nice structure that helps you do this in a principled way. There’s nothing special about it other thab doing pretty much exactly what you’d want. reply openrisk 8 hours agoprevFeels like a missed opportunity that the online version of the book isnt a demo of hypermedia in itself? Maybe a serious student of htmx could (as a learning exercise) transcribe the book from asciidoc into htmx? :-) Besides technical merit [1] in this era of tech hypes, manias and virality it helps to engineer some gee-wow moments... 2 cents. [1] (that htmx and friends definitely have, reminding us once again that \"any fool can make something complicated but it takes a genius to make it simple\") reply karmarepellent 5 hours agoparentWhen I look into the website source of the book I just see static HTML and CSS as well as a few media queries. Why would you want to use htmx to serve a completely static website? reply openrisk 5 hours agorootparentBecause many usage examples could be \"live\" as you go through the document learning about htmx functionality. Seeing is believing. The very same htmx-enhanced html pages deployed statically would (presumably) fall back to something still readable. Ofcourse there might be valid reasons to choose to deploy statically using adoc (reusing for pdf, minimal maintenance etc.) but my point is about maximizing the impact. reply djeastm 39 minutes agorootparent>many usage examples could be \"live\" as you go through the document learning about htmx functionality The examples at htmx.org itself are like this (e.g. https://htmx.org/examples/click-to-edit/) reply tb_data_apiary 14 hours agoprevI found Hypermedia Systems to be useful. Bought the hard copy as support/thank you to the authors, but the entire book is free online at hypermedia.systems. The documentation & essays on htmx.org further explain what you see in the book. htmx is a straightforward, simple-to-implement javascript library that brings HATEOAS to the top of your development mindset. You can disagree with the HATEOAS philosophy, but the reasoning and purpose of the approach is clearly and professionally explained by the authors. Yes, the gorilla marketing on x.com may rub some the wrong way, but frankly, it's fun. Humor and a useful product, with a deep rationale & good documentation, are wins in my book. reply dgb23 11 hours agoparentI love how you misspelled it as „gorilla marketing“.

I don't want to start another framework flamewar but was it something in particular that people stopped talking about it? reply rogerclark 26 minutes agoparenthtmx itself is not the future of anything. Businesses are not using htmx to make money and nobody is hiring for htmx. It's an ideological technology rather than a practical one. Maybe it'll inspire something that will turn out to be the future of frontend, but it won't be htmx as it is now. reply vga805 3 hours agoparentprevSvelte is great, htmx is great. I don't think the right way to think about it is that one of them is _the_ future of F/E development. One might be getting more attention at the moment but they are both (along with others) useful tools to have in the belt depending on the use case. I recently took over a flask web app. Using htmx with it to get a more snappier SPA feel in certain places was a true joy. Will I use it on a greenfield highly interactive webapp? I'm not sure yet. But it's been nice to discover a new tool that worked really well in a recent project I've taken over. The experience was a really good one so I'm not surprised it's been getting attention lately. reply MisterTw22312 1 hour agoparentprevHypes come and go. They rarely correlate to the real world usage. Spring, VueJS and Angular are huge, much bigger than HTMX will ever be, but nobody is raving about them. Svelte is still growing. Nothing has happened. React ecosystem is so full of commerce that there're always many voice talking about React. I often think that people praising HTMX are comparing it to React, which is by far the worst of all SPA frameworks. SvelteKit on the other hand is such a succinct yet powerfull all-in-one framework that HTMX (with the required backend with routing and template) appears clunky compared against it. But as I said, most people coming from React and I fully understand why HTMX appears as such a relief. Because it is in those cases. reply DrDroop 9 hours agoprev [–] What are you gonna do if you want to give a user the option to display the same search result in a html table and a map drawn on a canvas element, or maybe some info viz thing like a chart? No htmx fanboy has a nice solution for this. Im fine with making hyper media part of the synthesis but ignoring features that you have for free with modern hybrid ssr spa is not helping. reply MisterTw22312 1 hour agoparentThis is doable, but for complex and component heavy UIs with much JS functionality and client-side-state HTMX is probably not the ideal choice. But for many other use-cases it is. It's good for probably 70% of the use-cases, the other 30% are for SPAs. reply jdpage 9 hours agoparentprevI'm assuming that you're referring to the fact that if you get the data as JSON from the server side, you can use it to render out your multiple visualisations. If this is not what you're getting at, my apologies. If you send the HTML table over the wire, you can use it as the datasource for the other visualisations, same as you would with JSON. You can extend it with `data-` attributes if necessary to get some extra machine-readable information in there, but I have not needed to do that yet. On the application I'm currently working on, we do this and then have a listener on the htmx event to turn the table into a d3.js graph. It works pretty well, and has the advantage that if someone is using our application with JavaScript turned off, they still get the table with all the data. reply DrDroop 7 hours agorootparentNice, what if I have a 3D model and I want to show extra info in a html div about a vertex, edge, face or object that I have selected? reply gsck 3 hours agorootparentThis has nothing to with HTMX/Hypermedia, this is an issue with SSR. No pure SSR frameworks can do this. You would do this the same way you would in any other website, have the server send the data required (Hypermedia or not) and use client side JavaScript to do the client side reactivity. This is like asking why doesn't HTMX allow me to change the colour of a button when I hover over it, why should I have to do this on the client? reply bbg2401 6 hours agorootparentprevThen use a different tool which provides the precise capabilities you are needing? I'm confused by your hostility. HTMX doesn't have to solve every problem to be considered viable. reply DrDroop 5 hours agorootparentBoy you need to grow up quickly if you find this hostile already reply biftek 1 hour agoparentprevNo one is stopping you from still having a JSON API if your hypothetical use case requires it.

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider subscribing to LWN. Thank you for visiting LWN.net! By Joe Brockmeier June 19, 2024 Philip Hazel was 51 when he began the Exim message transfer agent (MTA) project in 1995, which led to the Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) project in 1998. At 80, he's maintained PCRE, and its successor PCRE2, for more than 27 years. For those doing the math, that's a year longer than LWN has been in publication. Exim maintenance was handed off around the time of his retirement in 2007. Now, he is ready to hand off PCRE2 as well, if a successor can be found. Punch cards to flat screens Hazel's tenure as a free-software developer is exceptional, if not record-breaking in its length. Linus Torvalds began working on Linux in 1991 as a college student and is still leading its development 33 years later with no signs of slowing. However, as Hazel wrote in his technical memoir From Punched Cards To Flat Screens, he began contributing to free software \"nearer the end than the start\" of his career. At the start of his career, Hazel was introduced to computers as an undergraduate when the University of Cape Town (UCT) received its first computer: an International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) 1301, with a dazzling capacity to read as many as 600 punched cards per minute. He attended introductory programming lectures, read the Manchester Autocode programming manual from cover to cover, and began writing test programs encoded onto paper punch cards: If you were lucky and your program worked, the output appeared on the printer; more often that not (at least at the start) all you got was an error message, which meant that you had to fix your program, return to the back of the queue, and hope to get another run before the end of the session. The more attempts it took to get a program to work, the more useful scrap paper one accumulated. He later moved on to the University of Cambridge as a PhD student. Cambridge was blessed with four computers when Hazel arrived in 1967: a Titan, IBM 1130, IBM 360, and PDP-7. Because Hazel knew the Manchester Autocode language, which is similar to Titan Autocode, he was given an account on the Titan \"and that was the start of the slippery slope down which I have been sliding ever since\". That slope, as well-detailed in Hazel's memoir (and mercilessly abbreviated here), ultimately led to his joining the Cambridge Computing Service as a software developer in 1971. During his tenure at Cambridge, and at home, Hazel had the opportunity to work with a number of interesting systems including the PDP-11, Ultrix, Sinclair ZX-81, and BBC Micro. In 1990 the Computing Service decided to set up a cluster of Unix systems for the use of staff and graduate students, and he began working with Sun boxes running SunOS. This coincided with the transition from the X.25 wide-area network standard to the Internet Protocol (IP). Hazel was responsible for the email service, and found it difficult to configure Sendmail to choose between IP and X.25 to deliver email. A colleague suggested that he try the free-software Smail MTA instead. Hazel took him up on the suggestion and added two features to Smail to manage the DNS lookups and decide whether to send mail via SMTP or X.25. While managing Smail for Cambridge, he submitted additional features to cope with messages that had bad senders: If such a message could not be delivered, the bad sender meant that an error report could also not be delivered, and the postmaster (me) had to intervene to sort things out. By rejecting messages whose sender address could not be verified, I pushed the onus of dealing with this problem out to the sending MTA. This kind of checking is now standard MTA practice (along with many other checks for spam and viruses). This was a small start that led Hazel to thinking about more checking and verification that would be needed for MTAs. He considered, but decided against, trying to modify Smail. It was written in pre-standard C and carried \"a lot of UUCP baggage\". Hazel wanted to write an MTA for modern (at the time) operating systems with standard C compilers and runtimes, and permanent connections to a TCP/IP network. He began working on the Experimental Internet Mailer (Exim) in March 1995. By November it was \"just about able to send and receive emails\". Exim Hazel had informed a colleague, Piete Brooks, that he was working on Exim. Brooks wanted to try it out, but Hazel demurred because he had not written any documentation. (This may be the first known case of a programmer refusing to distribute undocumented code...) Brooks response was \"I don't want the documentation, I want the code.\" Even so, Hazel insisted on writing a first cut of the Exim manual before packaging up the code and sending it off to meet its fate. Brooks put the code into service right away, and started telling others about it. Hazel put Exim releases on a public FTP site, and gave a talk on Exim at a \"Campus Mail Day\" in Aberdeen, which led to more usage. A request from Richard Stallman persuaded him to switch from a homegrown license for Exim to the GPL. It began being ported to other operating systems, and eventually found its way to Linux in 1997 or 1998, \"which by then had become an operating system that could be used in production environments\". Over time, Exim would become (and still is) a popular MTA used all over the planet. Its adoption far exceeded Hazel's expectations: I never expected commercial sites to get involved, nor for it to become the default MTA in any operating systems. In short, I did not foresee that it would grow into the fully-fledged open source development project that it has. PCRE Regular expressions play a rather large part in managing mail, and Hazel wanted to have more flexible regular expressions for Exim than were present in Smail. He chose a regular-expression library written by Henry Spencer for early versions of Exim, but found it limiting compared to Perl's extended pattern-matching features. He thought about lifting Perl's implementation, but it was too integrated to be easily adapted to Exim. \"In the end, I solved the problem the way programmers generally solve their problems: by writing something myself.\" That, of course, became PCRE. Hazel bundled PCRE with Exim and also released it as a standalone library. Like Exim, it filled a need that he did not even realize existed. PCRE was adopted by Apache HTTPD, and Hazel was \"particularly gratified\" to find that it had been included with the Postfix MTA. After a while, PCRE looked beyond Perl to include features such as recursion inside a regular expression, and named subpatterns (borrowed from Python), as well as other ideas taken from other regular-expression implementations. In 2014, Hazel decided that PCRE's API was \"not capable of much further extension\" and began working on a new, incompatible, version of the code. The first PCRE2 release (starting at version 10.00 to avoid confusion with then-current PCRE 8.x releases) was announced in January 2015. Hazel continued supporting PCRE until its final release in 2021. PCRE2 moved to GitHub in 2022. The most recent release of PCRE2, 10.44, came out on June 7, 2024. Hazel wrote that PCRE may now be even more important than Exim was \"because of its widespread use in many different applications and operating systems\". Indeed, just looking to see the installed software that depends on the PCRE2 library on Fedora 40 turns up use by Git, Grep, MariaDB, nmap, SELinux's command-line tools, Sway, Wget 2, and quite a few others. In his memoir, Hazel had written that it felt right to pass maintenance of Exim on to others after so long. \"More than a decade on one project is long enough.\" In his 2017 update to the memoir, he noted that the sentence had come back to bite him: He was still working on PCRE 19 years after he started to write it. Little did he suspect he would still be maintaining it in 2024. He would like to hand it off while he can help with the transition. Passing the torch I emailed Hazel with a few questions about his thoughts on long-term free-software maintenance, changes to the industry, and what he might do once PCRE was handed off. Hazel wrote that he does not have any post-PCRE plans. All of his projects, with the exception of the base to presentation form (B2PF) library for converting Unicode characters for printing, were started while he was still working. \"Since I retired I haven't felt a lack of anything enough to spur me into writing something new\". He added that he would continue to maintain his non-PCRE2 projects \"if necessary\" and would help with PCRE2 if needed. When asked how new generations of tools, and developers, had changed his work habits, Hazel replied that he has changed little. \"I am sufficiently old that I am well stuck in my ways, and haven't changed how I do things since the 90s\" with the exception of moving development to GitHub. He admitted that he was not good at anticipating or keeping up with trends in development. For example, he said he was not aware of Unicode when he began PCRE development, so it was written to support ASCII and with a limit of 64K for compiled patterns. Others had to persuade him to extend PCRE with Unicode support, and the option for larger patterns. Contributors, he said, have not changed. The world has, though: When I was born, there were no digital computers, though their predecessors, for example the Colossus at Bletchley Park, were around. The world has gone from nothing to where we are now in just one lifetime. Incredible! What particularly amazes me more than the CPU power is the amount of storage that I carry in my pocket. Hazel did offer some advice for those starting new software projects, though he noted he was not the first to make this point: It's worth remembering that the effort needed to maintain a piece of successful software over its lifetime far outweighs the effort of writing it in the first place. In the case of PCRE there have been several major re-designs and re-writes of the internals as well as continual extensions to the user-visible features. He also suggested that developers think about how software would be tested as it is designed: \"Effort put into building test harnesses is never wasted.\" I asked Hazel, given the recent XZ backdoor attempt, how he intended to vet any prospective PCRE2 maintainers. He replied that it was a good question \"to which I have no answer. I will have to see who (if anyone) makes an offer\". To date, he said he had received \"no communications whatsoever\" about taking over the project. Perhaps, once the word gets out more widely, a qualified maintainer will step forward to take PCRE2 into the future.

Though the code is, well, interesting at places, as a system administrator it's generally great stuff. I see more and more email coming in with invalid envelope senders, though, and callouts tend to trigger alerts in spam filters. So I'm not sure if this is as universal as the quote would have it to—certainly, if e.g. Gmail did such checks, nobody would send from junk addresses.

Who here even knew PCRE2 was looking for a new maintainer? I took over some fairly widely used Go projects, but only after they were archived. I had no idea they were looking for someone to maintain it. There's a bit of a catch-22 here: - If a project is already well-maintained then no one really needs to contribute anything. - If a project is poorly maintained due to lack of interest or time, then this will also discourage contributions – the first think I check before contributing is whether previous PRs are actually getting merged. For larger projects where there's always something to do, like Exim, this usually isn't a big issue. But for smaller more narrowly scoped projects like PCRE2 this is more of an issue. I'm not surprised he's having a harder time with PCRE2. reply apitman 39 minutes agoparentI worry about new maintainers who feel the need to leave some sort of a mark on projects by adding unnecessary features and dependencies. I get it, true maintenance of a stable project, where you only fix bugs and security issues, is not glamorous. It's a tired meme but we really do need some concept of \"finished\" in our field, along with the necessary incentive structures to enable people to do the needed maintenance on finished software in perpetuity. reply dingnuts 29 minutes agorootparentisn't the whole point of intellectual property law to align incentives? it's no coincidence that corporations that own proprietary code don't have this problem. has anybody considered that maybe Richard Stallman was wrong? maybe it ISN'T a good idea to volunteer your time to write libraries that corporations will use to make billions, while begging for donations. maybe, sometimes, libre licensing is a mistake specifically because it leaves maintainers with no reasonable avenue for compensation reply ekidd 4 minutes agorootparent> it's no coincidence that corporations that own proprietary code don't have this problem. Proprietary programs have a different, interesting problem: They eventually disappear. In 1995, the year PCRE2 was born, I was doing classic MacOS GUI programming on a 680x0 machine, running Metrowerks CodeWarrior as my IDE, and relying on a bunch of tools that are now gone. The proprietary technology I used in those days is now almost universally extinct. I think only BBEdit still exists. A couple of years later, I switched to Emacs and Linux, and they're still going strong a quarter century later. I hope to get another couple of decades out of VS Code (or a fork). I can deploy Linux apps to containers. And PCRE2 is still going strong. Oh, and I can still typeset math with LaTeX. I think there is real value in software that is \"done\", with stable APIs and very conservative maintenance, which can remain in use for decades. That's a world I want to live in. Let me keep using proven technology where appropriate, and switch only when I find a good reason to switch. > maybe it ISN'T a good idea to volunteer your time to write libraries that corporations will use to make billions, while begging for donations. I sometimes avoid letting my projects get too successful in order to minimize my support costs. But in general, if you want to earn money from software (open source or proprietary!), you're going to need to build an actual business. Using a proprietary license isn't magic. I can use a restrictive license, find no customers, and still earn no money. It's the easiest thing in the world. If you want money for an open source project, you're still going to need to focus hard on the business part. The easiest way to do this is consulting. Your users will still capture 99.9% of the value from your software, but a successful open source project can still be turned into decent revenue—if you keep working at the business side, too. Mostly, when I release open source, it's because I've created something useful, but I know that it would make a lousy startup for one reason or another. My employer is happy to go along. They see that a tool is useful internally, that we couldn't sell it to our customers without a massive pivot into a difficult market, and the tool isn't hugely useful to our direct competitors. So why not share it? Sometimes we get a useful PR! Even better, designing a tool to make sense as open source sometimes makes it more reusable internally. reply apitman 12 minutes agorootparentprevThese are definitely questions worth considering. > it's no coincidence that corporations that own proprietary code don't have this problem. I would argue they have a similar but worse problem. Someone at google creates an awesome product. They get promoted and leave the project. Someone else is assigned to maintain the product, which slowly gets worse over time either a) because the new maintainers are less skilled/driven or b) because programmers perceive themselves as being paid to write code, and it's fun, so they're going to change things even if nothing needs to be changed. I've seen so much commercial software get worse over time. I'm not sure if I have the causes right, but there's definitely something wrong with the model. In contrast, I've found open source software to be far better for far longer. It might stop being maintained, but it almost never gets worse in my experience. reply notRobot 11 minutes agorootparentprevSurely that's a decision to be made by the author(s) of the code? There is no objective \"right\" or \"wrong\" when it comes to libre. I have written dozens of libre projects. I don't want them to be proprietary. I don't want to make money from them. If I did, I'd simply use a proprietary licence, no one forced me to go libre. reply fanf2 2 hours agoparentprevThere’s a PCRE2 issue that Philip created last week, and which I submitted here, but it didn’t get much traction. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657607 This LWN article is helping to spread the word. (I worked with Philip before he retired.) reply arp242 1 hour agorootparentYeah, that's exactly the kind of stuff very few people are going to see. Even this HN post here is seen by relatively few people. Also, about 90% of the people respond will fall through. I'm sure people say \"yes\" with the best of intentions, but saying \"yes\" in a wave of enthusiasm is easy, and then spending a lot of hours on it ... not so much. My favourite example is someone who said \"yes, I'll help maintain\", was added to the GitHub repo, made a new issue with a long plan on how to deal with the many open issues, and ... was never seen again. Never actually dealt with any of the open issues. I'm sure this was done with the best of intentions (and their profile said they're a student, so I don't want to judge harshly), but this was a rather marked example that made me laugh. reply throw0101c 6 hours agoprevNot mention of the music software: > Hazel is also known for his typesetting software, in particular \"Philip's Music Writer\",[5][6] as well as programs to turn a simple markup into a subset of DocBook XML for use in the Exim manual, and to produce PostScript from this XML. * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hazel * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip%27s_Music_Writer reply neilv 6 hours agoprevI'm not sure this is correct, but I made a quick guess at which is the most representative Debian package for PCRE, and got this order of magnitude of direct and indirect dependencies for it: $ apt-cache --recurse rdepends libpcre2-8-0tr -d ' |'sortuniqwc -l 52160 reply adolph 6 hours agoparentLooks like another example for Explain XKCD: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2347:_Dependency https://xkcd.com/2347/ reply socksy 4 hours agorootparentAnd thus a good candidate for funding from https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/ , should there be some trustworthy individual or group that could maintain it (I always felt like while this project is admirable, it should be regarded as a point of national security for nation states to maintain core infrastructure in-house) reply dehrmann 2 hours agoprevThis is an interesting problem open source might start facing. There are a lot (I assume) of mature, critical libraries with a single owner. These libraries started their life around 30 years ago, and the maintainers are ready to move on. Taking on maintenance isn't very exciting since all the fun work's been done, but the open source world needs it. reply acdha 1 hour agoparentThat’s what I was thinking, too. There are some fun aspects but there’s also a lot of stress: if you fix a bug, what are the odds that someone added a dependency on that behavior in one of the thousands of dependencies which accumulated over the decades?

After all, he stepped away from Exim (an incredibly notable project) many years ago, so it's not as if he is incapable of walking away when the time is right. So, presumably, he has only worked so long on these projects because he finds meaning and/or enjoyment from doing so. I can only hope if/when I reach the age of 80 I'll have something meaningful like this I could contribute to! reply jzb 2 hours agorootparentI borrowed the title from a talk he did in 1999, but didn't find a way (mea culpa) to work that naturally into the story.

The FSB (say) dont send you a bunch of flowers and a pull request from fsb.gov.ru. We saw from the xz situation that this class of attacker can start out genuinely helpful and use sockpuppets and social engineering over a long period of time to infiltrate projects. For all we know, (put on tinfoil hat now) there could be committers in major projects now who have spent years acting \"normally\" to earn trust but are sleepers. reply lelandfe 4 hours agorootparentStruggling to find it now, but one of the crazier scams I’ve seen was for an NFT company who was making, IIRC, cards. A person joined their Discord claiming to be a former Ubisoft 3D designer and was confirmed by other former coworkers. They began to ship actual, high quality 3D work as a contractor and earned the trust of the channel. …and then ultimately tried to drain their wallet at the end. Best they could guess was that the scammer(s) paid freelancers and then presented the work. Vetting people online is really hard. reply ChrisMarshallNY 6 hours agorootparentprevFair point. Not so sure that I'd call it \"tinfoil.\" Probably quite realistic. It's easy for me to say. I write software to support a fairly small, tight-knit, demographic. We all tend to know each other, so trust (or lack, thereof) is fairly established. reply baq 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah no tinfoil needed, xz was exactly that, except sloppy. We won’t hear about a second attempt for a long time after it’s happened. reply hnlmorg 3 hours agorootparentFor all we know, intelligence services might have already had multiple successful attempts prior to xz so they just got complacent on that particular one. The problem we have is you can’t prove the absence of something. reply bityard 4 hours agoparentprevI'll agree with thankless. But I'm confused about \"pays peanuts,\" because unless you get hired by a company paying you to work on open source software, or have somehow cracked the code to acquiring extremely generous patrons (donations), I would say being an open source maintainer typically pays nothing at all. Which is fine for a lot of us who consider it a hobby and would never _want_ to be paid for it. I also have to believe that if it's a true open source project (meaning, without commercial aspirations), then any stress must be self-induced. FLOSS authors don't owe anyone features, bug fixes, or explanations. And any that are delivered are totally voluntary. reply bee_rider 3 hours agorootparentI totally agree with this but haven’t actually maintained any open source projects. Have you? For me at least, it is easy to say the, I’m quite sure, objectively correct thing. Open source hobby projects have no obligation to anybody, just release code for fun, and anybody who expects more is the problem and should be ignored. But there are lots of reports of burnout and stress. So I think there must be strong social pressure that people fall to, despite not having any legal or ethical obligations. I mean for most of time, all of pre-history, humans got by with informal social structures and a feeling of wanting to provide their friends continued help, despite a lack of a real state or legal framework, and mostly informal ethics. So it isn’t that surprising that people feel like they have a real obligation to users when they’ve been working on a project for a while, right? Helping others is a human instinct. reply neilv 7 hours agoparentprev> [...] individual who feels they are sacrificing for the good of society [...] is the stereotype for a person who can be turned. Turned towards... something that sounds consistent with the values for which they're sacrificing? Or is the theory about more of an \"f-word these ingrates; I might as well get paid\" reaction? Or towards a role that makes them feel important or appreciated? Would this theory distinguish people doing open source mainly because it's technically interesting to them, from those who are in it more for the community, from those who are strongly motivated by principles? reply currency 6 hours agorootparent\"Turned\" may be the wrong word. \"Cozened\" might be more correct. There may be no good way for an individual to identify someone who is being paid to take over their project from someone with a genuine interest. reply ghaff 5 hours agoparentprev>Open source maintainer is a stressful, thankless job which pays peanuts compared to what you could get for the skills and time. Well, it needs to be something of interest to a company that will pay someone to be a maintainer as part of their day job.

A few old friends and acquaintances reached out to congratulate me on my financial independence. I think it was an honest mistake on the part of the reporter. I told her I had quit my job to write full time, and I guess she thought that meant I must have millions of dollars. To be clear, I was not then, and am not now financially independent. The 100 or so people that actually know me could discern that just by seeing my kitchen. Yet perhaps 20,000 people read somewhere that I am. That means potentially 200 times more people are wrong than right on this question, because of an inference made by a reporter. This scenario, in which there’s much more wrongness going around than rightness, is probably the norm. People make bad inferences like that all day long. These wrong ideas replicate themselves whenever the person tells someone else what they know, which the internet makes easier than ever. Consider the possibility that most of the information being passed around, on whatever topic, is bad information, even where there’s no intentional deception. As George Orwell said, “The most fundamental mistake of man is that he thinks he knows what’s going on. Nobody knows what’s going on.” Technology may have made this state of affairs inevitable. Today, the vast majority of a person’s worldview is assembled from second-hand sources, not from their own experience. Second-hand knowledge, from “reliable” sources or not, usually functions as hearsay – if it seems true, it is immediately incorporated into one’s worldview, usually without any attempt to substantiate it. Most of what you “know” is just something you heard somewhere. Standard editorial approach When people go on to share what they “know”, there’s usually no penalty for being wrong, but there are rewards for convincing people you’re right: attention, money, adoration, public rhetorical victories over others, and many other things humans enjoy. The Two Kinds of Knowing First-hand knowledge is a whole different thing from the second-hand kind. When you experience an event with your senses, you’re not just accepting a verbal claim, such as “There’s fighting in the streets of Kabul” — the truth is actually happening to you. The experienced sailor knows that looming cloud formation means trouble. The soldier knows the attack on his unit’s position was repelled. The dog owner knows exactly how long she can leave Rocco alone at home before he relieves himself on the floor. The friend sitting on my fifteen-year-old couch knows I’m not independently wealthy. Experience imprints reality right into your neurons; it doesn’t just add another thought to the abstract space in your brain where you keep your axioms and factoids. Good for about six hours Only a tiny percentage of what a given person “knows” is in this first-hand, embodied form. The rest is made of impressions gathered from anecdotes, newspapers, books, schoolteachers, blogs, and things our older siblings told us when we were little. If you ever read an article on a subject with which you have a lot of first-hand experience, you’ll notice that they always get major things wrong – basic facts, dates, names of people and organizations, the stated intentions of involved parties, the reasons a thing is happening – things even a novice in the space would know better about. It makes perfect sense, if you think about it, that reporting is so reliably unreliable. Why do we expect reporters to learn about a suddenly newsworthy situation, gather information about it under deadline, then confidently explain the subject to the rest of the nation after having known about it for all of a week? People form their entire worldviews out of this stuff. Me forming my worldview What doesn’t make sense is that we immediately become credulous again as soon as the subject matter changes back to a topic on which we don’t have first-hand experience. You know they don’t know what they hell they’re talking about on Subject A, but hey what’s this about Subject B? In 2002, author Michael Crichton named this the “Gell-Mann Amnesia effect”: Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In [Murray Gell-Mann’s] case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know. Crichton clarifies in the full speech that by “media” he’s not only talking about newspapers, but books, television, and internet too, and of course anybody’s recounting of what these sources say. Well, that accounts for just about 100% of our second-hand knowledge. “The situation is developing” People do know things though. We have airplanes and phones and spaceships. Clearly somebody knows something. Human beings can be reliable sources of knowledge, but only about small slivers of the whole of what’s going on. They know things because they deal with their sliver every day, and they’re personally invested in how well they know their sliver, which gives them constant feedback on the quality of their beliefs. Plumbing knowledge, for example, is constantly tested by whether the place floods after you’ve advanced your theory about what pipe connects to what. You need to get it right because it costs you something when you get it wrong. The mechanic has seen a thousand check-engine lights and knows how each of them was resolved. The English professor has seen a thousand essays and can tell you what’s wrong with yours. The night club bouncer has dealt with a thousand drunk patrons and knows which guests will be trouble even before they do. Somebody’s sliver, thankfully There are ways to carefully gather, scrutinize, and compare high-quality second-hand sources, and maybe learn something reliable, but this is extremely difficult for the groupish, emotional creature we are. It is viscerally unpleasant (not to mention time-consuming) to honestly question beliefs you feel positively towards, or honestly entertain ones you don’t, and ultimately you’re just determining what “feels right” anyway. Aside from our own respective slivers of reliable knowledge, we mostly carry a lot of untested beliefs — teetering piles of them, accumulated over years, from random people assuring us “this is how it is.” Most of these beliefs are bunk, but we don’t know which ones. Beliefs are Mostly Mind-Candy Humans love beliefs, not because they’re reliable pointers to what’s true, but because they often feel good in some way, or have social rewards. Expressing and sharing beliefs can get us attention and social status, make us feel competent, sell our goods and services, and motivate people to do things for us, and they can just feel satisfying to say aloud. A convincing belief is simply one that feels good to the ears, or the mind. Beliefs of mine, awaiting testing Theory feels good. Pithiness and analogy feel good. A tight sentence feels good. Neat and snappy stories about what’s “true” are like candy to the sense-craving part of the human brain. Notice how many smart people believe things like, “You can’t reason yourself out of a belief you didn’t reason yourself into.” This is a belief nobody would arrive at through reason. It doesn’t stand up to even a minute’s logical scrutiny. You certainly didn’t reason yourself into a belief that North-Pole-dwelling elves made your childhood toys, but you probably reasoned yourself out of it. Both beliefs are just mind-candy, only for different audiences. In short, human beings are bad at gathering information, inferring the right things from it, and responsibly passing it on to others. It is incredible what we’ve achieved in spite of this — almost entirely by carefully combining and testing our respective reliable slivers — but as a species we remain supremely untalented at knowing what’s true outside the range of our senses. A relevant documentary (1996) Much of the problem is that we want so badly to be believed, to be seen as someone who knows stuff. In the rest of Crichton’s speech, he explains why he named the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect after Murray Gell-Mann: because he’s famous, and he’s a physicist. People believe things named after physicists because we know they’re smart. And Crichton is a medical doctor, so you should listen to the guy. Also, none of you will be able to confirm this, but George Orwell did not say the line in the intro of this article. I just said that he did so you would take my own assertions more seriously. And it’s too late — you’ve already tasted the candy. I mean, Orwell could have said something like that. He might as well have said it. He probably did, basically! I will sleep soundly anyway. There are few penalties for bullshit, and many rewards.

I’ll put it right next to ‘The Last Bike Ride’. { Reply } Ron June 13, 2024 at 6:01 am That’s hilarious. I liked your fake Orwell quote so much I added it my quotes database right after reading it. So now I’ll go delete it. Or, hey, maybe just correct its attribution. But then, w/o the famous author, does it retain its value? Hmm. { Reply } David Cain June 13, 2024 at 8:51 am Haha! Most quote databases are full of fake stuff so I think it’s okay. { Reply } Keena June 13, 2024 at 11:25 am Ha ha! I liked it too. I’ll just attribute it to David, rather than George :) { Reply } Agnieszka June 13, 2024 at 6:49 am Brilliant. The initial story about more people being wrong than right about a particular truth really shook me.

It’s all a big swizzle!” I like the idea of being aware of the difference between “knowing” and knowing, and working towards knowing something intentionally. I was really convinced by this article that argues that the only real effective method to get policies changed is for random people to take it upon themselves to become experts in some super-narrow bit of, like, municipal zoning law or whatever. https://medium.com/civic-tech-thoughts-from-joshdata/so-you-want-to-reform-democracy-7f3b1ef10597 You devote a chunk of your free time to knowing more about that thing than anyone else (including elected officials, of course), and before you know it you’re the go-to person for that subject and able to help people fix the problem. Sadly, despite finding it persuasive, I never followed through with learning about something. Maybe that should be a depth year goal for me? { Reply } David Cain June 13, 2024 at 10:12 am That is a really interesting idea, and (without reading the article) I agree with it, haha! Depth is rare, and there is something very powerful about a person who can demonstrate deep knowledge on a subject. But because depth is rare, you don’t have to learn that much to know more than almost everybody, especially somebody whose job is to “know” about a huge variety of subjects, like policymakers. { Reply } Dennis June 13, 2024 at 12:40 pm Nicely done, David. Re: politics, I have come to believe that the news is mostly fake on both the left and the right. My guess is that, to a lesser extent, this has always mostly been the case. I wasn’t a cynical person and now I’m trying not to be, but narratives seem to be explained by various forms of following the money. { Reply } David Cain June 13, 2024 at 2:38 pm I mean, it basically has to be, because reporting what’s true doesn’t have nearly the incentives as reporting what makes money. If it’s true, it’s only by accident. I think the best way to navigate the world is to always keep in mind about the incentives humans respond to. We value truth, but much, much less than acceptance, pleasure, security, etc. That’s nobody’s fault, but it is how the world works imo. { Reply } Eugene June 13, 2024 at 1:35 pm Very perceptive, David. On a deeper level, of course, our usual perceptions of the world at large and of ourselves are bullshit. Why we meditate and practice mindfulness. The comments on belief are especially insightful. Thanks, as always. { Reply } David Cain June 13, 2024 at 2:40 pm The great thing about mindfulness is that if you’re doing it right you’re not making conclusions. It’s one of the few things we do that avoids inferences altogether. You’re not even naming things, not even attaching concepts, just observing the nameless, mysterious experience that is life itself. { Reply } Georgia Patrick June 13, 2024 at 2:31 pm What a great companion article to go with the book I just completed by Charles Duhigg, Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection. Communication, like the brain, is something we barely understand and need to use to survive, if not live well. I keep thinking we might do well to learn more about both–and use them, with more wisdom and awareness. I intensely enjoyed this article, David. { Reply } Steven June 13, 2024 at 4:20 pm This one brought me up short. Trained in epistemology, I’m more than aware of the drawbacks and sometimes utter failures of every attempt philosophers have made to explain and justify what we claim to know, whether based on science or from any other source. Even immediate sense experience is capable of misleading if we let it. I look out my (10th floor) home office window across an open landscape, and the world looks flat! Naturally, I tend to think the Earth is a globe (slightly flattened at the poles!). I’ve never *seen* the whole thing, though! I’ve come back to first-hand knowledge that consistently solves a given problem, reliance on those who can demonstrate that they have such knowledge and communicate this clearly to others, and consistency of claims across different problem domains. We are problem-solvers, as much as we are anything, and technology has solved a lot of problems for us (while creating a few more of its own!). The point being: we can probably trust physics, on which technology is based. That said, I was impressed by Joel Salatin’s discussion in his book *Folks, This Isn’t Normal* of how kids raised on farms can discern features of animals, plants, and nature itself that those of us raised in suburbia can’t even begin to see. I’ve wondered if indigenous peoples we products of modernity see as “primitive” understand properties and features of the natural order, from having lived in direct contact with them, that are simply beyond us. One of the most famous philosophical problems is whether the future will be like the past, and how we can justify believing that it will be. We can’t *prove* that the so-called laws of nature are constants without begging the question. The answer is not to look for *proofs* but continue to rely on problem-solving capability of hands-on practices … realizing that we are more creatures of emotion and sentiment than we are of abstract logic. We feel much more comfortable telling ourselves that we basically understand the principles governing the world than suggesting the opposite, which is that many of our dearest conclusions will never be anything more than educated guesses … and that ultimately, it’s all up for grabs. { Reply } David June 14, 2024 at 8:52 am A couple of thoughts here: First-hand experience can definitely fool us in many ways. We can go all the way back to Descartes and reason that everything we know is doubtable except that consciousness of some sort is happening. But this just casts second-hand knowledge into even more doubt, because at *best* it’s a verbal accounting of direct experience, introduces extra sources of distortion, like inference, languaging, and incentives to shape how it sounds to the other person. So it’s still a lot better. I don’t know anything about physics but I have heard people say it’s locked up in a sort of political stalemate right now, wherein the most influential figures in the field are invested in a framework that has not produced any significant advancements in some time. A minority of physicists wants to toss it and use a different framework, but the majority of talent and resources are occupied in service of the dominant framework. I don’t know who’s right, but it’s clear that political and interpersonal forces can have a major influence on the state of a scientific field and what it tells us is true. { Reply } Ginzo June 14, 2024 at 8:50 am Ah yes, what we think we know. And where we think are trusted sources to prove our ‘facts’. From an evolutionary view, for most of mankind’s existence; one would get ‘what’s going on’ from a another person in your group/tribe, or maybe from a neighboring group. Local gossip/stories was the standard. So our brains got trained to believe the gossip in spite of other facts on national/worldwide news outlets. This at least partially explains why some people continue to believe things that have proven to be absolutely false. Same goes for scientific research. If my neighbors don’t believe it, I’m likely to not believe too. Our ‘inner world’ facts are a another story…….. { Reply } David June 14, 2024 at 8:59 am It’s helpful to consider that this capacity for believing anything, for abstract thought about what’s true, is an evolutionary trait. This means we will believe in ways that aid survival, which means our beliefs have never precisely been about believing what’s true, but believing what helps us survive. In particular, that means it’s often more advantageous to your survival to believe what the group believes than to believe what’s true. You can prove your loyalty to a group (and therefore secure their help) by demonstrating that you share a belief with them, even if it’s ultimately untrue. { Reply } Discovered Joys June 15, 2024 at 2:50 am The worst boss I ever worked for used to assert ‘Perception is reality’. In some ways this was a profound observation, in others a complete misapprehension. If something is ‘broken’ but ‘everybody’ believes it to be working then there is no immediate need to do anything. And yet ‘broken’ things need ‘fixing’ if they are not to cause big problems later. It rather depends on how important ‘others immediate impressions’ are to you. { Reply } Rhino June 15, 2024 at 9:29 am “Humans love beliefs, not because they’re reliable pointers to what’s true, but because they often feel good in some way, or have social rewards.” A more generous take on this is that beliefs can alleviate suffering. This is really the basis of religion. Religion has many alternate purposes, but for the majority, it’s a means to alleviate suffering – and to be fair, it’s pretty good for that purpose, on average of course, your mileage may vary.. Cool that Robert Wringham stopped by, I’m a big fan of the New Escapologist! { Reply } David Cain June 17, 2024 at 2:02 pm Beliefs can indeed console but I think that’s selling religion short. I believe the great religions persist not because they’re comforting but because they point at possibilities to transcend normal human consciousness, which is fixated on the confort and security of the individual organism. Using religion primarily as a source of consolation misses out on its main purpose, imo. I write a regular column for New Escapologist now. Look for it in the next one! { Reply } Alex June 16, 2024 at 7:14 pm Keeping this post in my notes, filed under #Unthink. Of course, it connects to media literacy and critical thinking. Often taken as hallmarks of higher education. Some possible links to networked decision-making processes described by Steven Berlin Johnson in Future Perfect. Also, some echoes of traditional approaches to “worldview” in anthropology. In the mix is a notion pretty close to ethnocentrism as we conceive of it in anthro: an unthinking assumption that what holds in our cultural context is the normal and natural thing. In several ways, it connects to this notion of “unthink” with which I’ve been playing for a while. It’s about limits to reflection. Not always a negative thing. After all, there’s always a limit to any thought process. It’s just that it can go with hasty conclusions, kneejerk reactions, groupthink, unquestioned assumptions, all sorts of cognitive biases, and decisions made with insufficient care (for instance, about diverse needs). In my experience, unthink often comes from a sense of urgency instead of intellectual laziness or inaptitude. It’s common, however, to blame others for being lazy or incompetent.

Now think about all the articles you read about subjects that you don't know much about, why would the accuracy be any higher on those ones? Kind of a bummer to think about. reply pcloadletter_ 17 hours agoparentI've been thinking about this recently with internet comments on here, reddit, etc. There are very few topics on which I'd consider myself an expert, but whenever one comes up, the \"top\" comment (often something contrarian/snarky) is always significantly incorrect. reply sweeter 15 hours agorootparent100%. It's extra disastrous when the topic is polarizing or charged. The topic of US politics for example will very often work off of some false dichotomy or fundamentally flawed premise and twist into some horribly deformed conversation. Try telling someone that \"the process of voting doesn't work that way\" or try to clear up some common misconception about the economy or crime and it just doesn't go anywhere. People have a lot of false assurance to back up their mode of thinking and it is nearly impossible to break that. In fact, there is an entire economy in vindicating people's beliefs which makes people even more assured. I'm convinced the only proper stance on complex ideas, concepts and topics is that we shouldn't have the hubris to think that we completely understand something or even have a solid grasp. reply randomdata 15 hours agorootparentKeep in mind that people don't talk about that which they believe they completely understand. When someone reaches a satisfiable conclusion in understanding, they lose interest in the subject and move on to something else. The political discourse around polarizing topics isn't disastrous. It takes place exactly because people realize that they are complex issues not fully understood, and are talking about it in hopes that more information will come to light to help them reach a greater understanding. This is why the more complex the issue, the more it will keep coming up over and over. reply walledstance 7 hours agorootparentThank you. This is a refreshing take on much of human interaction. As a teacher in middle school I see this demonstrated throughout my classes. I have even started collecting data points on how many times a week a topic or topic adjacent to another topic crops up as discussions in my class. There are almost always heated discussions, but in the end we typically come to an understanding about facts or how we can’t truly know fully situations. There are of course some holds outs, but for the majority we find understanding or compromise. reply human_person 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is one of the most optimistic but realistic perspectives I’ve heard about online discussions in a long time.

It is incredible what we’ve achieved in spite of this All was achieved when it was widely not so, and by people not affected by this. reply throwaway7ahgb 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is a good point and I'm certainly subject to this. I read the most about topics that have no clear objective truth. Mostly around Sociology, Psychology and Politics. Engineering principles I have a deep knowledge of do not attract my attention other than to clear up someone's misconceptions. reply shostack 15 hours agorootparentprevWith regards to politics, wasn't that found to be a Russian active measures tactic where they'd get low quality or inaccurate comments up voted to the top, down vote actual informative comments, and flood their up voted comments with low quality replies and threads to push the informative stuff so low that users likely will give up scrolling before they see it? reply bdowling 14 hours agorootparentNo need for foreign operatives, we do it ourselves.

They aren't causing it, just furthering our issues for their own goals, and unfortunately it's working pretty well. reply rconti 16 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a significant contribution to imposter syndrome. It took me a long time in life to realize that the confidence some people have in their opinions rarely comes from true expertise; rather, it comes from their personality. reply throwaway7ahgb 7 hours agorootparentDon't let the opposite add too much weight. Meaning, don't believe that all confident people are bullshiting their way. The best are people that have both expertise and confidence. This is one reason I like to stay at a company for many years, the expertise boosts my confidence more than linearly (if that makes sense). reply roenxi 17 hours agorootparentprevAre you claiming expertise in computing or non-computing topics? HN tends to be - as we might expect - quite good at computers and bad/average [0] at everything else. I'd assume it is the same logic as comparative advantages in economics; it doesn't make sense for communities to become experts in everything. The only caveat is that people in the chattering communities (eg, journalists, influencers, celebrities) are some of the last to look to for informed opinions on reality since their speciality is attracting attention and telling stories rather than anything linked to success in the physical or academic worlds. They're often clever, just not involved in complex topics. [0] average = bad. Goes to show how catastrophic dictatorships are that a democracy can consistently outperform one. reply jfengel 16 hours agorootparentDemocracies function on the notion that most people have no idea what they're talking about, and vote randomly. The few who do know what they're talking about will all vote the same way, so most of the time the right answer will prevail. There are a lot of problems with that assumption. Thus far it seems to work out better than the alternatives, but we'll have to see if that continues to hold. reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentI don’t think that’s true. I’m pretty sure the hope is that people are reasonably well informed. And anyway, we’re voting on representatives, not specific issues, for the most part. (I mean clearly referenda exist, but they aren’t the main thing). Or we’re voting on matters of preference, in which case the populace is essentially correct whatever their decision. reply caseyohara 16 hours agorootparentprev> Democracies function on the notion that most people have no idea what they're talking about, and vote randomly. Can you expand on this? I have no idea what you mean. In what way do most people vote randomly? reply dartos 16 hours agorootparentThe theory is: In aggregate, the result of uninformed people voting would be more or less the same as voting randomly. Not that people vote without thinking. reply em-bee 16 hours agorootparentbut that doesn't take into account the influence false reporting in the media has on them. badly or falsely informed is much worse than uninformed. reply corimaith 16 hours agorootparentYes, but false reporting isn't coming from just one side is it, it's something all sides can participate in. The way the education system is right now along with societal expectations, people are going to be misinformed rather than admitting to be uninformed. reply dartos 8 hours agorootparentprevIt does. All sides engage in propaganda, that’s the game. If someone is not knowledgeable they will likely buy into some propaganda. At an extremely high and oversimplified level, that’s more or less random. It’s a thought framework, not a rigorous explanation reply roenxi 15 hours agorootparentprevIn the absolute sense yes, but this thread was framed in comparison to undemocratic systems. The media aren't biased in the direction of making their host country worse off, so their biases aren't negative in that sense. We'd get better outcomes if people in the public discourse held themselves to higher standards; but their low standards don't stop the tendency of marginal voters to bias on rational decision making. reply em-bee 6 hours agorootparentThe media aren't biased in the direction of making their host country worse off i don't believe that. at least western media are biased towards majority and conservative views and for profit entities, ignoring or even suppressing minorities and that is making us worse off. reply jfengel 1 hour agorootparentprevThat is indeed one of the problems I mentioned in the last paragraph.

I don't expect that at all. \"computers\" is such a broad subject, with countless areas of specialty, and in my experience HN commenters are often, all too often, quite ignorant of my particular areas of specialty, though that doesn't stop them from overconfidentally asserting falsehoods about those subjects. reply ThunderSizzle 8 hours agorootparentIgnorant and arrogant.

The number of comments I've seen on Hacker news (ostensibly the intellectual sister of reddit) that make extraordinarily confident outlandish claims about various subjects with zero citations, sources, etc across what would otherwise be considered highly scientific disciplines - neuroscience is a particularly egregious offender - is far more worrisome to me than the latest hallucination from Gemini. reply bradly 17 hours agoparentprevMy experience working at Apple on both Music and Maps: anything that I had worked on that was reported on was usually wildly inaccurate.

Like, if I watch a YouTube car repair video, and the presenter is diagnosing an issue and says something like “ok, so we can see here the battery is draining far too quickly so I better check the alternator first,” in my experience, it’s rarely the alternator and often either a bad battery or a short somewhere. My first check is either of those two things. I might eventually arrive at the alternator but it’s all just semantics and interpretation at a certain level. I don’t feel like they’re breathtakingly _wrong_, they just probably have had a different experience than me, leading them to a different conclusion. Caveat: I often work on old cars where a short is far more likely. reply simianparrot 12 hours agoparentprevCovid was the litmus test for me. I happened to know a lot about a lot of topics that became wildly reported on, from virology to immunology, and I had to watch in horror as every single media presence and expert weighed in with at best non-existent data to support major changes to existing wisdom, and at worst (and most common) obvious lies that contradicted not just available science but the very nature of how viruses operate. I can’t go back to ignorance ever again. reply jaredcwhite 2 hours agoparentprevIt's like when we see people \"do programming\" in TV shows/movies and laugh at how goofy it is.

That is, it's not yet a widely noticed thing and I feel it helps to spread it around and people generally seem to welcome and understand the concept. It probably does not immediately change how they read - biases are very hard to fight. But it goes in the right direction. reply wait_a_minute 17 hours agoparentprev> Now think about all the articles you read about subjects that you don't know much about, why would the accuracy be any higher on those ones? Why wouldn't the accuracy be higher? Extrapolating that way from limited experience is not something I would personally do. I would read everything, learn gradually, and continue learning and testing information with experiments and more information. reply ffsm8 17 hours agorootparentIn the context of articles the answer is simple: because the journalist isnt the specialist, they likely just interviewed a few people and wrapped it up the article. For comments it's a different story. You do occasionally get the real experts, but more often then not, you just get another mediocre human like myself that just voiced their opinion. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation with experts not commenting as they've got better things to do vs the average Joe that is commenting with little effort, essentially outputting significantly more comments. Another detrimental factor is that mentally unwell people will often output orders of magnitude more comments then everyone else, complicating everything even more. reply noduerme 16 hours agorootparentOP has a point. It depends on your frame. Some areas require far more specialized knowledge than others. If your specialization were something incredibly complex like quantum physics, you'd probably find ridiculous mistakes in 99% of mainstream sources. OTOH, articles about business or tax law may have far fewer lay errors, so you would be mistaken to project the popular information error rate in your own field onto popular reporting in every other field. reply jfengel 16 hours agorootparentprevAt least in theory, while the journalist isn't a subject matter expert, they have spent time reporting on the same domain. They know the people who are experts, and work under an editor who has worked in that field for decades. They should be able to validate any facts and be able to put them into context. As newspapers have gotten hammered there are fewer and fewer people who actually do that, and more and more bloggers with loud opinions and few facts. Many good sources have gone defunct or given up trying. But there do remain a few sources of decent journalism, where the reporters and editor really are better informed than most laymen. reply AmericanChopper 16 hours agorootparentprev> You do occasionally get the real experts, but more often then not, you just get another mediocre human like myself that just voiced their opinion Most of the comments experts make are just stating their own opinions as well. Take any credible expert in any field and you'll find equally credible experts who completely disagree with them. When experts are communicating with non-experts they're often really bad at explaining which points are just their opinions versus more widely accepted facts, and just as bad as explaining what other equally credible expert perspectives exist on a topic other than their own. They also tend to be pretty bad at explaining where the limits of knowledge in their field are as well. I would suggest that the ego boost of being a highly regarded expert also tends to make these shortcomings worse with a lot of people, that increasing credibility and reputation can have the effect of increasing dogmatic-ness. Of the topics that I'm somewhat well informed about, I know very few \"experts\" who are good at explaining the perspectives of their field in a reasonably balanced way, I think Roger Penrose is quite good at doing this, but even he's not perfect and experts with his level of humility are not very common. reply noduerme 15 hours agorootparentSure.

The previous commenter's complaint about how it doesn't solve anything if you get scammed is a bit off-target, because dealing with frauds and scams isn't a feature inherent in the currency itself -- it applies equally to any payment solution, especially cash and checks -- and is something we deal with via the legal system regardless of how funds are transferred. reply exoverito 16 hours agorootparentprevLarge cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin are extremely hard to execute a 51% attack upon due to their size.

In order, the largest influences on currency value are: 1. Speculation / belief 2. Approx 10x less influential is trade, most currency transactions both by volume and by value are in speculation which is underpinned and driven by beliefs in a particular currency. Some estimates put trading as low as 2.5% of all forex. Trading does impact the price of a currency, but in miniscule proportions to speculation 3. We can fairly confidently say tax collection is a lower influence than trade because of so many examples (and extraordinarily rare counter examples) but I don’t know of any reasonable way to quantify how much less the effect is. The threat of incarceration and / or asset seizure drives demand for currency which influences its value. Places like Argentina are fascinating (said while acknowledging the extreme hardship being placed on people who have to use Argentinian currency!).

Unfortunately, I started to fail with this, but it’ll be more important again, because the status quo which allowed to pretend democracy is under attack, and we could already see what happens then. After COVID, it’s even more interesting your statement, because you were affected, and to be effective you had to know what are the “news”. In other words, how people fucked up things. Also, I should have been quite offended why my doctor didn’t want to see me, when I arrived sick from New York two days before the first lockdown there. Also from the “news” it seems that the general trust between each others plummeted (shrinking number of real life connections, and increasing internet toxicity). That indicates the possibility that democracies are not the optimal strategy on individual level anymore. We need to prepare for that. Because of the “news” I, my brother and his whole family, and about at least a quarter of my high school class left Hungary (whom I know about).

But it does mean you have a very different experience there than you would as a long-term resident, and it's quite likely very, very different from your experience as a resident back home. reply balder1991 8 hours agorootparentNot only that, in most situations you will be treated differently simply by being a tourist. reply MrJohz 13 hours agorootparentprevI can't do France and the UK, but I can do Germany and the UK. There's definitely similarities, but there's a lot of differences as well, and the differences are often important. For example, the longer I rent in Germany, the safer I am against being forced out or having my rent arbitrarily raised. That is not true in the UK, where there is very little protection for renters. The types of apartment one can get in the UK and in Germany differ significantly, in everything from the quality of materials to the design of the neighbourhood. This means that things that will be a significant issue for a tenant in one location will be irrelevant in another location and vice versa. Understanding the issues on the ground usually requires living in that place for a significant amount of time. reply em-bee 16 hours agorootparentprevthis is why, when i go somewhere i prefer to either stay with locals couchsurfing, or when i stay longer, rent a room or an apartment. i don't travel around but stay in the same place, make friends with locals, join their events, etc. i intentionally don't read about the places before going there, to avoid influencing my experience by the subjective reports of others. especially reports of other foreigners. i'll never experience the life and struggles as a local, especially not when the culture is very different, or the language or its a developing country. at best i get to experience what living in that place as a european, an expat, is like. but, where i am able to make friends or become part of a local family, i still get way more insights than any tourist would. while traveling in japan (where i was couchsurfing) i met a young european who claimed to have learned things about japanese culture that generally no foreigner ever finds out and his japanese friends would always be surprised when he told them about some of the things he learned. i could not verify his claim of course, but it was interesting nonetheless. reply 1d22a 17 hours agorootparentprevBhutan, for one, restricts tourists to a subset of the country to limit the damage caused by overtourism. reply AzzieElbab 17 hours agorootparentprevNorth Korea, China, Russia, and most Gulf and Central Asia countries. reply lobochrome 17 hours agorootparentprevSpain, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar reply djaouen 16 hours agorootparentMy favorite theory about Cambodia is that they subtlely threaten any tourist to post positive feedback about the country otherwise they get the Pol Pot treatment lol reply kjkjadksj 15 hours agorootparentprevEven the US is like this reply Tao3300 17 hours agorootparentprevPretty much everywhere in the Caribbean, Mexico, and vast sections of Central America. reply fuzzfactor 8 hours agorootparent>Pretty much everywhere in the Caribbean, Like South Florida.

The brilliant minds that believe we are indeed in a simulation have extrapolated this concept from the weirdness that is found within the realm of quantum, the realm of the sub micro and nano. Religious folk believe we live in some sort of simulation as well: \"You are travelers and sojourners here. This is not your home. God is of spirit not of flesh.\" Don't know what 'spirit' is, but it's not carbon-based matter. Don't know what home is, but it's evidently not here. The Bible suggests that nothing here is real and the only real things are found in the spiritual realm. Simulation, or manufactured space, it doesn't really matter to us. Like Mr. Friedman pointed out, we have to deal with the space around us and whether the space around us is simulation or not is irrelevant. reply j16sdiz 16 hours agorootparentBrief in afterlife is somewhat different from brief in simulation.

People believe it is representative, they literally link to it as proof of their claims. In this way (and there are many others), reality is simulated. Another way is Indirect Realism, knowledge of which is rarely in working memory. Another way is that people believe there is only one possible form of simulation, as in \"the\" simulation theory. reply csours 14 hours agoprevA really useful meta-question is: How much work is it to answer that question? A few examples: Junior devs asking about how to do something - sometimes the answer is clear, there's a standard or a decision has already been made - sometimes someone has to do some work to decide how to proceed. Its easy for people to get frustrated when they think they asked a simple question, but at the point they ask, NO ONE knows the answer. Do masks work? How much evidence of what types would it take to make a satisfying answer to this question? What would those study designs look like? How large would your sample size need to be? I think it would take a great deal of work just to design the studies and get them past ethical review boards, much less get them funded and completed. Anything related to diet. Getting real answers takes way more work than can reasonably be done for anything more that the simplest questions. --- Related: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBBnfu8N_J0 reply duckmysick 4 hours agoprev> Plumbing knowledge, for example, is constantly tested by whether the place floods after you’ve advanced your theory about what pipe connects to what.

On top of that, individual experts still carry their own biases in their heads, and they lack any sort of editorial board to service the reader by separating knowledge from bias. It’s easy for me to cast stones but I also have no answer. The best I’ve come to is to read broadly on topics you need to truly know and compare what you find in your sources. For less important topics just accept that you are likely off the mark and have much to learn. reply jameshart 17 hours agorootparentDuring the early days of the pandemic, as advice to wear masks started to propagate into the population, and laypeople started to have to develop familiarity with concepts like ‘N95’, a community of helpful experts (often nurses and doctors, people with actual qualifications and real experience) piped up to tell the world that they had been trained in the proper use of PPE, and that there were very important donning and doffing procedures that needed to be followed (not touching the outside of the mask, eg), without which ordinary untrained mask users were going to be exposed to enormous risks. If you tried to use such masks without following these procedures you might as well just rub a dead bat on your face. The thing is, though, that the PPE handling requirements which practitioners like nurses and doctors are trained in, for working in a clinical environment with patients who are highly infectious or highly vulnerable to infection, are not the same as the PPE handling requirements for walking around a supermarket during a public health emergency. Public health usage of masks was not supposed to solve the same problems as masks solve in surgery or in infectious disease care contexts. Experts are vulnerable to having highly specific knowledge about how something works in a very narrow domain, but overestimating how well that knowledge applies to even quite closely related nearby domains. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentThis is an aside, but I don’t really think donning and doffing an N95 mask requires expert knowledge. It is easy to screw up if you don’t know to be careful, and the stakes are sort of high. But you can learn to do it by, like, reading the material that comes with the mask and watching a YouTube or something. Rather, I thought the anti-mask advice came before it was known that masks helped. At the time this was the prudent advice: what they don’t want is people acting like the masks will fully protect them. reply harry8 17 hours agoparentprevYep totally and I agree expertise in one field means nothing in another.

Some fields are such that they are hard to be expert in, but it’s trivially easy to verify expertise when observed. For example, playing tennis. It’s easy to identify a good tennis player even if you can’t play tennis at all. Another classic example is cooking. Even the most caveman-like philistine knows good food. On the other hand, for some fields, verifying expertise (or ‘mastery’) is as hard as achieving it. Academic disciplines — particularly technical ones like science — are examples. In those cases, you probably have to rely on a trusted authority to verify legitimacy. Without that, you can’t distinguish the accomplished experts from the crackpot blowhards. reply AlotOfReading 17 hours agorootparentI don't think it's as easy as you make it sound.

I don't think there's a magical answer, but one approach I've found is to try to be a mini expert in a tiny, tiny slice of a bigger area (usually bridging over knowledge from some adjacent area I know). This means that I can then evaluate those who talk about this tiny area, and get a good baysian guess as to there broader expertise from there. reply ashwinne 17 hours agorootparentprevTypically someone who has spent their life working/researching/teaching in that sliver of a domain. It is also important to remember that experts start losing their expertise once they have retired or no longer actively working in that domain.

Hacker News is notorious for the gaping chasm between the proclaimed expertise of the claims made here, and actual knowledge, in any non-technical domain, and often even the technical. This tendency towards aggressive ignorance becomes obvious whenever actual experts in a field enter a thread and inevitably have to talk people down from their preconceptions, often getting harassment in exchange. No one is ever, ever as impressed with what Hacker News knows about anything, as Hacker News is with itself. This is such a well known facet of the culture here it got written up about in the New Yorker[0]. Hacker News is no better an educational resource than Reddit.

My goal is mostly to get the player curious and not necessarily to explain absolutely everything. There were a lot of fun technical parts to building this: - For implementation reasons, it’s much easier if the lines all have integer intersection points with each other.

So for the most part all of the instances in the game are “easy” zamadatix 1 hour agoLoved the interactions and flow overall but I'm a bit lost on the zero knowledge proof example. I'm familiar with the concept but I don't follow how the example is one. E.g. \"By repeating the process enough times, the probability that you never catch me becomes smaller than, say, getting struck by lightning\" doesn't seem to show it's a proof? If I pick a hundred numbers it'll look like I just proved some black box function which happens to be Sin[n] + 0.999999999999 is always positive even though I'd be able to clearly show it negative with the knowledge of the function. It feels like something that got detached from the things that make it work during simplification. Or it could be that I just have a misunderstanding/oversight in the zero knowledge proof :). In an unrelated note: I colored the larger graph and it didn't even play along! reply MCSP 28 minutes agoparentVery glad you enjoyed it! For the ZK example, the math behind it is this: if there are m bordering regions and I am lying, you have a 1/m chance of catching me each time. Thus after k repetitions the chance you haven't caught me is (1-1/m)^k \\approx e^{-k/m} which is extremely small for k sufficiently larger than m. Now, you may rightfully say: hey that's still not a \"proof,\" you could still be lying! There are two responses to this: 1. The probability can be made incredibly small, like smaller than the the chance, say, your computer got hit by a gamma ray burst that would flip bits from 0 to 1 (I really have no idea if this actually happens but people have said it to me). 2. It turns out it is mathematically impossible to get the zero knowledge property if you want true proofs (i.e., no probability of being wrong). So, there's a trade off: if you want zero knowledge, you have to accept some (small) failure probability P.S. Adding an easter egg for coloring the larger graph is on the todo list :) reply esquivalience 1 hour agoparentprevI think the answer is that each time you reveal the colours, you observe that they are within the set of three colours illustrated at the beginning of the proof. Whichever you reveal, you never find a fourth colour. This confused me at first. reply zamadatix 1 hour agorootparentFor anyone confused by this response I had edited my comment after reading https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40740557 but before equivalence had hit reply and now their reply is left hanging. Sorry esquivalience! To summarize the linked answer on trusting the second dot isn't just randomly assigned: keep the context as physical post-its. Barring something like a matter bending psychic you'd be able to tell the dot under the second post-it was swapped as you made your pick. That still leaves how to rely on chance of picks for a proof though. reply romwell 30 minutes agorootparentIt's the same thing as limits in spirit. It's not that the chances of lying are small, it's that they can be made arbitrarily small. Let's say my standards of \"proof\" are that there's only 0.1% chance that you're cheating. We play that game several times, and I'm satisfied. Next comes someone else whose standard is 0.001% chance of cheating. They simply play the game a few more times, and they're satisfied too. If they change their mind and decide that only 0.0000001% will make them happy, they simply tack on a few more rounds. The key here is that the probability that you can cheat for arbitrarily long is exactly zero — for the same reason that Zeno's paradox is resolvable (and limit of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... is exactly zero, and not just a very small number). reply baruchel 2 hours agoprevHi, my two cents; you claim \"Although mathematicians believe their proof is correct, it is too complex to verify without computer assistance\", but I'm not sure \"believe\" is the correct verb since the proof has been formally verified (see for instance https://github.com/coq-community/fourcolor for a formal verification in Coq). I understand that you want to emphasize the fact that no human can understand the proof with a full overview, but I wonder whether the current sentence will not make people think mathematicians are not perfectly sure of the proof. reply MCSP 2 hours agoparentGood point! I'll try to think about a better way to phrase this (happy to hear suggestions) reply valenterry 52 minutes agorootparentNah, actually I agree with you. What counts as believe and what as fact is rather abitrary. Is 2+2=4 a fact? Is global warming a fact? What about man-made global warming? Ask 100 people whether something is a fact or a believe. To top that up, it's fact that there have been \"proves\" that were wrong (or maybe that's just my believe? :^]) even for a long time. Hence, I think we can say that there are 4 options for a theorem: 1) Some mathematician believes the theorem is correct (but can't prove it) 2) Some mathematician believes the theorem is incorrect (but can't prove it) 3) Some mathematician believes the proof of a theorem is correct 4) Some mathematician believes the proof of a theorem is incorrect Proving that a proof is correct is kind of meaningless. At that point it's all believe anyways. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Although mathematicians have been able to prove this, the proof is too complex to verify without computer assistance.\" Or some such. reply gergo_barany 1 hour agoparentprevThat Coq proof is not \"without computer assistance\". No Coq proof is, as Coq is literally an \"assistant\" that runs on a computer. And those many jobXtoY.v and taskXtoY.v files sure look like they also do the same as the Appel and Haken proof, namely enumerate lots and lots of cases that are then machine-checked. So I don't think the computerized Coq proof is really qualitatively different from other computerized proofs that enumerate so many cases that a manual check would be impractical. reply franciscop 1 hour agoprev[spoiler alert] I knew that 4 colours sufficed for any arbitrary map from back in the day when I learned this, but still I found it VERY rewarding by attempting to draw a map that needed 5 colors, and how intuitive this demo was for getting a \"feel\" for a thing that I knew only theoretically! Like I needed an impossible geometry to fit, either an area that stretched to a zero-width path (which would becomes a point, and thus 2 areas, so doesn't fit) or some other \"impossible\" geometry.

The “British Isles” encompassing a non-british sovereign state is controversial. reply romwell 26 minutes agoparentprevIt's about as \"trivial\" a distinction as considering Crimea (or the entirety of Ukraine, for that matter) a part of Russia. Many, many people have died for this triviality. \"Somewhat fraught\" is a very interesting choice of words, but then again, so is \"The Troubles\" (when the subject matter is decades of bombings and killings). reply AndrewOMartin 2 hours agoprevCan you add to the FAQ at the end an answer to the question \"How do I know you're not just showing me two random colors?\"? It's possible this is already addressed and I missed it. reply hcs 2 hours agoparentYou do need to prove that you have assigned the colors before the choice of what to reveal is made, I think. Physically this is guaranteed by the presence of the colors under the post-its (barring dynamic e-paper or something). I'm not sure how it works with the example of the primes, I lost the link to the later pages of the game so I can't read over it again, but I think it's guaranteed because there's just one number encoding all the assignments and you just get to unlock a single pair with the key given in response to your choice. There's an assumption that there isn't enough information in the key to fake any response, it has to reveal something that was already in there. reply MCSP 2 hours agorootparentYou're exactly right. The definition via primes ensures there is only one color consistent with each number (formally, this is called a perfectly binding commitment scheme). Also, here's the link if you want to go back: rahulilango.com/coloring/zk reply hcs 1 hour agorootparentThanks! And this is a great exercise, thanks for sharing it. reply MCSP 2 hours agoparentprevThanks for the feedback! As hcs suggests, this is part of the physical post-it assumption. I'll think about ways to make it more clear -- adding an FAQ is a good idea :) reply gowld 26 minutes agorootparentAll that's missing is more info in the answer to this question: > Question: How do you do this in the digital world, without post-it notes? Answer: \"When I give you a map labelled with numbers for each region, the numbers are the \"post-it notes\", \"covering\" the list of factors (which encodes a color). You can't see the primes factors inside them, because, even though generating an multiplying large primes is easy for computers, factoring numbers is much, much harder.)\" I think if, when the player checks \"reply the demo, with numbers\", you move the game down to where the prime number discussion is, it's easier to understand. Also, note that the digital versionis better than the physical version. In the physical version, you can't stop me from removing extra notes. (A better example might be to put each color in a locked box, each with a different lock/key.) In the digital version, the factor lists are the \"keys\". reply OmarShehata 1 hour agoprevI love this! I'd for this to be a more typical experience in math class (I bought Paul Lockhart's \"measurements\" but gave up because I felt like I needed a sandbox to play with and little hints.

First I was curious to learn how is the fast way to understand that 1, 2, or 4 colors suffice. And why finding out such a way for 3 is so hard. The zero-knowledge proof demonstration felt like “changing the subject”. Probably I missed the connection there. reply gowld 25 minutes agoparentZKP is the subject. The maps part is a helper lemma.

It's not needed for the demo. reply russellbeattie 1 hour agorootparentprevDiving into Wikipedia, apparently variations of the name \"Britain\" have been in use since 30BC, and referred to the big island, with the smaller islands grouped with it, e.g. British Isles. The Irish may not like it, but they're fighting against two millenia of history. reply returningfory2 17 minutes agorootparentSure, but more recent history should have a higher weight. It is reasonable that our names for things reflect recent history and current affairs more than ancient history. Two thousand years ago Britain and Ireland were ethnically and linguistically pretty similar (I believe). Since then they have diverged in many ways - most significantly during the Reformation period when people in Britain largely left Catholicism, but people in Ireland remained Catholic. Changes like this and the legacy of colonialism this have ultimately resulted in Ireland having distinctly non-British identity. It is reasonable that our naming for things reflect this current state of affairs. As always, it useful to consider other examples to clarify the point. For example, by the same argument, should we deprecate the phrase \"Latin America\"? After all, Latin Europeans only arrived in the Americas 500 years ago and the continent has had people for 10 thousand years before that. Are people who include a European adjective in the name of this cultural area \"fighting against ten millenia of history\"? reply messe 20 minutes agorootparentprevAnd it's use in English only comes from the mid 16th and 17th centuries, right around the time that much of Ireland was being colonized by the British.

On another note, I dislike how “Zero-Knowledge Proofs” are called proofs. It’s not a proof. You iteratively increase your belief that the result is true, like in experimentation, but that’s not a proof. reply tyilo 1 hour agoparentIf someone has signed something cryptographically, wouldn't you say that the signature was a proof of someone with the private key signing it? (Even though it is possible to construct a valid signature without the private key - you just have to be very very very lucky) I guess you also don't like the name Proof of Work. reply hcs 56 minutes agoparentprevIt might help to think of the sense of \"proof\" that's synonymous with \"trial\", rather than a specific formal math sense of proving a theorem from axioms by formal transformations. reply windowshopping 1 hour agoprevI went in skeptical and got completely hooked.

The Civil War; Spain was not grounds for any of the two World Wars so they are not relevant events to be survived.

All else being equal, the Spanish Civil War would have happened even if Italy, Germany and the USSR hadn't intervened in any way whatsoever (though what the result would have been is anyone's guess), and WWII would have happened all the same even if the Spanish Civil War had never happened or if the Spanish Republic had managed to prevail. reply Medox 6 hours agoparentprevAnd through some earthquakes too, although such large heavy vases would probably survive 4/5-ish quakes with little movement. Maybe even a 6 (?) reply joenot443 7 hours agoprev> Therefore, the 2019 finding in a Roman mausoleum in Carmona, southern Spain, of an ash urn roughly 2000 years old, containing a reddish liquid, was rather exceptional and unexpected. An archaeochemical study of the liquid allowed it to be deemed the oldest ancient wine conserved in the liquid state. This is remarkable to me. What a find! Am I alone in being super, super surprised that it remained in liquid form this long? Does that suggest a very perfect seal on the urn? reply Archelaos 5 hours agoparentThere is also the Speyer wine bottle dated to about AD 325 and 350. It is presumed to be the world's oldest unopened wine bottle. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speyer_wine_bottle reply xandrius 6 hours agoparentprevWell, it could have been somewhat perfect and dust/dirt/debris/shrinkage made it perfect. Or the temperature dropped enough for it to stop evaporating. reply anthk 5 hours agorootparentMost basements had (and still have) a cooler termperature than the ground one. In a small village of Salamanca, when the temperature outside was around 30C, inside a cellar/basement it would perfectly be at 18 or even 16C depending on the corner. Also, being underground (or semi-underground under a separate room from the house) was an advantage on wars against pillage or further bombings. Under the Spanish right-wing dictatorship, a lot of people had banned magazines and books well kept under/inside basement trunks, relatively hidden from the usual rooms at home, as most people would just think of a basement as a room to store old junk, ripped clothes, photos, family related letters or broken hardware. And a bunch of food, maybe. Rural Spain's homes were built on thick walls often made from stone bricks, they isolated from both heat and cold, which can drop below 0 with ease at Winter on non-coastal zones and reach up to 40C temps at Summer. reply Sharlin 3 hours agorootparentJust three to four meters below ground level the temperature is more or less constant <10°C the year around. A root cellar with a well-insulated door and roof (sawdust is great!) is basically a fridge that requires zero power to keep cool. reply romanhn 5 hours agoparentprevNot alone, though the part that really got me was the volume - the vessel was still filled to the brim with 5 liters of liquid. Amazing job with sealing.

What aspect of the problem makes it unsuitable for running in a single process? reply emersion 6 hours agoparentThe database needs to be shared between multiple actors: several teams of multiple people working in different companies. For instance, a team may be working on a single project such as a new railway or a large timetable change. Another example would be multiple freight companies requesting new routes. Additionally, the UI contains complicated elements such as custom maps with the railway network and custom graphs to visualize trains. There is a large ecosystem to implement this kind of stuff via Web technologies. A webapp also removes the need to distribute an installable binary on many different platforms (some may be quite restricted due to company policies) and many different machines (there are many users, see above). Note that the system uses a client-server architecture but isn't really distributed. reply cbsmith 4 hours agorootparent> Note that the system uses a client-server architecture but isn't really distributed. Yeah, I kind of agree. The thing is, it's orchestrating multiple containers to do the job. I can't figure out why you couldn't just have one container. reply emersion 2 hours agorootparentPart of the answer is that some of these services need to be scaled horizontally to be able to handle a significant number of users (e.g. tile servers, the core server), another part of the answer is architectural constraints (e.g. the core server needs to keep quite a bit of per-infrastructure data in RAM). (Of course, it's completely possible to build a single container which runs all of the services in parallel, but then monitoring/scaling/availability/etc are more difficult to handle.) reply cbsmith 1 hour agorootparent> (Of course, it's completely possible to build a single container which runs all of the services in parallel, but then monitoring/scaling/availability/etc are more difficult to handle.) Having done both, I'm always surprised when people say that it is more difficult to handle running N-copies of the same container than a heterogeneous set of containers. Sure, at really large scale you can glean efficiencies from it (which is why one might do it), but there's a lot of complexity that comes with that. reply p_l 2 hours agorootparentprevRead the architectural description - it does mention why and how. reply cbsmith 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I read it.

This choice was made to ensure the modularity of the code and to guarantee the exploitability of certain OSRD services by external applications\" Modularity of code is a common explanation for using a multi-service architecture, but it's not a particularly strong one (services are just one way of modularizing code). In terms of OSRD services being accessed by external applications, it doesn't seem like that would work particularly well, given the coupling between the pieces. The only pieces that would make any sense to me for outside applications to directly in would be the PostgreSQL database... and if that were the plan, I'd just host the whole thing in PostgreSQL. reply p_l 4 minutes agorootparentIf you read deeper, you'd find out that for example the simulation engine is a separate (older?) system written in Java that does have an API but does not implement other components like designing the railroad system etc. p_l 8 hours agoparentprevEDIT2: https://osrd.fr/en/docs/reference/architecture/services/ describes it better than I did :) EDIT: The goals of OSRD include realtime cooperation between multiple entities, including timetabling and planning on short term.

Not OP, but I am. The French railway system suffers from a few faults (like the fact that it's Paris first, or not enough capacity on some routes, especially around popular times like Friday afternoon), but is otherwise extremely good. There's very fast coverage between all big cities aligned to Paris (so Lille - Lyon - Marseille is super fast, but mostly because they are destinations linked to Paris); Marseille - Bordeaux is slow because it isn't aligned to Paris, and has to pass through bad terrain in the middle of nowhere). In terms of coverage of % of the population with regional or high speed rail, or hell, low cost low or high speed rail, it's among the best in the world. It's only serious challengers are Spain, Italy, Japan, China. reply javilovesmambo 6 hours agoparentprevYou can put it on a different way, the Swiss have no use case for such a software since everything is running fine.

Donate Now Plastic doesn’t break down in nature. If you turned all of what’s been made into cling wrap, it would cover every inch of the globe. It’s piling up, leaching into our water and poisoning our bodies. Scientists say the key to fixing this is to make less of it; the world churns out 430 million metric tons each year. But businesses that rely on plastic production, like fossil fuel and chemical companies, have worked since the 1980s to spin the pollution as a failure of waste management — one that can be solved with recycling. Industry leaders knew then what we know now: Traditional recycling would barely put a dent in the trash heap. It’s hard to transform flimsy candy wrappers into sandwich bags, or to make containers that once held motor oil clean enough for milk. Now, the industry is heralding nothing short of a miracle: an “advanced”type of recycling known as pyrolysis — “pyro” means fire and “lysis” means separation. It uses heat to break plastic all the way down to its molecular building blocks. While old-school, “mechanical” recycling yields plastic that’s degraded or contaminated, this type of “chemical” recycling promises plastic that behaves like it’s new, and could usher in what the industry casts as a green revolution: Not only would it save hard-to-recycle plastics like frozen food wrappers from the dumpster, but it would turn them into new products that can replace the old ones and be chemically recycled again and again. So when three companies used ExxonMobil’s pyrolysis-based technology to successfully conjure up that fruit cup, they announced it to the world. “This is a significant milestone,” said Printpack, which turned the plastic into cups. The fruit supplier Pacific Coast Producers called it “the most important initiative a consumer-packaged goods company can pursue.” “ExxonMobil is supporting the circularity of plastics,” the August 2023 news release said, citing a buzzword that implies an infinite loop of using, recycling and reusing. They were so proud, I hoped they would tell me all about how they made the cup, how many of them existed and where I could buy one. So began my long — and, well, circular — pursuit of the truth at a time when it really matters. This year, nearly all of the world’s countries are hammering out a United Nations treaty to deal with the plastic crisis. As they consider limiting production, the industry is making a hard push to shift the conversation to the wonders of chemical recycling. It’s also buying ads during cable news shows as U.S. states consider laws to limit plastic packaging and lobbying federal agencies to loosen the very definition of what it means to recycle. It’s been selling governments on chemical recycling, with quite a bit of success. American and European regulators have spent tens of millions subsidizing pyrolysis facilities. Half of all U.S. states have eased air pollution rules for the process, which has been found to release carcinogens like benzene and dioxins and give off more greenhouse gases than making plastic from crude oil. Given the high stakes of this moment, I set out to understand exactly what the world is getting out of this recycling technology. For months, I tracked press releases, interviewed experts, tried to buy plastic made via pyrolysis and learned more than I ever wanted to know about the science of recycled molecules. Under all the math and engineering, I found an inconvenient truth: Not much is being recycled at all, nor is pyrolysis capable of curbing the plastic crisis. Not now. Maybe not ever. LET’S TAKE a closer look at that Printpack press release, which uses convoluted terms to describe the recycled plastic in that fruit cup: “30% ISCC PLUS certified-circular” “mass balance free attribution” It’s easy to conclude the cup was made with 30% recycled plastic — until you break down the numerical sleight of hand that props up that number. It took interviews with a dozen academics, consultants, environmentalists and engineers to help me do just that. Stick with me as I unravel it all. LESSON 1 MOST OF THE OLD PLASTIC THAT GOES INTO PYROLYSIS DOESN’T ACTUALLY BECOME NEW PLASTIC. IN TRADITIONAL RECYCLING, plastic is turned into tiny pellets or flakes, which you can melt again and mold back into recycled plastic products. Even in a real-life scenario, where bottles have labels and a little bit of juice left in them, most of the plastic products that go into the process find new life. MECHANICAL RECYCLING 55-85% gets recycled into new plastic 15-45% is lost in the process The numbers are much lower for pyrolysis. It’s “very, very, very, very difficult” to break down plastic that way, said Steve Jenkins, vice president of chemicals consulting at Wood Mackenzie, an energy and resources analytics firm. “The laws of nature and the laws of physics are trying to stop you.” Waste is heated until it turns into oil. Part of that oil is composed of a liquid called naphtha, which is essential for making plastic. There are two ingredients in the naphtha that recyclers want to isolate: propylene and ethylene — gases that can be turned into solid plastics. To split the naphtha into different chemicals, it’s fed into a machine called a steam cracker. Less than half of what it spits out becomes propylene and ethylene. This means that if a pyrolysis operator started with 100 pounds of plastic waste, it can expect to end up with 15-20 pounds of reusable plastic. Experts told me the process can yield less if the plastic used is dirty or more if the technology is particularly advanced. PYROLYSIS 15-20% gets recycled into propylene and ethylene 80-85% becomes diesel fuel, hydrogen, methane and other chemicals I reached out to several companies to ask how much new plastic their processes actually yield, and none provided numbers. The American Chemistry Council, the nation’s largest plastic lobby, told me that because so many factors impact a company’s yield, it’s impossible to estimate that number for the entire industry. LESSON 2 THE PLASTIC THAT COMES OUT OF PYROLYSIS CONTAINS VERY LITTLE RECYCLED MATERIAL. WITH MECHANICAL RECYCLING, it’s hard to make plastic that’s 100% recycled; it’s expensive to do, and the process degrades plastic. Recycled pellets are often combined with new pellets to make stuff that’s 25% or 50% recycled, for example. But far less recycled plastic winds up in products made through pyrolysis. That’s because the naphtha created using recycled plastic is contaminated. Manufacturers add all kinds of chemicals to make products bend or keep them from degrading in the sun. Recyclers can overpower them by heavily diluting the recycled naphtha. With what, you ask? Nonrecycled naphtha made from ordinary crude oil! This is the quiet — and convenient — part of the industry’s revolutionary pyrolysis method: It relies heavily on extracting fossil fuels. At least 90% of the naphtha used in pyrolysis is fossil fuel naphtha. Only then can it be poured into the steam cracker to separate the chemicals that make plastic. So at the end of the day, nothing that comes out of pyrolysis physically contains more than 10% recycled material (though experts and studies have shown that, in practice, it’s more like 5% or 2%). LESSON 3 THE INDUSTRY USES MATHEMATICAL ACROBATICS TO MAKE PYROLYSIS LOOK LIKE A SUCCESS. TEN PERCENT doesn’t look very impressive. Some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability, so companies use a form of accounting called mass balance to inflate the recycled-ness of their products. It’s not unlike offset schemes I’ve uncovered that absolve refineries of their carbon emissions and enable mining companies to kill chimpanzees. Industry-affiliated groups like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification write the rules. (ISCC didn’t respond to requests for comment.) To see how this works, let’s take a look at what might happen to a batch of recycled naphtha. Let’s say the steam cracker splits the batch into 100 pounds of assorted ingredients. = 1 pound = 1 \"recycled\" pound Propylene Ethylene Other chemicals, including fuel You'll get some colorless gasses that are used to make plastic: 13 pounds of propylene and 30 pounds of ethylene. You'll also wind up with 57 pounds of other chemicals. Propylene makes sturdy material such as butter tubs ; ethylene makes flexible plastics like yogurt pouches . Many of the other chemicals aren't used to make plastic — some get used to make rubber and paint or are used as fuel. All of these outputs are technically 10% recycled, since they were made from 10% recycled naphtha. (I’m using this optimistic hypothetical to make the math easy.) But companies can do a number shuffle to assign all of the recycled value from the butter tubs to the yogurt pouches . That way they can market the yogurt pouches as 14% recycled (or “circular”), even though nothing has physically changed about the makeup of the pouches. What's more, through a method called free attribution, companies can assign the recycled value from other chemicals (even if they would never be turned into plastic) to the yogurt pouches . Now, the yogurt pouches can be sold as 33% recycled. There are many flavors of this kind of accounting. Another version of free attribution would allow the company to take that entire 30-pound batch of “33% recycled” pouches and split them even further: A third of them, 10 pounds, could be labeled 100% recycled — shifting the value of the full batch onto them — so long as the remaining 20 pounds aren’t labeled as recycled at all. As long as you avoid double counting, Jenkins told me, you can attribute the full value of recycled naphtha to the products that will make the most money. Companies need that financial incentive to recoup the costs of pyrolysis, he said. But it’s hard to argue that this type of marketing is transparent. Consumers aren’t going to parse through the caveats of a 33% recycled claim or understand how the green technology they’re being sold perpetuates the fossil fuel industry. I posed the critiques to the industry, including environmentalists’ accusations that mass balance is just a fancy way of greenwashing. The American Chemistry Council told me it’s impossible to know whether a particular ethylene molecule comes from pyrolysis naphtha or fossil fuel naphtha; the compounds produced are “fungible” and can be used for multiple products, like making rubber, solvents and paints that would reduce the amount of new fossil fuels needed. Its statement called mass balance a “well-known methodology” that’s been used by other industries including fair trade coffee, chocolate and renewable energy. Legislation in the European Union already forbids free attribution, and leaders are debating whether to allow other forms of mass balance. U.S. regulation is far behind that, but as the Federal Trade Commission revises its general guidelines for green marketing, the industry is arguing that mass balance is crucial to the future of advanced recycling. “The science of advanced recycling simply does not support any other approach because the ability to track individual molecules does not readily exist,” said a comment from ExxonMobil. IF YOU THINK navigating the ins and outs of pyrolysis is hard, try getting your hands on actual plastic made through it. It’s not as easy as going to the grocery store. Those water bottles you might see with 100% recycled claims are almost certainly made through traditional recycling. The biggest giveaway is that the labels don’t contain the asterisks or fine print typical of products made through pyrolysis, like “mass balance,” “circular” or “certified.” When I asked about the fruit cup, ExxonMobil directed me to its partners. Printpack didn’t respond to my inquiries. Pacific Coast Producers told me it was “engaged in a small pilot pack of plastic bowls that contain post-consumer content with materials certified” by third parties, and that it “has made no label claims regarding these cups and is evaluating their use.” I pressed the American Chemistry Council for other examples. “Chemical recycling is a proven technology that is already manufacturing products, conserving natural resources, and offering the potential to dramatically improve recycling rates,” said Matthew Kastner, a media relations director. His colleague added that much of the plastic made via pyrolysis is “being used for food- and medical-grade packaging, oftentimes not branded.” They provided links to products including a Chevron Phillips Chemical announcement about bringing recycled plastic food wrapping to retail stores. “For competitive reasons,” a Chevron spokesperson declined to discuss brand names, the product’s availability or the amount produced. In another case, a grocery store chain sold chicken wrapped in plastic made by ExxonMobil’s pyrolysis process. The producers told me they were part of a small project that’s now discontinued. In the end, I ran down half a dozen claims about products that came out of pyrolysis; each either existed in limited quantities or had its recycled-ness obscured with mass balance caveats. Then this April, nearly eight months after I’d begun my pursuit, I could barely contain myself when I got my hands on an actual product. I was at a United Nations treaty negotiation in Ottawa, Ontario, and an industry group had set up a nearby showcase. On display was a case of Heinz baked beans, packaged in “39% recycled plastic*.” (The asterisk took me down an online rabbit hole about certification and circularity. Heinz didn’t respond to my questions.) This, too, was part of an old trial. The beans were expired. Pyrolysis is a “fairy tale,” I heard from Neil Tangri, the science and policy director at the environmental justice network Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. He said he’s been hearing pyrolysis claims since the ’90s but has yet to see proof it works as promised. “If anyone has cracked the code for a large-scale, efficient and profitable way to turn plastic into plastic,” he said, “every reporter in the world” would get a tour. If I did get a tour, I wondered, would I even see all of that stubborn, dirty plastic they were supposedly recycling? The industry’s marketing implied we could soon toss sandwich bags and string cheese wrappers into curbside recycling bins, where they would be diverted to pyrolysis plants. But I grew skeptical as I watched a webinar for ExxonMobil’s pyrolysis-based technology, the kind used to make the fruit cup. The company showed photos of plastic packaging and oil field equipment as examples of its starting material but then mentioned something that made me sit up straight: It was using pre-consumer plastic to “give consistency” to the waste stream. Chemical plants need consistency, so it’s easier to use plastic that hasn’t been gunked up by consumer use, Jenkins explained. But plastic waste that had never been touched by consumers, such as industrial scrap found at the edges of factory molds, could easily be recycled the old-fashioned way. Didn’t that negate the need for this more polluting, less efficient process? I asked ExxonMobil how much post-consumer plastic it was actually using. Catie Tuley, a media relations adviser, said it depends on what’s available. “At the end of the day, advanced recycling allows us to divert plastic waste from landfills and give new life to plastic waste.” I posed the same question to several other operators. A company in Europe told me it uses “mixed post-consumer, flexible plastic waste” and does not recycle pre-consumer waste. But this spring at an environmental journalism conference, an American Chemistry Council executive confirmed the industry’s preference for clean plastic as he talked about an Atlanta-based company and its pyrolysis process. My colleague Sharon Lerner asked whether it was sourcing curbside-recycled plastic for pyrolysis. If Nexus Circular had a “magic wand,” it would, he acknowledged, but right now that kind of waste “isn’t good enough.” He added, “It’s got tomatoes in it.” (Nexus later confirmed that most of the plastic it used was pre-consumer and about a third was post-consumer, including motor oil containers sourced from car repair shops and bags dropped off at special recycling centers.) Read More Plastic, Plastic Everywhere — Even at the UN’s “Plastic Free” Conference Clean, well-sorted plastic is a valuable commodity. If the chemical recycling industry grows, experts told me, those companies could end up competing with the far more efficient traditional recycling. To spur that growth, the American Chemistry Council is lobbying for mandates that would require more recycled plastic in packaging; it wants to make sure that chemically recycled plastic counts. “This would create market-driven demand signals,” Kastner told me, and ease the way for large-scale investment in new chemical recycling plants. I asked Jenkins, the energy industry analyst, to play out this scenario on a larger scale. Were all of these projects adding up? Could the industry conceivably make enough propylene and ethylene through pyrolysis to replace much of our demand for new plastic? He looked three years into the future, using his company’s latest figures on global pyrolysis investment, and gave an optimistic assessment. At best, the world could replace 0.2% of new plastic churned out in a year with products made through pyrolysis. About the Math Our article is focused on pyrolysis because it’s the most popular form of chemical recycling. Other types of chemical recycling technologies have their own strengths and weaknesses. There are different variations of pyrolysis, and steam crackers produce a range of ethylene and propylene yields. Companies are secretive about their operations. To estimate the efficiencies of pyrolysis and mass balance, I read dozens of peer-reviewed studies, reports, industry presentations, advertisements and news stories. I also fact checked with a dozen experts who have different opinions on pyrolysis, mass balance and recycling. Some of them, including Jenkins and Anthony Schiavo, senior director at Lux Research, provided estimates of overall yields for companies trying to make plastic. All of that information coalesced around a 15% to 20% yield for conventional pyrolysis processes and 25% to 30% for more advanced technologies. We are showcasing the conventional process because it’s the most common scenario. We took steps to simplify the math and jargon. For instance, we skipped over the fact that a small amount of the naphtha fed into the steam cracker is consumed as fuel. And we called the fraction of pyrolysis oil that’s suitable for a steam cracker “pyrolysis naphtha”; it is technically a naphtha-like product. These processes may improve over time as new technologies are developed. But there are hard limits and tradeoffs associated with the nature of steam cracking, the contamination in the feedstock, the type of feedstock used and financial and energy costs.

Pizza boxes, deli paper and cardboard clamshell boxes are biodegradeable and industrially compostable.

For recycling, we’re going to experiment with doing it ourselves—take used product back, and have our injection molder regrind it for a future batch (this is why I picked a local partner, they’re down for it).

The halogens are completely recoverable by bubbling them through an alkali mixture, doesn't matter what earth metals are used (some combination of sodium and calcium is cheapest), this will result in salts. You want to be a bit more careful about some metals, so that you don't have to precipitate them out of the salts to render them nontoxic. There are ways to preferentially bind the metals even in the gas phase, but it's best not to burn them to begin with, which isn't that hard because metals aren't found in high quantities in plastics to begin with, especially not the bad ones like cadmium and lead. Other than that, plastics are economically useful, but burying them is just delaying their release into the environment, which is not great. So burn them, and stop pretending they're useful for anything but fuel at the end of their service life.

Do you think that in a wonderful future where we get some technical advancement to be able to deal with plastics effectively, will it be easier to deal with it when it's uniformly spread through the world's landfills, or when it's sorted and dumped in bulk? reply SoftTalker 38 minutes agorootparentIf and when that future arrives, we will have plenty of plastic waste to deal with, without digging up that which is buried. Buried plastic is largely inert.

But the plastic doesn't currently go into a special landfill, it goes into the same ones as all of the other trash.[I]f the [recycling] plant can find a buyer at a price that makes sense, the bundles will be shipped off to a recycling plant. Sometimes a local one, and sometimes one as far away as Africa or Southeast Asia. If they can’t, everything goes into a landfill or gets incinerated. And even though my original comment is at zero, the industry specifically pushed recycling because by making people feel like they were helping, they would ignore the real problem.Yet the industry spent millions telling people to recycle, because, as one former top industry insider told NPR, selling recycling sold plastic, even if it wasn't true. \"If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment,\" Larry Thomas, former president of the Society of the Plastics Industry, known today as the Plastics Industry Association and one of the industry's most powerful trade groups in Washington, D.C., told NPR.\" Burying the plastic is probably the better option.“The energy required to do reprocessing is higher than the energy required to make the [plastic] in the first place,” he said. To limit carbon emissions in line with the global warming goals of the Paris climate accord, it would be better to “bury the stuff”, according to Hallett. reply paul7986 1 hour agoprevRecently my township in southern york county pa made recycling a lot more costly and thus MANY are no longer are recycling.

It seems like the solution is to tax the producer. reply kkfx 5 hours agoprev [–] Let's start to talk instead how to need less plastic. The most commonly discharged plastic is for packaging. Let's start observing the activity, usage who consume the most quantity of plastic: ready made food, small pack of anything. It's then about time to stop vending machines of micro-dose ultra-transformed \"food\", individually package fruits and vegges not to preserve them but to sell them at a higher price, the proliferation of sugar+gas added water to sell more since many in the western world have access to public clean water at home and so on. Let's star selling the as prepared leaves in a significant quantity instead of pre-dosed individually envelop mini-bags, mini-bags of sugar and so on. This will IMMENSELY reduce the quantity of disposable plastic we drop every day. We can't get rid of anything of course, but we can get rid of many. Even for milk we can start to redistribute it in the classic way instead of in the modern long-range shipping who need plastic to preserve it. If you follow this idea you'll realize a thing: we need to delete modern dense cities. They are the biggest consumer of such packaging because the fast life in tight space demand them. I'm really serious. Try imaging you as a remote worker or an in person worker in a remote spread are how and what kind of food you buy there. You are at home, no need for packed single-dose bags of sugar, you have you own favorite tea in pots, you have plenty of space to stockpile food and buying in big quantity allow to save some time and money, also you might have time to cook at home and so on. Oh, yes, it's just a slice of the total plastic we use, but it's a very big one, used for things we can avoid. Surely we have also much plastic for dress, and that's again can be reduced if we live spread because there is far less \"need\" to dress ourselves in gazillion of different outfit to go downtown, but we can't avoid that completely, let's start what we can start. reply GuB-42 4 hours agoparent> we need to delete modern dense cities... This is more of an argument for remote work than an argument against dense cities. Living in a \"remote spread\" is not great otherwise: long distance travel, limited public transport because it is not worth it due to the low population, cars are pretty much the only option. You don't have more time, again because of long travel time because of long distances. You can stockpile, but you have to take conservation into account, and plastic packaging is, maybe unfortunately, a great solution for conservation. Dense cities are quite efficient, and not particularly reliant on small plastic packaging. Many cities have markets at walkable distances that sell products in bulk. And from my experience in living in tight spaces, I think it is actually a good thing against plastic use. For the simple reason that you have less space for plastic. You have to think twice before buying something, because where you are going to put it is always something to consider, and packaging takes space too. A tea ball and tea in bulk takes less space than individual tea bags for the same amount of tea for instance. reply kkfx 3 hours agorootparentThese are common points used by those who profit from dense cities, and are mostly false while sound logic. > long distance travel Travel for what? Take a look at some EU Rivieras, there is little \"commuting\" since a slice of people work (or could work) from remote, others work locally/nearby, people normally do not travel back and forth countless of time like in a dense city. I state that for personal experience having left a dense EU city for the Alps, yes, I do travel, but not more than the number of km/miles I've traveling in the city. Simply because many \"regular trip\" are far less needed here. For instance I do not buy grocery every days but every 15 days or so. Also I have room for p.v. to recharge my car, so I consume even less from the grid, travels are cheaper both in pure monetary terms than in pollution terms. > limited public transport Witch again it's a GOOD thing despite common (interested) narrative. Collective transport was effective back then when it was just to bring workers back and forth to the factory from their homes, so every working day only with nearly always at nearly complete capacity. It was then extended in an era where cars was very expensive and only very few can own one NOT BECAUSE it was efficient for that but to allow people who can't afford a car to travel anyway at a price they can pay, and it was heavily subsidized because of that. Then it became a business munging money both from their customer and the public, wasting enormous resources to allow the city to exists but being horribly inefficient. We need to move 24h a day, anyone with their own schedules, as a result collective transports can't completely satisfy the demand, so we have a mix of personal and collective transport means both typically under-utilized wasting even more resources. Try to really think as an alien observing curious aliens from the orbit, you'll see how many resources a modern city eat just to exists, how many to get regularly updated and regularly at certain point in time get rebuild because at a certain point in time you can't evolve without big rebuilds. You need ENTIRE COUNTRIES just to build few cities. Modi in India think they can build 100 smart cities on the entire country resources. In central Asia most State can only have ONE city and so on, we do not see that because cities for us was ancient ad slowly changed, but an external observer see it very well, cities are a sink hole of resources for giving an utter life to most people. Their purpose in the modern era with modern logistic and IT? Just the service economy or keeping people owning less and less till nothing, salves of the services operated by few, modern Fordlandia equally distopic and equally untenable, a more broad description: https://kfx.fr/articles/2024-04-26-onnewdealexp-contrapolis/ > You don't have more time, again because of long travel time because of long distances. Oh I have it. Because in a reasonably spread (meaning not too little dense nor too much) living the 15' city is already there, but not on feet, instead by cars. Most people living spread can do nearly anything in 15' car trips. And they are in nature, so they can have plenty of natural activities instead of consuming paid services for anything because in a modern city anything is a service on sail... > You can stockpile, but you have to take conservation into account, and plastic packaging is, maybe unfortunately, a great solution for conservation. That's right, but at what rates? For instance I buy some times per year significant batch of pig meat, I grind and salt and flavor it at home making my own sausages and freeze them in dedicate plastic, but not single-use, containers. I buy olive and sunflower oil but not in small bottles, instead in metallic containers around 10l some, 5l others. They got recycled as well. I tend to buy wine in demijohns from \"nearby\" producer one or two time per year, and bottle it at home, again it's glass and cork recyclable and normally reused. So yes, there is still plastic, but far less and generally not single use. > Dense cities are quite efficient Is efficient for you living in tall buildings than moving to others tall buildings typically with immense machines named metros, using such buildings for less than 12h/24? I call it ALL but inefficient... > and not particularly reliant on small plastic packaging So you do not eat ready made food, typically sold in some single use packaging while working downtown? Just for instance. You do not frequently buy grocery with plenty of plastic bags, mostly too thin to reuse? > Many cities have markets at walkable distances that sell products in bulk. You can also buy in bulk from a supermarket, but you need space to stockpile and in apartments, specially in modern ones, there is not much space. Not talking about the fact that's impossible have p.v. and heat pumps for anyone anyway... So essentially the full-electric new deal is nearly impossible in cities. > You have to think twice before buying something If I see my grocery records I've bought MUCH more back then in a dense city than now on mountains, really. Simply because I buy frequently ready made stuff than dropping their relative packages to the bin. Try a simple experiment: hold somewhere your packaging for a month (if you have enough space), you'll might be shocked by their volume. Just for tea bags: I like green or white tea and I tend to buy metallic 1kg pot, they last for long. Yes, I need a bit more to clean anything but WFH it's not much an issue, in the end my waste is ZERO. Simply because having nature around I made compost, so the used tea leaves got dropped in nature, where they do not pollute. While with bags they need to be dropped to the bin, creating a certain amount of waste per day. Really, try experimenting collecting the waste you can without odors etc for a month or at least a week, then try measure it and project the same for 1000 of you per year try playing about changing habit in this model. Cities of the past, where people just live in \"wall homes, little equipment\" and tend to work \"just downstairs\" do not exists anymore, there are the theoretical \"strong towns\" who are not there and they are not compatible with today economy anyway. Modern buildings just for piped water, electricity, sewers, elevators, fire safety, seismic safety, HVAC consume MUCH MORE raw resources than small homes and makes people consume more. They are really only needed for financial capitalism, against nature and humanity. reply LikeBeans 2 hours agorootparentI think you are arguing about centralized vs distributed models. They both have pros and cons. I think it depends what you are optimizing for. And likely you need both especially with 8+ billion people. For example in a centralized model the initial investment in resources is pretty high (like building a large apartment building) but the idea that over time you can manage and operate that building with common resources among the inhabitants. Hopefully over time it uses less resources than a distributed model. reply kkfx 2 hours agorootparentYes, but there is an important point: in the past centralized means much, just to have services we need to have them nearby, there was no phones, people have only their feet and so on. Being in a city was not nice due to pollution, from heating (burned wood and coal), sewers, ... but still means having anything around. This is not true anymore. In the past being centralized for a company means having workers and customers nearby, more companies in a tight space means competition that lowered prices and pushed up innovation and so on, it was problematic but needed. Since the '80s thanks to modern logistic assembly a chair in India, with Russian wood, Brazilian caning, Chinese felt and Indonesian nails to sell it in Amsterdam became cheaper than built it nearby. Cities was still needed, most things happen on paper and we can't duplicate archives around employee homes, receiving customer there, conferences was only in person, trade fairs/expo was needed and so on, so again there was no distributed modern model possible. After internet start to spread, TLCs evolve, we do not need the office, we do not need in person conferences or trade fairs and so on. So now we can choose between centralized and distributed models. Stated that: the centralized model is not anymore the one from the past, a big residential building in the past, let's say just from the '80s was typically a big concrete structure, with a concrete or metallic roof, some windows and doors, a simple clean water distribution, hot sanitary and heating water and a common sewers, very simple electricity (since there is not much power needs), phones and TV. That was already significantly more than the '50s where phones was not really a thing and TV was a new thing only few have, no central system. Now? Well, roof need to be an insulated and ventilated one, nothing exceptional, but complex on a large structure. For seismic safety we might need or much more steel or a seismic insulation, witch again it's nothing so exceptional but still means 15-20% more raw materials, of course we need general insulation, ventilated facades, stuff to allow winter Sun penetrate the building for free heating, but not the high summer Sun, VMCs, HAVAC, f.o. maybe security cameras, elevators, .... a modern building of comparable size/number of apartments than the '80s one is more the double it's cost AND you can't count for generations in the future to amortize it, tech change. We have had classic copper phone, than FTTH, and in many cases we was not able to reuse copper ducts, TV now in large part of the western world is distributed on IP, so we need at least home networks because relaying on wifi is horrific and you are not allowed anyway in new buildings, a new cat6a/cat8 LAN per apartment instead of some chained coax, electricity is used for cars and much more powerful appliances so again we need much more stuff for it and I do not take into account how many things are now mandatory for cars, including mere garage space, not demanded in the '50s Long story short in the past, a near past, the cost of building a 40 apartment building was LOWER than building 40 single family homes and the useful life of such building was estimated certainly for 50 years but probably for 100 years. Now the useful life is perhaps 30 years and potentially 50 years and the cost of 40 apartment is greater than 40 single family homes, beside that a 40s apartments building can't evolve much. A single family home can do only a bit better but being a single family home with a bit of ground around in 50 years when the elderly parents having build if for them die their children sell/rebuild it, it's doable at a reasonable price (let's say the price of 4-6 mid-range cars, in a hypothetical spread society) so single family homes remain \"up to date\" to current tech, needs, human desires and climate change. Large buildings and cities can't. Long story short in the past there was no other options than cities, now cities are too costly and we evolve at a speed we can't amortize such cost, we do not need them also, so it's not much reasonable keeping them and pushing for smart cities which are even more costly and hard to evolve. reply vwcx 4 hours agoparentprevPerhaps. But go work at a grocery store or warehouse and you will observe the vast amount of plastic film used (and discarded). \"Shrink wrap\" covers palletized boxes and is used as a method to group cargo. Once you realize how much a single grocery store throws away in the course of unloading a truck and stocking the shelves overnight, you won't be pointing at a vending machine with a wrapped fruit as the most effective mitigation. Not to say personal consumer habit shifts won't be important, of course. reply ZeroGravitas 2 hours agorootparentThere's companies that will pay you for that kind of palette wrap and recycle it. Apparently 21% is already recycled in the US, 30% in the EU. It can also be made from recycled plastic. reply kkfx 3 hours agorootparentprevNo doubt. But can we remove such packaging? I'm not in that business so I do not really know, but I suppose not. While we can remove the ready made food. It's not differently than cars: can we have BEVs? Yes. Can we have BEV-trucks, well, there are some, but honestly they are not realistic, so what? It's better taking the cars, since so far we can for them, trying something else for the trucks or simply giving up? For something we can change, and it's a good thing to do, for something else there is no option. Even BEVs are sold as \"green\", well, they pollute much anyway, but instead of polluting the atmosphere we all breathe in, they pollute around mining sites, witch tend to exists where little to no humans live a life. It's not good anyway the pollution, but it's a choice: damaging certain area or the whole planet. For nuclear it's the same, a nuclear accident it's a disaster but normal operations are \"clean\", yes we have waste witch are an issue but in the end we put them in deserts and they can pollute at maximum there except in case of extreme climate disasters where we have anyway little chance to survive. reply CorrectHorseBat 4 hours agoparentprev [–] So to save a little bit of plastic you'd spend much more energy on everything else? Why not just use glass for milk and paper for tea? reply kkfx 3 hours agorootparent [–] Energy I can make (and I make) locally, for instance from p.v. instead of spending in plastic that demand energy anyway. There is a common misconception about modern cities than \"far past one\". Nowadays we do not simply live in dense area walking around with stairs having next to no equipment at home like in the aforementioned past where people live tight but also simply, working in most cases \"from home\" meaning they just go downstairs and they are in their shops. Modern cities demand a gazillion of things, just a building for: - clean water - hot water - sewers - fire safety - elevators - seismic safety - HVAC - .... Demand MUCH more energy than modern wood based single-family homes (if well built ad without exaggeration of course) both to be build, operated, maintained and evolved. We are not anymore in the era of rock+wood homes passing from a generation to another for centuries with little to no changes. With \"new deal\" tech we simply can't live in cities. Just take a look at a mean apartment in your country, in Italy a mean apartment need 20-30kW thermal power to heat in the winter simply because even if it's less and less cold most of them was built in an era where no one care about insulation. Modern homes with 1kW electrical can heat and cool themselves in the mean for the same country. In single family homes there is typically room to recharge from p.v. cars if you WFH or working in a spread area to recharge them from p.v. at work, the same model. In cities it's simply not possible. How much energy this alone means? Now try seeing \"future personal air mobility\" sold as urban https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/uam-full-... but definitively NOT urban, cities can't simply adapt, you need to rebuild them to adapt more than few evolutionary steps. In a spread (not too much of course) area you have plenty of space to adapt and buildings are small, they can be made in recyclable materials for most of their structure and the same is valid for local infra. Cities demand big harbors, airports, highways who consume enormous resources and can't change much, a spread are use maybe even LESS resources and being spread can slowly adapt.

This says otherwise, especially if you take into account you'll have to do less km in a dense city. If you go by bike it's even less. Personal considerations and experience, I think no such real study exists mostly because it should be really large. Taking into account all the variable in a real life case ALONE demand much effort. For first you should find data for a significant timeframe, let's say 10 years, measuring the raw materials needed to build a metro in some city, and I think no such data exists, you can get some projects but not a trustable bill of material. Secondly you have to track all buses and trains and their average consumption. Done this you have a generic measure of \"how much it cost in capex and opex the public transport system of YouNameIt city\", what you miss is a \"YouNameIt city\" spread equivalent with only private vehicles. In this case you can only measure a large number of people consumption in a spread area, count the cost of the original road network witch likely exists since so much time no one can count and their operational costs. Even if you reach such goal you have just a \"first degree measure\", you need to take into account resources needed to produce the resources you used to build the city and the spread area transport network, some are easy, let's say cement and sand, some others are far harder, like steel. And so on. You probably need an decade to craft a working model for a state like North Korea (a good one because due to it's politics (Juche) anything there is mostly \"domestic\", they do commerce of course but much less than other countries and they still have cities and spread are, though get real data on NK might be a bit hard). To cut it short the \"carbon footprint\" is a nonsense, sometimes useful but not an answer: a train travel it's far less energy intensive on a modern rail than a truck travel, the material travel, but thing change if you have to count resources needed to build and keep rails vs roads, including exchange nodes, because we do not have rails on the home front door or aside of a cultivated field. If you just count how many tons of steel you can start imaging what cost more and what less. At this scale we have no simulation, non real scientific study, only \"I like it let's try\" without possible comparisons. > You're comparing with a new build house, compare with a new/renovated apartment. I do on purpose because my new home was built in around two months, rebuild the building of my ancient apartment is practically impossible because not only you have to relocate ~53 families for an year or more but also because it's in the middle of a dense EU city where such large demolition than construction size would destroy the traffic of a significant part of the city for an year or more, such EU buildings was simply built considering an eternal useful life, and that's a bubble waiting to explode with damage not much different than those of a nuclear war. In USA something similar have happened with certain big condos collapsed or at least damaged enough to be beyond repair but USA cities tend to be far less dense and younger than EU one so MAYBE some might be rebuilt. The point is essentially that small buildings with enough ground around can be practically rebuilt, dense area can only be rebuilt in batch like relocating all the people from NY to another place and rebuilt the whole NY, witch I bet no one think it's doable or at least reasonable to do... > You still need them with spread, only more roads to spread everything around. Not exactly the same thing, yes, maritime commerce need harbors and having many little harbors and many little ships it's not much sustainable, so you need some \"hubs\" in the logistic network but having much more room for local production you can do them, and the rest of the logistic network is spread anyway so MUCH simpler and cheaper to be build and evolve. A simple example around me there are enough potential farm to have cows for meat, milk and cheese for the nearby residents, it's definitively not enough for modern living but in a hypothetical spread society it would be normal and actually it was normal in a not so far past where at least milk was generally local instead of import in from 1000-2000km away simply because there it's cheaper than here even with the needed logistic. Do so on scale and it's easy to view you need much less resources. We would anyway import shrimps from South America and India, but the volumes changes much. kkfx 1 hour agorootparentprev [–] > In a dense city most people don't even have a car.

With just 2 walls of our building retrofitted with insulation I now barely need any heating in winter, try that with a single family home. This means that you live in a nice climate, where summers are not too hot and winters are mild. Such areas exists and are typically densely populated also because of the climate but they are a very little part of the inhabited earth, or you are in a less nice climate but being \"in the middle\" you get \"free heat\" from some apartments underneath and \"insulation\" from apartments over yours. Again that's true for some, but in TCO terms it's still not favorable for the humanity at a whole, only for some humans. If you are in mild climate a single family home would barely need heat as well, not if you get free heat from neighbors of course BUT a new single family home in the same climate can thanks to insulation and mere design (compact form, large windows on the southern side, roof/other element shielding the Sun in summer while allowing it pass in the winter etc) and while you might profit from your neighbors they still have to heat/cool anyway, it's good for you but it does not reduce the overall consumption. Just for a personal counter argument: I was living in an apartment from the '60s in a mild climate, it's heated with 24kW methane. I live now in a home twice the size/a bit more than twice the heated volume, in a much colder place and I heat with 1KW most of the time, climbing to 3-4kW few late night and early morning between January and February, the maximum absorption recorded for heating was at the end of January 2017 a single night with a minima of -24.8℃ (-12.64℉) with 6.3kW. In raw material terms electricity here means nuclear (I have p.v. with small storage, but not to heat the home at night) and the grid, gas means a much more raw material and energy hungry distribution network. So again building new home demand energy, but in their useful life we amortize it and we evolve. Remain in old buildings demand still more, many times more in many cases, just to keep them operational and we do not evolve. Can we change them now?

    "originBody": "Boris Cherny's Blog About NPM and NodeJS should do more to make ES Modules easy to use June 19, 2024 Coming back to JavaScript and TypeScript after a few years neck deep in Python and Hack, I kept hitting a number of new, cryptic errors when running NodeJS code in my dev environment: # when I ran ESM TypeScript code the wrong way: Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: Must use import to load ES Module # when I imported an ESModule from a CommonJS .js file: Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module .../lodash.js from .../index.cjs not supported # when I imported an ESModule from a .ts file: error TS1479: The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require' calls # when I used ES6 import syntax in a .js file: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module These errors are all related to importing, typechecking, and loading modules. The JavaScript ecosystem moves fast, and things changing over the last few years was not a surprise. However, it was surprising to see so many errors related to such a core piece of the language! How we got here Modules in JavaScript and TypeScript have changed significantly over time: Years ago, there was no module system for JavaScript and TypeScript. A number of solutions sprang up around ways to declare and load modules: IIFEs, LabJS, AMD, require.js, TypeScript namespaces, and more. Tooling support and interop were hit or miss. CommonJS emerged as a standard-by-convention for modules, across browser, server, JavaScript, and TypeScript. When ES6 came out, folks started switching over to import and export syntax (from CommonJS’s require and module.exports), using tools like Babel and TypeScript to compile code down to CommonJS. CommonJS can be challenging to statically analyze, and uses an inefficient, synchronous module loading algorithm at runtime. ES Modules were introduced as the way to use import and export, while at the same time improving code load times at runtime. ES Modules introduced significant complexity for NodeJS in particular: instead of reusing the .js and .ts file extensions, ES Modules in NodeJS require either using .mjs, or setting type=module in your package.json. Interoperating these modules with an ecosystem-ful of CommonJS remains painful. Current state, by the numbers I was curious – since ES Modules (import/export) were introduced in 2015, and NodeJS has supported type=module/commonjs, .mjs, and .cjs, with the goal of replacing .js, since 2019, to what degree have these new conventions been adopted? I answered this with data, using two approaches: Looking at the most starred JavaScript and TypeScript repos on Github Looking at the most downloaded packages on NPM The results are not rosy. After 5+ years, adoption of ES Modules remains weak: Between 9-27% of JavaScript/TypeScript projects declare themselves to be ES Modules via the type (and lesser-used exports) fields in their package.jsons. Less than 6% of JavaScript/TypeScript files declare that they are ES Modules via the .mjs, .cjs, .mts, etc. file extensions. Note that these ranges come from the two approaches I used to estimate the numbers. Head here for more detailed data and code. How do we fix it? This helps explain why it’s so painful to interoperate ES Modules and CommonJS across both NodeJS and TypeScript: enough libraries use ES Modules that for many projects you need to either use ES Modules, or figure out how to interoperate ES Modules with your CommonJS code. At the same time, enough code still uses CommonJS that you often need to figure out how to include that legacy code in your otherwise-ES Module project. The benefits of ES Modules are significant. Rolling everything back to CommonJS is not the way forward. Is there more we can do to simplify the ecosystem, and push harder on adoption? Some ideas: We should kill .mjs, .cjs, .mts, etc. The vast majority of projects use type=module in their package.json, rather than file extensions. It would simplify things considerably if we drop support for these new file extensions and stick to .js, .jsx, .ts, and .tsx. We should make type=module the default for new package.json files for the npm init, yarn init, and pnpm init commands. Package managers’ publish commands should warn when type is not set to module. We should upgrade the most common libraries used by the community to ES Modules, either manually or through automated pull requests (this feels like something that can be semi-automated). The NPM registry can require an explicit module field on new packages, making it clear when a package intentionally uses CommonJS (eg. because it targets legacy NodeJS versions). NodeJS can officially drop support for require and module.exports in a future version, creating a bit more pressure to migrate. I’d love to hear others’ thoughts. Have you also felt the pain of interoperating ES Modules and CommonJS? Discuss this post on HackerNews or on Threads.",

Allow es modules to be require()-ed. It's be synchronous and slow and ideologically impure, but it'll make it so that millions of projects (mostly private!) will be able to start adopting es modules without a massive refactor. Anyone with a project of significant age or size looks at ES modules now and thinks \"fuck it\". There's no return on investment to convert (other than less pain while trying to upgrade or adopt new libraries). It's a big undertaking with loads of risk (modifying import order isn't safe!) and the payoff is \"it's the shiny new thing\". I had been using adminjs at work. Their new major version was ESM-only, and it was easier to _write a new admin panel from scratch_ than it was to refactor our entire codebase to be ESM just so we could upgrade one library. I expect that's the situation at hundreds of thousands of other companies. Like for all the belly aching that happened over async functions (and the whole function color rant), synchronous and asynchronous functions work together just fine through plain old promises. You can easily use async functions alongside functions that use old fashioned callbacks. ESM vs CJS is a file coloring (versus function coloring) problem, but there's no interoperability. There's no escape hatch when you just need one file to use another file but their colors are incompatible. reply microflash 4 hours agoparent> Allow es modules to be require()-ed.

(Though I'd be happier with importSync() to identify the use of ESM packages.) reply paulddraper 28 minutes agorootparentImplementing it in require() allows a library to migrate from CJS to ESM, without breaking any of its downstream users. reply jauntywundrkind 4 hours agorootparentprevBefore Node had any/experimental module support (April 2019, https://nodejs.medium.com/announcing-a-new-experimental-modu...), I'd been using std-things/esm loader for Node.js, which seemed to have no problem allowing CJS and ESM to interop, require and import each other. In my experience it worked flawlessly. https://github.com/standard-things/esm It's wild to think about: esm has taken nearly a decade to be feasible for folks to use, without heavy encumbrance; it was the key feature of es-2015/es6! It took many more years for import-maps to become a thing, such that we could start using modules in a modular fashion; we've had to use bundlers/codemods to re-resplve dependencies, unless you've been going to go Deno's original path of just hitting absolute urls wherever they be. There's still no standing proposal for how we get import-maps on service-workers & shared workers; modules still are not a ubiquitous feature of the core web & JavaScript ecosystems. 9 years latter. https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/2 It's been hard being a webdevs, when the future remains so partially implemented. The article's exploration of the bomb ecosystem is telling. And is much of the reason I hope JavaScript Registry (jsr) project might succeed. Npm will never escape it's past. CJS is going to be in there for a long time. Being on a registry where everything is esm & typescript, that sounds divine. https://deno.com/blog/jsr-is-not-another-package-manager reply z3t4 53 minutes agorootparentDid anyone actually want ES modules, and are anyone using ES modules in production today? I don't think so except for transpiling languages that compile and bundle the JS. The only argument against lazy loading is that single threaded UI's will freeze for a few ms when the code loads, but if you compare that to the time it takes to fully load a modern website that point is moot. reply apitman 4 minutes agorootparentThere are a few hiccups, but I've found ESM to be a huge win overall. The killer feature for me is the ability to write code that can be imported in a browser without any sort of build step. You don't even need node/npm. Just download the file/directory from somewhere and import. It's perfectly feasible to build a complex browser app with many dependencies using nothing but git submodules. The main thing you're missing out on is the optimizations that come with bundlers. But they should be treated as just that: optimizations. You shouldn't be required to use a bundler just to develop/distribute JS programs. reply alexose 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's awesome! I can't wait to try this. Maybe I'm in the minority, but using NPM packages that have changed over to modules continue to be one of my biggest annoyances in NodeJS: npm install node-fetch const fetch = require('node-fetch'); Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module npm install node-fetch@2 reply throwitaway1123 1 hour agorootparentYou might just be using the node-fetch example as a stand-in to make your point about esm/cjs, but the fetch api is built in to Node (since v16.15) and is no longer even considered experimental as of Node 21+. https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/globals.html#fetch reply tyleo 4 hours agoparentprevBy god do I agree with this. I feel like all my most diabolical ESM issues are beating the tsconfig.json, webpack.js, and package.json into shape to get ESM and legacy working. reply afavour 5 hours agoparentprev> it was easier to _write a new admin panel from scratch_ than it was to refactor our entire codebase to be ESM just so we could upgrade one library A middle ground answer would be using import() in CJS to asynchronously require the ESM module. It would require some hacking around your loading flow to ensure the module loads before you try to do anything with it but would still be preferable to rebuilding the entire thing. reply ComputerGuru 5 hours agorootparentI have a custom loader that can operate in both sync and async mode with the same syntax; it started off as a single loader to load AMD and CommonJS but I’ve been meaning to add ESM support as well (it was more opaque than I liked when I last tried, required too much browser magic). https://github.com/mqudsi/loader reply bastawhiz 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't disagree! But is there really an argument (other than an ideological one) for why it needs to be an awaited import? Why does it matter that it's async? reply eyelidlessness 4 hours agorootparentESM (as standardized, not necessarily as implemented in Node) treats import specifiers as URLs. That alone would inherently be async because network requests are async across basically all JS runtimes. ESM was also later extended to support top level await, making module execution itself async. Node has recently taken a more pragmatic approach, by treating local specifiers as potentially synchronous, allowing sync require() of ESM… which then fails if the required module uses top level await. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agorootparent\"Sometimes works, but can also blow up at runtime after any upgrade\" seems to me like a \"pragmatic cure\" that is worse than the existing \"disease\" of needing to treat all ESM imports as async and/or migrating all uses of `require()` to `await import()`. If incrementally moving a CJS code base to use `await import()` in more places is too hard then you probably have other problems you've overlooked for too long (bad promise usage, callback waterfalls, etc). (But I'm a hardline \"all you need is type=module\" sort and think a CJS=>TS emitting ESM \"rip off the bandaid\" approach to CJS legacy libraries works and is fundamentally easier than most of the \"pragmatic\" solutions to CJS/ESM interop. It is past time to jettison CJS out the airlock.) reply tqwhite 3 hours agorootparentprevI'd say it's exactly the opposite. Neither require() or import require an async code structure. The biggest reason I avoid ESM like a plague is that many of my projects are not, and do not need to be, async. Adding import() is a huge hassle because it is async. Adding an importSync() function would be a perfect solution. reply sureIy 2 hours agorootparentimportSync exists and it’s called import statement. reply IggleSniggle 5 hours agorootparentprevThat was my first thought, and what I attempted first in my project. But it turned out that rewriting everything, while being incredibly tedious, was significantly easier to reason about and ensure continuity than developing my own bespoke dependency loader in a large project where not all portions are well understood. reply throwAGIway 5 hours agoparentprevWhat about the createRequire function? reply bastawhiz 5 hours agorootparentWhy should I need to go out of my way to do this? Why do I need to care what kind of module I'm importing and reach into the stdlib to run code? It should just work. reply throwAGIway 4 hours agorootparentTo be frank I don't care about these questions, perhaps you're right and it should, but whatever. It's a solution I used in the three cases it was necessary that blocked moving my codebase to ESM. reply sureIy 3 hours agorootparentYou’re missing the point. Of course createRequire is a solution, it’s always been.

We really need a Python 2.7 style \"no: we're done with this. Don't uplift your code as much as you deem necessary, but we're moving on. You've had a decade by now\" event for Node. reply knallfrosch 5 hours agoprevI don't know which is which. I don't care. I don't understand the benefit of a top-level await if I can simply await in a different file. I use Typescript which adds a layer in-between anyway. At work, we use Angular, which (I think) uses both Typescript and maybe esbuild. Or Webpack. Does it compile to ESM, or CJS? Who knows, and it will change in 2 years again anyway. All of that is something that I consider to be platform-level. It's insane that millions of feature-writing devs are expected to know all these arcana. Then again, it might be fixed™ soon Ⓡ https://joyeecheung.github.io/blog/2024/03/18/require-esm-in... reply dimgl 1 hour agoparentThe whole point of this is that ESM was very poorly handled. It's irrelevant to TypeScript, esbuild, Webpack, etc. That tooling handles the complexity for you and sometimes that backfires. I've run into a lot of headaches with the TypeScript compiler. The fact that you don't know whether your codebase uses TypeScript, esbuild or Webpack is disappointing. It means that those worries have been handled for you and you don't care to learn them, which is never a good stance if you work with this on a daily basis. But I somewhat agree that it should all be vastly simpler. I also kind of agree with the downvoted/flagged comment re: Golang. The way the JavaScript ecosystem works is highly dependent on the way Node is handled. And Node has, for many years, made ESM needlessly complicated. reply dboreham 5 hours agoparentprevNow we see the benefit of having adults in charge, e.g. as is the case with golang for example. reply 999900000999 51 minutes agoprevI'm tempted to say we need a complete reset of the NodeJS ecosystem. It will never happen because it would require coordination and money, but instead of having millions upon millions of different NPM packages, many of which are downright harmful, we should have a careful selection of maybe the top 20,000 or so. And then maybe call the next generation of node something else, maybe ProJS. reply paulddraper 26 minutes agoparentIsn't the problem that ESM is proving almost too much of a reset? I'm not sure I understand what you're going for. reply PaulHoule 24 minutes agoprevThis is timely to me because I am in the middle of modernizing a project that was ejected from CRA years ago and now won’t build in Node 18. I’ve worked on a few big React projects but haven’t really looked much into how the build works, I found out upgrading one thing forced me to upgrade other things and I wound up making a lot of changes by hand to the build scripts and figured I’d probably screw something up. Dependencies changing from CommonJS to ESM was probably the most common problem that can frequently solved by version bumps (at risks of adopting changes you don’t want) At some point I decided to try the alternate path of switching to Vite for a build system since I’ve had good luck working with it for some VR side projects. It’s funny how you can code on front-end Javascript and not need to learn about CommonJS until something like this hits. reply jakubmazanec 3 hours agoprevI followed advice of Sindre Sorhus [1] and moved all my packages and apps to ESM year ago and couldn't be happier. Only Jest and ts-jest were problematic, so I replaced them with Vitest. I also never encountered problems because of the so-called dual-package hazard [2]; but IMO this isn't that much different than when you have two copies of React in node_modules - it's simply an npm/dependencies problem, not ESM problem.

Python got that right, but that's the only thing Python got right ;) reply eyelidlessness 4 hours agoparentI tend to agree, but I’ve found it mostly doesn’t matter as I stopped typing import statements almost altogether. I type a reference to the thing I want to import, in the place I want to use it, choose a suggestion from the editor, and let the editor write the import statement as a side effect. It only doesn’t work when dealing with aliases, and even then only when something isn’t cached yet. reply eddd-ddde 2 hours agorootparentYou can type the real name, import it with autocomplete, then rename the symbol (f2), which creates the alias. reply eyelidlessness 16 minutes agorootparentI should’ve been more clear that I meant import specifier aliases. Eg in TypeScript, this is often determined by `paths` in tsconfig.json. It may also be controlled by `imports` in package.json, or any number of other tools and configs. reply paulddraper 25 minutes agorootparentprevThat doesn't work so well for default or wildcard imports. (I'd argue that default + wildcard imports are bad, but ESM went out of its way to have them :shrug:) reply eyelidlessness 15 minutes agorootparentIt works okay for defaults IME, and yeah I generally avoid both but especially namespace (wildcard) imports. reply samth 14 minutes agoparentprevWe considered that syntax, but `from` was not a reserved keyword already, whereas `import` was, so the parsing situation with the actual syntax was much better. reply wvenable 2 hours agoparentprevI've been newly doing a lot more front-end development and I've been sort of impressed by the autocomplete. You start typing the name you want to import and it autocompletes the name and module that it comes from. That actually seems more useful to me. reply MatthiasPortzel 1 hour agorootparentYep. Especially with relative imports, it’s easier to type `import { myHelperFunc` and let LSP complete `tion } from \"../../../util\"`. reply jajag 3 hours agoparentprev> But I do believe they got the syntax wrong - should have been \"from fs import { readFile }\" so that auto-complete works. Personally, I prefer the \"import x from y\" format because it makes it easier to visually scan where an import is coming from; fair point about auto-complete though. reply fwlr 4 hours agoparentprevI think that particular issue could be solved with tooling - if you can autocomplete from “package name” to a given exported identifier, you must already have a mapping from “package name” to “exported identifier” somewhere in your machine’s memory; duplicate this mapping and swap the keys for values, now “exported identifier” points to “package name” as well. But I do agree that it should be “from ‘foo’ import { … }”, because then the code would look nicer. reply everforward 1 hour agorootparentA core problem here is that modules are generally a unique key, but exported identifiers are not. My editor does what you're talking about, but can be unhelpful because if I type in \"create\" I get 83,000 results. That would be much more helpful if it were pre-filtered by module so I get 6 results instead. reply jeswin 4 hours agorootparentprev> I think that particular issue could be solved with tooling - if you can autocomplete from “package name” to a given exported identifier, you must already have a mapping from “package name” to “exported identifier” somewhere in your machine’s memory; duplicate this mapping and swap the keys for values, now “exported identifier” points to “package name” as well. Sorry I don't follow. What the \"from ...\" syntax does (when typing it) is to narrow down 10k possibilities (the set of all exported functions in all in-scope modules) down to a few dozen. How would this be possible otherwise? Illustration: Case 1: importCase 2: from fs importreply afiori 3 hours agorootparentprevI dislike the assumption that natural languages are a good base for the syntax of programming languages, In my personal contrarian opinion I would have wanted something along the lines of import \"url\" with {namedImport}, defaultImport; With other keywords like import assertion mixed at the same level import \"url\" assert {type:\"js\"} with {namedImport}, defaultImport; I admit that `with` is not a great choice... reply ComputerGuru 5 hours agoparentprevI feel like it’s going to be an inevitable language update to allow that syntax. I’m surprised TypeScript hasn’t succumbed to the pressure to support that syntax, but they’re really strict about where they allow deviations from the JS superset. reply afiori 3 hours agorootparentIt is not that big of a deal, you can write import {} from \"some/package\" And then go back with working autocompletion reply jeswin 5 hours agorootparentprev> I’m surprised TypeScript hasn’t succumbed to the pressure to support that syntax They won't do this without consensus in TC39. They shouldn't either; that'd be worse than this niggle. reply ComputerGuru 4 hours agorootparentWhether they should or not and whether that would be bad or not depends on how close of a relationship you believe should/does exist between TypeScript and JavaScript l, specifically in the TS to JS direction. If I said language foo that isn’t TS but transpiled to JS all the same was considering that syntax, people might have a different opinion. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agorootparentSince Typescript 1.0 it has mostly taken the path of wanting to follow TC-39's standards rather than lead them. The most notable exception was an experimental flag for decorators at too early of a stage that's currently playing out in a compatibility war between the too many projects depending on the experimental flag in Production builds versus the actually standardized behavior. Between that and some remaining warts fromThe aim of this proposal is to enable developers to run programs written in TypeScript, Flow, and other static typing supersets of JavaScript without any need for transpilation, > if they stick within a certain reasonably large subset of the language.EAO: Okay. So the sense I get overall of this whole proposal, that it’s more of a – it’s a solution looking for a problem that it’s trying to solve a year ago when this got accepted for Stage 1, the problem statement that was in fact considered then was only effective we made up or made concrete during the meeting itself, and then – so what it looks like now is that since then, that problem statement has evolved to this current form of unifying or unforking JavaScript and somehow then presenting type annotations as a way of achieving this result. However, I’ve not been able to find any conversation anywhere or description of how in practice this unification is supposed to happen as a consequence of accepting type annotations. No one had a good answer to that, because there isn't one. Anyhow, tldr; this has basically nothing to do with any tangible reason to think ESM is good or useful in anything other than a massively broad, speculative 'maybe in the future' kind of way. ...it is most certainly not any kind of advantage or reason to use ESM for anyone, right now. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agorootparent> js + type annotations !== typescript It's very close though. The proposal is well written and covers the cases where existing Typescript code would not parse correctly/work as intended under the proposal. Most of those cases are pre-1.0 Typescript features still in the language for backwards compatibility but generally frowned upon and that you probably already have strict warnings and linter errors preventing you from using today. The big exception is a lot of TS codebases heavily use `enum` and I've still not seen enough suggestions to tighten the linter warning against it. (But there are at least some of us suggesting avoiding TS `enum` today.) reply afiori 3 hours agorootparentprevBeing able to copy paste typescript snippets in the browser console is enough of a benefit in my opinion reply Quothling 4 hours agoparentprevThere isn't that much difference on the backend if you use Node and Typescript. ESM is the standard for JavaScript and you'll probably run into situations where you can't use a new JavaScript feature with CommonJS as early as you can with ESM. There are disadvantages and advantages to how the modules load on Node, but ESM is generally improving faster than CommonJS. If you're looking into other runtimes ESM used to be the way to go because of Deno, but these days you're likely either running Node or Bun and both work well with CommonJS and ESM. If you do both frontend and backend work, or if your team has a lot of cross-over between the two sides of the ecosystem, then it'll likely be easier for you to use ESM on both ends as CommonJS isn't supported by browsers. I think the primary reason CommonJS is still around is mostly because Typescript replaces it's import/export module system with something that's basically similar in syntax to the way ESM does it untill it gets transpiled into Javascript. If people actually had to work with CommonJS modules in 2024 then I think they'd likely go insane. Not everyone will agree with me on this, but I don't think there is a reason to rewrite old projects into ESM unless you have a very good reason to do so. That being said, there isn't really a good reason to start new projects with CommonJS either... Unless you have a really good reason to do so. reply paulddraper 20 minutes agoparentprev> Can someone explain to me what the advantages of ESM actually are to me as a backend dev who uses import / export syntax in TS already? 1. The downstream users of your backend library can use ESM JS. 2. You can author (or output) isomorphic code that works in Node.js and other environments. 3. Static analysis tools can more reliably understand your dependency graph, e.g. find unnecessary code/modules/packages. 4. You can use a custom load API to do customized operations. E.g. import a YAML file as a JavaScript object.

JSR says \"here's a way to leave the original ecosystem alone, but have a better-fitting ecosystem that does the things you want\". (not sure about the 'jsr doesn't change' bit? It literally requires ES modules, in lieu of common js modules). Seems pretty relevant, to me, but YMMV.

They’re compatible enough. Javascript is weird because it has this directive for browsers to keep compatibility, but then has proponents for language changes that people try to force on everyone through framework/library use and design. All to the benefit of someone reading code the way they want to read code. It hasn’t changed because it’s not a real problem. This is like forcing main as the default branch in git. reply rty32 4 hours agoparentWell, to begin with, they are NOT compatible, in the general sense.

In fact, the introduction of ESM has been entirely pernicious, causing more problems, not fewer. Why? Because there is no importSync(). If that existed, it would be easy to interoperate. reply tracker1 0 minutes agorootparentI think it would have been more prudent if Node had chosen to stay closer to bable compatibility in terms of how it handled ESM + Require.

No major company is going to upgrade to that. It's already a project to drag a major codebase kicking and screaming to a new LTS release of your runtime (even if it makes code faster), do you really think folks will invest the time to work to make their code run slower unless they invest even more effort and modify ~every module in their codebase? ESM isn't implicitly good. The benefits of ESM are almost entirely theoretical for pretty much everyone who is content with CJS. I manage codebases right now that total half a million lines of typescript and js and I think I simply wouldn't notice any improvements from converting any of the code. The point being: this isn't a problem for me or people in similar situations, it's a problem for the folks working on Node and the standards.

It (kinda) unifies browser and server syntax, and across competing server-side JS frameworks (Node, Deno, Bun). CommonJS was clearly a NodeJS thing. We embraced ESM a couple of years back. It was a bit harder earlier on; for example our test frameworks didn't support mocking ESM code well enough. But now there's hardly anything to complain about. There's no going back really - we wouldn't want to. reply pavlov 5 hours agoparentprevES modules work natively in browsers, which are the slow-moving ships of the ecosystem. Changing course for them is completely unrealistic. There’s a billion browser clients out there. That ensures that whatever API they ship, an increasing amount of code will be written directly against it. Everybody else just needs to adapt or be seen as incompatible with the baseline of JavaScript. reply rezokun 5 hours agorootparentShow me a real product on the web that does not compile or bundle and uses native modules for code delivery. It's a dead technology that only fragments the ecosystem and makes life harder. reply pavlov 4 hours agorootparentThe web is not just for \"real products\". It's also a platform with tens of millions of hobbyists and dabblers writing HTML and JavaScript. I promise you they will use any feature that's documented on MDN as being available in all browsers. And ES modules do make life easier for someone who's just writing HTML and JS and doesn't know anything about build tools. IMO, it's the wrong attitude that we should focus on the professional ecosystem and forget about this use case. Probably most people writing front-end code got their start by creating a HTML file in Notepad (or equivalent) and loading it via file:// into the browser. reply WorldMaker 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's a great development experience today: no waiting for bundlers, easy inner dev loop, let the Browser do all the loading just like Web 1.0 and JS development was maybe supposed to feel. It will become more common in products. There are going to be startups that see that great development experience and long for some returns towards \"just FTP it to the web server as-is\" CI/CD processes. There are going to be more product owners everywhere (startups, Enterprise) that think that HTTP/2+ adoption (or even HTTP/1.1 properly configured) is acceptable in the real world and that they are done with most of the needs for bundling. reply jsmith99 5 hours agorootparentprevMany bundlers output module format - it makes features like code splitting (chunking into separate files) convenient. reply rezokun 5 hours agorootparentES modules mean you don't need to bundle your code; you just include your index.js in HTML, and all 30,000 JS files of your project come to the user's browser without trouble or delay (let's wish them luck, lol). Since you're bundling, it doesn't matter which module type you use; CJS has worked with code splitting perfectly for over 10 years. However, it's a pain every time you try to import a CJS library in your ESM or vice versa. The truth is, you can't just drop all legacy CJS packages in most real-world projects. reply pavlov 3 hours agorootparent> “all 30,000 JS files of your project come to the user's browser without trouble or delay (let's wish them luck, lol)” If only there was something in the HTTP protocol to make it more efficient to load multiple requests from the same server.

You need to elaborate a bit before making a statement like that, friend. reply tqwhite 3 hours agoprev [–] So, this guy's idea to deal with the fact that using ESM is nasty for the vast majority of existing projects, ie, those that use CommonJS, is to make it nastier? Great idea. Idiot. Here's a better idea: Make an importSync() and let people who do not agree with his religious views on ESM go their own way. Would also have the advantage of letting people make new things that use ESM while still making progress in their CommonJS projects. The advantages of ESM are simply not important to the (apparently) vast majority of smaller projects. This notion that the Great Lord Poohbahs, like this dope, have decided that all us lesser beings need to be punished because we don't agree is appalling.

In that post I listed a bunch of well-known titles I knew use curl and there was a list of 136 additional games giving credit to curl. Kind of amazing that over one hundred games decided to use curl! At the time, lots of people told me that number was probably way low and while I kind of had that feeling as well it was just a feeling and nothing else. We cannot be absolutely certain unless there is data or evidence to actually back it up. The speculation could stop this week when someone provided me with a link to a database of Steam titles (Steam, as in the video game service). SteamDB is a third-party site that among other things extracts data and figures out which “SDKs” are used by Steam games: Their list of game titles on Steam using curl. Since that list is capped at 10,000 titles, I had to filter it and add up the number of titles based on release year. Out of the 91,559 titles they currently list in their database, 22,734 are identified to be using curl: 24.8%. Not too shabby for a hobby. Discussion Hacker news cURL and libcurl",

It looks a little weird to me, for example, you need to set URL as an \"option\", and it is not \"optional\" despite the name. Wouldn't it be better to pass URL and method to \"curl_easy_perform\" function? Furthermore, it seems to use \"set option\" function with magic values to control in-memory cookie storage which is even weirder: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COOKIELIST.html Also, curl seems to have no built-in function to save data? The user has to implement write callback themselves? Also, regarding options, curl uses a single function for setting options of different types (numbers, booleans, strings) so typing for an option value cannot be used. Is that a good idea? What C developers usually use in such cases? reply Sharlin 6 hours agoparentUnfortunately C libraries aren't known for their use of strong typing or the \"make invalid states unrepresentable\" paradigm, and C itself is very weakly typed so it's not even feasible to write strongly typesafe APIs in C. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 6 hours agoparentprevYour unfamiliarity with C aside, curl is more than its API. reply dncornholio 6 hours agoparentprevWhy should a transport library deal with storing data?

Doesn’t even have to be features. Bug fixes or docs are amazing. Heck even opening really good issues where it’s clear the dev spent time getting a good reproduction. Daniel is a full time maintainer who would benefit from additional income. Many small projects have maintainers that a few dollars might be helpful but help would be more helpful. I went to some open source confs to promote a book I wrote (https://howtoopensource.dev) and free service (https://www.codetriage.com) and asked people working at booths for large companies if they can contribute to open source at their day job. Only one person had a positive example and in that case their team was literally blocked on the fix and there was no workaround. The rest seemed confused about why they should be spending work time to report issues or fix bugs. Some genuinely didn’t realize that was helpful and that “contributing to open source” doesn’t just mean releasing and maintaining your own code. So yes, please fund the software you use, also time and attention is valuable too. Last tip: If you want to make a habit of it, get it tracked like regular work. “Hey, is feature X done, can we move this card over?” …”Actually I still need to report an upstream issue before we are totally done, I’ll make another work item for it and get it checked off today”. If you feel like you would get pushback for that, then start smaller, by filing issues and talking about it after the fact.

I was reading The Wealth Of Nations by Adam Smith recently (1776), and one passage stuck to me: that the regular market works because it is driven by the inherent self-interest and egoism of humans, while only beggars expect to earn a living out of the goodwill of the people. I love free software, but it makes no sense as a business model. If you want to make money out of free software while avoiding leeches, use a serious license. AGPL3, MPL2.0 or EUPL. The entire ecosystem of permissive licenses is pushed, hard, by companies themselves, and perpetuated by their naive employees. Hence the creation of the corporate-friendly Open Source Initiative (OSI) that has completely eaten the lunch of the FSF. reply alexvitkov 5 hours agorootparentThose licenses are all a joke. If I need a library like libcurl for a commercial application, then GPL, AGPL, EUPL and even LGPL are non-starter. MPL-style licenses are fine, but it doesn't really make you any money, it just forces me to publish my patchset for the library (except not really [1]) The solution really is to use a serious license. Add a \"if you make more than $X you owe us $Y\" clause. Or use a Qt-style dual-license, where your users can buy their way out of the GPL, this way you can keep the moral high ground of using a \"FSF-approved license\". But putting yourself in a position where your work can be easily exploited and then complaining when it is is ridiculous. [1] MPL works on a per-file basis. Technically I can extend it the library with a new file that contains no MPL code and won't have to release it. The LGPL has protections against this, is worse in other ways. reply jenadine 4 hours agorootparentWhat's wrong with LGPL? reply sph 4 hours agorootparentprevMPL and EUPL don't make you money but they are in the spirit of free software while not being viral and forcing everybody to buy into the socialistic ideals of free software. A company can keep closed source their own extension to your project, but any modification to the project itself gets shared with the community, no exception. In ways it's more libre than GPLv2, without forcing big money to bend to your idealistic will (because they won't, and will just avoid using your software). Of course you can write your license, but either you do it seriously and pay $x,000 a lawyer to do it for you, or you write legal nonsense. In both cases the result is any company will just skip using your software because they have better things to do than review your custom license. There is a real people choose pre-made licenses for open source. reply piva00 4 hours agorootparentprev> But putting yourself in a position where your work can be easily exploited and then complaining when it is is ridiculous. Ridiculous is a strong adjective to use in this case, naïve would work much better without adding a harsh judgment to people who don't share your worldview. I could say the same: your position is ridiculous by only believing that humans are incapable of cooperation without having something to gain from it, such position only exist due to a system we are beholden to, not due to absolute human nature. reply schneems 5 hours agorootparentprev> Then don't choose a super permissive license like BSD/MIT. One big problem is that you cannot encode all possible wants and wishes into a legal document. Laurence Lessig, founding member of Creative Commons, wrote in Code 2.0 (1999) about four elements that regulate behavior online: Laws, norms, markets, and technology - *Code/architecture* – the physical or technical constraints on activities (e.g. locks on doors or firewalls on the Internet) - *Market* – economic forces - *Law* – explicit mandates that can be enforced by the government - *Norms* – social conventions that one often feels compelled to follow It also doesn’t help that OSI and FSF operate as though they are each other’s biggest enemies instead of all the other threats out there. I feel like the definitions of “Free” and “Open” are too binary and lack nuance. I wish for something more, an open “score”, for example. Sure the Hipocratic license isn’t permissive but the only limitation it imposes is predicated on committing human atrocities as defined in legal code by the Geneva convention. So maybe it’s “closer” to MIT then say the “business source license” which is actively restricting commercialization. Or to put it another way: If we want software devs to choose licenses that are closer to their actual goals (like CC-BY-NC) then we need to find ways as a community to distinguish these projects as better than pure closed source, proprietary software. Because right now FSF and OSI classify both the same. reply Sharlin 6 hours agorootparentprevSo, how exactly would Adam Smith explain the open source ecosystem? OSS devs clearly aren't beggars because they create value. reply schneems 5 hours agorootparentI do a ton of open source but I don’t beg. I negotiate with my employer to find a common goal that advances the business and the community. Companies don’t donate out of (pure) goodwill. Lots of talks about risk mitigation.

Tips to get better results Unique3D is sensitive to the facing direction of input images. Due to the distribution of the training data, orthographic front-facing images with a rest pose always lead to good reconstructions. Images with occlusions will cause worse reconstructions, since four views cannot cover the complete object. Images with fewer occlusions lead to better results. Pass an image with as high a resolution as possible to the input when resolution is a factor. Acknowledgement We have intensively borrowed code from the following repositories.

Have they figured out how to produce usable topology yet? They don't talk about that, so probably not. 3D artists are begging for AI tools which automate specific tedious but necessary tasks like retopo and UV unwrapping, but tools like the OP do the opposite, skipping over those details to produce a poorly executed \"final\" result and leaving the user to reverse engineer the model in an attempt to salvage the mess it made. If gen3D is going to be a thing then they need to listen to the people actually doing 3D work, not just chase benchmarks invented by other gen3D researchers.

This has been an issue for much longer than generative AI. In graphics, Siggraph papers have been publishing fully automated methods claiming “high quality” for decades that produce lower quality than human created assets or human-in-the-loop tools. Same is true of lots of other things in computer science, academics is just prone to over-automating because it’s fun and clever and because we can. This is probably the natural course of events. People publishing papers and projects are going for maximum wow, not for maximum quality. Often this is smart grad students in school, and they have no access to 3d professionals, and need to get something published asap to meet funding/graduation goals. We shouldn’t necessarily complain about it or get tired, but instead work on tech transfer. Borrow these ideas and bring them to 3d tooling. It takes time, and we have to vette them and figure out which will actually help people.

From this, I would expect a clean texture map. I am fairly certain that current technology is not up to this. I have seen a few of these papers, and (from my limited experience) very rarely is the 3d model avauable for review. reply thangalin 16 hours agoparenthttps://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes I ran Instant Meshes over a model of Mount Chimborazo and it did an okay job. Although the mesh was fairly uniform with its quads, the topology looked weird. Like the typographic equivalent of \"rivers\" running through the mesh. I decided to keep the imperfect topology, with some amount of decimation, because it looks better. https://i.ibb.co/2nX8WfC/chimborazo.png Retopology tools are discussed on a Blender forum: https://blenderartists.org/t/best-auto-retopology-tool-ever/... Have you tried them? What are your thoughts? What tool would you consider state-of-the-art? reply Daub 16 hours agorootparentInstant Meshes is pretty good. We have it installed in all our labs. The results you share seem fine for the purpose. In our experience, Quad Remesher is the best. It certainly helps that QR sits inside of Blender as an add on (unlike Instant Meshes). It is also pretty much industry standard, being used in Max, Maya, ZBrush. As for its results... I find that it has a deeper 'awareness' of the source topology. The meshes are dense when they need to be and not dense when they don't need to be. A good test of any re-mesher is to apply it to some 3D text. 3D text geometry is famously horrible. Another test is to apply it to a face. Face topology is very prescribed: there is a (mostly) single way of doing it. Any non-standard approach will create issues, especially if you wish to animate it. I would not have expected any automatic approach to work very well, yet have been surprised by the quality of QR. reply washadjeffmad 18 hours agoparentprevRight. Outside of creating something to show off in a web browse, this is currently at best a quick way to generate disposable background assets for VFX. Definitely not usable for AM or 3D printing, and more work to clean up and stylize for any given animation. Once we get artists to start producing LoRA on UV wraps of their own assets, I think it'll get interesting. reply cma 16 hours agoparentprevFor human topology wouldn't you just transfer it with keypoints to a standard topology using something advanced like R3DS Wrap? That's what is used in human scan data conversion for film to get a realistic animatable double for VFX shots. reply Daub 16 hours agorootparentI'm ashamed to say that I have not heard of R3DS Wrap. It does not seem to re-mesh as such. Rather it seems to 'wrap' an existing mesh around your raw mesh. It also manages the baking, which is sweet. This seems like a valid approach. After all, every human figure in a Pixar movie has been sourced from the same base mesh. reply qarl 18 hours agoparentprevNo, but it's not exactly hard to retopo bad geometry. You can download the models from Hugging Face. reply Daub 18 hours agorootparentIn my experience depending on the model, it can be between hard and very hard. Blenders remesh will produce something reasonable but with a gazillion polygons. Guided approaches are a lot better but are labour intensive as the user is effectively tracing over the source model. Retopology will destroy the old uv map, so a new map will need to be made. Following that, the old textures will need to be baked onto this map. I have spent easily as much as a day cleaning up (I.e. re-mqking) 3d scans. reply qarl 17 hours agorootparent> Guided approaches are a lot better Yes, they are. reply romwell 18 hours agorootparentprev>No, but it's not exactly hard to retopo bad geometry.

If so, would you mind linking your ArtStation profile? Otherwise, we don't have to agree to disagree. You can go and ask actual working 3D artists how they feel about retopologizing bad geometry, and find out what the reality of the situation is. We can \"agree to disagree\" with each other, but let's agree to agree with reality. reply ninetyninenine 19 hours agoprevReally good. This is just geometric analysis though. Geometric in the sense that the model likely doesn't understand what it's rendering. All it sees is some shape. The next step is geometry with organized contours that make sense, meaning that the model needs to cohesively understand the picture and not just the geometry. For example, if a person in the picture is wearing armor the model generates two separate models overlayed on one another, the armor and the mesh. reply Geee 13 hours agoprevGreat to see these getting better and better. This might actually be usable for geometry generation if it's possible to increase the resolution. It seems that a simple super-resolution pass could help with this. For now, using this mesh as a reference model would help a lot in a typical 3D modeling process. Those textures are completely useless, because they have all the light and view-dependency baked in.

    "title": "Atkinson Dithering",
    "originLink": "https://beyondloom.com/blog/dither.html",
    "originBody": "Atkinson Dithering When the Macintosh was released in 1984, it featured a square-pixeled black-and-white display at a crisp 72 dots per inch. The 512x342 resolution might seem less than impressive today, but for the time it was a pleasantly high-resolution consumer-grade computer. Among other things, the monospaced Monaco 9pt bitmap font featured characters that were 6 pixels wide, allowing the Macintosh to render a standard 80-column terminal with ample room for a vertical scrollbar and other niceties. Beyond Susan Kare’s brilliant type design and pixel-art icons, a cornerstone of the visual vocabulary of the Macintosh is the use of dithered images. Dithering algorithms use a small palette (in our case, black and white) to represent a larger one (simulated grayscale). Here we will examine two popular techniques: Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and a variation common on the Macintosh, Atkinson dithering. Floyd-Steinberg The central idea of Floyd-Steinberg dithering is error diffusion. When determining the 1-bit color to assign to a given pixel in a grayscale image, quantizing will result in some error- a pixel either darker or lighter than the true grayscale value. By “pushing” this rounding error to neighboring pixels, we can ensure that on average the distribution of black and white in the output image resembles the input. Your eye closes the gap, and reconstructs some of the lost information. Floyd-Steinberg dithering scans input pixels in a single pass, top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Error left over from each pixel is distributed between neighboring pixels which have not been converted yet, in the following proportions: Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion Suppose we have the [0.0,1.0] grayscale values of an image in an array pixels and the width of the image w, and we wish to generate an array of {0,1} output pixels. If we are permitted to mutate pixels in-place, a JavaScript implementation of the algorithm might look something like the following: function floyd(pixels,w) {const m=[[1,7],[w-1,3],[w,5],[w+1,1]]for (let i=0; i.5, err=(x-col)/16 m.forEach(([x,y]) => i+x.5), the error (err) is the difference between this quantized value and the original, and we simply add a fraction of that error to neighbor pixels before returning col. Original Floyd-Steinberg dithering Note that in this implementation error diffused from the right edge of the image will bleed into the left edge of the following row. The inherent noisyness of dithering makes this aesthetically irrelevant, and doing so simplifies the implementation. Everyone wins! If we wanted to avoid modifying pixels in-place, we could observe that the accumulated error we care about would fit in a fixed-size circular buffer (e) proportional to the width of our image. The result is slightly more complex, but in some ways conceptually cleaner, since our main loop is now a map(): function floyd2(pixels,w) {const e=Array(w+1).fill(0), m=[[0,7],[w-2,3],[w-1,5],[w,1]]return pixels.map(x => { const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix>.5, err=(pix-col)/16 m.forEach(([x,y]) => e[x]+=err*y) return col}) } (Array.shift() and Array.push() are used here for conciseness; use your imagination for a more efficient low-level implementation.) Atkinson’s Algorithm Apple’s Bill Atkinson developed a variation of the above technique which produces results that are subjectively nicer-looking. The basics work the same, but error is spread in a broader pattern, and only 3/4ths of the error is preserved: Atkinson error diffusion Modifying floyd2() above, we can simplify m, as all the error is propagated in an even proportion. The sliding error window e now needs to be roughly twice as large to account for the broader spread pattern: function atkinson(pixels,w) {const e=Array(2*w).fill(0), m=[0,1,w-2,w-1,w,2*w-1]return pixels.map(x => { const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix>.5, err=(pix-col)/8 m.forEach(x => e[x]+=err) return col}) } Original Floyd-Steinberg dithering Atkinson dithering Compared side-by-side with Floyd-Steinberg dithering, Atkinson’s algorithm seems to produce richer contrast, at the cost of some detail in very light or dark areas of the image. Dithering in iKe Readers of this blog might be curious to know what Atkinson dithering would look like in iKe. We can leverage iKe’s capabilities for loading remote images via the special /i operative. By specifying the built-in palette gray, the input image will be converted into a matrix of [0,255] grayscale values. To resize the iKe graphics window to match the image, we initialize the magic variables w and h based on the dimensions of this matrix. Our running error window is stored in a global (e) initialized with two rows worth of zeroes (&2*w). The definition of our mask m is virtually identical to the JavaScript version above. Most of the work happens in d, which is meant to dither one pixel. We find the value of the current pixel, incorporating accumulated error (p:x+*e), quantize the output color (c:p>.5), shift out the consumed error value and shift in a zero (e::1_e,0), and then amend e by adding the error at the current pixel at every index in our mask m (@[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]). To dither the entire image, we explicitly apply d to each pixel of the matrix, remembering to first rescale the input [0,255] palette indices into floating point [0.0,1.0] values. For an animated application of this code, it would be necessary to reset e after each frame. /i pixels;gray;https://i.imgur.com/Lcq4Xi4.png w: #*pixels h: #pixels e: &2*w m: (0;1;w-2;w-1;w;2*w-1) d: {p:x+*e; c:p>.5; e::1_e,0; @[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]; c} ,(;;d''pixels%255) Thanks, Bill. back",

It was so crisp, the black and white pixels so beautiful (especially if you had come off the typical computer hooked up to a TV).

It's a shame, digital video playback would really benefit from it as a way to eliminate posterization. reply dahart 1 hour agoparentNo, not entirely! Dithering is still very important for print media and for displays. I’m talking about dithering from 16 or 32 bits per channel, e.g. floating point and/or HDR, down to 8 bits per channel. The dithering techniques like Floyd Steinberg and Atkinson taking 8 or 4 bits per channel down to 1 bit per channel are definitely anachronistic, but not dithering where the goal is 8 bits per channel. I’ve made very expensive mistakes printing poster-sized art without using dithering, and you can end up with visible color-banding in gradients in the print that aren’t visible on a display. This is why we still need and still have dithering. This is the reason that Photoshop quietly dithers by default when you convert from 16 or 32 bits per channel down to 8 bits per channel. reply btbuildem 46 minutes agorootparentI've definitely seen color banding on video playback across multiple streaming services. Dithering would've been super helpful in resolving that. reply prewett 28 minutes agoparentprevWell, it's more niche, but it's still necessary. For instance, if you write a printer driver you'll need a good dithering algorithm, since you only get pigment on/off (even in CMYK). In fact, for multi-channel dither you do not want a normal error-diffusion algorithm, since it does not give good results for low values of a channel (for instance, rgb(255, 255, 2)). There appears to be active research on new dithering techniques. I ran across libdither [1] which implements more dithering algorithms that you can imagine. [1] https://github.com/robertkist/libdither reply SaberTail 2 hours agoparentprevAlso e-ink displays. For most of the ebooks I've read recently, the images end up posterized to the point of near illegibility. reply ddingus 2 hours agorootparentDefinitely! The better ones have really high resolution, which compliments this dither technique perfectly. reply zamadatix 2 hours agoparentprevDithering is usually applied as pre or post processing step to encoding/decoding because accurately encoding dither itself actually takes more bits than just encoding without banding would in the first place. Nowadays the easiest way to sidestep banding is to use >8 bit encoding and a codec with good psycho-visual enhancements & perceptual quantization. reply Sharlin 2 hours agorootparentOf course as post-processing step, yes. Dithering is not uncommon in games to avoid posterization of gradients (which can happen even with 24-bit colors without any extra quantization) so it would be pretty natural for media players to do it as well. And doing it in the player would mean older videos without fancy 10-bit PQ stuff would benefit as well. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 3 hours agoparentprevI assume those 10 and 12 bit codecs do it on playback, it's just that free video services bit-starve the encoders reply semireg 1 hour agoparentprevIt’s still used every day in low-DPI label printing where dithering and pixel alignment are very important. reply Tommix11 1 hour agorootparentAlso in the retro computer demo scene is dithering very important. I've seen some outrageously great dithering on C64 demo art. reply makapuf 1 hour agorootparentAlso everywhere you want smooth gradients on any application. Go search gradient rendering without banding by example. Dithering will almost certainly be mentioned. reply doublesocket 2 hours agoparentprevWe've very recently been testing multiple dithering techniques for graphics we send as bitmaps to a TIJ printer that's used as a dynamic labeller. reply feverzsj 2 hours agoprevError diffusions are hard to be parallelized. They're also not stable, meaning moving pixel may look different in different frame. But they usually give best result for static images. reply bryanthompson 2 hours agoprevOne really nice use case for dithering that I've found is for building graphics for 8-bit (Pico-8 and Picotron) games and toys. I made a ruby script that can take a graphic and scale it to whatever size, then it uses a closest color match to substitute colors for the _very_ limited Pico* palette and applies dithering to make it look attractive.

[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern reply londons_explore 2 hours agoprevI would like to see the ideas of dithering applied to voting systems. Ie. Imagine a country with hundreds of elected officials, each of which represents a town or city. Each official is part of a party. A dithering-like system could be used during the vote so that the country as a whole is fairly represented, and most towns also are represented by who the majority of their population wants. It would work by, during an election, whenever a candidate is chosen for a location, any votes for other parties get transferred to neighbouring towns and cities. That is done repeatedly until every towns seat is filled, and nearly every voters vote has an impact (if not in their local town, then it gets to help a candidate of the same party nearbyish) reply garaetjjte 2 hours agoparentJust sum party votes and calculate amount of seats for each party on national level, then assign seats for each party based on regional results. reply pacaro 1 hour agorootparentOr cut to the chase and use sortition, which will provide statistically correct representation with out even needing a vote reply garaetjjte 2 hours agoprevMore on dithering: https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/ reply m12k 1 hour agoparentAlso, here's an example of another 3D dithering technique, inspired by Obra Dinn: https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@runevision/11050883717334359... reply DonHopkins 1 hour agoparentprevHere's an example of iterative error diffusion dithering, procedural circuit bending, mis-using Micropolis (Open Source SimCity) tiles to render cellular automata (dithered heat diffusion, and Eco (Anneal + Life + Brian's Brain): Micropolis Web Space Inventory Cellular Automata Music 1 https://youtu.be/BBVyCpmVQew?t=291 Micropolis Web is the browser based version of Micropolis (open source SimCity), that uses WebAssembly, WebGL, and SvelteKit. Based on the original SimCity Classic code, designed by Will Wright, ported by Don Hopkins. This first video has music by Juho Hietala, Blamstrain, and the Space Inventory Cellular Automata is performed by Don Hopkins. https://MicropolisWeb.com (tap the \"space\" bar a few times, even though it warns you not to) The error diffusion dithering is most noticeable when there's not a lot of heat change in the system (strong enough heating or cooling rotates the tiles towards the extreme, then they wrap around, producing chaotic boiling lava lamp blobs). Without the error diffusion dithering, the heat diffusion produces much more geometric less organic patterns (sharp diagonal triangular crystals that melt away quickly, instead of fuzzy dithered curvy gradients that smoothly organically diffuse and stay around for a long time). Strictly it's not actually a \"cellular automata\" because of the error diffusion: information travels further than one cell locally each frame -- the leftover energy can \"quantum tunnel\" in the direction of scanning (serpentine left/right / right/left) into cells downstream arbitrarily far away. So when you draw in one part of the image, the dither fingers in all parts of the image wiggle in response. A true cellular automata has no \"action at a distance\" and the flow of information respects the \"speed of light\" (one cell or so per frame, depending on the radius of the neighborhood). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_bending >Circuit bending is the creative, chance-based customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low-voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children's toys and digital synthesizers to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. >Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with \"bent\" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and potentiometers that alter the circuit. reply AceJohnny2 2 hours agoprevWhy is the Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion kernel so uneven? What's the output like if the error is distributed equally among the bottom-right pixels? And this is a naive question, but could one construct a kernel that diffuses the error across all surrounding pixels, not just the bottom+right? I get that this will cause recursion difficulties as error bounces back-and-forth between neighboring pixels, but is that resolvable? reply chowells 2 hours agoparentBottom+right is purely a performance optimization, when processing top-to-bottom, left-to-right. You only ever push the error terms to pixels you haven't processed yet, so the whole algorithm remains a single linear pass. That was the standard approach for handling images at the time. Everything was stored as lines of raster data, rather than the blocks modern compressed formats prefer, and there wasn't parallel processing available to speed things up in ways that make linear data dependency awkward. reply nullc 1 hour agorootparentIt doesn't just prevent you from having to make two passes, it prevents you from having to make potentially infinite passes! reply DonHopkins 1 hour agoparentprevInstead of top/bottom left/right scan, you can perform a serpentine scan that goes top/bottom, but alternates left/and right/left each row, zig zagging as it goes down the page. That way the errors get spread out more evenly, and you don't get 45 degree diagonal flowing artifacts down and to the right.

Floyd-Steinberg definitely benefits from the latter approach.
