It was Nóva who inspired us to come together to build Hachyderm, whose vision created Nivenly, and whose mission we continue to carry forward. In her working life beyond Nivenly, she has left behind a legacy of professionalism and strength of vision, and we all miss her terribly. This is very fresh and raw for us in the Nivenly community right now, so we ask for patience while we figure out how we move forward. But move forward we will, as we know that is what Nóva would want. ←Previous Next→ © 2023 The Nivenly Foundation All Rights Reserved",

Her passion wasn&#x27;t just about writing code, but about bringing people together, breaking barriers, and making technology accessible to all. Kris&#x27;s vibrant personality and dedication to collaboration will be deeply missed, but her impact on the world of open-source won&#x27;t be forgotten. She has left a personal imprint on many of us, and her spirit will continue to inspire those who believe in the power of community-driven innovation. I will miss her so much.

Most people are not \"free\" soloing as it&#x27;s called in the US (just soloing in the UK). If he&#x27;s the sort of person that&#x27;s attracted to those kinds of things he&#x27;ll find other dangerous stuff to do anyway like sky diving, riding motorbikes.

I was an instant fan. I ran into once at Salesforce Park in SF, and told her about how I followed her and loved her works. It so happened she was talking to a VP at the time, explaining the importance of social media in tech, to that worked perfectly for her.

Not a lot of people are killed flying in wing suits but that&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s such a safe activity.To be clear, I think mountaineering is a perfectly rational activity for people to pursue so long as they&#x27;re going into it with their eyes wide open. I&#x27;ve certainly done activities in that vein that some reasonable percentage of people would probably consider excessively dangerous for various reasons.I wouldn&#x27;t personally do many of them but I&#x27;d hesitate to criticize people in general for pursuing activities that have greater than typical day-to-day danger associated with them. reply dijit 14 hours agorootparentFWIW the article I linked says exactly the same thing as you.It&#x27;s essentially impossible to properly normalise across hours of doing the activity.Those stats, are at best, an estimate but it&#x27;s exceptionally favourable to mountaineering. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentI clicked through the link and looked at what data was available--looked like a lot of broken links. But, depending on your definition of mountaineering, as someone with a fair bit of experience in the area, I simply don&#x27;t believe that mountaineering at any significant level is safer than driving whatever sort of normalization you settle on. The latest fatality stats for US roads is something like one per 100 million miles.However, as both you and the link suggest, it&#x27;s essentially impossible to normalize. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d even draw a hard line between a \"walk in the woods\" and \"mountaineering.\" But do whatever works for you. reply pcthrowaway 10 hours agorootparentprevI think \"mountaineering\" is probably more dangerous, especially once you get into the alpine.I do (and love) outdoor climbing and even a bit of mountaineering, but it seems like most accomplished climbers die in the alpine. Some of what people do makes Honnold&#x27;s famous free solo of El Cap look tame by comparison reply hobo_mark 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not criticizing. I&#x27;d like to understand what might make climbing a tall rock worth losing my life. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s risk in all manner of things. Some I would personally consider as high risk for relatively low personal reward--or I&#x27;m not physically capable of doing them anyway (which alas covers more things than used to be the case).But people like challenges, experiences, etc. some of which are never going to be wholly risk free. I&#x27;m not going to pressure someone to get out of their comfort zone in a way that puts them in potential physical danger but I fully understand people who pressure themselves. I&#x27;ve certainly gotten into some dicey situations now and then. Nothing serious happened--I was generally prepared--but it wouldn&#x27;t have taken a lot for things to go sideways.Or maybe you get distracted and forget to look both ways before crossing the street. reply outside1234 11 hours agorootparentprevSitting in front of a computer will claim a lot of lives through inactivity but manny people still do it because it brings meaning &#x2F; relaxation &#x2F; connection to other people to their lives.Its the same with mountaineering. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think those statistics mean what you think they mean. And those two activities are not directly comparable in that way. reply j45 15 hours agoparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t have to make sense to others.If I was to imagine what I didn&#x27;t know about mountaineering, it might be about working to see views that I couldn&#x27;t have imagined. reply ocdtrekkie 15 hours agoparentprevSimply put: They enjoyed doing it. I wouldn&#x27;t do it. But I would say I definitely see why someone would rather leave this world doing something that brought them joy over something like cancer. reply voidfunc 18 hours agoprevnext [3 more] [flagged] bhouston 17 hours agoparentIt was a climbing accident on Wednesday. reply voidfunc 16 hours agorootparentUgh. Terrible reply dijit 17 hours agoprevnext [19 more] [flagged] argiopetech 17 hours agoparentTo steelman your point, I believe you&#x27;re saying that an Autistic person may have difficulty not \"being an asshole\" due to lack of understanding or awareness of how you&#x27;re interactions with others may be perceived. Therefore, while the rules try to be inclusive of autistic people, they are simultaneously exclusive by requiring a level of social awareness that may be impossible.Is that correct? reply dijit 17 hours agorootparentThat is exactly my position, thank you for articulating it so eloquently. reply argiopetech 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad. I appreciate and understand (viscerally) your point, and I don&#x27;t believe it is deserving of the backlash that you have received. Hopefully my restating will support a more intelligent conversation, or at least earn you a fake internet point or two back. reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agorootparentprevYou might want to update your original comment to clarify.It seems to be getting downvoted by people who misunderstanding the comment. reply dijit 17 hours agorootparentUnfortunately I cannot edit it, but downvotes are ok.as others have mentioned, this topic is probably not a worthwhile one to bring up as the focus is on mourning one of our own. reply fumeux_fume 17 hours agoparentprevWould like to politely point out that this is not really the time or place to be posting your petty gripes with a person who just passed. reply dijit 17 hours agorootparentPardon, I was merely lamenting that I didn&#x27;t know her better.It was not my intention to air a gripe. reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m sorry you experienced that.I&#x27;m on the spectrum, and my son even more so. It&#x27;s painful when my heart is in the right place, but neuro-typicals mistake my intent and refuse to believe me.It&#x27;s taken a lot of effort for me to adjust my communication style to avoid those situations. Happily it&#x27;s mostly paid off, but I&#x27;m sad that my son will likely need to walk the same path somewhat. reply ahelwer 15 hours agorootparent(am also on the spectrum)> neuro-typicals mistake my intent and refuse to believe meThis is an idea I had to unlearn. We struggle as much understanding ourselves as understanding other people. When people react negatively to our behavior often times we immediately jump to extending unlimited benefit of the doubt to our own intentions. In reality, our perception of our own intentions are often post-hoc fabrications to preserve our self-image as a nice person. Letting go of this assumption was helpful to a better understanding of interpersonal interaction. reply 0ct4via 17 hours agoparentprevSounds like your message implied that being autistic meant being an asshole, which categorically isn&#x27;t true.You can be accused of being an asshole, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s because of your autism though - and going \"autistic = asshole\" is absolutely worthy of a ban.Maybe don&#x27;t be so quick to portray your own experiences onto autistic people as whole. If you wanted more specifics about what Kris meant by \"don&#x27;t be an asshole,\" you could&#x27;ve asked her (or any Hachyderm staffer).You are not every autistic person, and not every autistic person is an asshole.Portraying all autistic people as assholes - or implying that by virtue of being autistic, they can&#x27;t not be an asshole - is incredibly ignorant and ableist.While I sympathise with your struggle with intent or clarity, it does seem that you were an asshole, and your projected assumptions about autistic people because of your own experiences are harmful, not helpful. reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agorootparentI think you may have misunderstood. (See sibling comments in this thread.) reply 0ct4via 16 hours agorootparentI understood it fine, but thanks for the assumption.It was put across in an asshole way, and bringing it up when it has no relevance to commiserating the loss of a great person and engineer, is an asshole move - autistic or not. reply KomoD 17 hours agoparentprev> I pointed out on twitter that the rules for her mastodon server were incompatible (IE; “Don’t be an asshole” and being welcoming to Autistic people)Calling all autistic people assholes is very worthy of being blocked and banned reply dijit 17 hours agorootparentApologies, that&#x27;s not what I intended to say, and not what I said to her either.It&#x27;s unfortunately true that my behaviour (and the behaviour of many autistic people) can be easily characterised as being an asshole, and vague rules do not help us function.The condition is very much characterised by being unable to understand social cues.I really was trying only to be helpful and got quite hurt in the interaction. reply foogazi 8 hours agorootparentDijit, Why is a rule about “Not being an asshole” incompatible with welcoming Autists ? reply dijit 4 hours agorootparentargiopetech stated the problem much better than I did: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37200670The fundamental issue is that Autism itself is at least partially characterised by being unable to read social cues, this is harder in text form.Its very easy to say something in perhaps not the best way. To welcome autists you have to do what the hackernews guidelines do: State that “Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize. Assume good faith.”This is not essential to operating your site, but if you are trying to be inclusive to neurodivergency then its extremely helpful to them to have a guideline like this which allows them to feel a bit at ease.A rule like “don’t be an asshole” requires a emotional intelligence that may be lacking, it will feel like a guillotine around the neck waiting to strike if you comment something which is interpreted in way other than it was intended.A fantastic example of this, ironically, is this thread and the original thread with Kris. Mal-intent was assumed but was not intended; people in this thread have genuinely called me an asshole- with no sense of irony. reply deanCommie 17 hours agorootparentprevDijjt, I do have some empathy for you. I&#x27;m on the spectrum but only mildly.You&#x27;re right that social cues are complex and inconsistent.But it&#x27;s not helpful to the autistic community to suggest that they are unable to learn how not to be an asshole - in online, or irl communities. I know many that started with struggles, but learned how to handle it.The trick was wanting to try. To decide that the empty annoying irritating things that allstics do are not malicious either. And that social interaction is like the rules of a very complex game.It takes time, it takes effort, it takes humility.I don&#x27;t know you so I would never presume what your situation is. But I know of several people in my life who are on the spectrum that I got close to before I realized that they genuinely have no interest in self improvement, and they use their autistic diagnostic as a cover to see themselves as above petty human social squabbles, and that their assholishness is a mark of pride that they use to refuse to better themselves. I hope that&#x27;s not where you are at. reply serf 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not what was said. What was said was implying that autistic folks need the ability to have their actions judged from the perspective of their trouble rather than just blindly judged &#x27;asshole&#x27; when they make a social miss-step.Regardless, this isn&#x27;t the time or place for moderation chat; one of our own had suffered a tragically early demise, and I mourn.

In the usual model for expansion ΛCDM Λ 𝐶 𝐷 𝑀 , it is at a redshift of about 1.5 or about 15 billion light-years (corresponding to a light travel time of about 10 billion years, or about 4 billion years after the big bang, the distance is greater due to the expansion of space) I'm using rounded values here, because the actual distance is quite sensitive to the exact parameters of expansion. A galaxy from 400 million years after the big bang (a distance of 32 billion light-years) would look as big as a galaxy that is 2.7 billion light-years away. (These figures from Ned Wright's calculator) It's illustrated in this xkcd comic. You can see nearby \"galaxies\" are large and bright, more distant galaxies are smaller, very distant galaxies are large, dim, and red.

Whoever created it was not a fan of the KISS principle. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agorootparentI actually think the opposite is true. The way I&#x27;ve heard it phrased and explained that makes the most sense to me is \"everything moves through spacetime at the same rate\" - it&#x27;s basically the clock speed of the universe. It&#x27;s just that if you move faster in a space dimension that your relative movement in the time dimension slows down.It only seems weird to us because our senses and minds evolved in an environment where things we can perceive never differ by relativistic speeds. reply someplaceguy 15 hours agorootparentWhile I do like that intuitive explanation, it&#x27;s lacking in describing all other aspects of the universe.Like, how the energy required for an object with mass to approximate the speed of light in spacial dimensions goes to infinity, even though it&#x27;s already traveling at that speed through spacetime.Or quantum mechanics. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentSure, one simple sentence is not going to explain the universe. But, at least from the simple relativity side of things, essentially everything falls out of (that is, it&#x27;s a consequence of) that simple sentence. I.e. starting from that you can derive other consequences. E.g. \"how the energy required for an object with mass to approximate the speed of light in spacial dimensions goes to infinity\" is actually a direct consequence of that statement: every amount of energy you push into an object with mass causes it to accelerate, but due to the essential \"clock speed of the universe\", that acceleration is less and less as you approach the speed of light, and thus it takes an infinite amount of energy to reach the speed of light. Another way to think of it is that if it took anything less than an infinite amount of energy to reach the speed of light, then the speed of light couldn&#x27;t be the universal speed limit, because you could add more energy that would accelerate it further.On the other hand, my understanding is that quantum mechanics is another beast entirely, and one of the biggest problems in physics, and to developing a \"theory of everything\", is to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. reply DougMerritt 14 hours agorootparentprevAlthough nothing will explain everything, still it&#x27;s fine with the first point: increasing the rotation vector of momentum in spacetime increases mass. The rest follows, since you know that the more mass, the more energy required to accelerate still more.But if you are interested, a significant amount of the basics of quantum mechanics follow directly from Fourier transforms -- which unfortunately are harder to self-study than spacetime rotations. reply jiggawatts 7 hours agorootparentprevI came up with a variant of this that extends the motion vector into “matter” dimensions. Then the logical consequence is that the more matter you have, the less of the unit vector is available for movement in time == time dilation due to mass.Similarly, only vectors with zero length in the matter direction can have unit length in the space&#x2F;time direction. This is the “only massless particles move at the speed of light” rule. reply rakoo 17 hours agorootparentprevOr, they just set the speed of light as a #define and left the rest as undefined behaviour reply hn_throwaway_99 13 hours agorootparentPerhaps nit picky, and I know you were joking, but I think this is the wrong way to think about it. It&#x27;s not that the other behavior is undefined, it&#x27;s you essentially have all of these functions that use \"C\" in their definitions, and then you have \"#define C ...\" in a header file somewhere. reply lamontcg 15 hours agorootparentprevNah, its real simple. SR just comes about because you want to keep chemistry working the same on a rocket doing 99% of the speed of light as it is at rest.Working out all the implications becomes very complex.But then you probably wouldn&#x27;t have life to observe it if the simple rules didn&#x27;t have complex emergent behaviors. reply russdill 16 hours agorootparentprevA limit to the speed of causality makes physics so much simpler. Without it you&#x27;d need to factor in the interaction of every particle with every other particle in the universe. reply someplaceguy 16 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t you need to do that anyway, because of gravity?Wouldn&#x27;t the causality speed limit just cause those gravity interactions to arrive with a time delay rather than being instantaneous?Which means that to simulate the universe you essentially have to keep a history of how gravity is propagating, which requires keeping more information than if interactions were instantaneous?In a sense perhaps this applies to light too, because since it has a finite velocity now you have to keep track of how all the photons individually propagate through spacetime, whereas if light traveled instantly this would not be necessary?EDIT: The advantage I see in a speed limit is that you should be able to compute what happens in a point of spacetime based only on the information that is around that point (which still might have come from any or all other particles in the universe, mind you). For me, this emphasizes how important locality must be and it basically converts the popular \"spooky action at a distance\" claims into nonsense to me.I guess that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a fan of the Many Worlds Interpretation. reply knome 16 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;spaceplace.nasa.gov&#x2F;gravitational-waves&#x2F;en&#x2F;Gravity waves also travel at the speed of light. reply someplaceguy 16 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t that what I was saying?Since they have a speed limit you have to keep track of all gravity waves associated with all particles of the universe throughout all time and space.So all particles still interact with all other particles, all the time, it&#x27;s just that they do it with a time delay.If there wasn&#x27;t a speed limit it would be much simpler because all gravity interactions would be instantaneous and you wouldn&#x27;t have to keep track of gravity waves. reply depressedpanda 15 hours agorootparentIf light acted instantaneously you would have to calculate the effect of it&#x27;s rays everywhere all at once, which I think is quite expensive given how vast space is.However, since the speed of light is miniscule compared to the size of the universe you can ignore all but the most local interactions, and just schedule a computation sometime in the future when you know that the light vector will interact with something.While instant calculations would perhaps make for a simpler system conceptually, the speed limit and locality principle ensures that less processing power is needed (at the cost of a lot of memory). reply wheelerof4te 14 hours agorootparentprevAs someone already mentioned, you would have to account for all the interactions with light -> everywhere at once.With a effective speed limit to space-time, you can \"localize\" the computation to the spaces where light has reached. And who knows, maybe light can&#x27;t travel forever, it might just disappear after crossing some distance we still haven&#x27;t measured (how we&#x27;d do that, who knows).Giving yet another evidence to the \"grand simulation\" theory. \"The universe\" is just a group of simulated worlds connected by interacting photon particles (light). reply someplaceguy 14 hours agorootparentRight, that&#x27;s what I meant when I said that the advantage of a speed limit is locality. It allows you to compute the next state of a point in spacetime based only on the points around it.But my point was that this also makes the universe more complex than an alternative fictional universe where information can be accessed instantaneously across any distance (which still allows for distributed computation, if synchronization or lazy computation is possible). reply wheelerof4te 14 hours agorootparentPossible alternative, but what would be a factor of locality in such an universe? And how would the universe store the infinite \"light matter\" in it&#x27;s \"memory\", since light particle beam being instant means that it has no limits to where it can reach, and will grow depending on distance traveled (which is infinite)?Some processes that are outside of scope we can sense seems like a too cheap explanation. reply cmpalmer52 12 hours agorootparentprevA universe is a computer that simulates a universe. reply wheelerof4te 12 hours agorootparentWe actually don&#x27;t know and can&#x27;t really know what simulates the universe.But we can deduce from various cues that it is being \"simulated\".The Double slit experiment is one, experience of deja-vu another, dreams that partly manifest in reality after some time, the apparent speed limit of light, out of body experiences, the fact we are the only local top intelligent lifeform in this part of galaxy, etc...All signs of processes and memory \"bugging out\". Except the last one, that one seems to be by design. reply tshaddox 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s unique about gravity with what you’re talking about? The Coloumb force also applies between every pair of electrically charged particles, right? And with the same inverse-square function of distance? reply someplaceguy 11 hours agorootparent> What’s unique about gravity with what you’re talking about?Nothing, it was just the most obvious example (to me). reply BiteCode_dev 16 hours agorootparentprevGravity is not instantaneous. reply FreshStart 4 hours agorootparentprevGravity effects are causality bound too? reply LadyCailin 16 hours agorootparentprevTangential question: is the speed of causality coincidentally the same as the speed of light? Or are they the same because of some underlying principal that inherently links them? reply satvikpendem 16 hours agorootparentCorrect, the speed of light is actually the speed of causality, we just so named it after light because that was what we first discovered as going at c, but many other things in the universe also due because it&#x27;s the same underlying principle. That is why gravitational waves also travel at c, ie if you removed the sun instantaneously from the solar system, the Earth will continue to orbit for 8 minutes, as that is how long light (and the gravitational force) takes to get from the sun to the Earth. reply squeaky-clean 15 hours agorootparentprevNot an expert, but can&#x27;t resist chiming in anyways... One thing to think about it what exactly is causality? There&#x27;ll be tons of different definitions, but they&#x27;ll all have one thing in common, events that cause \"later\" events, and&#x2F;or events that depend on \"earlier\" events.And in a physics sense what is an event? An interaction between two things, right? And since there doesn&#x27;t exist any force that can interact instantaneously across distance, the speed limit of causality is equal to the speed of our fastest forces.If we discovered some scifi-esque Tachyon particle that traveled at 2C, we could no longer say the speed of light is the speed of causality. reply someplaceguy 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not an expert either, but I like to think that the speed of causality is the speed at which a piece of information (e.g. a particle, a gravity wave, etc) is traveling through space.So the speed of light &#x2F; gravity is essentially the maximum speed of causality, because nothing can travel faster than that.EDIT: Or you can think in terms of how information propagates through spacetime. In this point of view, the speed of causality is always the speed of light, for everything, including particles with mass. reply squeaky-clean 14 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;s what I was trying to work towards. Basically that causality is an abstraction, or at least a \"higher level\" idea. And if we look at the components of it, we can see that interaction between two things is a central part of it. And an interaction between two things in our universe has a maximum bound of the speed of light (and gravity and so on). The speed of causality is just the speed of the fastest thing. reply anon291 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the reverse. Light and gravity travel at c because they (at least light) are mediated by particles &#x2F; systems that have no mass.Mass is what slows the speed of causality for certain particles. For example, while the photons I emit may travel at C, the massive particles that make up &#x27;me&#x27; cannot. reply mr_mitm 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m an expert, and an event is just a point in spacetime. reply squeaky-clean 10 hours agorootparentSure, but events have a causal future light cone which can have a causal relationship with future events, and a past light cone with the inverse. reply d1sxeyes 13 hours agorootparentprevThey are the same, because there’s no such thing as the “speed of light”.Theoretically as I understand it, everything moves at exactly the same speed through space-time, whether it is light, the Earth, etc.At non-relativistic speeds, this means moving along the time axis at approximately one second per second, with the rest of the movement in space. At relativistic speeds, higher proportions of the “speed” of an object are along the time axis.As the energy requirements for moving massive objects through space at relativistic speeds are huge, we can only really observe this phenomenon with light, which has no mass, and therefore does not need huge amounts of energy to move through space.As a result, we call 186k miles per second the “speed of light” when actually it is just the maximum speed anything can travel through space, and due to light being massless, it happens to be the speed that light travels through space too. reply anon291 3 hours agorootparentThis is my understanding as well. All massless particles must travel at the speed of light (they cannot be slowed down) and moreover, they must travel at the speed of light in all reference frames.Whereas massive particles can remain at rest. There&#x27;s no such thing as an unmoving photon. reply someplaceguy 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not a physicist, but AFAIU the speed of travel&#x2F;causality for light is only the maximum speed of causality because photons have a mass of literally zero.If photons had non-zero mass they could only travel slower than the maximum speed of causality (which would probably be called speed of gravity rather than speed of light, in this alternative universe). reply quickthrower2 8 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anthropic_principle reply he0001 16 hours agorootparentprevFrankly, it may very well be KISS because the other options were so much more complex.

It seems like a standard KISS artefact when abstractions leak from lower levels to upper. reply nickpeterson 16 hours agorootparentprevI think our senses are just imprecise and it undermines all our thoughts and perceptions of the universe when things approach limits. reply dredmorbius 16 hours agorootparentOur senses are evolved to maximise our fitness function within our immediate reality. There&#x27;s a view that our senses don&#x27;t reflect truth so much as evolutionary fitness, which involves both compromises and biases.[1]Our evolutionary environment for the most part has excluded relativistic effects.Though that raises the interesting question of what sense perceptions of an organism evolving under such circumstances might be.________________________________Notes:1. Donald Hoffman is the principle proponent of this that I&#x27;m aware of: . I&#x27;m not entirely sold on the hard-line version of his argument; it seems to me that there&#x27;s a general tendency for adherence to truth to be more parsimonious than outright fabulation, in which the nonessential inaccuracies of the sensing system incur additional costs. reply anon291 3 hours agorootparentprevRelativity makes it simpler actually. reply fallingknife 16 hours agorootparentprevI have to disagree.

That is to say, it&#x27;s \"elsewhere\" (a technical term (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.phys.ksu.edu&#x2F;fascination&#x2F;Interlude1.pdf)).Seems to me that in this alternative, cosmic expansion could be explained as gravitational attraction between elsewhere-matter and matter in our light cone.Imagine there&#x27;s some argument to be made for why this is not the case, but I don&#x27;t know it. It would require a bit of explaining re: why that point in history and not some other?- Is it that the maximal distance is constant and that the cmb is subtly changing in ways we havent noticed (as the point of most-distant-past moves forward in time)- Or maybe something caused the speed of light to change at that time, pruning the rest of the universe from our view. reply drorco 19 hours agoparentprevSo essentially one giant blob of cosmic background radiation was at the time its light was emitted, the size of an atom or so? reply ben_w 18 hours agorootparentKinda but different scale, the CMB era universe was about 1100 times smaller than that now, so still huge.There may be a neutrino background behind the CMB, where the universe was even smaller, and the gravitational wave background behind that with even more of a size difference. reply bloopernova 16 hours agorootparentWould the universe in those other 2 older events have been 2 orders of magnitude smaller still?

The entire universe was everywhere as hot as the surface of a star at the time of the CMB, so any evidence of galaxies forming before that is surprising.The surprisingly high uniformity of the temperature of the CMB — isotropic to roughly one part in 100,000 — is one of the reasons the Big Bang model replaced one of the older competing hypotheses (continuous creation IIRC).So it is in fact the case that everything cooled very very uniformly and I&#x27;m not sure why you think otherwise?I&#x27;m also not clear what you&#x27;re saying with> so we should see a transition somewhereGiven the CMB is itself the transition that we see.> Sometimes, somewhere there must be a galaxy past CMB.I think here you&#x27;re mixing up space and time.It&#x27;s reasonable (please permit my use of conventional language rather than 4-vectors) to assume that a galaxy exists on the other side in space of the CMB as we see it now, but that happens at a point in time after the recombination epoch began and space became transparent, and light from that event hasn&#x27;t reached us yet; when it does, the apparent distance of the CMB will be large enough for the galaxy to appear on this side.Are you familiar with light cones and the convention of one space axis and one time axis?

It&#x27;s like the temperature of a water stream from underground: it&#x27;s uniform across a climate area because underground temperature averages seasonal temperature shifting. reply ben_w 3 hours agorootparent> It should be behind some of the CMB produced by BB, isn&#x27;t?A reasonable mistake, but no.If you look at the info box on your link, you&#x27;ll see there are two different distances:≈33.2 billion ly (10.2 billion pc) (present proper distance)≈13.6 billion ly (4.2 billion pc) (light-travel distance)The latter is what we&#x27;re talking about when we say the CMB is about 13-point-whatever billion years old.The difference with the other number is that the universe got bigger in the meantime, and that&#x27;s where we recon it is now.> Where it is, that plasmaThe plasma itself?Everywhere. The whole universe, including here.The bit we see?An echo made of light emitted at the last moment in time that it stopped being plasma — the light from the plasma that was here is now as far away from us as the plasma that caused the light we can see. reply oneshtein 2 hours agorootparentThese numbers means that nothing can travel at FTL speed except this galaxy. It travelled 20Bly in 13By at the speed of 1.5 c. Extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence. Where is the source of energy for this FTL galaxy? Why this galaxy is not ripped apart into ball of gluon plasma?Echo requires something to reflect of. Moreover, echo will be an order(s) of magnitude weaker and will have a stamp of the reflective surface on it properties. reply ben_w 2 hours agorootparent> These numbers means that nothing can travel at FTL speed except this galaxyNothing including this galaxy can beat light locally.Look up the balloon (or raisin bread) analogy.> echo will be an order(s) of magnitude weaker and will have a stamp of the reflective surface on it properties.It does. That&#x27;s in the CMB. reply DiogenesKynikos 5 hours agorootparentprevGLASS-z12 is way in front of the CMB.You have to be careful with what you mean by \"distance\" at cosmic scales. Space is expanding with time, and there are several different definitions of \"distance\" that give very different results at cosmic scales.The best \"distance\" measure here is simply redshift. GLASS-z12 is at redshift z=12, as the name suggests. The CMB is at redshift z=1100, so it&#x27;s father away.In fact, for very straightforward physical reasons, no light can reach us from beyond the CMB. The universe was opaque before the time of the CMB, because it was ionized and dense. Before the CMB time, photons could not travel very far at all before they hit an electron and were scattered. reply oneshtein 3 hours agorootparentNobody pointed to a source of energy for this \"expansion\" of \"space\". Usually, coordinate system doesn&#x27;t expand with time. An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence.Yes, CMB emitters are much further away, at a distance of about 4Tly, while BB claimed to be just 14By ago. Your claim, that CMB is produced by BB, requires a lot of stretching. reply ben_w 2 hours agorootparent> Nobody pointed to a source of energy for this \"expansion\" of \"space\".Several have been made, the suggestions have issues.> Usually, coordinate system doesn&#x27;t expand with time.Define \"usually\". Do you have experience of other universes?> An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence.Indeed, but this comment box is too small to do the evidence justice.Edit: that&#x27;s unhelpful in retrospect, so I suggest the Youtube channel \"PBS Space Time\". The videos build on each other, so start at the beginning and work through the back catalogue.> Yes, CMB emitters are much further away, at a distance of about 4Tly,I have no idea where you got this belief from. reply oneshtein 2 hours agorootparent> Define \"usually\". Do you have experience of other universes?I have experience with coordinate systems. I can bend or expand space-time on my computer all day long, to simulate reality, but I cannot do that in the real world at all.> Indeed, but this comment box is too small to do the evidence justice.Looking for the paper or a blog post! However, I suspect that you will just stretch evidence until it will match your model.> I have no idea where you got this belief from.Just by looking in the window, I see that some object are close, other are far away, then even further away, and so on, up to 4Tly. Nothing extraordinary. No Big Bangs, no FTL speeds, no hidden sources of energy of epic size, just ordinary physics. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparent> I cannot do that in the real world at allSure you do, just by sitting there.Reminds me a bit of my dad; he did radar simulation for military IFF and one of his work anecdotes was about increasing the number of decimal(!) digits of pi the software used.He stopped boasting about that when I pointed out the extra digits were less relevant than the curvature of spacetime caused by Earth itself.> Just by looking in the window, I see that some object are close, other are far away, then even further away, and so on, up to 4TlyI had dreams like that once. Woke up to find I was suffering from testicular torsion.If you seriously believe you can see 4e12 light years through your window, that&#x27;s probably hallucinogens of some kind (not necessarily intentional). reply DiogenesKynikos 2 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no point in arguing about this here. There&#x27;s a very well defined, mathematical theory called General Relativity, which explains gravitational phenomena from Mercury&#x27;s precession all the way to the expansion of the Universe.If you take the time to learn General Relativity, and to learn how to apply it to cosmology, you will see that there are rigorous mathematical answers to the various questions you&#x27;re raising.I want to point out that this isn&#x27;t esoteric stuff that only a few people understand. General Relativity and cosmology are part of a standard undergraduate physics curriculum. It only takes a few years of study, starting from Physics 101, to get to the point where you can derive the answers to all your questions from scratch. reply ben_w 2 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t even need that much — their questions so far are at my level, and I keep messing up the much simpler special relatively questions on brilliant.org reply oneshtein 2 hours agorootparentprevHow GR explains claimed FTL speed of GLASS-z12?

It looks like an excuse that an answer. It&#x27;s just heavy stretching of the evidence until it fits the BB model of evolution of Universe.Static Universe model of evolution doesn&#x27;t requires such stretching: CMB is just light of distant galaxies. End of story. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparent> this is not an answer, because it breaks number of laws of physics, such conservation of energyGR doesn&#x27;t conserve energy. What follows is a bit beyond my level so I may be misremembering, but IIRC Noether&#x27;s theorem is that conservation laws are always identical to some symmetries, and the symmetry for energy (time?) just isn&#x27;t true in GR.(I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even true in SR because space and time are observer dependent, but at least in SR you can get a different conserved quantity because all observers agree on a space-time interval; but as I implied in a different comment where I mentioned brilliant, this is my hobby not my profession). reply DiogenesKynikos 50 minutes agorootparentprev> CMB is just light of distant galaxies. End of story.The CMB is a perfect blackbody. Galaxies are far from a blackbody. Your explanation fails if one knows even a tiny amount about astronomy.Before you criticize Big Bang cosmology, you should learn the theory. That means studying General Relativity, learning to derive the Friedmann Equations, learning about the (utterly overwhelming) observational evidence for the theory, etc. Then you&#x27;ll be in a position to ask intelligent questions about the theory.I promise you that if you learn the theory, you&#x27;ll understand that the questions you&#x27;re asking either don&#x27;t make sense or have obvious answers. For example, conservation of energy does not hold in General Relativity. You keep saying that expansion is an ad hoc assumption that breaks physical laws. However, if you solve the Einstein Field Equations, you&#x27;ll see that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. This fact bothered Einstein so much that he tried to modify General Relativity to get rid of it, something he regretted when observational evidence firmly established that the universe was indeed expanding. This was all the way back in the 1920s, and the evidence is so overwhelming now, a full century later, that it&#x27;s impossible to deny.bigbillheck 15 hours agorootparentprev> a transition somewhereA transition from what to what?> which is not the case.Why not?> Sometimes, somewhere there must be a galaxy past CMB.If there is we&#x27;d have to wait for the light from it to get to us, by which time the CMB will have receded further and it would then be in front of the CMB. reply oneshtein 14 hours agorootparent> A transition from what to what?A transition from plasma to the cold mater in the form of galaxies we see.> Why not?As you see, there are big clusters everywhere.

Assuming we had telescopes big enough and sensors sensitive enough, what does the structure of the deepest parts of space look like? Are there pre-galaxy-formation structures which are smaller than galaxies and yet take up huge swaths of sky? Are there structures from some point in the past that take up so much space on the sky that not very many of them can \"fit\", and, if so, do the calculations work out so that an equivalent explanation for having not very many of them is that the [region of the] universe [which is observable to us] was just that much smaller back then? reply MaxikCZ 14 hours agoparentThe furthest we can see is the physical limit of universe: we can literaly see thefirst photons after universe became transparent. That is the CMB (cosmic microwave background, and you can easily google a real picture). The problem is, while these are the oldest photons we will ever be able to see, they still are from when universe was cca 400 000 years old, and by that time it was 100 million lightyears wide. That picture tells us that the universe was extremely homogenous (altho not perfectly), and basically no such structures you talk about.If we would like to see even further, we must give up on photons completely, and probably probe the ultra deep space gravitation waves. Those should give us picture even of completely opaque universe, as it was before then. So far we can only \"see&#x2F;hear\" the brightest&#x2F;loudest events in the universe with our gravitational waves observatories, but the fact we can even do that is astounding nontheless: we built a new sense for humanity, that no other known creature in the universe posses.

If it takes 4 light years for the light to travel one way (and the one way speed of light still hasn&#x27;t been measured!), that is for the observer at the origin, the photons we observe, for them it is much less than 4 years, is it even in years? So if I look at alpha centauri with a telescope, it isn&#x27;t really aloha centauri 4 years ago that I am observing right? It&#x27;s much more recent than that?Otherwise, if a 30yo person travels at the speed of light from alpha centauri to earth, when the person arrives will they be a 31yo(~) person who arrived 4 year later, effectively time traveling to the future? And if they return right away, will folks at alpha centauri meet a 32yo(~) person who came back 8 years later?

    "originBody": "Skip to Content Susan Rigetti About Books Cover Story Microservices Whistleblower Film & TV Guides Math Philosophy Physics Misc Newsletter Reading List Contact So You Want to Learn Physics… SECOND EDITION Introduction to the Second Edition April 20th, 2021 Nearly six years ago, I sat down at my desk and typed up a detailed guide for anyone who wanted to learn physics on their own. At the time, I had no idea how many people would read it and use it — my only goal was to put the information out there in a clear and straightforward way so that anyone who wanted to learn physics would have the self-study curriculum they needed. Since then, over six hundred thousand people have turned to this guide to study physics. According to the emails I’ve received from readers, many of you have gone on to get undergraduate degrees in physics after following the curriculum in this guide (some of you are even now in graduate programs!), but the majority of those who have bookmarked and followed this guide — even all the way to the end! — have done so out of pure curiosity and for the sheer joy of understanding the incredible universe we inhabit. The success of this guide is, I believe, a testament to two things. First, that one of the most impactful things you can do is to share what you know with others, even if it doesn’t seem like a lot. I wasn’t able to become a professional physicist, but I was able to use my knowledge of undergraduate and graduate-level physics to type up a comprehensive and accessible curriculum that has helped hundreds of thousands of people learn physics. That’s pretty remarkable. If you are wondering what you have to offer the world, I hope you will think of this guide and consider what you might know that you can share with others. Second, that there are so many people in the world who want to understand physics but are unable to study it formally in a university setting for any number of reasons. These same people are very serious about learning physics, and not for any career purposes but simply because they want to understand the universe, and they are and have been dreadfully underserved and underestimated by the academic physics community (who do not take them seriously because they aren’t studying at colleges and universities) and by the authors of contemporary and popular physics books and the publishers of those same books (who mostly just sell them books that assume most readers can never and will never really understand physics). When I wrote the first edition of this guide, I was pretty sure there were a lot more people out there who really wanted to learn physics — real physics — than academic physicists and publishers believed, and those were the people I wanted to help. As it turns out, there were even more of you than I could ever have imagined! Well, after almost six years and lots of reader feedback, I decided that it was finally time to make a (lightly) updated version of this guide. I went back through the emails and comments I’ve received over the years, and then made a list of the most popular requests. I skimmed through all the books in the curriculum and a few new ones as well. I updated textbook editions, added more undergraduate-level electives, added a section of graduate-level electives, and made a few other small changes — all in the hope that this new version will be even more useful than the first. As I wrote in the first edition: “Remember that anyone can learn physics…Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.” Godspeed! You can still find the first edition here, on my old website: https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics. Introduction to the First Edition August 13th, 2015 Over the past few years, ever since writing a blog post called “If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You,” I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies. I've spoken with single mothers who want to go back to school and study physics, tenured philosophy professors who want to learn physics so that they can make significant and informed contributions to philosophy of physics, high school students who want to know what they should read to prepare for an undergraduate education in physics, and people in dozens of various careers who want to really, really learn and understand physics simply for the joy of it. This post is a condensed version of what I've sent to people who have contacted me over the years, outlining what everyone needs to learn in order to really understand physics. The general physics education given in U.S. universities is divided into what is learned at the undergraduate level and what is covered in graduate courses, and I've divided my list in a similar way. Because each subject is built upon the previous subjects and the mathematics becomes more complex and difficult, it's important to learn each topic in the order presented below. If you work through the all of the textbooks in the Undergraduate Physics list of this post, and master each of the topics, you'll have gained the knowledge equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Physics (and will be able to score well on the Physics GRE). If you work through the graduate core of the Graduate Physics textbooks, you'll have the equivalent knowledge of obtaining a Master's Degree in Physics. A PhD in Physics requires the graduate coursework as well as several years of research and a thesis, and the experience involved in a PhD isn't something that can be gained independently of a PhD program. Remember that anyone can learn physics. It's no different from learning programming, from learning a musical instrument, from reading great literature. Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life. Before You Begin Popular Books on Physics When you're solving problems, working through textbooks, and getting into the nitty-gritty details of each topic, it's so easy to lose the forest for the trees and forget why you even became inspired to study physics in the first place. This is where really, really good (and non-speculative) popular books on physics come in handy: they inspire, they encourage, and they help you keep the big picture in mind. One big problem is that many popular physics books (especially those written by famous physicists) are incredibly speculative and tend to present an unrealistic view of what the study of physics is all about. When you're learning physics, it's best to avoid these types of speculative books and stick to the ones that talk about the real physics that we know exists (in general, anything by Frank Close or Richard Feynman is a safe bet!). Here are a handful of my favorite popular physics books, ranked in order of difficulty: The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg (Level: Easy). An account of the Big Bang by one of the most brilliant physicists of all time. The Character of Physical Law by Richard Feynman (Level: Easy). A brilliant, inspiring little book on the laws of nature. The Particle Odyssey by Frank Close (Level: Easy). A brilliant popular introduction to particle physics and its history, beautifully illustrated with amazing figures and photographs. (Unfortunately it’s a bit difficult to find online right now, but if you find a copy, you should buy it ASAP!) Black Holes and Time Warps by Kip Thorne (Level: Easy/Medium). My absolute favorite popular introduction to general relativity. The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky (Level: Medium). A solid introduction to classical mechanics. Is best understood around level 5 in the undergraduate curriculum. The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Boxed Set) and Feynman Lectures on Physics (Kindle Edition) (Level: Medium). Feynman's Lectures are essential readings for everyone interested in physics, and you'll find a copy on the bookshelf of every amateur and professional physicist. These lectures are what got me into physics: my astronomy professor told me to read them and see if I liked physics - they changed my life! They are somewhat difficult to understand if you are just getting started, but they will make more and more sense by the time you reach levels 5 and 6 in the undergraduate curriculum. Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce Schumm (Level: Difficult). The very best popular book about particle physics — it clearly explains the most difficult concepts without resorting to speculation. (I had the honor of working with Bruce on a search for supersymmetry at the ATLAS detector.) This book is a great read while you are starting level 7 in the undergraduate curriculum. Mathematical and Scientific Preliminaries Before you begin studying physics and working through the topics in the sections below, you need to be familiar with some basic mathematics. A high school education — which should include pre-algebra, algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, and pre-calculus — is sufficient. If you need a refresher, I recommend either working through the Khan Academy math courses (https://www.khanacademy.org/) or the book Why Math? by R.D. Driver. There's no need to be familiar with calculus before starting, because you’ll learn it as you work through the undergraduate-level courses. There are no scientific prerequisites for this curriculum. You don’t need to be familiar with biology or chemistry at either the high school or college level in order to understand, although doing some studying on the side can’t hurt. Khan Academy has some great high school science refresher courses that are perfect for this (https://www.khanacademy.org/science). How to Study Everyone learns very differently, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes, by talking, by watching, by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. Think about this before you begin so that you'll know how to structure your studies. Regardless of your learning style, you'll still need to solve the physics problems in each textbook. Solving problems is the only way to understand physics. There's no way around it. Even though it can feel tedious at times, there's nothing more rewarding than figuring out a really difficult physics problem and realizing that you figured it all out all by yourself! One tough thing about learning on your own is that you may not know whether you are solving the problems correctly. Some of the textbooks listed below have answers to selected exercises in the back of the book, but these aren’t always adequate for two reasons: (1) they often only show the solutions to the problems, and not the steps taken to get there; and (2) it’s much better to do all of the exercises rather than just a select few. The good news is that many of the solutions (and step-by-step ways to solve them) can be found online with a simple Google search. If you are going to Google the answers, however, please first try to solve the problems on your own, and try multiple times (you’re not in school trying to get a perfect grade — you’re trying to learn and understand). And, finally, a note on learning in a laboratory vs. learning from textbooks. Physics is both an experimental and theoretical science, and while research happens in laboratories and on blackboards and computers, the majority of any physics education does not take place in a laboratory but in lecture classes that teach from textbooks and assign homework problems that are found in textbooks. Yes, there are some laboratory classes (usually at the very introductory levels, and their only purpose is to show that oh, look, Newton’s laws work in the real world after all) and some — some — undergraduates are allowed to participate in research on the side, but physics is taught through textbooks, lectures, and homework problems. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the undergraduate physics curriculum at any university that offers a physics major. Graduate programs in physics are largely the same — both M.A. and PhD programs in physics require two years of core classes — with one key difference: to get a PhD, students need to complete several years of research, a thesis, and — at many programs — take an exam to prove they have mastered the graduate core curriculum. The graduate core curriculum is all textbooks and lectures and homework problems. The textbooks listed in the curriculum I’ve written below are the same textbooks that are used in the top undergraduate and graduate physics programs in the world. Studying them will give you the same education that you would receive at one of these programs — no painfully-annoying-introductory-mechanics-laboratory-class-with-inane-group-projects required. Undergraduate Physics Overview The curriculum of every undergraduate physics program covers the following subjects (along with some electives in various topics), and usually in the following order: Introduction to Mechanics Electrostatics Waves and Vibrations Modern Physics Classical Mechanics Electrodynamics Quantum Mechanics Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Undergraduate Electives I'm going to cover the details of each of these fields below, including the best textbooks to use and any additional reading you may find helpful in your journey. I'm also going to give some details about the mathematics you'll need to learn alongside each topic. 1. Introduction to Mechanics What It's All About An introduction to mechanics course is the first physics class that most people will take in an undergraduate program, and it's the best place to begin independent study of physics as well. This is where you'll start learning how to see the world in mathematical terms. Topics that will be covered: the basics of motion in a straight line, motion in two dimensions, motion in three dimensions, Newton's Laws, work, kinetic energy, potential energy, the conservation of energy, momentum, collisions, rotation and rotational motion, gravitation, and periodic motion. The Best Textbooks to Use University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman (essential). Work through all of the \"Mechanics\" chapters (in my edition, these are chapters 1-14). This is the best introductory book I've found, and you can use it when you learn electrostatics and modern physics, too. It does a great job of introducing the relevant mathematics, but you'll need to be learning calculus alongside it. There are plenty of great example problems to work through, and the solutions are easy to find online (though you can also buy a Student Solutions Manual). Please note that you don't need to spend $250 on the new edition — Amazon has lots of copies of the 12th edition, the 13th edition, and the 14th edition that contain the same material. The Math You'll Need to Learn Alongside It You'll need to learn calculus while working through University Physics. My favorite introductory calculus book is Thomas' Calculus (you can also use the earlier editions), with Stewart's Calculus (older edition here) coming in as a close second. Work through each chapter, and make sure you can solve problems at the end of each chapter before continuing to the next. If you are new to calculus and/or find yourself struggling to get accustomed to it, don’t let that stop you. Calculus is really difficult, and it can take a really long time to wrap your head around it. Some things that can help are (1) watching videos like the ones on Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/), (2) taking Robert Ghrist’s free calculus courses on Coursera, and (3) reading a truly amazing little book called Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner that breaks everything down really clearly. 2. Electrostatics What It's All About This is where you'll learn about the physics of electricity and magnetism (electromagnetism) in static situations (situations where no motion is involved). Topics covered are: electric charges and electric fields, magnetism and magnetic fields, Gauss's Law, capacitance, resistance and conductance, inductance, current, and how circuits work. The Best Textbooks to Use University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman (essential). Work through the chapters on \"Electromagnetism\" (in my edition, these are chapters 21-32). You can find inexpensive copies of the 12th edition, the 13th edition, and the 14th edition that contain the same material. The Math You'll Need To Learn Alongside It Keep working through the calculus textbooks (Thomas or Stewart) while you work through the basics of electrostatics, but you should finish them by the time you finish the electromagnetism chapters in University Physics. You absolutely must understand the basics of calculus before you move on to the other topics in physics. 3. Waves and Vibrations What It's All About The mechanics of vibrations and waves are complex and important enough to demand their own course of study. Mastering this material is essential for learning about quantum mechanics, so don't skip this topic! This is where you will learn about simple harmonic oscillators, damped harmonic oscillators, forced oscillations, coupled oscillators, waves, interference, diffraction, and dispersion. The Best Textbooks to Use Vibrations and Waves by French (essential) and Vibrations and Waves by King (essential). These two books complement each other very well, and contain different problems and solutions. The Math You'll Need To Learn Alongside It By this point, you should have finished the introductory calculus books and are ready to move on to more advanced mathematics. You should start working through Zill's Advanced Engineering Mathematics, which is a thorough introduction to more advanced topics in mathematics (linear algebra, complex analysis, real analysis, partial differential equations, and ordinary differential equations). The topics in this book are essential — once you master them, you'll have all the math you need to know in order to understand undergraduate physics. You can also buy the (cheaper) 4th and 5th editions. 4. Modern Physics What It's All About The fourth physics class that most undergraduates take is usually called \"Modern Physics\", and it's an introduction to topics in physics that will be taught in greater detail later in the undergraduate physics curriculum. If you plan to study the advanced topics on their own, it's fine to skip this class, but covering these topics now in your independent studies will allow you to grasp the advanced topics that you hear so much about and that probably got you into physics in the first place. This is where you'll learn the basics of thermodynamics, relativity, quantum mechanics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology. The Best Textbooks to Use University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman (essential). Work through the \"Thermodynamics\" section (chapters 17-20 in my edition of the book), and the \"Modern Physics\" section (chapters 37-44). You can find inexpensive copies of the 12th edition, the 13th edition, and the 14th edition that contain the same material. The Math You'll Need To Learn Alongside It Continue working through Zill's Advanced Engineering Mathematics. Once you have mastered all of the topics in this book, you'll have all the math you need to know in order to understand undergraduate physics. 5. Classical Mechanics What It's All About This is where you’ll really learn classical mechanics, which you were introduced to in the very first course (Introduction to Mechanics). You'll study the topics in much greater depth, and learn how to use different mathematical formalisms of classical mechanics (the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamiltonian formalism) to solve problems in mechanics. The Best Textbooks to Use Taylor's Classical Mechanics (essential). This is a fantastic introduction to classical mechanics. Morin's Introduction to Classical Mechanics with Problems and Solutions (supplement). Morin's book is a good supplement to Taylor's, and contains some great problems to work through. Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics by Morin (supplement). Even more great problems (with solutions) to work through, and contains some great problem-solving strategies. The Math You'll Need To Learn Alongside It If you haven't finished working through Zill by now, you should master the topics in it by the time you finish studying classical mechanics. 6. Electrodynamics What It's All About Earlier, you learned about electrostatics: the study of static (non-moving) electricity and magnetism. By now, you know the mathematics to understand electrodynamics, which encompasses everything about classical electricity and magnetism. You'll cover electrostatics again, then learn about Laplace's equation, multipole expansions, polarization, dielectrics, the Lorentz Force Law, the Biot-Savart Law, magnetic vector potential, electromotive force, electromagnetic induction, Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves and radiation, and special relativity. The Best Textbooks to Use Griffith's Introduction to Electrodynamics (essential). This is the book on undergraduate electrodynamics and one of the very best physics textbooks ever written. Make sure you work through every single problem in the book. Div, Grad, Curl and All That by Schey (supplement). This is a short textbook on vector calculus that is very helpful when trying to work with vectors in electrodynamics. A Student's Guide to Maxwell's Equations by Fleisch (supplement). Maxwell's equations are essential in understanding electrodynamics, and this book is the best supplement on the topic. 7. Quantum Mechanics What It's All About By this point, you're ready to really dive into the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and its applications — one of the most beautiful, interesting, and thought-provoking topics in all of physics. You'll learn to see the world in a completely new way. You'll learn about the wave function, the Schrodinger equation, perturbation theory, the variational principle, the WKB Approximation, the adiabatic approximation, and scattering. The Best Textbooks to Use Griffith's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (essential). This is, without a doubt, the book on undergraduate quantum mechanics, written by the same Griffiths who wrote the Introduction to Electrodynamics. It's written in the same concise and beautiful style, and every single problem is worth solving. 8. Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics What It's All About Thermodynamics is the field of physics concerned with kinetics (dynamics) related to heat and energy, while statistical mechanics is all about the microscopic principles that underlie the Laws of Thermodynamics. This is where you'll learn about the laws of thermodynamics, entropy, the canonical ensemble, Maxwell distributions, Planck's distribution, Fermi-Dirac statistics, Bose-Einstein statistics, and phase transitions. By the time you've finished this topic, you'll have mastered all of the fundamentals of undergraduate physics! The Best Textbooks to Use Schroeder’s An Introduction to Thermal Physics (essential). A very thorough and comprehensive introduction to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics; contains very clear and straightforward explanations and examples. Introductory Statistical Mechanics by Bowley and Sanchez (supplement). A good second text to have on hand to reference. 9. Undergraduate Electives What They’re All About Now that you understand all of the fundamentals of undergraduate physics, you have a solid foundation and can study more advanced and specialized topics, including (but not limited to) astronomy, astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, electronics, optics, particle physics, and string theory. The Best Textbooks to Use Astronomy: The Cosmic Perspective. A wonderful introduction to astronomy, accessible to anyone who is just beginning to study physics. Astrophysics: An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by Carroll and Ostlie. A comprehensive introduction to modern astrophysics. Biophysics: Biophysics: An Introduction by Glaser. A solid introduction to the principles of biophysics. Cosmology: Ryden's Introduction to Cosmology. My absolute favorite introductory cosmology book. Electronics: Basic Electronics for Scientists and Engineers by Eggleston. Accessible to anyone who has worked through the basics of electrodynamics. Optics. Optics by Hecht. The classic (and truly amazing) optics textbook. Particle Physics: Griffith's Introduction to Elementary Particles. Written by the same Griffith who gave us the Introduction to Electrodynamics and Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, this book is the perfect introduction to the fundamentals of particle physics and is a joy to work through. String Theory. A First Course in String Theory by Zwiebach. The essential introduction to string theory. Graduate Physics Overview Graduate-level physics requires mastery of every topic within the undergraduate physics curriculum above as a prerequisite. The graduate physics core is comprised of: Mathematical Methods in Physics Electrodynamics Quantum Mechanics Statistical Mechanics General Relativity Quantum Field Theory Graduate Electives I'll cover each of these in the sections below. (Note: many graduate students are required to take a course in classical mechanics as part of the graduate core, but if you've mastered the material in undergraduate classical mechanics there is no need for this). 1. Mathematical Methods in Physics What It's All About Studying electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and stat mech in more depth at the graduate level requires a greater level of mathematical rigor. To prepare, you'll need to learn the following in greater detail: Fourier analysis, tensors, ODEs, PDEs, real analysis, complex analysis, algebra, and group theory (to name a few). The Best Textbooks To Use Mathematical Methods for Physicists by Arfken, Weber, and Harris (essential). This book covers the essentials of everything you'll need to know for the mathematical rigor demanded by the graduate core. Tolstov's Fourier Series (supplement). The best book on Fourier Analysis ever written. Complements the main text very well. Complex Variables by Fisher (supplement). Amazing overview of complex analysis. Can be used along with Needham's Visual Complex Analysis to supplement the main text. Zee's Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists (supplement). A brilliant introduction to group theory for physicists. 2. Graduate Electrodynamics What It's All About Graduate-level electrodynamics covers the same topics as undergraduate electrodynamics but with greater mathematical rigor. The Best Textbooks To Use Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson (essential). This is the bible of classical electrodynamics, and everyone who works through either loves it or hates it (I loved it). If you can master everything in this book and work through a decent selection of the problems, you'll have mastered electrodynamics. 3. Graduate Quantum Mechanics What It's All About Graduate quantum mechanics is far more advanced than what you learned at the undergraduate level. Here you'll learn, in great depth, all there is to know about quantum mechanics, including quantum dynamics (the Schrodinger equation, the Heisenberg picture, propagators, and Feynman path integrals), angular momentum, symmetries and conservation laws of the quantum world, perturbation theory, scattering theory, relativistic quantum mechanics, decoherence, and interpretations of quantum mechanics (the Copenhagen vs. Many-Worlds interpretations). The Best Textbooks To Use Sakurai's Modern Quantum Mechanics (essential). This is my favorite textbook on quantum mechanics, and the one I used to learn quantum mechanics for the very first time. It's a wonderful, elegant, simple book with clear and understandable problems. Try to work through all of the problems — if you do, you'll understand quantum mechanics very well. Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals by Feynman (essential). Sakurai's coverage of Feynman's Path Integral formalism of quantum mechanics doesn't do it justice. Working through this text (written by Feynman himself) is not only useful, but incredibly fun. The Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Dirac (supplement). Dirac was one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. This book is important historically, and also will open your eyes to the need for quantum field theory. Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar (supplement). A great supplement to Sakurai for more information about each topic. A bit too dense to serve as a primary text, it works best as an addition or reference. Decoherence and the Appearance of a Classical World in Quantum Theory (supplement). This book is very dense and you may not understand all of it even after working through Sakurai, but understanding decoherence is essential to understanding how the classical world arises from the quantum. The Everett Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Collected Works 1955-1980 (supplement). Very few books have been written on interpretations of quantum mechanics, and reading through this volume helps to understand the limitations of our interpretations as well as the complexities and details of Everett's Many-Worlds interpretation. 4. Graduate Statistical Mechanics What It's All About Now that you have a more solid mathematical background and understand all of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, it's time to approach graduate-level statistical mechanics. You'll revisit the Laws of Thermodynamics, and then pick up from where you left off in undergraduate statistical mechanics. The Best Textbooks To Use Statistical Mechanics by Pathria and Beale (essential). This book is, admittedly, a bit frustrating, but it's worth suffering through because if you make it all the way to the end and work through the majority of the problems, you'll know stat mech like the back of your hand. Huang's Statistical Mechanics (supplementary). This is a great book to supplement the main text — is a good bridge between undergraduate stat mech and Pathria. 5. General Relativity What It's All About By now you'll have a very deep understanding of Einstein's special theory of relativity, but, as you may have noticed, general relativity (GR) — the theory of gravitation — hasn't yet been mentioned. That's because GR is a mathematically demanding topic — not only do you need to know all of the math you've learned so far, but you'll need to learn differential geometry in order to make sense of how gravity works. Here, you'll revisit special relativity and the intricacies of spacetime, then learn the basics of differential geometry, how to deal with curvature, the essentials of gravitation, how black holes work, and the basics of cosmology. The Best Textbooks To Use Spacetime and Geometry by Carroll (essential). This is the book on general relativity, and Carroll does a phenomenal job of introducing the essentials of differential geometry and general relativity. Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell by Zee (supplement). A great, accessible overview. Wald's General Relativity (supplement). Wald's book is a very abstract, high-level overview of general relativity, and makes a great supplement to Carroll's book. Go to Carroll for the overview, look it up in Wald for the high-level abstractions, and then look in the apple book for the dirty details. Gravitation by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (supplement). Also known as the \"apple book\" thanks to the apple gracing its cover, this book goes into the nitty-gritty details of general relativity in ways that no other book does. Weinberg's Gravitation and Cosmology (supplement). Weinberg is one of those rare physicists who has not only been at the forefront of every major field in physics, but has written about each of them as well. His books tend to be inaccessible to beginners, however, and this book is no exception. It does make a good supplementary reading, but I'd advise reading it after you've worked through the rest. Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Manfredo P. do Carmo (supplement). The classic differential geometry textbook; may be useful to help you wrap your head around differential geometry. 6. Quantum Field Theory What It's All About Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the heart of all modern high-energy physics: the Standard Model of particle physics is a QFT. The whole idea behind QFT is that we are doing quantum mechanics on classical fields, and it works remarkably well. Along with GR, QFT will be the most challenging part of your physics education, but perhaps the most rewarding (I know it was extraordinarily rewarding for me!). It may take many, many years to master. You'll learn about how to quantize fields, Feynman diagrams, quantum electrodynamics (QED), renormalization, non-Abelian gauge theories, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the Higgs mechanism, the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions, the symmetries of particle physics, and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Best Textbooks To Use Zee's Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell (essential). This is my favorite physics book of all time, and the most beautiful introduction to QFT ever written. You'll walk away understanding the basics of QFT and with a deep understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder (essential). This is the bible of QFT, but its far too terse and encyclopedic to work through on its own and must be studied alongside Zee. Covers everything you could possibly want to know about QFT. Try to work through the problems, but be aware that mastery of QFT will take a very, very long time. Weinberg's The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 1 (supplement). Another great volume by Weinberg, who was one of the most important physicists in the history of particle physics. This book should be used only as a supplement, and preferably not read until Zee and Peskin and Schroeder have been completed. It's not a book to learn from, but one to gain additional understanding of QFT through after you've mastered all of the basics. Lie Algebras in Particle Physics by Georgi (supplement). This dives into the details of Lie Algebras in QFT. 7. Graduate Electives What They’re All About The graduate curriculum can be split into several categories: (i) the core courses, (ii) specialized coursework and graduate electives, and (iii) research. Graduate students typically take the core courses first, which focus on the same topics covered in undergraduate courses but in much greater depth and with far more mathematical rigor. Students then choose more specialized courses and electives depending on their area of research in physics, including (but not limited to) condensed matter physics, cosmology, electronics, optics, particle physics, quantum computing, solid-state physics, and string theory. The Best Textbooks to Use Condensed Matter Physics: Lubensky’s Principles of Condensed Matter Physics. A modern, comprehensive textbook. Fairly advanced, and is easier to understand after completing the graduate core and working through something like Ashcroft and Mermin. Cosmology: Mark Trodden and Sean Carroll’s TASI Lectures: Introduction to Cosmology. Supplement with Steven Weinberg’s Cosmology. Electronics: The Art of Electronics by Horowitz and Hill. The best electronics textbook there is, period. Optics: Optics by Hecht. The classic optics textbook. Particle Physics: Quarks and Leptons by Halzen and Martin. Wonderful overview that’s fun to read and work through. Supplement this with Modern Particle Physics by Mark Thomson, which is up-to-date on contemporary discoveries like the Higgs. Quantum Computing: Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang. Also known as “Mike and Ike,” this is the standard introduction to quantum information and computation. Solid-State Physics: Solid-State Physics by Ashcroft and Mermin. The classic introductory solid-state textbook. Supplement with Introduction to Solid State Physics by Kittel. String Theory: String Theory: Volume 1, An Introduction to the Bosonic String and String Theory: Volume 2, Superstring Theory and Beyond, by the late Joe Polchinski; and String Theory and M-Theory: A Modern Introduction. I found it really enjoyable to pair Polchinski’s books with Becker Becker Schwarz when I was learning string theory — they complement each other well.

Even just the very basics (pressure, velocity, etc in a moving, non-equilibrium system) and translating between the terminology used by different science and engineering fields (static pressure, total pressure, velocity pressure, stagnation pressure, hydrostatic pressure, dynamic pressure, plain old pressure, head, oh my!) is very useful.Hydraulics are everywhere. Ever used a sink? Flushed a toilet? Contemplated an air filter? Felt both sides of a small fan? Wondered how, exactly, a utility pump causes water to go in the inlet and out the outlet, and tried to read the manufacturer’s spec? Contemplated that the ripples when you throw a rock in an actual pond really don’t resemble the average “look I made water in WebGL” animation very much?And more fancily, and very much in “Physics”, cosmological models usually model the universe as being full of a spatially varying continuous fluid. Stars are plasma or weirder things, and those are fancy fluids.Yet, for some reason, the basics are missing from “Physics”. You can sometimes find them in mechanical engineering departments, and Feynman covers it a bit in his lectures. reply movpasd 1 hour agoparentI think solid state continuum mechanics are also the optimal place to introduce tensors. For some reason, the first tensors many physics students encounter are very abstract. It would be like if the first vectors you encountered were quantum mechanical states. Stress and strain are, in my opinion, the ideal \"prototypical rank-2 tensors\", and it&#x27;s useful to spend time really elaborating what that means, the same way we teach students to think of vectors as \"things that look like displacement&#x2F;velocity\". reply bkcooper 8 hours agoparentprevYou might be interested in Kip Thorne (of Gravitation fame) and Roger Blandford&#x27;s book Modern Classical Physics, which is designed to cover the elements of non-quantum physics that are generally ignored in the first year PhD curriculum.

But all of those phenomena are emergent. Shouldn’t physics focus much more on the underlying micro states and micro processes than the emergent phenomena?Obviously there needs to be a transition, but at some point you go from physics to engineering. I suppose it depends what specialty in physics you go into. Nobody can specialise in everything. reply dhosek 8 hours agorootparentReminds me of a student sketch from my days in nerd school, parodying Star Trek. A student dressed as one of the physics professors demonstrated that FTL travel was impossible, causing the Enterprise’s warp drives to stop functioning.

Obviously there needs to be a transition, but at some point you go from physics to engineering.1. The boundaries between disciplines are where they are in part by historical accident, and in part because that&#x27;s what the people working in them find useful - there is no actual fact of the matter.2. We don&#x27;t actually know the underlying microprocesses of anything. Effective theories are all we have, and there&#x27;s no fundamental difference between an effective theory for the vacuum (if it is a vacuum) and one for, say, the bulk of a semiconductor. reply commonlisp94 8 hours agorootparent> there is no actual fact of the matter.This is true of all categories, so not a helpful comment. I suspect someone has a good enough definition. reply BeetleB 10 hours agorootparentprevAs GP said, continuum mechanics is often used for physics research. While not the Truth, the models can often be accurate. My own research involving transport in the quantum domain utilized some models from continuum mechanics.(I didn&#x27;t introduce it - it was already being used). reply tnecniv 9 hours agorootparentprevYou could say that about a lot of topics. Heck you could say that chemistry is just an emergent phenomenon of physics.The benefit of taking such a class or reading such a textbook is that these things have been studied extensively, we have good models for them, and it is useful to know because people are still doing fundamental research on it to this day or working on phenomena that are closely related. reply jagged-chisel 10 hours agorootparentprevPhysics: research, theorizeEngineering: practical implementationThat’s how it goes in my brain.

I don&#x27;t want to discourage anybody from trying to educate themselves in a difficult field (be it physics or something else), but that&#x27;s a very common and immediately visible problem with autodidacts. If you haven&#x27;t worked through enough hard problems you lack the intuition that ties together theory. reply belugacat 15 hours agoparentThat’s a POV I’ve grown to adopt as I got older (like many, perhaps).

Otherwise, it’s just words.The most frustrating is when I have friends who have derived their entire understanding of a subject I know as a practitioner (typically something tech&#x2F;programming related) from watching YouTube videos&#x2F;listening to podcasts.Because they’ve heard hours and hours from experts, they have a feeling of deep understanding. But talking to them about this topic is extremely frustrating because their knowledge clearly has never had to be applied to the real world, and is grounded in nothingness, so they misunderstand lots, but they feel like they know what they’re talking about as much as you do. reply civilitty 14 hours agorootparent> That’s a POV I’ve grown to adopt as I got older (like many, perhaps).

Solving lots of problems serves two particular purposes: To really solidify the concepts in your mind so you won&#x27;t forget, and ensuring you learn the techniques and not just the knowledge.For the former, you may find yourself in the position where you find yourself way over your head, and won&#x27;t know where to start. You usually will not have a single gap, but many. You&#x27;ll find yourself realizing you&#x27;ll need to look up material from several textbooks to regain the knowledge you&#x27;ve lost. Once you begin that process, you&#x27;ll pick up one of your old textbooks and while the physics knowledge may be absorbed, you&#x27;ll realize you&#x27;ve forgotten much of the math needed to solve such problems. In the unlikely event you&#x27;ll retain enough to follow the textbook, it is very unlikely you&#x27;ll know the techniques well enough to solve the real world problem.And your colleagues will. You&#x27;ll be alone, and you&#x27;ll drop out of that group. With physics&#x2F;math, there often are hard boundaries in these groups. Those who meet the bar are in. Those who don&#x27;t drop out, because it really sucks being the only person in the group who is struggling with what everyone else considers as basic.SW engineering has a much more gradual change in skills amongst people, and usually the problems most people work on are fairly learnable in a short amount of time. reply tnecniv 9 hours agorootparentPlus, at various times, I’ve had to revisit things I learned years ago and ended up understanding it much better because I could connect it to a swath of things I hadn’t learned the first time I saw the material.Math and its applications are a contact sport.

Differential geometry, for example, is a big field with a lot of notation. Different textbooks end up using very different notations and covering non-overlapping sections of the field.

I found the best way to understand something was to teach it to others. That way I took what I already understood and was able to see what other people misunderstood, which was often something I&#x27;d never expected to be an issue, and add their experience in learning the topic on to what I already knew which expanded my overall understanding.Then again, in the process of teaching I always found myself teaching people to work problems, which required me to be able to work the problems myself. In a way, it&#x27;s kind of impressive you managed to avoid doing that. reply javajosh 14 hours agorootparentprevI think this shows a lack of self-doubt, which can be deadly. Those problems acted as verification to yourself that you understood the theory and its application. If you truly understood the material, then the problems would be zero effort.

What I&#x27;d like to see more of in physics texts is presenting a problem before offering the solution. Too often you get what amounts to a laundry list of techniques and ideas, which are the components to the answers to hard problems, but the student isn&#x27;t motivated to learn them. If you present the hard problem first, the student may flail around and realize: I need something to help with this! Now that they know they need it, and why, you can give them the tool that fits the bill. For example, I think calculus is probably better learned after trying to write down some force laws, and perhaps doing some numerical analysis. Then when you learn them you realize those nice closed-form solutions aren&#x27;t busywork, they are huge labor saving tools that eliminate ad hoc labor intensive analysis.I would also deemphasize the more mathy parts of calculus - do you really need a deep dive into continuity or the fundamental theorem of calculus? Eventually, yes. But it&#x27;s just like programming: you&#x27;re not going to need to understand language theory or ADTs or category theory or lambda calculus to write your first program. Or your second. And, IMHO, you should only reach for this understanding when you realize you need it.

In other words, every single section of that reading list is based directly or indirectly on a diverse and sophisticated set of devices and measurement configurations (aka experiments). Also, most progress in our understanding the physical universe follows simply from inventing ever better probes and opening new observation windows.A computer analogy of the theoretical&#x2F;empirical physics relation might be fun: You can spend your whole life writing application software and never even know what digital devices you are actually using. That&#x27;s totally legit. But if you want to write a new computer language (= a new theory) you most likely will have to dig into memory architectures and caches and all that stuff. If you want to dramatically increase the speed of computation (= a new observation window) you have to design a new chip.

You don&#x27;t use it in most fields that are generating physics PhDs in the 2000s and beyond.There&#x27;s only so much time to teach somebody in four years and there are significantly more important things that are also being left out (e.g. more thorough courses on group theory). reply btrettel 12 hours agorootparent> You don&#x27;t use [Navier-Stokes] in most fields that are generating physics PhDs in the 2000s and beyond.That&#x27;s because physics degrees don&#x27;t include much on fluid dynamics. If someone wants to get a PhD in fluid dynamics, they probably get a PhD in some variety of engineering. This goes back to what I said about the physics curriculum seeming weird to me, as it it&#x27;s not about \"physics\" in itself. It&#x27;s more a random selection of topics that exists for historical reasons.> There&#x27;s only so much time to teach somebody in four years and there are significantly more important things that are also being left out (e.g. more thorough courses on group theory).In another comment, you said that you don&#x27;t know what the Navier-Stokes equations are. Given that, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re in a good position to judge their value.I have a couple of group theory books myself, and I don&#x27;t agree with your assessment that group theory should get priority over fluid dynamics. reply staunton 11 hours agorootparentThe physics curriculum prepares people to do research on stuff that is published in \"physics journals\". You may not think that should be the goal but it is. Doing work on Navier-Stokes lands you in a math journal on PDEs.On a more important note, the actual topics are completely irrelevant. What&#x27;s important is learning to \"think like a physicist\". That&#x27;s what has value even for those who don&#x27;t go on to do academic research, which is most students. For any given physics topic that is relevant to real-life applications, there are engineers who actually know how to use it, something that would be ridiculous to expect from the superficial treatment a physics degree has to give any one topic. reply btrettel 10 hours agorootparentFluid dynamics is published in physics, engineering, and math journals, even if focused specifically on Navier-Stokes.To do fluid dynamics research in a physics department, sometimes one has to spin it in some way that people with physics degrees care about. For example, saying that it&#x27;s to understand chaos theory. reply lanza 11 hours agorootparentprev> In another comment, you said that you don&#x27;t know what the Navier-Stokes equations are. Given that, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re in a good position to judge their value.It was an exaggeration given that it never came up during my studies once. And I think that&#x27;s a fantastic assessment of their value that I made it through most of a decade of studies without having to know a thing about fluid dynamics.> I have a couple of group theory books myself, and I don&#x27;t agree with your assessment that group theory should get priority over fluid dynamics....why? You&#x27;re commenting on a physics line of education here. We don&#x27;t use fluid dynamics and we extensively use group theory. reply btrettel 10 hours agorootparentYou are missing my main point. Physics education tends to exclude fluid dynamics, so of course you wouldn&#x27;t hear much about it or do research in it if you only have physics degrees. If a physics degree were about physics as defined in the dictionary, fluid dynamics would be more prominent. But \"physics\" as studied in a \"physics\" department is much more narrow than the dictionary definition.Fluid phenomena is ubiquitous. You live in a fluid. You probably drive a car through a fluid and may occasionally take a plane through a fluid at higher speed. You surely use plumbing. I don&#x27;t see how you can claim that fluid dynamics is not valuable given that. It&#x27;s a lot more relevant to most people than quantum mechanics. replyelashri 15 hours agoparentprevI am writing my physics PhD thesis and I did not study fluid mechanics (other than the few chapters in the standard general physics).It will really be dependent on what is your physics field but you can definitely survive in physics without deep knowledge of fluid mechanics except when your study require itPS: I am a particle physicist. reply jwuphysics 15 hours agorootparentA professor remarked that it was a bit sad that physics students nowadays have a better understanding of quantum field theory than fluid mechanics. He mentioned this while lecturing on QFT. reply tekla 15 hours agorootparentBut fluid mechanics is haarrddddd (Aeronautical Engineer). Compressible fluids can go suck it. I rue the day Navier-Stokes became a thing. reply bigger_cheese 6 hours agorootparentAgreed, I studied Materials Engineering - Fluid Dynamics was one of the hardest subjects in my opinion. I liked thermodynamics it made sense to me, solid mechanics was a bit of a slog to get through (endless amounts of beam deflection) but fluid dynamics arrghh.I chose to take a particle physics course as an elective in my final year - I was planning to specialize in battery and capacitor technologies and wanted to learn more.The lectures were very different to Engineering much, much more theory focused(almost nothing on applications) it was my introduction to things like Hamiltonians, Wave Functions and Fermi-Dirac statistics. I&#x27;m glad I took the course I learnt a heap especially about semi-conductors it gave me a better appreciation and understanding of things we covered in my engineering degree like magnetism and phonons&#x2F;heat transfer as well. But I will say it did feel like another world compared to Engineering - there was much less in common than I would have thought. reply paulpauper 6 hours agorootparentprevat least fluid mechanics in the context of engineering is only 3 dimensions. QFT needs more. reply elashri 14 hours agorootparentprevThere is a more practical reason for that. QFT has become essential to learn for many Condensed matter physicists. And they always are with particle physicists which will span most of the physics community, at least comparing with whose work involve in-depth knowledge of fluid mechanics. Not to mention that QFT seems easy in comparison. reply cli 14 hours agoparentprevThe order seems fine to me.Thermodynamics&#x2F;statistical mechanics was taught as a junior level class at my undergraduate alma mater. During that year, students would take electrodynamics, classical mechanics, and statistical mechanics as separate classes in some loose order, although of course simpler versions of these topics would have been introduced in first year physics.The lack of fluid mechanics also, unfortunately, tracks with my experience. reply superposeur 14 hours agoparentprevAs a physicist, fluid mechanics was the most glaring gap in my undergraduate preparation, despite its centrality to most physics applications. Somehow it is always a “time permitting” topic at the end of an already-cramped curriculum.I first encountered the Euler equation in the context of GR — absurd. In another decade or two, I suspect its rightful place early in the physics curriculum will be emphasized. reply pclmulqdq 15 hours agoparentprevThat is a very \"pure physics\" way to approach physics, and I think it&#x27;s right if you want to build up the underlying principles. That was how my college taught physics, and it helped to make many otherwise unintuitive parts of thermodynamics understandable.Also, physicists don&#x27;t necessarily include fluid dynamics as a core discipline. It is almost mechanical engineering to them. I&#x27;m not surprised to see it missing. reply carabiner 15 hours agorootparentyeah NS is just newton&#x27;s laws, which is part of mechanics reply mhh__ 15 hours agorootparentNewton&#x27;s laws and centuries worth of intuition about fluids but sure.Also stating the equation isn&#x27;t the same thing as studying it. reply Avshalom 15 hours agoparentprevI have a B.S. Physics from NMT graduated in 2009 (they changed some of the courses a year or two after my cohort) but the main series progression was Modern Physics -> Waves -> Classical Mechanics, E&#x2F;M&#x2F;Optics -> Quantum -> Thermo. Never really did much of anything fluids-wise other than some viscosity&#x2F;drag stuff in Mechanics reply disentanglement 14 hours agoparentprevThermodynamics is usually (and rightfully so) taught together with statistical physics for which quantum mechanics is essential, so the order does make sense. reply lanza 13 hours agoparentprevFormer theoretical physicist here (quantum gravity).

This is a sign that it is maybe time for me to jump into a textbook.However, I seem to be interested in a few particular questions about particle physics as a science rather than facts about particle physics. For instance, I am interested in the instruments and methods that physicists use to verify their theoretical claims empirically. I am also interested in how theorists are able to come up with theories so early on, such that they are confirmed by evidence many years later. What are the assumptions that they were able to make? I am curious about where they derived the creativity to be able to bring in so many assumptions together and the come up with their models. Now that I write this, I realize that before theories were validated there were probably competing models.Therefore, I am not exactly sure I want to study particle physics per se, or whether a book on the history of particle physics will do. I am ok with having a popular understanding of the subject, I mostly want to gain inspiration from following the work of famous scientists. reply cb321 15 hours agoprevRather than 27 (or however many) books, an ambitious student may be able to use just one big-ish book: Ian D. Lawrie&#x27;s \"A Unified Grand Tour Of Theoretical Physics\". This even has a little 18 page \"Snapshots of the Tour\" which might be a trip down memory lane for those who studied physics long ago.Of course, it might also be impenetrable if you haven&#x27;t had prior exposure to most of the material.. I have zero experience trying to teach physics from it. reply libraryofbabel 14 hours agoparentIt will be impossible to learn physics from this book, even in the unlikely event that you already have all the requisite mathematical background (partial differential equations, vector calculus, tensors, etc.). Degree of “ambition” doesn’t come into it; you just can’t start out with special and general relativity and spacetime and quantum fields; you need to solve a lot of problems in newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism and thermodynamics and get a solid foundation in classical physics first. There is no royal road to this stuff: Susan’s list lays out the standard curriculum and it’s really the only way we know to produce physicists.That said, this book does look like a great text for someone with a graduate level physics knowledge who wants to refresh their memory. reply cb321 11 hours agorootparentIt was mostly just a recommendation to check out. I did not actually do it myself, but I tend to think I could have right after lin.alg.&#x2F;multivar calc freshman year and would have preferred it. Can&#x27;t prove that, of course, since I didn&#x27;t do it, but a year later I was loving Landau&#x27;s Classical Theory of Fields which has a very similar relativity-first approach, and I did know a lot of relativity in high school. Wolfram went right from high school to grad school in physics at Caltech. The only very recently deceased late great Ed Fredkin got to be head of the MIT CS department with naught but a high school degree due to various life interventions and had some interesting \"digital physics\" ideas.There are lots of pathways to learn & do. That is especially true of people coming to topics later in life, as I might expect is more common for HN comment thread readers. I know someone who learned to program in x86 assembly before they learned C (in fact one of the best programmers I know). If you talk to such people, I think you will find that their more varied backgrounds &#x2F; ages in life when they approach things make anyone&#x27;s dogmas more suspect. A great numerical relativist didn&#x27;t study physics until his 30s. No idea what order he did things in, but I heard it was very non-standard.So, I would encourage you to have more imagination of what might be possible &#x2F; be less dismissive &#x2F; jumping to conclusions. That is needlessly discouraging to many here were bemoaning \"soooo many books&#x2F;years&#x2F;etc\". \"Ambition\" might be \"first learn diffgeo, then learn physics\". I&#x27;ve been recommending that lately to a friend with extreme mathematical sophistication (a professor even) but no physics exposure, actually, but already some diffgeo exposure.And, of course, \"to learn physics\" is maybe not to be a \"produced physicist\" any more than \"to learn networks\" means to \"build a hardware router\". It all depends. IMO, there are too many levels (& even directions&#x2F;dimensions) of \"having learned\" to really even make \"just can&#x27;t\", \"only way\" statements like you did. Elsethread, the diversity of even what \"physicists\" wind up having learned is shown to vary considerably (e.g. continuum mechanics). I find such absolutist statements needlessly discouraging to someone who might be hopeful to do it in \"fewer steps\". The way for most need not be the way for all or even the recommended way for any one person. People vary. reply srameshc 14 hours agoprevI love HN for thing like these that I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise found out.

I loved level editors so I was really disappointed.We had a closer look at the disc and it was a mysterious \"OEM Version\" (I know what that means now, but none of us did back then). But it said version 1.0 so surely it was meant to have everything? We contacted Gateway, like \"is there any way we can upgrade to the actual final version of the game?\" And the answer was no.They were bundling an unfinished version of the game!----> OEM Versions> These beta versions were originally distributed alongside Intel&#x27;s manufactured hardware, as a result of a partnership between Epic and Intel. While most people who acquired these versions assumed they were the same as the retail release, they were actually builds from halfway through the game&#x27;s development.> Two OEM versions exist: 1.00g, which is the most common, and 1.00h. These versions have quite a lot of differences compared to the final release, such as different file formats, many levels use different tilesets or are in different orders, many sound effects weren&#x27;t coded yet into the game, different screens for loading and menus and different and&#x2F;or glitchy physics for weapons and objects.[0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jazzjackrabbit.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jazz_Jackrabbit_2&#x2F;Dev... reply amacneil 7 hours agoparentSame here. I have a vague memory of the level editor being included in the OEM version but not being able to get it working. But I could be mistaken.Was very confused at the time that we appeared to have the full version but it was missing features. Still spent many hours playing it.Edit: Also some motorbike racing game that came with the same (probably Gateway) PC.

    "originBody": "Jim Nielsen’s Blog Verified ($10/year for the domain) Archive About RSS “We’re All Just Temporarily Abled” 2023-08-20 That’s a quote from Cindy Li — “We're all just temporarily abled”. I first heard it in Sarah’s course and it’s been on repeat in my mind ever since June 6th. June 6th I was on vacation at the beach with my family and tried something that, looking back now, maybe I’m too old for. And I injured my knee. I knew immediately it was bad. I laid there in the sand, unable to get up, and let the surf crash over me. After a few waves, I got on my belly dragged myself free. Fortunately this all happened the day before we flew home, but sitting there on the beach at sunset I knew my vacation was over at that point. That was almost three months ago now. I’m still limping. It’s getting better but it’s slow. The doctor told me, “Just be aware: this isn’t days or weeks recovery. This is months.” Since then, I’ve tried to make the best of summer while kids are out of school but my mobility has been limited. Through all of it, I’ve found myself noticing “accessibility” helpers more than ever before: that railing on the stairs, that ramp off to the side of the building, that elevator tucked away in the back. All things I rarely noticed before but have since become vital. And that phrase plays on repeat in my head — “we’re all just temporarily abled”. From my notes on Sarah’s course: 1 in 5 people currently have a disability. 100% of people will have some form of disability in their lifetime. I suppose it’s easy to misunderstand ability as a binary thing. But now I’m understanding more how fluid it is, as it inevitably comes in and out of each of our lives — “100% of people” in their lifetimes. In classic human fashion, it’s one of those things you take for granted until it's gone. (I’m taking a moment for self-reflection here.) I know I’m privileged. My knee is healing each day, and fortunately all I have to do is sit at a desk for work. I am more grateful now for the abilities I have, for the accessible helpers in the world I overlooked before, and for the people who make them possible. Reply via: Email, Twitter, Mastodon",

It really is that easy.Highly recommend it for anyone interested.1. Any back pain I had disappeared completely.2. When I have to lift something awkward (eg, furniture), I don&#x27;t injure myself. If you can deadlift 200KG, awkwardly leaning over your lawn mower to grab a 20KG bag of concrete is pretty easy.3. It is really really handy being able to move heavy things.4. Basically everything else improves. Going for a tough hike uphill? Your legs will be a lot less sore if you can squat 150KG. Need to hold your screaming baby for 40 minutes? Easy! reply ekidd 2 hours agoparentI powerlifed for years, with a truly excellent coach for much of that time. For what it was worth, she was Starting Strength certified and a successful international masters competitor. She fixed a subtle problem with my deadlift using nothing but the wrinkles on my T-shirt; my recovery improved dramatically.At 40, I was stronger than I was as a high school wrestler. I loved lifting. I remember casually picking up a piece of equipment that took two burly guys to lift and jumping down from a pickup with it.But over the course of several years, I picked up several small but persistent injuries lifting. Two can be worked around. One makes it very hard to squat for more than a few weeks of training. None of the injuries, fortunately, affects me noticeably in daily life. But I&#x27;ll never wide-grip bench press again, either.When I was coming to terms with these injuries, I had a long talk with the oldest natty lifters in my gym. The powerlifers were all dealing with various chronic injuries. (Seriously, Rippetoe has published a bit of his medical history. He&#x27;s a mess of injuries.)But you know who was still lifting in their 60s and even 70s, injury-free for decades at a stretch? The natty bodybuilders. One of the oldest looked over at me one day, and said, \"You know, I don&#x27;t like the risk&#x2F;reward on heavy squats. You do them flawlessly for years, and then one day, a group of muscle fibers decides to misfire for a moment when you&#x27;re under the bar.\"So, enjoy Starting Strength, or whatever other beginner program Reddit likes this year. And the two Starting Strength certified coaches I&#x27;ve known were excellent. Good technique is absolutely worth it. But once you&#x27;ve gotten those sweet beginner gains, talk to the old lifters, and think long and hard about where you want to go next. Because nothing is as important as remaining injury-free. And every older powerlifter I met was dealing with chronic injuries.Once gains get difficult, think about what you really want out of lifting. reply hifromLA 44 minutes agorootparentMan I wish somebody told this to a young me (although I probably wouldn’t have believed them).Once you start making gains it does become addictive especially if (like me) you have some uh let’s call it mental health challenges.After sustaining a number of injuries I finally learned to stop looking at the numbers, to stop comparing myself on exrx or symmetric strength. I just go to the gym and have fun. I still do the major movements but I always make sure to leave a little in the tank. I always listen to my body first and foremost. If it doesn’t feel right, it doesn’t feel right. reply throwaway4good 1 hour agorootparentprevI used to do karate. There were all these character who had seemingly superhuman physical fitness yet they would die really early. I always wondered why was that?Now I believe that a lot of physical training isn&#x27;t that healthy. And if you put your whole personal identity on your physical abilities then when your abilities start to decline, as they naturally do from age 40 and up, you may spiral out of control and literally die. reply layer8 7 minutes agorootparentI know multiple martial arts practitioners who had to have hip surgery at a relatively young age.

Especially in Kyokushin where they have (had?) no weight classes. reply throwaway4good 1 hour agorootparentYes. For example.I actually don&#x27;t think it is the direct damage from fighting that gets them but more the inability to stop and scale your commitment to what you can and can no longer do. reply tastysandwich 33 minutes agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why I appreciate starting strength. It&#x27;s a novice program and the gains come fairly quickly and easily. Rippetoe himself in Practical Programming makes the point that after the novice phase, you need to assess what your goals are and program accordingly. A football player will have different goals from a runner, who will have different goals from the general sedentary public.I myself am pretty happy with where I&#x27;m at and don&#x27;t plan on trying to squat 300KG. I appreciate there&#x27;s a higher risk of injury pushing myself to my limits. And the amount of investment (time in the gym, getting a coach or learning enough to program for that level) is not worth it.I&#x27;m not suggesting that everyone goes and tries to become a powerlifter. I&#x27;m just suggesting that for anyone who isn&#x27;t strong and is looking to become strong quickly, Starting Strength is the best method in my opinion. And as others have pointed out, going from a 20KG to an 80KG squat will make a huge improvement to your life, and is very manageable for pretty much anyone. reply oarfish 1 hour agorootparentprevYour experience is surely valid, but I wouldn&#x27;t just generalize this to the population at large.When you say \"powerlifters\", are those people who compete or just people who train? I can imagine this to make a difference.And in any case, I wouldn&#x27;t take Rippetoe as an example of good scientific programming these days. It&#x27;s good for getting people into lifting, but Starting Strength has a powerlifting fetish for no good reason, and the advice to aggressively gain weight is also not appropriate for everyone (GOMAD etc.). Then recently I saw a Starting Strength video in which they claimed that the really grindy reps at the end of the set are the ones that make all the difference (for strength anyway), which as far as I&#x27;m aware is false and probably harmful, as you can do way more training volume with less risk of injury (I would expect) if you keep some reps away from failure. reply ekidd 11 minutes agorootparent> and the advice to aggressively gain weight is also not appropriate for everyone (GOMAD etc.).Yeah, don&#x27;t do GOMAD unless you&#x27;re a 17-year-old teenage boy with a BMI of 18.5 who wants to be a linebacker or something. Some of the Starting Strength advice is... very situational, to put it politely as possible.Their coaching certification, however, means more than 95% of the \"personal trainer\" certifications you&#x27;ll see in the average gym.> When you say \"powerlifters\", are those people who compete or just people who train? I can imagine this to make a difference.The oldest powerlifer I knew well who wasn&#x27;t dealing with chronic injuries was a 40-year-old women&#x27;s masters competitor. She competed around 135 or 139 lbs bodyweight, I think? She was absolutely a beast, with near flawless form and an excellent coaching eye.Besides her? Almost every other long-term powerlifter I met was nursing some injury. But what really stood out to me was the absence of old powerlifters in my local gyms. There were old lifters in amazing shape. But none of them were grinding out the really heavy squats and deadlifts.But don&#x27;t take my word for it. All I&#x27;m recommending is that when new powerlifters max out their newbie gains, they take a good hard look around their local gym, and see who has decades of happy lifting under their belt. Ask those folks about their training plans and injury histories and PED use. You may see different patterns than I did. But for lifelong fitness, avoiding chronic injuries is everything. reply zemvpferreira 1 hour agorootparentprevI can review myself in ekidd&#x27;s experience. I&#x27;ve been in the gym for 20 years and plenty of stronger (but not competitive) people I know picked up injuries from grinding out tough sets of 5 or 3. Heck I have two abdominal hernias and a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; back that gives me problems from time to time that I can directly blame deadlift PRs for, even with great technique.The gym is generally a safe hobby, but scientific bodybuilding, with its large sets, slow eccentrics and focus on the stretch is definitely the safest way to lift for longevity. reply qtk8 23 minutes agorootparentDo you have a good source or book (preferably) to start learning more about scientific body building? reply zemvpferreira 17 minutes agorootparentLook up Renaissance Periodisation&#x27;s stuff, they do a great job of explaining this approach. reply rayxi271828 1 hour agorootparentprevDo you think one can lift heavy but with machines, and get the same risk&#x2F;reward ratio as bodybuilders?In other words, train for power (rather than hypertrophy), but instead of using barbells, use dumbbells or machines, to minimize the risk of injury? reply ekidd 53 minutes agorootparentI think it makes sense to get started exercising, using any kind of good program at all, and to pay attention to technique.I don&#x27;t have injury stats on machines versus free weights. Almost all the serious lifters I knew (bodybuilders or powerlifters) did plenty of free weight work. This included one 67-year-old bodybuilder in amazing shape who&#x27;d been injury-free for decades. He used a mix of free weights and machines, but he didn&#x27;t squat the kinds of weights the serious powerlifters did, either.You can make yourself a lot stronger than the average person with pretty low risk of injury, if your technique is good. As far as I can tell, you can do it pretty safely with a squat rack, some safety bars, a bench, a bar, and some weights. According to BroScience(TM), lol, the advantage of free weights is that if you have good technique, then you wind up working large parts of your body as a unified system, or something. (Bro science is like blog posts on unit testing; everyone&#x27;s got a theory and almost nobody has numbers.)But once you hit \"a lot stronger than the average person\", where do you go next? Do you maintain? Do you keep trying to lift more? Do you decide to go for a bit of hypertrophy?And that&#x27;s where I think it makes sense to talk to the old lifters, and look for patterns. Don&#x27;t believe me. I&#x27;m just some guy on the Internet. Go talk to the old guys who&#x27;ve been doing it for 40 years and who aren&#x27;t wearing tons of wraps and tape. By the time you need to make these decisions, you&#x27;ll likely know some old guys at your gym, anyways. reply omnimus 1 hour agorootparentprevI am not sure if you minimize risk of injury that much. You might get injured on machine or dumbbell if you go heavy.Anyway with most machines you won&#x27;t be able to load it heavy enough quite soon.I think there is also happy middle ground where you train for strength but not into extremes - you progress at slower pace and prioritize form. I would say bodybuilders can also be strong and healthy but they can&#x27;t use that strength properly (because of the type of training they do) and destroy their health with drugs. reply Broken_Hippo 59 minutes agorootparentand destroy their health with drugs.I mean, if they are the type that are using steroids and such things, sure. The other sort that are into drugs just gets stoned and lift weights. The risks just aren&#x27;t the same: Sure, you are going to do some damage with pot, but not the same sort and you&#x27;ll certainly not be so much worse than the person that gets stoned and plays games a lot of the day or gets stoned and works at a gas station.(I worked with an ex-professional body builder: He was the second type and couldn&#x27;t compete with the steroid crowd. He was OK with that) reply trabant00 1 hour agorootparentprevInjuries are not talked about enough on the internet. And they should be the number one topic for amateur fitness enthusiasts of any kind. Everybody is focusing on impressive performance results but:- you will never achieve anything resembling impressive as an amateur natty no matter what you do. PED use is so common now they&#x27;re the standard for comparisons- your pay check does not depend on achieving certain results. Look at the pros when they stop competing, they know it&#x27;s not worth pushing it any more- any persistent injury significantly affects your life quality. A very mild shoulder RSI makes sleeping and sex complicated- training 3 times a week for decades offers plenty of opportunities to make mistakes so you need to leave a big margin for safety- 80&#x2F;20 rule applies to the effort and results and to the risk and rewards reply pulpfictional 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the plan to stay injury-free? I don&#x27;t know any bodybuilders. reply piva00 1 hour agorootparentYou can either choose to lift until you find a sweet spot of strength you are content with and not push past it, avoiding injury from ever-heavier lifts. Or you&#x27;ll want to progress slower when you are at intermediate-advanced level, lifting is pretty safe as a sport if you do it with proper form until you get to the upper boundaries.Rest well, eat enough, don&#x27;t push it when something is feeling a \"little weird\" with some muscle. My worst injury as a beginner 10+ years ago was to finish a deadlift routine after feeling a muscle slightly pulled after the first rep, I had a bad lower back pain for weeks that left me uncomfortable doing anything: laying down, sitting, walking, etc.If you don&#x27;t know any bodybuilders I&#x27;d recommend getting a good coach on your beginner phase to fix your form, you don&#x27;t need to keep a coach after you learn the basics, and bad form is the #1 source of injuries at lowest levels. Starting Strength is a decent beginner routine but over time you&#x27;ll want to add some auxiliary exercises to work smaller muscles, in my routine I like to start the training session with big lifts (deadlift, squat, standing barbell rows, chin ups&#x2F;pull ups, bench press, and overhead presses) and after those I follow with auxiliary movements (face pulls, dumbbell presses&#x2F;curls, calves, etc.).I chose to not push myself past a level I got comfortable with, never tried a deadlift heavier than 220kg, my squats hover between 130-140kg, bench press around 80kg, military press around 55-60kg. I feel strong enough and been injury-free for years, it&#x27;s a good maintenance level and my goal with lifting has always to just keep mobility in older age, not to keep growing muscles&#x2F;strength as far as I could push. reply omnimus 1 hour agorootparentAlso for most people being able comfortably deadlift even 1x of their weight in a set would be big improvement and they would probably get most of the benefits.The problem is once people get to that - why would they stop? reply rayxi271828 1 hour agorootparentprevI wonder how to tell whether one&#x27;s reached that sweet spot. Is it when the lift hasn&#x27;t increased for months?And of course there&#x27;s the variable of age as well. reply piva00 1 hour agorootparentFor me it was when I start noticing that the bad days where I&#x27;d fail my intended lift happened more often than the days I progressed.An example, when I was trying to push my bench press over 87,5kg I was going with 1-2 sets of warm-up (~8-10x 70kg then adding 5kg to the 2nd warm up), followed by: 1 set of 5x85kg, 5x87,5kg and trying to go 3x90kg but noticed I was failing the 3x90kg set for 4+ weeks in a row, I kinda knew it was going to take more effort and a different approach than just my very basic way to increase load, I was happy with lifting 87,5kg on the bench and just stopped trying to push it further.Age has definitely affected my recovery time, stamina, etc. but because I&#x27;ve been lifting on-off since my teens playing tennis, and only focusing on strength training for its own sake later in my 20s. I do have a \"baseline\" that I can reach in about 4-6 months even when I stop training completely for a while, the strength you gain changes your muscles (I think it creates extra nuclei in muscle cells, unsure how true that is, lots of pseudoscience in fitness-world) and it comes back. That&#x27;s one of the main reasons I recommend all of my sedentary friends to try lifting for a while, it will help when one is older. reply pulpfictional 1 hour agorootparentprevThank you! reply zemvpferreira 1 hour agorootparentprev-Develop excellent technique. -Learn to stop at technical failure, never muscle up reps at any cost. -Focus on slow eccentrics, deep stretches under load. -Keep your sets over 10 reps. reply rqtwteye 1 hour agorootparentprevFrom some age on (40-50?) you have to train to maintain, not to improve. Some can train really hard up to old age but most people tend to accumulate nagging injuries that can take away the ability to train at all. reply oarfish 1 hour agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t exceed your recovery resources. Anecdotal reports are not helpful when determining injury risk.Overall injury incidence in strength sports is very low. But if you do it to compete, maybe there is an argument to be made that pushing the limits increases it.Overall though, the much greater risk is to not train. Whether you do barbell movements or machines is not a determinant of of health outcomes, as far as we know.I would not put stock in anecdote without some numbers on injuries among non-competing powerlifters. reply pulpfictional 1 hour agorootparentThank you. reply kugla 35 minutes agorootparentprevLift hard but do let life get in a way. reply saiya-jin 44 minutes agorootparentprevI partially agree - pushing limits is plain stupid given enough time, every single time injuries happen, to everybody out there. If they say not to them they are either lying or just begun the sport recently.I have different approach, with similar result so far to those bodybuilders without actually doing it - don&#x27;t lift your max, but do it with free weights as much as possible, in good form (the most important bit long term). You don&#x27;t need to look ridiculously bulked, say well-defined is more than enough, even for women&#x27;s attractivity. Those massive muscles always hide very unhealthy eating habits (ie > 200g of protein every day will mess up your organs and joints badly over decades) and tons of injuries, plus they are very hard to maintain if you actually want to be happy in your life and do other stuff.I strongly recommend removing some weights and adding repetitions, you can still reach failure threshold if you want, but in much safer way. Easier to maintain perfect form for each exercise too. You mention lifting heavy stuff in weird positions - that&#x27;s recipe for injury regardless of age or shape, rather just be a bit smarter with lifting.What is much better to be able to have some stamina - weightlifting on the limits alone ain&#x27;t going to give you much of that (saw more than once a ripped guy who didn&#x27;t do any cardio trying to make >1000m altitude difference hike, well he struggled a lot, on a way up and then knee pain started say in the middle of descent).There are tons of things apart from main, most visible muscle groups that you really want to train - small stabilizing muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint flexibility, and stamina for all of those. Body is a complex and interconnected system, no point overdeveloping just few main parts for the show or mirror look, rather work on everything. reply throwaway4good 2 hours agoparentprevI think that is missing the point a bit; regardless of how healthy a lifestyle you live you still will end up suffering from some kind of disability. Perhaps of a cause completely outside your control (stroke, heart problem, accident).Not to say that strength training isn&#x27;t good for you of course. But it may not actually prepare you for things to come (unlike having a healthy family life, an identity outside work and physical fitness). reply maccard 1 hour agorootparentIts not a binary thing. On my dad&#x27;s side, there is a history of hip issues, sciatica, upper back and shoulder mobility issues.One of his siblings is in his early 60&#x27;s, retired, and can only be described as \"active\". He&#x27;s not powerlifting or anything like that but gym, cycling, gardening, every day or other day. He&#x27;s on his second hip, soon to be third.His other sibling is late 50&#x27;s, also on their second hip about to get their third. They&#x27;re limited to 2-300 yards of walking, can&#x27;t really stand unaided for long periods of time, struggle with their sleep, etc etc.The easiest comparison is that the older one is, and always has been more active. Sure it&#x27;s complicated, sure you can&#x27;t prepare for an unexpected diagnosis, but I&#x27;d you&#x27;re 60 with no active health scares, your quality of life is going to be dictated by how much you looked after yourself, not just luck. reply quickthrower2 2 hours agorootparentprevYou do reduce the probability of an issue though.

More muscle also means you can eat more without getting fat.2) A competitive strength sport (generally called powerlifting; weightlifting usually refers to the explosive overhead lifts seen at the Olympics).Your strength goals can, and should, depend entirely on your objectives. If you&#x27;re aiming to compete, a 150KG squat and 200KG deadlift would put you around the median in the lowest male weight classes.If you just want to get in shape, it&#x27;s overkill. reply mise_en_place 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also relative to your body weight. A 150 kg squat for someone who weighs 118 kg (i.e. me) is not that impressive. Whereas an 80 kg squat if you weigh 80 kg is extremely impressive.

The idea is 55%, 65%, 75%, 85% weeks. The % is perceived effort. That might be bench pressing just the bar sometimes. And I go twice a week, and do about 7 different exercises. It is not \"perfect\" but it is f&#x27;ing consistent.

It takes less than 10 minutes and keeps a bare minimum of strength in your lower back and arms. The lower back part is key for people who work in chairs all day.

It looks scary but anyone (without a precluding condition) can do it.It&#x27;s only HIIT if you make it so, the key is to pace yourself according to your level, going slow if needed so as to complete each of the 30s.If you can&#x27;t do the full range, do a partial range, but do that range with proper form so as not to hurt yourself, don&#x27;t force through it, it&#x27;ll get better over time.Aim for consistency, not short term record.Side note: lubricate joints before (do rotations and flexing), stretch after exercise: stretching before increases risk of injury. If you really want to stretch before, do dynamic stretching, not static.* doing only sit-ups and push-ups strengthens frontside massively, so front-back is not balanced, further increasing the forward arching position (starting with nerd neck) induced by long term sitting. Front training is important for all-day sitters as these muscles (which should be engaged all along the day but are not) atrophy, but overtraining front (vs back) amplifies the issue.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dlantbhXp4Y reply Gud 2 hours agorootparentprevA small amount of exercise each day will do wonders for your overall fitness, especially when starting out.You don’t need to hit the gym for an hour to feel the results.

The health benefits of simply doing each compound lift at least once a week plus eating a ton of protein cannot be overstated, they are life changing.* I&#x27;ll editorialize here but I feel both BBR and SS are designed for younger, fitter, more hardcore \"beginners\" than me, especially SS.

It&#x27;s fine to take it easy and not increase the weights you&#x27;re lifting aggressively, for instance. Or even to go to the gym twice a week instead of three times. If it&#x27;s not an easy and fun part of your life you&#x27;ll fall off the wagon.Basically you can be a physical wreck at 40, to a degree that a 23 year old guy can&#x27;t even comprehend. All simply because you didn&#x27;t exercise.Just keep showing up regularly, doing the compound lifts SAFELY but heavy enough to tire out your muscles, and eating your protein (100g+ daily, there are formulas to calculate it precisely).It might take a little longer for us older sedentary guys but everything will come together.A good personal trainer (or physical therapist if you start hitting issues?) is absolutely worth it if you can get one, one advantage we older guys have is we&#x27;re more likely to have the spare cash for this. reply jaggederest 2 hours agorootparentprevHonestly you should start again with starting strength or a beginner program like it if you haven&#x27;t been actively training in the last few years. Go slow, start with the bar, let the increases happen until you hit a wall where you need to reassess. Listen to your body. Once you&#x27;re back to \"intermediate\", i.e. 6 months to a year of reasonably consistent training, you can transition to a different program or just maintain at 2x a week if you like where you&#x27;ve ended up.That&#x27;s in addition to very gradually adding some sort of cardio like walks around the block. Being sedentary is going to be more of a struggle to overcome than strength - you will find that the strength you used to have will come back quickly when you start training again, but as a guy in the exact same boat, the cardiovascular side is the tough part.

I was in the latter group; it was the first program recommended to me, but I was leery of it because I don&#x27;t have medical insurance and was skeptical about the feasibility of the suggestions based on what I knew about my own body, so I just did nothing about it. When I did start lifting, I started out with light weights and spent months figuring out a program while getting a kinetic understanding of the different muscle groups and how they worked together, spamming volume for a while and gradually adding more weight.I don&#x27;t mean that SS is a bad program, it works for lots of people and it&#x27;s very accessible. But I also think it&#x27;s way oversold and not magic. reply cheald 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s definitely not magic, but it&#x27;s on the 80 side of the 80&#x2F;20 split, IMO.It isn&#x27;t the right starter program for everyone, but then, nothing is. The best program for the beginner is whichever one keeps you consistently showing up and moving forward. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentprevIt does actually. The program is so poor that beginners might not even see enough progress that they&#x27;re put off from working out, because \"what&#x27;s the point if I&#x27;ve been at it for a month or three and still don&#x27;t have any gains?\" That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to actually pick a good program, one that shows consistent gains as motivation rather than plateauing as a demotivational force.Other recommended programs like 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1 are not \"more complex,\" that&#x27;s a false dichotomy. They&#x27;re just as simple but with different sets of exercises. reply cheald 3 hours agorootparentThis is a very silly argument to be made against a lifting program which has verifiably moved countless people off the couch and into resistance training. The reason people recommend Starting Strength is because it&#x27;s what successfully got them into lifting.I train 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1 now, I have for years, I love it, and I absolutely do not recommend it to beginners. I&#x27;ve tried. Their eyes glaze over when you start talking about \"training maxes\" and \"periodization\". They get confused and lose whatever sliver of motivation they had. Save the optimization for when they&#x27;re bought in. Any beginner is gonna make progress on essentially any structured program just due to neuroadaptation. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentI did SS too in the beginning. I didn&#x27;t see much progress and that has also been verifiably the case for others too, if you are using anecdotes as your verification process. That SS works is despite its quality, not because of it. And so what? Should we not try to improve programs just because they work in some cases? We don&#x27;t have to use 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1 then, we can use even the basic beginner routine as recommended on r&#x2F;fitness, it is pretty good while discarding the problems of SS. reply cheald 2 hours agorootparentBut you&#x27;re still lifting, presumably. That sounds like success to me.I tried to start lifting multiple times. SL 5x5 is what actually made it click. Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing, I could write volumes on its flaws, but what I needed wasn&#x27;t a technically optimized program, but one which gave me a clear goal for each workout and an easy way to see what the path forward looked like.As the reddit beginner program correctly notes:> The primary goal is to be a simple, easy to follow routine that will help beginners get into the gym, start training with the standard barbell lifts, and build a habit of going to the gym consistently. Consistency over time is the biggest point of failure in making progress, and the aim is to lower the barrier as far as possible to starting and staying consistent.The point of a beginner program really isn&#x27;t the volume moved or optimizing the particular split, but to give the beginner a structure on which to build routine and learn good habits. It helps no one to crap on Starting Strength, when it has an established history of achieving exactly that goal. Offering things like the reddit program as a potentially superior alternative is fine to the eager newbie, but telling people that Starting Strength is a bad way to start is just counterproductive.My advice to every new lifter is that the best program for them is the one that gets them going back to the gym consistently, and I&#x27;ll continue to stand behind that.

Go to gym - find heavy stuff you can pick up - try not to do anything stupid.SS is great because it has a low number of movements, volume is irrelevant when you get sore from a barbell squat, learning how to lift is deceptively complicated (breathing&#x2F;bracing&#x2F;muscle activation).The article keeps straw-manning \"longterm\" this and that - SS is your first year in the gym (or less). By the time you&#x27;re trough with it, unless you&#x27;re totally oblivious, you&#x27;ll pick up on other stuff when you have the time. And you&#x27;ll have a decent intuition of how to lift, understand recovery implications, consistency in training, and a decent base strength. It&#x27;s a great base to get you started and have an achievable progression framework that doesn&#x27;t require much tutoring or time.I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people get from 0 to nice lifting strength in ~1 year by doing SS. The only thing that&#x27;s relevant is consistency - if you come in 2-3x a week and do something difficult for an hour for a year - you will see results - it can be total fucking around - you will still get results. It&#x27;s good to start with SS type exercises because those well defined movements target your entire body, and if you learn to execute them correctly you reduce your chance of injury.TL;DR - for any newbie out there that&#x27;s in bad shape and looking to start gym - save yourself time and avoid \"optimal muscle development\" crowd.

How old are you? reply cheald 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;ve had two knee surgeries, and have genetically terrible knees. Squatting incorrectly made them hurt, but I went to see a sports PT and he taught me how to squat correctly (I was overloading my quads and not using my posterior chain like...at all - a proper low-bar squat with the glutes engaged was a total gamechanger), and not only did it fix my knee pain in squats, it fixed my knee pain in general. I went from being functionally crippled in my 20s to competing as an amateur powerlifter and training Brazilian jiujitsu in my late 30s, and I absolutely attribute the foundation of that to squatting and deadlifting.In my personal experience, as a now more seasoned lifter, most people have knee pain in squats because they load the quads and arrest the squat early with the quads rather than hitting full depth. Once your hip crease is below the top of your kneecap, your quads are no longer bearing the load! If you&#x27;re stopping the lift prior to that, then you&#x27;re applying a ton of torque to the knee directly with the quad, rather than letting the much more robust posterior chain absorb the energy of the descent.If you haven&#x27;t tried squatting low-bar, you might give it a go - it makes it much easier to move with the posterior chain. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo is my single favorite squat video on the internet.

Technique is really important. I recommend watching some videos by Mark Rippetoe [1], and also filming your squats to review them.

Then my knee started randomly buckling when I would walk.So I started filming myself. I also used TUBOW [3] to figure out that my knees were drifting far too forward. I corrected my technique accordingly, and started engaging the hips properly.

For example, medial knee pain can be, to name two options, an MCL tear or just an inflammation of the bursal sac. I had the latter when getting back into exercise after a long break (I&#x27;m now 40), and was really worried I had busted my knees. In the end, switching to front squats for a bit and working on mobility as well as paying attention to posture when lifting helped with it.Point being, if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing your knee pain, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to figure it out first, then think about what could help. reply lookboil 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat sort of range of motion are you using?

And also the notion of ability&#x2F;disability has too many connotations, it makes it really hard to discuss the subject.One could posit that having less than perfect vision is a disability (for whatever value of \"perfect\"). But people will fight tooth and nail to not fall into that category, they&#x27;ll explain how much they still can do without correction, or straight refuse the definition because glasses compensate their vision.I think at the very basis, accepting that there isn&#x27;t a \"norm\" in the first place could help a lot. If there&#x27;s no normal people, we can start discussion how we&#x27;re all different and will be good or bad at different things.Another funny lens: people entering a foreign culture where they can&#x27;t read nor speak should also fall into the (temporary?) disabled bucket. And same for so many other mindane situations. reply Paul-Craft 2 hours agoparentYou make a really good point here.Some years ago, I probably never would have thought of myself as \"disabled\" in any way. But, like you mention, I wear glasses, and, depending what the activity is, I can either continue on with little issue, or end up completely useless. I&#x27;ve also learned that I have ADHD and a learning disability.A \"disability\" is generally defined as a condition that limits one or more \"major life activities,\" which is a term that has its own definition, but it&#x27;s pretty common sense. One of my disabilities is myopia, which limits the activity of \"seeing.\" My learning disability limits my ability to process visual-spatial information.Without accommodation in certain tasks, I absolutely am disabled. Ask me to navigate an unfamiliar neighborhood alone without my phone, and I&#x27;ll end up lost, frustrated, and probably not find where I&#x27;m supposed to go. Ask me to do it without my phone and my glasses, and it&#x27;s just a pointless exercise in futility then.But, let me have those tools which I know can help me do the tasks, and I&#x27;ll be just fine. I am still a person who has some disabilities even with my tools, but they&#x27;re what lets me manage. It says something about American culture, I think, that being seen using something as a \"crutch\" is a sign of weakness, when, in fact, a crutch is nothing more than a tool that can let someone who would be otherwise unable to do an activity be able to do so, no more or less than my glasses or my phone. reply zomglings 4 hours agoprevThis article really struck a chord in me.At the end of May, I started suffering from Achilles tendonitis in one of my feet.

Ice packs - avoid heat for sure.And try to stay off your feet.Last Monday, I think tightened a tendon on the front part of my right foot because I had tried to walk too fast the previous evening. Thankfully, understanding the principles of stretching and icing helped me recover from that in 2 days (it wasn&#x27;t as serious as the Achilles tendon tightening).Just take it slow and give yourself time to heal. The good news is that this isn&#x27;t chronic (what the physiotherapist told me). After you heal, just take care to be stretched and warmed up before putting repetitive stress on your tendons.Edit: When you are injured, the rest of your body has to put itself under extra stress when you move to offset the lack of mobility that the tendonitis causes. So you increase the probability of other injuries (in my case, the tightening of other tendons). Try to be super careful and super patient. reply kaivi 50 minutes agoprevPeter Attia explores the same notion in his recent book called \"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity\". I haven&#x27;t finished the book yet, but the key point so far is that our modern medicine, as he calls it \"Medicine v2\", is in need of an upgrade to v3. Most people expect to become frail or senile in their late years, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be that way.This new type medicine will focus on preventing injuries like that of Jim Nielsen&#x27;s knee, as well as illnesses. For example, blood sugar levels considered normal have increased over the years as the general population got fatter. If your levels are measured 125 mg&#x2F;dL, maybe you&#x27;ll get a suggestion to change your diet.

He also argues that we have all the tools to collect the data and to make it possible.

The demographic that I Serve tends to have a statistically higher level of challenges than your average audience.One trick that I&#x27;m doing, in the app that I&#x27;m working on now, is that I have a \"long-press help\" feature.I have a long-press gesture recognizer attached to the main view, and, when a long-press event is received, I find the shallowest view under that press, and examine it for the accessibility label and hint support. If it does not have any, I back up to its parent, etc.If I find a label and hint, I use them to populate a popover, pointing at the target, and trigger a haptic. This popover has whatever is in the label (the popover title), and hint (detailed popover body).This encourages me to make sure that as many items as possible, have accessibility support. It also is a lot easier to test, than running voiceover (which I need to do anyway, as sometimes, text does not speak the way we think).I also localize my accessibility[0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiftValleySoftware&#x2F;RVS_Generic_Swift_Tool... reply EarthLaunch 2 hours agoprev> Through all of it, I’ve found myself noticing “accessibility” helpers more than ever before: that railing on the stairs, that ramp off to the side of the building, that elevator tucked away in the back.The title got me because I was fortunate to have this revelation too.

How much does an individual at their peak owe to the collective that \"abled\" them. Why should anyone take care of them during decline?Its not a trivial problem. The feeling of invincibility in our youth, ignoring - if not despising - the weak and adulating the strong and capable is probably an evolutionary adaptation.Yet our predicament as an intelligent and moral species is to understand this core reality and find the right balance. Use the various forms of invented technology to push the limits of ability (augment) without forgeting how it is all bootstraped and held together. reply sublinear 4 hours agoprev> I injured my knee.Now imagine if your job wasn&#x27;t sitting at a desk all day!Actually let&#x27;s be honest, a sedentary lifestyle makes injuries like this more likely. reply rob74 3 hours agoparentI thought about that when I read this in the blog post:> ...and tried something that, looking back now, maybe I’m too old forI don&#x27;t know how old he is (not that old judging by the photo, but maybe it&#x27;s an old photo?), and I don&#x27;t know what he tried to do, but thinking like that is a slippery slope. Regular exercise is more important when growing older, not less - otherwise, you might become disabled because of your sedentary lifestyle rather than because of an injury. reply ehnto 3 hours agorootparentExactly my thoughts, people slow themselves down as they age and it&#x27;s surely a combination of reasons, and you can do what you want. But use it or lose it rings true.When you break your collarbone, the majority of your recovery is actually healing the joints and muscles that atrophied while you were in a sling (exceptions for surgery etc.) The bone takes care of itself, but your shoulder and arms freeze up and wither away alarmingly fast.If you have a bad joint and the pain causes you to reduce movement, it&#x27;s very worthwhile to see a physio and keep the joints moving while it heals, to avoid further damage. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentprevI think you assume way too much out of this: The way I usually hear this expression is like \"I have tried to do a backflip, failed and broke my arm\", or so. So the blog writer likely did something way out of his league, like a fancy trick, and it is not a fair assumption to think that he lives such a sedentary lifestyle that any kind of movement would cause him harm, or even thinks that way. One can be very sporty, yet do some stupid one-off movement that will cause harm. reply ycombinete 3 hours agoparentprevAbsolutely, being sedentary is actively harmful.And it&#x27;s amazing how long these things can take to recover once you&#x27;re in your 30s. I got patella tendinitis in both my knees, after a decade of sedentary indolence, followed by an extreme reentry into exercise. It took nearly a whole year to get my knees right. reply psychoslave 1 hour agoprev> 1 in 5 people currently have a disability. 100% of people will have some form of disability in their lifetime.That would mean no one will ever die in their best abilities. I think that is a claim that can easily proven wrong, for any reasonable definition of best abilities. reply crdrost 1 hour agoparentI think if you went even more pedantic you would come back again to the idea that it&#x27;s right, the idea being that someone dies an untimely death, fine, but it takes like 5 minutes for them to die and several of those minutes they are technically disabled.So then you get ultra pedantic about, maybe that doesn&#x27;t make sense if you are vaporized over a timescale less than a human reaction time, 100ms or so, and probably that has happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or suicide bombers, or when the twin towers fell, or when a submarine catastrophically collapses, or certain falling deaths perhaps... But likely less than 0.5% of the people who have been alive, so when rounding to the nearest percent you would indeed say 100%.All of that is for lols, probably the original quote attached some sort of caveat that was lost in the note-taking, but even without it it&#x27;s reasonable for the reader to be expected to add the necessary caveat, “ignoring people who happen to very suddenly die in the prime of their lives,...” reply psychoslave 29 minutes agorootparentSure in some sense, and we can always be over pedantic in any topic. Maybe I felt in the trap here, though I still feel that the sentence is over selling the author point, which is not the end is the world either.What I mean is, from what I get, the author point is that we shouldn&#x27;t disregard people with permanent disabilities, as it&#x27;s a faith we will all eventually reach.While I agree with the ethical goal of not disregarding people with some disabilities, I wouldn&#x27;t take the path of founding that on average human faith.All the more the point is not how long will we agonize in an obviously near death situation, but how comfortably and socially integrated we can live once we have some disability, taking for granted that yes we will all necessary have the luxe of such a situation. reply apsurd 4 hours agoprevSame. at twenty something i sprained my ankle playing basketball. it&#x27;s unbelievable how hard concrete sidewalks feel to a tender recovering bag of flesh. i sought out dirt and grass for relief.

To the extent I&#x27;ve successfully developed empathy for disabled and marginalized people and some degree of understanding, it&#x27;s mostly been because my privileged life was interrupted by injury, or something else happened to impact myself personally.I read this article on HN recently about trying to cultivate these experiences deliberately, I&#x27;d be curious what you thought of it. It seems like an interesting idea but I have mixed feelings about cosplaying as a person with a disability I don&#x27;t actually have.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shkspr.mobi&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;i-feel-hopeless-rejected-an... reply DoreenMichele 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve read it...at least part of it and skimmed the rest.From what I have read -- and this article cites the same stat -- roughly 15 to 20 percent of people self-identify as disabled. But that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. At least one study found that about 60 percent of people would benefit from better accommodation if you ask them if they have difficulties with X without asking them to self-identify as disabled.Both the officially disabled and people with milder limitations get really cranky about where to draw that line. People with mild limitations often go out of their way to say they are definitely not disabled and merely have a little trouble with these things and officially disabled jealously guard the label because they need it to have any hope of making their lives work at all and don&#x27;t want people who can make their lives work without that label horning in on any limited benefits available only to them or diluting what the word means.It&#x27;s a really thorny topic.I had a class from SFSU in Homelessness and Public Policy and it has a similar exercise, like \"Spend one day pretending you are homeless. Figure out how to go to the bathroom while carrying everything you own. Figure out how you will get around without a car.\"And then I spent nearly six years homeless.There are plenty of people with actual disabilities who are perfectly capable of telling you what they need if you will only listen to them. If you are unable or unwilling to listen to them and take them seriously without trying to \"walk a mile in their shoes,\" well, sure, go ahead and try it out for a week or whatever if you think that will help you.But sometimes all it takes is one person willing to say it over and over so you keep it in mind when it&#x27;s time for you to make coding decisions or whatever. And if&#x2F;when that happens, it probably won&#x27;t ever get noticed, acknowledged nor appreciated.It will promptly be forgotten like when programmers of an old, \"useless\" language fixed Y2K and the world did not have a global financial meltdown on January 1, 2000. We shrugged, acted like \"Someone must have been wrong.\" and moved on to hand-wringing about the newest bad news.I am probably the only person on the planet who sometimes goes \"Thank God we aren&#x27;t living in the Y2K Post Apocalypse!\"The internet has made my life as a disabled person vastly more workable. Are there things I wish were even betterer? Sure, there are and we certainly shouldn&#x27;t be dismissing the completely valid complaints of anyone who can&#x27;t do x because it&#x27;s not designed with their needs in mind and there is no means whatsoever to get it done.I certainly do not dismiss such people.But perhaps it would help to understand that when they complain about, for example, the internet not working for them, part of what they are telling you is that the internet is vital to their lives and has expanded their life beyond what it likely would have been in decades past. So when it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s like taking away their oxygen or sunshine.It&#x27;s hard to do anything well. It&#x27;s often not appreciated at all nor rewarded. Try to not throw the baby out with the bathwater. reply padolsey 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s true. But also perhaps more nuanced. Many people see disability as a purely negative experience, something to avoid at all costs, synonymous with illness. But it is a slightly different axis: Both medical and societal in nature. Thus we have the idea that it is not the person who is disabled, but society that disables the person. And separately many people have it as a central part of their identity, something to be proud of. Hence identity first language: “disabled person” vs “person with disability”. I am a person who holds it both as a burden of sorts, but also an identity, and a constantly fluctuating commentary on the ableism in the way we’ve built society. Disability is a complex framework. reply DoreenMichele 1 hour agorootparentI hate labels.But they are sometimes a necessary evil to communicate at all. reply sjg1729 2 hours agoparentprevThe main point of this article is to inspire a bit more empathy and consideration for those with disabilities.

Doesn&#x27;t feel constructive to call him out for it reply DoreenMichele 2 hours agorootparentI used to work at a Fortune 500 company. While there, I gave up my car and began walking to work.A teammate offered to pick me every morning but our schedules were a little different, so she couldn&#x27;t take me home. There was a program for people ridesharing, some goody-two-shoes, pie-in-the-sky, \"Let&#x27;s promote the idea that people need to drive less\" thing and she qualified for a special parking space for ridesharing with me.And then someone else offered to take me home and also applied to this program and did not get the special parking space she was hoping for. Instead, the first woman lost her special parking privileges.After that, I stopped participating in all the company programs aimed at rewarding people with cars for driving less by walking, biking, ridesharing, etc. for fear that as someone entirely without a car, no matter what I did, I would somehow be in violation of the rules which were geared towards people who owned cars and by default drove alone.I happen to be seriously handicapped myself and my condition is congenital.

Each of us has a fragile body and at any moment, you might become broken in a way you can&#x27;t fix. When you can&#x27;t walk up a hill, hold a job - the world becomes hostile. Even going down a road that isn&#x27;t asphalt but stones is a challenge for some people. That is a consequence of young and healthy people designing our world and the things in it, while others have to adapt. It is not about privilege, it&#x27;s about smart design and understanding that the problem can very easily apply to us all.

If there are consistent excess renewables on a grid, it seriously impairs the economics of nuclear. France’s nuclear reactors load follow but are hard on the mechanicals attempting to do so, and France has some serious issues with reactor maintenance and refurbishment.Coal and nuclear are the first to be driven out of the generation mix due to their poor economics (or sometimes air pollution regulation as is the case with coal), and remaining coal and natural gas will be driven out over the next decade. Natural gas competes with renewables and batteries, both of which continually decline in cost. Peaking natural gas (vs more efficient combined cycle gas turbine) is already no longer competitive with batteries, and those generators are quickly being replaced.Tangentially, Germany has twelve interconnectors with neighboring electrical grids.

Is it because the German industry and population is much bigger?The problem is, basically, that the other 50% is _very_ CO2 heavy , and it only got worse in 2022-2023 because the last nuclear plants closed, and gas got more expensive so more coal got used. [3]This explains the vast difference between Germany and France on the electricity map: France hardly gets 20% of its electricity from solar panels and wind farms, but the other 80% are from atoms and water drops instead of lignite, which just makes a huuuge difference.Also, remember that electricity-maps only looks at, well, electricity - which only accounts for roughly 1&#x2F;4th of the emissions [4]. Germany still has a large industry, and it&#x27;s building... petroleum cars. (I was surprised to read that as far as \"Industry\" emissions are concerned, Germany and France are actually rather close, at ~25Mt&#x2F;y. But I suppose the cars go in to the \"Manufactoring\" category, where Germany is clearly on top....)All in all, the per-capita CO2 emission of France ends up being almost twice as low as Germany. Which is maybe why it&#x27;s easier to reach reduction goal: \"all\" Germany has to do to get a massive reduction is to clean-up its grid. The country kinda-sovereignly decided to make it harder by ditching nuclear, but it&#x27;s actually the \"easy\" part (in the sense that it&#x27;s transparent for most people when they switch on their TV if the electricity is\" clean\" or not. The only consideration is whether it is \"cheap\" or not.)France is at the stage where it has to reduce the other not-low-hanging-at-all fruit: transport emissions. (Because the current technology forces people to trade relatively cheap, comfortable and versatile gas-powered cars for EVs that are none of those three things - at the moment - and they&#x27;ll understandably kick and scream to avoid that.)In a different world, Germany would have invested in R&D to build small and affordable electric cars, while France would have invested in R&D to build smaller and safer nuclear reactors.Instead, Germany paid software engineers to make car cheat tests [6], and France paid consultants to make the electricity market undecipharable while 1970&#x27;s nuclear plants where rotting in place [7] ... and then 2022 happened !---[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2023-06-germany-climate-narrow-fully-c...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;germany-greenhouse-gas-emissions-progr...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleanenergywire.org&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;germanys-energy-c...[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;co2&#x2F;country&#x2F;germany[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;co2&#x2F;country&#x2F;france[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Volkswagen_emissions_scandal[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_in_France#Messme... reply GuB-42 8 hours agoparentprevTL;DR coalNot only Germany uses lots of coal, it also uses a lot of the worst kind of coal, lignite.

In reality every country is going to have grid limits internally and different sources of demand in different places.For example, in your Finland observation it may be cheaper&#x2F;easier to supply the north of Finland from Sweden rather than send the power that could otherwise go to Estonia to the other side of the country, probably not a lot of north south distribution internally in Finland because of terrain (I know Norway really struggles with this, you can see huge price differences in the north of Norway vs south of Norway on EPEX Spot - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epexspot.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;market-data), so I would assume Finland is the same.The UK also has huge bottlenecks north&#x2F;south in distributing power.

I take it this includes CO2 released during manufacturing. Is it averaged over the expected life span? What about for a nuclear plant? Whole I can see how we can estimate CO2 for a panel, I don’t think we can have good idea of a whole plant. reply Lapha 19 hours agorootparentIdeally it&#x27;s lifecycle carbon footprint averaged over expected power production during that time, but the numbers aren&#x27;t always directly comparable and the error bars are huge to boot.With solar, most of the carbon footprint comes from the massive energy requirements needed to produce the panels, and countries that use coal to produce panels like China have a significantly higher carbon footprint than say the EU. Then there&#x27;s the matter of where you install them, panels in most of Europe will have a CO2&#x2F;kWh figure similar to to panels installed in north-west Canada, while panels installed in the US will have a similar figure to panels installed in southern Europe and northern Africa. Newer panels generally have a longer lifespan and are more efficient so will have a lower number even if the total footprint stays the same. Should the albedo effect be considered with solar? It matters if you plan to cover a light desert with dark panels. How often it rains can also ironically have a difference, as rain helps clean the panels keeping them running efficiently.With nuclear, there&#x27;s the mostly fixed costs of constructing and decommissioning the plants, the ongoing cost of running and maintaining the plants, disposing of spent fuel, and with most of the cost coming from mining the fuel. To me nuclear seems a little more straight forward to calculate, but there&#x27;s still variability that can come from the availability and difficulty of mining the ore. There&#x27;s also political issues to consider. If your country decides to shut down your nuclear plants prematurely, like Germany did, the huge upfront cost of building the plants can&#x27;t be recouped by running them for an additional 10, 20, 30+ years until it becomes necessary to decommission them.Regardless of how renewables are compared to nuclear, coal and gas are the elephants in the room when it comes to CO2 produced per kWh. reply p_l 18 hours agorootparentprevNote that the \"CO2&#x2F;kWh equivalent emissions\" given on the page are provided with source to document describing methodology: UNECE 2022.

If you look at kragen&#x27;s code, you&#x27;ll see that running it on a list of e.g. 6 elements in ascending order will mean that you make 5 comparisons, swap 0 elements, and exit. (You do have to count from 1 to 6 as you do this.)The insertion sort is implemented as a bubble sort, interestingly enough, but one that doesn&#x27;t consider the entire array at every iteration. Given that it&#x27;s equally correct, it&#x27;s not difficult to understand why it will always be faster than a bubble sort that does consider the entire array at every iteration. reply SomeoneFromCA 40 minutes agorootparentprevIn any case, you should retract you claim that Bubble Sort is slower on already sorted case.

You&#x27;re never going to get 10x without architectural changes but you can get 3x with a lot of work.Of course the \"we&#x27;ll just optimise the hotspots\" people have written their code so badly they need at least 10x. reply bongobingo1 5 hours agoprevnon xitter mirror: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;cperciva&#x2F;status&#x2F;1693127769901969772 reply rf15 4 hours agoprevDoes anyone know why they used bubblesort in the first place?

But it seems reasonable to have, for instance, link-time sorting support that only works when building a kernel that doesn&#x27;t support kernel modules. reply cperciva 5 hours agorootparentMaybe. The tradeoff is that having two different ways of doing something makes it more likely that one will break without anyone noticing. reply JoshTriplett 5 hours agorootparentValid. Especially in early boot.Another possibility: always use link-time sorting for the kernel, and for individual modules, and then do runtime merging if and only if you have kernel modules. That way, the link-time sorting path is always tested, and the runtime merging is tested anytime you have kernel modules (which sounds like the more common case).(All of this, though, is gated under \"is it worth saving the microseconds yet\".) replygizmo686 5 hours agoparentprevWhy not boot as a compilation step, and save a memory instance to be loaded on actual boots. reply midoridensha 2 hours agorootparentProbably because that would assume far too much about the state of the hardware. reply loeg 5 hours agoparentprevNo good reason.

It would be easy to take a snapshot at the \"wrong\" time when something is deadlocked on a timer or external device that won&#x27;t be in an appropriate state at the next power on. A \"boot\" process ensures everything attached has been roused from their slumber and get them back to a known state.OTOH, I could imagine if you were designing to a specific enough use case, you could design a system that relied on a minimal support devices and a CPU that bit-banged almost everything, so you knew if you were in the idle loop, everything was safe to snapshot. reply RetroTechie 3 hours agoparentprevWould it?Read in small amount of code (or execute directly from flash) & use that to initialize hardware, might just be faster than read memory dump of already-initialized system.Also the \"read memory dump\" method would include code & data structures which were used on a previous run, but may not be needed for the next run (or only much later). And not re-initialize hardware which may have gone flaky, or changed configuration in the meanwhile (like USB port with different device plugged vs. state that memory dump reflects).Rebooting is just an all around cleaner method to return system to a known state. But of course it all depends on hardware specifics & what type(s) of initialization is done. reply im3w1l 2 hours agorootparentThe context here is starting a vm really fast on aws firecracker, so those concerns about hardware don&#x27;t apply. reply bux93 3 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s what windows fast startup does, it starts from a post-boot hibernated state of RAM.

It&#x27;s the portion of time spent sorting the array of system calls during boot. This didn&#x27;t used to matter when it took longer than a second to boot up, but now that the boot times are in the sub-second range, the amount of time spent sorting the array of system calls ended up taking up a notable chunk of the time spent booting.Might not matter for the things you care about, but some people certainly do care about boot performance. reply Crestwave 5 hours agoparentprevThe author mentions in the thread that the boot time they measured on the device was 28 ms and 7% of it (2 ms) was spent sorting. reply wkat4242 5 hours agoparentprevOn the sorting of SYSINIT (not sysint as the title says) calls during bootup.

It&#x27;s almost the same algorithm conceptually, except cutting out an odd pessimization. reply ynik 2 hours agorootparentprevBubble sort is optimal for sorting data stored on tapes (no random access possible).

This is the kernel, there’s no libc you have to write the sort algo yourself. reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s really because C doesn&#x27;t have a proper dependency management system like modern languages do. If it did there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t import a third party sorting algorithm in the kernel. You can do that in Rust for example, although you would just use the built in sort in this case. reply throwawaylinux 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not because of that. There exist countless BSD compatible code out there, and many are taken and used in projects like this. CRC codes being an obvious example. There is no reason sort code could not have been grabbed from somewhere, no \"dependency management system\" required. The FreeBSD kernel has its own existing sort libraries already in the code too -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cgit.freebsd.org&#x2F;src&#x2F;tree&#x2F;sys&#x2F;libkern&#x2F;qsort.c?id=9a7...The real reason is because this is an early boot environment with exact constraints that are unusual if not unique to FreeBSD where the facilities to support your general language &#x2F; runtime environment is not up yet. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparent> the facilities to support your general language &#x2F; runtime environment is not up yet.Rust&#x27;s [T].sort_unstable() is part of core, that is, the code to sort a slice of arbitrary type T doesn&#x27;t need the allocator, operating system etc.Only if you want a fast stable sort do you need to wait for such an environment because their fast stable sort needs an allocator, I doubt that FreeBSD needs a stable sort here. reply fanf2 1 hour agorootparentIt does need to be stable, which is why the replacement is mergesort.The SYSINITs need to bring up the system in a particular order. I dunno why there are both explicit ordering (the sort keys) and implicit ordering (the stability requirement), perhaps cperciva can chime in.Based on when I last looked at this code, I guess the explicit ordering is to do with startup phases, and the implicit ordering is because of the way SYSINITs are (or were?) implemented using linker sets, which have more guarantees about ordering than __attribute__((constructor)) and other similar functionality. reply tialaramex 37 minutes agorootparent> I dunno why there are both explicit ordering (the sort keys) and implicit ordering (the stability requirement), perhaps cperciva can chime in.In the event Colin is looking at this sub-thread now I&#x27;m intrigued too. reply throwawaylinux 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure what part of my post you are addressing.If you had a kernel written in Rust, you would have to bring up the rust runtime environment as part of the boot process. You don&#x27;t just magically get it because that&#x27;s the language you used, whether it is \"core\" or not. You can&#x27;t even execute simple functions before you have set up stack, and in this case apparently there is a constraint on stack usage. And evidently they do need a stable sort.In any case my main point is that it&#x27;s not anything to do with dependency management, not quibbling about whether or not some language could support this function at this exact point of the boot. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparent> you would have to bring up the rust runtime environment as part of the boot processLike the existing C runtime environment, this just isn&#x27;t a big deal by the time we&#x27;ve got here. If you&#x27;re the code for initialising the DRAM controller then sure, that&#x27;s pretty intimidating. But this is all happening much later, we&#x27;re part of an operating system, we were already loaded from disk.> And evidently they do need a stable sort.How so? They appear to even have a deliberate tie-breaking mechanism in their data structure, which suggests if order actually matters you&#x27;re expected to specify when creating the data, not rely on stability to do what you expected. replyMBCook 5 hours agorootparentprevWay to go.Do you know how fast Linux starts up?

In 1941, he wrote “My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight, in the fields while waiting for a truck, and at noon after lunch. Towns are too distracting.” Ten years later, Hoffer’s masterpiece The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements was published when he was in his late forties. Its unexpected success led him to later be appointed as an adjunct professor at University of California, Berkeley. A slim volume, The True Believer was a favorite of President Dwight Eisenhower, who regularly gifted copies to friends. The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was also an enthusiast of Hoffer’s book. The author and conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. described The True Believer as “deeply provocative.” It’s one of my favorite nonfiction books. Hoffer’s unusual background as a manual laborer and member of the working class helped to fuel his unique psychological and sociological insights which people continue to mine to this day. Today, political polarization is at its peak. Out-party hate is now more powerful than in-party love as a predictor of voting behavior in the United States. Eric Hoffer's ideas are more relevant than ever. Eric Hoffer made the case that if you peel back the layers of any mass movement, you will find that frustration is their driving force. Frustration, though, doesn’t arise solely from bleak material conditions. The dockyard philosopher argued that “Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.” He points out in the years leading up to both the French and Russian Revolutions, life had in fact been gradually improving for the masses. He concludes, “It is not actual suffering but the taste of better things which excites people to revolt” and that “The intensity of discontent seems to be in inverse proportion to the distance from the object fervently desired.” Personally, I saw this when I first arrived at Yale. I recall being stunned at how status anxiety pervaded elite college campuses. Internally, I thought, “You’ve already made it, what are you so stressed out about?” Hoffer, though, would say these students believed they had almost made it. That is why they were so aggravated. The closer they got to realizing their ambitions, the more frustrated they became about not already achieving them. Hoffer’s conceptions of frustration highlight how if your conditions improve, but not as much or as quickly as you’d like, you will be vulnerable to recruitment by mass movements that promise to make your dreams come true. In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, “When inequality is the general law of society, the most blatant inequalities escape notice. When everything is virtually on a level, the slightest variations cause distress. That is why the desire for equality becomes more insatiable as equality extends to all.” For Hoffer, this insatiability cultivates frustration—a nebulous, simmering emotional state that can be harnessed by any ideology. He describes what has now become known as the “Tocqueville effect”: A revolution is most likely to occur after an improvement in social conditions. As circumstances improve, people raise their expectations. Societal reforms raise reference points to a level that is usually not matched, eliciting rage and frustration. In addition to the fact that reality seldom matches expectations, frustration also originates in a deep sense of dissatisfaction within oneself. We see this in the rise of social movements across the U.S., where individuals across the political spectrum feel disillusioned by their current situation, leading to a strong desire for dramatic change. Hoffer argued that mass movements consciously attempt to cultivate and exploit frustration among their members. This helps to fuel their existence. The promotion of frustration is not incidental but is in fact the result of competition: movements that effectively nurture frustration outperform others by attracting and retaining the most fervent members. In a passage that is reminiscent of today’s idea of the “horseshoe theory” (political extremes have more in common with one another than with moderates), Hoffer wrote that, “When people are ripe for a mass movement, they are usually ripe for any movement...In pre-Hitlerian Germany, it was often a toss up whether a restless youth would join the Communists or the Nazis.” Indeed, the official figure from the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party was that fifty-five percent of their members were former communists. According to Rudolf Diels, head of the Gestapo in 1933-1934, the actual figure was seventy percent. According to The True Believer, the shared factor among extreme mass movements is not ideology or practice but a shared hatred for the present and a yearning for a (subjectively defined) utopian future. In the marketplace of ideologies, the dogma that is most effective at harvesting emotional discontent often prevails. The danger of mass movements lies in their ability to manipulate these frustrations. Hoffer argues that these movements purposely foster frustration and dissatisfaction, pushing their members further into their cause. This, in turn, deepens their commitment, keeping them in a state of perpetual discontent and thus, devotion to the movement that promises to liberate them. The formula goes something like this. Mass movements that are good at what they do make previously content individuals frustrated and further frustrate their adherents while pretending to advance the movement. This means that the strongest mass movements are inevitably going to be the ones that are the best at not delivering the goods. Any movement that actually advances the interests of its frustrated supporters will make them less frustrated. Hence, they’ll stop being members. A core aspect of Hoffer's argument is that the root of frustration lies not just in external circumstances or “the system,” but fundamentally in the burdens of being an individual. Outsourcing decisions about your life to the movement comes as a relief. While practical organizations (e.g., an employer) cater to self-interest and offer opportunities for self-advancement, a mass movement appeals to those who wish to escape or camouflage an unsatisfactory self. Mass movements hold the implicit promise of fulfilling the desire for self-renunciation. When people feel their lives are meaningless, they seek meaning by telling others what to do with their lives, a key feature of many mass movements. One sentence in the book summarizes the idea: “Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.” The book goes on, “A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people’s business.” Hoffer's concept of “substitution” elaborates on this theme. He suggests that individuals dissatisfied with their own self-image often substitute their identity for that of a larger group. Those who join mass movements often feel that their lives lack meaning because they cannot derive satisfaction from their current actions or circumstances. They seek fulfillment in something that extends beyond practical acts in the present, leading them to mass movements. In one of the book’s most famous passages, Hoffer wrote “Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents...Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never without a belief in a devil.” For mass movements, hatred serves a useful purpose. It’s the glue that binds the disgruntled members together, turning them into a focused, potent force. The collective enemy helps maintain an atmosphere of constant alertness. It does not only keep the followers united, but it also attracts new members who share similar fears. Hatred fosters an atmosphere of persistent threat that can never be entirely overcome. Hoffer writes that “in a mass movement, the air is heavy-laden with suspicion…the faithful strive to escape suspicion by adhering zealously to prescribed behavior and opinion…strict orthodoxy is as much the result of mutual suspicion as of ardent faith.” This is consistent with modern notions of the enforcement of popular social norms. A widely-cited paper from 2009 proposed that people coerce one another into adhering to disliked norms to show that they themselves have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. Indeed, some individuals might be especially prone to enforcing unpopular norms because they are worried that others will regard them as insufficiently sincere. In a notable historical illustration of a mass movement using a “belief in a devil” as a limitless source of ideological fuel, consider the case of the “Recalling Bitterness” campaign in Maoist China. In the 1960s, the communist dictator Mao Zedong grew worried that ordinary Chinese citizens were developing lukewarm attitudes about the socialist revolution. In response, the regime forced people into rituals in which they publicly announced how bad life was before they had been liberated. Mao ordered writers and artists to rewrite history through the lens of class struggle to suit the needs of his political agenda. Regime officials held meetings encouraging peasants to describe how much better life was now compared to pre-liberation, hoping to convince them that the revolution’s successes outnumbered its failures. The “devils” here were reactionaries, landlords, rich farmers, and counterrevolutionaries. Documenting the rituals of the Recalling Bitterness campaign, the historian Guo Wu has written, “Only poor peasants were allowed to speak; former landlords and rich peasants were silenced.” Rewriting history to demonize selected groups is an effective way to promote unity within a mass movement. For Hoffer, the deliberate cultivation of fear and hatred serves to justify increasingly terrifying levels of cruelty and violence. The individual, convinced of his or her guiltlessness, relinquishes agency to the movement. This is yet another example of escaping the burden of the self. These activities, Hoffer proposes, often manifest as futile tasks that seem to address problems but in fact accomplish little of substance. Rather than confronting the system they oppose, mass movements often end up targeting irrelevant figures or groups, engaging in meaningless protests, or turning on each other. Ironically, because the movement accomplishes so little, they ultimately give rise to increased fanaticism. This leads to further persecution in the quest to find a scapegoat to hold accountable for the failures of the movement. A strong community can counter the attraction of mass movements. When people feel a sense of belonging, this can guide them away from falling into the trap of large collectives that dissolve individual identities. In our modern world, where traditional forms of community are fraying, and many feel unfulfilled by their work, the appeal of mass movements is amplified. Such movements thrive on shared frustrations. Mass movements are not exclusive to the modern age. The True Believer, written in the mid-twentieth century, suggests that modernizing forces provide a fertile ground for their proliferation due to the lack of meaningful work, a sense of community, and an overarching sense of meaning in life. Community is a safeguard against frustration. Hoffer suggests that those who see themselves as part of a close-knit group are less likely to be attracted to mass movements. The sense of accountability that comes from being part of a community and the reciprocal actions required to sustain membership counters the urge to lose oneself in a larger collective identity. The book points out that although mass movements can be seen as a kind of community, they differ in that they require only belief and identity, rather than reciprocal obligations and accountability. In addition to membership in a cohesive community, engaging in meaningful work provides a buffer against radicalization. This is one reason why mass movements attempt to undermine the value of work, or claim that anyone who earnestly and unironically participates in the system is a victim of false consciousness or propaganda or has somehow been duped. The aim is to position the members of the mass movement as those who are truly “in the know,” and to undermine their targets’ confidence and turn them into potential recruits. The True Believer advises against supporting organizations without clear, attainable objectives. The dockyard philosopher reminds us that we should be skeptical of mass movements without clearly defined goals. Often, the ostensible aim of large movements is some nebulous idea of improvement.

LIKE (28) REPLY 1 reply Assistant Village Idiot 23 hrs ago An excellent summary. I use the term \"foxhole friends\" to describe the believers that leaders of mass movements are looking for - followers that will stick with you even when you are wrong. After all, anyone can be a supporter and send money or tell others how great this new way is when it's right and you can give evidence for it. But the supporters you really want are the ones who will believe you when you are obviously lying, or argue for your position when it is patently foolish. As for the various revolutions and movements coming from those who already have a great deal, I noticed this in college. I doubt I was smart enough to have come up with the idea myself. More likely, someone who had read Hoffer made the observation to me and I was ready to hear it. The complaint about \"the 1%\" from 10-20 years ago came from the 5-20% - or their children, who feared they were not going to make it that far and needed to declare the system rigged and unfair.

Somehow I had never read it.It is shocking how so many replies are hostile or defensive. The author (or the author the author is citing) isn&#x27;t even claiming that movements are bad, or giving any qualitative judgment (e.g. citations about equal rights or the American revolution as if they&#x27;re counterpoints somehow seem off the mark), just noting the qualities of most movements and the environments in which they occur. If you&#x27;re looking to engineer a group for some cause, even if the cause is ostensibly good, this is a good how to guide. reply dkobia 14 hours agoparentIt is extraordinary. Much of the hostility stems from the fact that most are distilling the article from the perspective of their tribe and somehow feeling attacked which is ironic considering the material.The “frustration” echoed in the book and article is real. Most people today have had a taste of the things they didn’t know they wanted and more apt to join a movement. reply Retric 19 hours agoparentprevThis isn’t an overall guide to engineering a group for a cause so much as how to gather strength running a movement.The green revolution and smallpox elimination operated very differently than something designed to create a regime or gather political power in a democracy.Movements that have a truly profound impact in human history operate rather differently. Compare say the Age of Reason with Communism and they both caused revolutions, but first had a far more long term impact while the second had more zest. reply tetrep 21 hours agoprev> “Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.”I think the elephant missed here is the focus on what we have or do not have instead of a focus on what we can attain. Mass movements are created and accelerated by the thought that things can be achieved through them. Regardless of how much you currently have, a mass movement is appealing if it offers you hope to get things you otherwise couldn&#x27;t. If you think violent revolution will bring you immortality, that&#x27;s a \"pretty good deal\" and you might want to take it. It&#x27;s no surprise that many religions heavily depend on this for controlling and gaining followers.Being limited by your imagination, I think, is the driving force behind \"your situation improves and then you revolt.\" Your situation improving can transition you from a hopeless \"this is always how it will be (suffering)\" to a \"hey, things can change\" mindset, which allows you to hope for and potentially even fight and die for a better future. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you have, it matters what you can get. reply brutusborn 6 hours agoparentI think both ideas are consistent: movements gain momentum when you seem to lack one thing because the psychology is “we have good things A B and C, why can’t we have D?” People who don’t have anything just dream for A, so a movement promising them D isn’t effective. reply JKCalhoun 21 hours agoprevI may be reading it a bit defensively, but the article seems to be trivializing mass movements; \"Oh it&#x27;s just the middle class griping because they don&#x27;t have a private jet.\"That mass movements coincide with a period of \"betterment\" is an interesting way to try to understand the civil rights and equal rights movements in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s. When the classes are no longer merely struggling to put food on the table they can rise up and demand something better than separate but equal education. And the comfortable and educated middle class white population had nothing to lose by joining those causes.At the same time if there is a growing frustration among the masses now I have no doubt it is being fueled by a wealth inequity that seems to shower all the accolades of life on a very select few. And not just private jets and private islands but exemption as well from the laws that govern the rest of us.Unlike many of my progressive friends, I understand the root frustration of the MAGA crowd and see something there that we are all frustrated about — those of us on both (all) sides.(As an aside, I discourage friends and family (and any who will listen) from having anything to do with any movement that embraces violence — whether on the \"right\" or \"left\". Because I believe any successful movement that relies on violence to succeed will then rule with violence. Not cool.) reply shigawire 20 hours agoparent>Unlike many of my progressive friends, I understand the root frustration of the MAGA crowdAfter hundreds of think pieces about this, I think very few progressives don&#x27;t understand the root frustrations here.

It was even predicted that the Treaty of Versailles would be ruinous. Although I am sure someone will disagree, it&#x27;s hard to see how there were many improvements to life prior to about 1920 for German people that would cause frustration in the way described.

I&#x27;ve been part of a cult during 15 years, and I do recognize patterns in all other radical organizations and movements. One of the most striking is having a common enemy, often a fictitious one on closer inspection. reply jl6 21 hours agoparentDo you mean to say you were in a cult for 15 years and found a way out? Can you share which cult, and how you escaped? reply janwillemb 13 hours agorootparentYes, I have been part of one from age 17 to in my 30s. I don&#x27;t want to appear in search results by mentioning the name literally, but it is a Scandinavian-based religious cult. I found a way out very slowly by connecting to other people with different ideas. It started with coaching from a psychologist and, funny enough, volunteering in a homeless community. Homeless people don&#x27;t really care about me or what I think, which was very liberating. My wife grew up in the cult, and her father was one of the leaders. This made it difficult for her, but she shared my doubts and we were lucky we could do this process of leaving together. Other couples divorced on these things. We lost nearly all contact with her family, but we were again lucky to being able to build a new network around us. Leaving the cult had so much impact on our lives, we could never foresee it. Which was good, because we may never have done it is we knew beforehand. It has been 10-11 years now and the dust is finally settling. I am convinced that this was the right step for us, but I can never bear the responsibility of recommending others to go this same painful path.Sorry, there is way more to this story than this paragraph.

Emacs and Org-Mode, these are groups that require you to do a public good with the idea that you&#x27;re protecting against many X&#x27;s.

Is that bad? reply Ensorceled 21 hours agorootparentprevMy hiking group, revue theatre and place of employment have no enemies at all.This is a weird way to think. reply JKCalhoun 21 hours agorootparentAgree, Quaker meeting (and probably most other&#x27;s church or religious group) is another obvious example. reply JackMorgan 19 hours agorootparentI grew up fundraising in evangelical churches and most certainly there are two common enemies talked about all the time: The Devil and The World.The World is an extremely broad catch-all term for whatever the speaker doesn&#x27;t like. It isn&#x27;t sin, which is laid out pretty clearly - lying, stealing, hate, murder, affairs, etc. The World is more like the speaker&#x27;s preferences. CS Lewis has one of his main characters decide to give up her royal heritage for makeup and pretty dresses - that&#x27;s The World. It&#x27;s not _sinful_ it&#x27;s just not what he thinks is important.The World fills an important role, because while Christians are taught that hate is a sin, it&#x27;s allowed if you&#x27;re hating The World. This gives an easy out that allows believers to hate as much as they please, as long as they call the object of hatred \"The World\" or \"Worldly Things\".Here&#x27;s brief list of things I&#x27;ve heard genuinely described as The World: guitars, drums, syncopated rhythms, atonal music, chanting, fasting (recommended in the Bible), mediation (also recommended in the Bible), sugar, staying fit, eating meat, spicy food, curry, alcohol, cannabis, bathing suits, makeup, fashion, nudity, being LGBTQA+, pronouns, sex-ed, women in sports, women in the workplace, civil rights, birth control, chemotherapy, antidepressants, antibiotics, vaccines (shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to anyone reading this), archeology (unless it focuses on Israel around 30CE), science, astronomy, therapy, TRPG games, World of Warcraft (I mean it&#x27;s right in the name!), communism, socialism, and shopping at businesses that aren&#x27;t owned by Evangelicals.Not every church says the same things are The World, but there&#x27;s definitely a lot of overlap. Generally the idea is that if it fits within the current culture of the speaker, then it&#x27;s ok. If it&#x27;s from a different culture than it&#x27;s The World.The World has recently been given a new name that will sound familiar: Woke. It&#x27;s a modern rebranding of The World into a fresh new term. The benefit is that Woke is a step removed from the religious terminology of The World, so it sounds less villainous to say it on public or broadcasts. Saying you hate The World and want to destroy it just isn&#x27;t a good look. reply xwdv 21 hours agorootparentprevYour hiking groups enemies are the people who litter the trails.Your revue theatre’s enemies are the people against the arts.Your place of employments enemy is lazy and rogue employees, or even competing employers.There are enemies all around if you are willing to find them. reply Ensorceled 20 hours agorootparentThis is very unhealthy if you really think like this.Our hiking facebook is full of pictures of the outdoors, we rarely talk about littering at all.

Anyway, \"people against the arts\" has never even come up.We fire lazy employees and our CEO regularly meets with our competitors.

If those people turn round and stab you in the back one day and leave you dead then their ideology has effectively won and yours has lost. This was how a lot of imperial empires operated, first befriending and then betraying.I would say that hiking groups definitely have enemies. Land owners are hostile to the idea of ramblers rights and in the UK they are trying to dismantle them - look at the back and forth over the right to wild camp on Dartmoor in the UK. You might not hate these people or spend any time even discussing them, but that doesn’t change the fact that they exist and they dislike you, or at least the activity that you do, on land they perceive to be theirs.Same with the arts, you only have to look at the amount of HN comments clapping their hands with glee at all the AI tech that is putting actors, writers and artists out of work. There is a sizeable portion of society who see the arts as “not proper work” and have an intense envy and hatred that people can make a living doing it.No matter what you do, you literally can’t get everyone to like you.

I simply said that the enemies likely exist, whether you are aware of them or not. I didn’t say anywhere that you should start treating everyone not in your group as an enemy.> If someone dislikes me, am I required to consider them my enemy? Is this not just a self-fulfilling prophecy towards conflict creation instead of conflict resolution?Again, I didn’t say this anywhere. You are free to treat someone who dislikes you however you wish. You could be indifferent, hostile or try to reconcile differences.The response you take will likely be based on your interest, power levels and assessment of the threat. If a person is just moaning about you in the pub you might not take much interest. If the person is a kingpin who tells you to stop or he’ll have someone kill you, now you have a decision to make as to whether you want to fight for what you’re doing or acquiesce. Of course the guy in the pub and the kingpin are two ends of a large spectrum of activity and where you choose to define enemy depends on what level of activity you personally think warrants it. Someone like Jesus might not even consider the kingpin an enemy, just misguided and unenlightened - “forgive them father for they know not what they do”. reply neon_electro 18 hours agorootparentThank you for clarifying your position(s). replyjpmoral 21 hours agorootparentprevMaybe but they aren&#x27;t necessarily a bonding factor. reply zogrodea 20 hours agorootparentprevYou have no enemies.

The fundamental problem with these movements is that in the moment it is hard to tell the useful from the destructive.

They were massively political, contained tons of completely made up lies for the sake of being sold or pushing agenda. There was no or not much expectation of objectivity or impartiality the way we project on media now.I do not mean to claim they were reason for the revolution, but more that the media as we know them now are basically tame compared to a lot that was written in the past.It takes more then just unhappiness and anger for revolution to happen anyway. The necessary condition is that the state must be weak and unable to suppress the threat to itself. You can hold people in arbitrary bad conditions for infinitely long time if you have enough power. And they won&#x27;t do revolution, because you will make it impossible. reply tchaffee 16 hours agorootparentThe parent claim is that polarization is so bad right now because of social media and the digital media.

A similar situation arose in the American South at the height of the plantation slavery system in the first half of the 19th century (of 10 million people in the US Confederacy, around 3.5 million were enslaved, and the majority of the wealth was held by a small group of plantation owner elites).Clearly, the author believes that mass movements are undesirable (since the author only references Mao and Hitler as examples of outcomes), but the French and American Revolution ushered in democracy on a large scale, which are generally good things. I suppose people who&#x27;ve been indoctrinated into belief in the superiority of the Ivy League elite schools system might think that democracy itself is unwise, and that rule by a small educated elite is preferable.

A decade later, DeSantis won them with 68%.The third reason your theory doesn’t make sense is that the most educated Hispanic groups most strongly favor republicans (at least in Florida, which has the most well developed GOP messaging to Hispanics). 40% of Cubans have a college degree, double the average for Hispanics. For Puerto Ricans it’s 30%.The exact opposite is a likelier explanation. Prevailing academic theories of race—where Hispanics are lumped together with black people as oppressed “people of color”—are offensive to many Hispanics.

It&#x27;s rather petty to vote against the better party because you don&#x27;t like their marketing, if you know they are the better party.The marketing reflects how Democrats conceptualize race, and that, in turn, drives their policies. For example, Democrats’ belief that minorities are the victims of systemic racism drives them to favor educational curricula that emphasize the structural barriers faced by undifferentiated “people of color.”But what are the effects of such curricula on minority kids? Studies show that successful people have an internal locus of control: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;melodywilding&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;succes.... I.e. they believe their outcomes are the result of their own efforts, not external factors.If you’re a Cuban, what do you want your kids to learn? That they’re “people of color” who will be held back by “systemic racism,” or that people from their cultural group went from poverty to prosperity in a single generation?

Although the origin of this failure is unclear, one candidate system involves control of emotional actions, coordinated through lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl) via amygdala and sensorimotor connections. Using structural, functional, and neurochemical evidence, we show how FPl-based emotional action control fails in highly-anxious individuals. Their FPl is overexcitable, as indexed by GABA/glutamate ratio at rest, and receives stronger amygdalofugal projections than non-anxious male participants. Yet, high-anxious individuals fail to recruit FPl during emotional action control, relying instead on dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas. This functional anatomical shift is proportional to FPl excitability and amygdalofugal projections strength. The findings characterize circuit-level vulnerabilities in anxious individuals, showing that even mild emotional challenges can saturate FPl neural range, leading to a neural bottleneck in the control of emotional action tendencies. Introduction Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and difficult to treat. This difficulty primarily stems from excessive avoidance of feared situations which prevents learning through exposure1. The ability to override these strong avoidance tendencies in favor of alternative actions involves a flexible action-selection process, known to rely on a distributed circuit revolving around the lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl) interacting with posterior parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and amygdala2,3,4,5,6,7. When people are faced with the challenge of overriding automatic emotional behaviors, such as social avoidance tendencies, the FPl coordinates that distributed circuit to guide emotionally-adaptive behavior5. The FPl involvement is mechanistically causal as well as clinically consequential: emotional action selection fails after FPl interference8, and variation in FPl recruitment predicts resilience against the development of emotional disorders later in life9. Here, we build on those insights to identify functional-, structural-, and neurochemical properties of FPl that explain variation in the implementation of neural control over emotional behavior between high-anxiety individuals and their non-anxious peers. Contemporary models of anxiety, based on rodent studies, have shown how hippocampal-amygdala afferents to agranular medial frontal areas drive avoidance of threatening situations and fear-like behaviors10,11, whereas recurrent medial frontal signals in the same circuit reduce threat-responses and allow approach behavior11,12,13,14. However, extension of those rodent-based insights to human anxiety disorders has proven difficult15,16, reflected in disappointing progress in the development of novel treatments for anxiety disorders17. Those translational efforts face a major challenge in the expansion of human granular prefrontal cortex, as compared to non-human models18,19. For instance, the neuronal organization and connectivity profile of the human FPl have no homologue in rodents nor other primates20,21,22,23. More precisely, the human FPl has access to both medial and lateral cortical circuits through its extensive connections with other frontal, parietal and temporal association areas. In addition, human FPl has direct access to information coming from the amygdala via the amygdalo-fugal bundle4,20. In contrast, macaque prefrontal cortex does not share a region homologous to human FPl, and its amygdalae project mainly to medial but not lateral prefrontal regions24,25. Accordingly, recent work has suggested that FPl is involved in selecting emotional actions by influencing neural activity in sensorimotor cortices when different alternative options are available5. Critically, recruitment of FPl when controlling emotional behavior fails in patients with emotional disorders26, and is a long term resilience factor against the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms9. Based on these findings, we reasoned that aberrant FPl recruitment might account for the difficulties experienced by individuals with anxiety in situations where they need to control emotional action tendencies. This study is set to understand whether and how FPl function explains altered control of emotional action tendencies in individuals with anxiety. We combined Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and functional MRI to capture neurochemical, structural, and functional properties of FPl during emotional action control. Examining those properties jointly is essential to explain variation in behavioral and neural indices of emotional-action control in anxious participants2,8,27. We exposed participants selected for high-anxiety to a mild emotional challenge requiring control over their emotional action tendencies, and compared that group to an existing age-matched dataset drawn from the general male population (in short, non-anxious peers6). The two groups achieved comparable success in emotional-action control, yet the anxious participants solved that challenge using Brodmann areas (BA) 9/46d (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), rather than FPl as did the non-anxious peers. This anxiety-related shift in the frontal circuit supporting emotional-action control was complemented by neurochemical and structural differences in the FPl of the two groups. Namely, the FPl of anxious participants had higher neuronal excitability, as indexed by GABA/Glutamate ratio, and stronger amygdalofugal projections, as indexed by MR-tractography. Furthermore, stronger amygdala connections, in the context of reduced FPl neuronal responsivity, significantly accounted for the anxiety-related shift towards those alternative control circuits in the frontal lobe. Together, these findings identify a circuit-level neural vulnerability in anxious individuals, opening the way to targeted interventions for enhancing control of emotional action tendencies6. Results Participants were selected for high anxiety (high-anxiety group; N = 52; 14 males, score > 30 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS, Fig. 1A, B). They were compared to a convenience control group of participants recruited and reported on earlier6 who were not selected based on anxiety scores (non-anxious peers; N = 41; all males). Comparison of these groups on an independent metric of trait anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI, Y-2), showed that the high-anxiety group was indeed more anxious as compared to their non-anxious peers, t(84) = 5.5, p  30 (dashed line), achieving a balance between sensitivity and specificity for detecting anxiety related disorders97. B LSAS-based selection resulted in a between groups difference in trait anxiety: t(84) = 5.5, p  congruent trials) activates bilateral FPl (in orange; highlighted by dashed black circle; congruent>incongruent in blue). However, the high-anxiety group does not show the neural congruency effect in FPl (bottom panels; w.b.c. whole brain corrected, n.s. non significant). A Bayesian analysis provided moderate evidence for the absence of a neural congruency effect in the FPl of the high-anxiety group (BF01 = 4.2). D There are differences in neural congruency effects between high-anxious and non-anxious in dorsolateral frontal cortex [24 30 34]. E Whole-brain search for a negative correlation between anxiety score and neural congruency effect across both groups showed an effect in the FPl, supporting the suggestion that more anxious participants recruit FPl less when controlling emotional behavior. Scatterplot depicts extracted t-values from this cluster and their relationship with STAI scores for interpretative purposes. Full size image fMRI measurements obtained during task performance across groups (Fig. 2C) show that controlling emotional action tendencies increased activity in bilateral FPl [32 54 4; −30 56 8] and decreased activity in bilateral sensorimotor cortex [42 −26 68; −32 −26 68]. Full list of coordinates is described in supplementary materials (supplementary tables 1–3). These effects confirm previous independent fMRI findings28,29 and isolate a spatially distributed neural circuit supporting the control of automatic emotional action tendencies and selection of affect-incongruent alternative actions. Separating this analysis for non-anxious and high-anxious participants showed significant FPl activation in non-anxious (already reported in ref. 6), but no statistically reliable neural congruency effect in the FPl for high-anxious participants, suggesting that they might rely less on FPl for control, Fig. 2C. To assess this possibility, we used Bayesian t-test to clarify potential absence of FPl recruitment in high-anxious individuals in the specific FPl territory recruited in healthy controls (Fig. 2C black circles). The Bayesian t-test confirmed this observation, providing moderate evidence for the absence of this effect in the high-anxiety group, BF01 = 4.2. There was no interaction between group (high vs non-anxious) and neural congruency in FPl when correcting for voxels across the whole frontal cortex. A second finding of this study concerns between-groups differences evoked during emotional-action control. High-anxiety participants had stronger neural activity for incongruent versus congruent trials in BA area 8B / area 9/ area 46D [24 30 34] as compared to their non-anxious peers, Fig. 2D, corrected for multiple comparisons over all voxels in the frontal lobe. This suggests that anxious individuals shift emotional-action control to frontal cortex located dorsolateral and posterior to the FPl used by the non-anxious group. Additional exploration of a parametric relationship between anxiety scores and neural congruency effects supports the notion that trait anxiety reduces reliance on FPl during emotion-control. Namely, participants with higher anxiety scores (across both groups) showed reduced neural congruency effects in FPl (max z = 4.24, p = 0.0004; [40 56 −4], Fig. 2E, corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain). Interestingly, across both groups, those participants that recruited FPl the least, relied most on dlPFC, ρ(91) = −0.22, r = 0.038, again suggesting that dlPFC compensates for reduced recruitment of FPl. Behavioral congruency was also differentially related to neural congruency in dlPFC between groups b = 0.11 [0.02 0.19]. Namely, in the high-anxious group, neural congruency effects in dlPFC correlated negatively with behavioral congruency; ρ(50) = −0.28, p = 0.04, whereas this is not the case for the non-anxious participants, ρ(39) = 0, p = 0.98. Anxious participants have a more excitable FPl Next, we tested whether neurophysiological and structural traits could explain the reduced FPl engagement observed during emotion control in high-anxious participants. We reasoned that the observed between-group differences could reflect reduced functionality of the FPl in the anxious participants. Reduced FPl functionality could emerge from weak responses, i.e. lower excitability and connectivity of this region. Alternatively, this region might have tonically high excitability and strong amygdala input, such that even mild emotional challenges could saturate its neural range30,31. Therefore, we used MRS and DWI to measure indices of excitation/inhibition balance and of structural connectivity, respectively. We acquired MRS scans from right FPl (Fig. 3A), left SMC and left occipital lobe (Supplementary Fig. 2). The first two locations are known to support the implementation of emotion control3, and the latter location provides a control region. Left SMC was selected because it has been shown to be under FPl control when selecting affect-incongruent movements with the right hand3,6. Within each region, we extracted estimates of GABA and Glx, a proxy for glutamate levels, and calculated an index of neural excitability (GABA/Glx ratio32). In FPl, local GABA/Glx ratio was lower (less GABA as compared to Glx; more excitability) in the high-anxiety group as compared to their non-anxious peers, t(88) = 2.3, p = 0.02, suggesting that the high-anxiety participants had a more excitable FPl (Fig. 3A, right panel). This was not the case in SMC and occipital cortex, both t  0.19, supplementary fig. 2, indicating that the differences in GABA/Glx between groups are anatomically specific to FPl and not a consequence of whole-brain changes in excitability. The GABA/Glx ratio in FPl was also related to behavioral indices of emotion control, differently for the high-anxiety and non-anxious group (three-way interaction between behavioral congruency (congruent vs incongruent), group (high-anxious vs non-anxious), and FPl GABA/Glx ratio, b = 0.19 CI [0.1 0.28]). Post-hoc comparisons (Fig. 3B) show that non-anxious participants with more excitable FPl had better control over emotional action, ρ(38) = 0.47, p = 0.0025 (Fig. 3B, in green). Importantly, this relationship is reversed in the high-anxiety group ρ(48) = −0.29, p = 0.036, an indication that high-anxiety participants with more excitable FPl had less control over emotion action (Fig. 3B in red). Behavioral congruency effects were also related to the GABA/Glx ratio in SMC, but only in non-anxious participants with more excitable FPl (Fig. 3C; four-way interaction between behavioral congruency (congruent vs incongruent) * group (high-anxiety vs non-anxious) * FPl GABA/Glx * SMC GABA/Glx, b = −0.1, CI [−0.21 −0.0002]). This interaction complements earlier findings using the same experimental paradigm, showing that FPl interacts with left SMC to implement control over affect-incongruent actions that are performed with the right hand3,6. Finally, neural congruency effects in SMC correlate with FPl excitability for the non-anxious group, but not for the high-anxiety group (effect of congruency * group * FPl GABA/Glx ratio in left SMC [−20 −20 66], whole-brain corrected, Fig. 3D). Taken together, these MRS data suggest that anxious participants rely less on previously established long-range FPl influences over SMC for controlling emotional actions3,27. Fig. 3: Behavioral and neural indices of emotional-action control differentially depend on lateral frontal pole (FPl) excitability for high-anxiety versus non-anxious participants. A Average right FPl voxel location quantifying GABA/Glx ratio (top N = 90), representative trace of MRS signal residuals (middle, in black), and corresponding MRS spectrum (bottom, in black) with LCmodel fit (in red). Excitability is higher for high-anxious individuals (less GABA relative to Glx) in FPl (t(88) = 2.3, p = 0.02; two-sided test, asterix represents p  0.16. Combined, these results suggest that the ratio between GABA and Glx is important for FPl-based emotional action control, and that it is specifically the ratio between inhibition and excitation in FPl that is different in high-anxious as compared to non-anxious individuals. Anxious participants have stronger amygdalofugal projections to FPl To test whether structural amygdalo-frontal connectivity changes contribute to altered FPl emotional-action control in highly anxious, we acquired DWI. Specifically, we quantified the strength of amygdala projections to the frontal cortex via the amygdalofugal fiber bundle4. This measurement is grounded on previous work showing that a substantial portion of variance in behavioral emotional control is accounted by the strength of structural connections from the amygdala to FPl27. There are three main findings. First, amygdalofugal bundle projections to the frontal pole were stronger for high-anxious participants than for their non-anxious peers, t(90) = 3.3 p = 0.0014, Fig. 4A. Second, this between-group difference was anatomically constrained to FPl and area 46 (t(90) = 3.0, p = 0.0027), since the between-groups difference did not extend to amygdalofugal projections to the medial prefrontal cortex (medial frontal pole; BA 24 and 25) i.e., other regions innervated by the amygdalofugal bundle, (all (t)  0.28; Fig. 4C). Third, the relationship between amygdalofugal anatomy and behavioral indices of emotional control changed between the two groups (three-way interaction between behavioral congruency * group * DWI, b = 0.14, CI [0.02 0.26], Fig. 4B). In the non-anxious group, the strength of amygdalofugal projections to FPl showed a positive relationship with the behavioral congruency effect, ρ(39) = 0.27 p = 0.04 (one-sided test; this group was part of the replication sample in27). In contrast, emotional-action control in high-anxious participants was not related to the strength of amygdalofugal projections to FPl, ρ(49) = −0.22 p = 0.12. These observations are supported by differential correlation between amygdalofugal projection strength and neural congruency effects. Namely, in sensorimotor and medial prefrontal cortex, there are between group differences in the relationship between amygdalofugal-FPl projections and neural congruency effects (supplementary figure 3B). Whereas non-anxious participants show strong correlations between amygdalofugal tract strength to FPl and neural congruency in SMC, high-anxiety participants show correlations between amygdalofugal tract strength and congruency effects in mPFC [0 50 2] and ACC [0 38 22], an effect that is not observed in the non-anxious group, supplementary figure 3B. Fig. 4: Amygdalofugal projections to lateral frontal pole (FPl) differently support emotion control in non-anxious versus high-anxiety participants. A High-anxious participants (in red) have stronger amygdalofugal projections to as compared to their non-anxious peers (in green); t(90) = 3.3 p = 0.0014, two-sided test, asterix represents p  10) and full-width half maximum provided by LCmodel. Signal quality was good in FPl, and very good in SMC and occipital cortex87. Based on signal quality from FPl we excluded one participant from the non-anxious group (CR = 46, snr = 6) and two participants from the high-anxious group (CR > 36). All analyses of FPl and SMC data were performed on the remaining participants. Control analyses using GABA/Glx ratio extracted from occipital cortex contained 38 participants in the control group and 50 in the high anxiety group. For this region, four participants were not measured due to time constraints, one was removed based on bad quality data. Overview of the MRS data quality is presented in Table 1, example MRS spectrum for FPl is depicted in Fig. 3 and example spectra for all regions are depicted in supplementary figure 2A. Table 1 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy data quality assessment Full size table Analyses – behavioral responses For all behavior analyses we focused primarily on differential error rates between the congruent and incongruent condition, because those have been most strongly linked to both individual differences in structural and functional properties of the FPl system under investigation6,8,27. Reaction time analyses are reported in the supplementary materials. Those behavioral metrics were related to the GABA/Glx ratio extracted from FPl, SMC, and occipital MRS-voxels using Bayesian mixed effects models and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Follow-up analyses also considered the strength of amygdalofugal connections to FPl. Bayesian mixed effects models were implemented in R 3.5.3 using the brms package88. We considered two factors; Group (high-anxious versus non-anxious) and Emotion control (congruent versus incongruent). Follow-up analyses of behavioral performance considered models that also included GABA/Glx estimates or amygdalofugal connection strength to FPl. Given that previous studies have shown that FPl is involved in implementing control over emotional action tendencies27,28,29,65 and that it does so by interacting with SMC3,6 we first set out to assess whether the ability to control emotional action tendencies depends on local FPl and/or SMC inhibitory tone. To test for regional specificity, we also implemented a model regressing behavioral congruency effects against GABA/Glx estimates acquired from the occipital cortex. All models included random intercept for participants and random slopes for the behavioral congruency effect. This model adheres to the maximal random effects structure89. Outputs of these models are log odds with credible intervals (“b”). In these analyses an effect is seen as statistically significant if the credible interval does not contain zero with 95% certainty. Significant interactions were further characterized by using Pearson correlation coefficient with Bonferroni correction over the three regions (MRS analyses). Analyses fMRI – preprocessing fMRI images were analysed using FSL 6.0.0 (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Images were motion corrected using MCFLIRT90, and distortions in the magnetic field were corrected using TOPUP91. Functional images were rigid-body registered to the brain extracted structural image using FLIRT. Registration to MNI 2 mm standard space used the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT. Images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian 5 mm kernel and high pass filtered with a cut-off estimated on the task structure. Independent component analysis was run with a pre-specified maximum of 100 components92; these components were manually inspected to remove potential sources of noise. Analyses fMRI – GLM First and second level GLM analyses were performed using FEAT 6.00 implemented in FSL 6.0.0. The first-level model consisted of twelve task regressors: Approach angry, approach happy, avoid angry and avoid happy trials were modelled separately for each of the three stimulation conditions (for details on stimulation conditions see Bramson et al. 2020a). In each regressor, each event covered the time interval from presentation of a face until the corresponding onset of the joystick movement. Estimated head translations/rotations during scanning (six regressors), temporal derivatives of those translations/rotations (six regressors), and MR-signals in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (2 regressors) were included to the GLM as nuisance covariates. Emotional control effects were estimated by comparing incongruent trials (approach angry and avoid happy) to congruent trials. First level models of the two separate sessions were combined using Fixed Effects analyses implemented in FEAT. Whole brain group effects and their relationship to GABA/Glx ratio’s in FPl and SMC, and amygdalofugal connections to FPl were assessed using FLAME 1 with outlier de-weighting93, making family-wise error corrected cluster-level inferences using a cluster-forming threshold of z > 2.3. This threshold provides a false error rate of around 5% when using FSL’s FLAME 194. In both whole brain and ROI analyses we used standardized GABA/Glx ratio’s extracted from FPl and SMC as regressors. GABA/Glx ratio extracted from occipital cortex was used in a separate control analysis. Analyses – diffusion Diffusion data was preprocessed using FSL FDT 3.0 (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Susceptibility artefacts were estimated using TOPUP using additional b = 0 volumes with reverse phase coding direction91. Data were then corrected for potential distortions during eddy currents and movement by using the EDDY tool95. Crossing fibers were estimated using BedpostX with default settings96. We reconstructed the amygdalofugal pathway using FSL’s ProbtrackX tool using waypoint and exclusion masks by4. In brief, a seed was placed in the white matter punctuating the extended amygdala and substantia innominata: MNI: [−7 3 −9]. Tracking was constrained by using an all-coronal waypoint mask at y = 22. Tractography was further constrained to exclude CSF and across hemisphere connections (which are not part of the amygdalofugal pathway), and not allowed to extend caudally from the seed location, up to the y = 25 coronal plane. Connection strength was normalized and log transformed within each participant. Next we extracted the total amount of times the tractography entered the FPl based on the white-matter border masks provided by20. These values were compared between groups and used as regressors in behavioral and neural congruency analyses on reaction time and percentage correct using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Analyses – statistics Statistical models testing behavioral congruency effects across and between groups, and derived models adding covariates were run in a step-wise fashion. We first compared correct responses between congruent and incongruent conditions between the different groups: Group (non-anxious vs high-anxious) * congruency (congruent vs incongruent). We then extended this model in two iterations by adding estimates of excitability in a 4-way interaction: Group*congruency* FPl GABA/Glx * SMC GABA/Glx. Amygdalofugal tract strength was added in a separate three-way interaction: Group*Congruency*amygdalofugal tract strength. Significant interactions were assessed by interpreting lower-level interactions resulting from these same models, or post-hoc Spearman correlations. Full models and results for the most important interactions are presented in supplementary table 4. Correlations between neural excitability and behavioral congruency for the different groups were Bonferroni corrected for the three regions of interest. Analyses on functional MRI effects were cluster corrected using a cluster-threshold forming threshold of z > 2.3 controlling either for all voxels in the brain (whole brain analyses) or all voxels in the frontal lobe. Spearman correlations were calculated in matlab2020b (www.mathworks.com). We ran several additional models including a six-way interaction model containing all major parameters of interest to explain behavioral congruency. The model explained correct responses based on congruency(congruent vs incongruent) * Group (non-anxious vs high-anxious) * FPl BOLD congruency * dlPFC BOLD congruency * FPl GABA/Glx * amygdalofugal-FPl tract strength. This approach yielded interactions between congruency*Group*FPl GABA/Glx and Congruency*Group*dlPFC BOLD. Interestingly, splitting up this model did give significant interactions between congruency*group*FPl BOLD, suggesting that estimates of FPl GABA/Glx, FPl BOLD and amygdalofugal-FPl connectivity explain partly overlapping variance between participants.

It may also go hand-in-hand with motivating heightened deliberation. I can see how one can fall into regressive patterns like distracting ourselves away from critical path actions, especially if a particular person only uses one of two strategies, 1) try going on as before or 2) try forgetting we need to go this way.I take a more neutral approach on the finding and don’t yet assume this is something that is best medicated out of. They show that even mild emotional challenges can saturate FPl neural range, which to me is simply a greater sensitivity that can be easily overloaded (like when you put the voltmeter on a more sensitive setting). Exposure Therapy is a methodical, deliberate, routine heavy strategy. ET doesn’t simply get us to re-engage, it gets us to re-engage with new and different behavior, which may be essential to success. reply psychphysic 7 minutes agoparentThe paper suggests rTMS to disrupt the disruptive activities.The emotional challenge in this study was that you had a joystick and sometimes you pulled that joystick towards you when you saw an unhappy face. That&#x27;s what was paralysing emotional challenge was for highly anxious people. Meaning it&#x27;s unlikely their PFI could have any control in real life scenarios.Cognition is hard work and the truth is you can reason about your entire life and expect much success. Like driving a car as a learner your whole life, I remember the first driving lesson I had, I couldn&#x27;t even focus with the radio on.Think of the absence of fpi as a lack of intuition you get once you learn to drive.CBT +&#x2F;- an SSRI for 6months is a small price to pay to regain intuition. reply impulser_ 5 hours agoprevSo from my understanding. Anxious people are so anxious that they overload the part of the brain that typical deals with anxiety so the brain routes it to another part of the brain to deal with it and that part of the brain isn&#x27;t what you want dealing with it so it cause problems.So the key is too limit overloading the part of the brain that deals with anxiety, which probably means doing things you are fearing to do so that you no longer fear doing it.I could be wrong, but that my understanding of it. reply otikik 1 hour agoparent> doing things you are fearing to do so that you no longer fear doing it.Careful with that assumption. I can see it completely backfiring. Doing the thing repeatedly can end up increasing the anxiety. If this route is taken, then \"the thing\" must be introduced very gradually and from a place of security.As an example, for an arachnophobe, it would starting with something like \"draw a dot. Draw a line coming out of the dot. Keep drawing lines up until 8. Pay attention to your anxiety levels and remind yourself that this is not a real spider, only a drawing. You are in control, you are safe\". Then progressing to pictures of cartoon spiders, then the first picture of the most cute realistic spider that one can find, and so forth. It would be a process that takes months and it&#x27;s not guaranteed to work. For example, a realistic depiction of a spider might be too much to handle even with a gradual approach.On the other hand, if you tell that person \"Close your eyes and open your hand. There, I put a tarantula in your hand, you see, it&#x27;s innocuous!\" that person is going to be scared of spiders for life.I&#x27;m exaggerating, but hopefully it sends the point across. reply amelius 2 hours agoparentprev> So the key is too limit overloading the part of the brain that deals with anxiety, which probably means doing things you are fearing to do so that you no longer fear doing it.I gave this advice in the past, but I know people with social anxiety disorder for whom this approach does not work. reply ddmf 1 hour agorootparentI have social anxiety and pushing myself to get out there leads to massive fatigue which makes me not want to go out and do that again, it can lead to a vicious cycle. reply antman 50 minutes agorootparentprevHas two parts: Meeting with people, interacting with people. One step at a time, a couple of people, for a specific timeframe. reply bluepizza 50 minutes agoparentprevAs a life long anxiety sufferer, I identify with your interpretation.My anxiety devolves into panic attacks if I try to deal with it consciously - self talk, rumination, avoidance. But it goes into a dormant state when I don&#x27;t engage with it consciously and just let it be. reply psychphysic 2 hours agoparentprevMore accurately multiple parts of the brain are activated when considering anxious situations.In anxious people the FPI is unable to override the avoidance behaviours.The key is not to limit overload you don&#x27;t have much choice there, it&#x27;s to use other mechanisms to make your seek exposure and not continue avoidance.CBT is all about teaching those skills the paper mentions TMS. reply yosito 27 minutes agoparentprevIf your interpretation is correct, it seems that there could be some truth to the old wisdom of (gradually and willingly) facing our fears in order to develop more courage. reply eliasmacpherson 2 hours agoparentprev> doing thingsI believe this is done in supervised fashion in Exposure and Response Prevention, and also CBT. Some say ERP violates the Hippocratic Oath part about &#x27;do no harm&#x27;.I found the mockery of it in GTA SA quite entertaining [1]. In my own experience, it&#x27;s probably best to talk to a therapist before forcing yourself into doing things you are fearing.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gta.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inversion_Therapy reply esperent 36 minutes agorootparentPhysiatrists and psychologists don&#x27;t take the Hippocratic oath in most cases. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even that common for doctors to take it - definitely not in it&#x27;s original \"do no harm\" form. reply guerrilla 1 hour agorootparentprevIt violates the Hippocratic oath as much as cutting somone open for surgery does. That is to say, it doesn&#x27;t at all. reply xboxnolifes 2 hours agoparentprev> So the key is too limit overloading the part of the brain that deals with anxiety, which probably means doing things you are fearing to do so that you no longer fear doing it.Which is pretty much the go-to advise for a lot of people with anxiety as far as I&#x27;m aware. reply jjallen 3 hours agoparentprevWhat if there are things we are fearing to do but shouldn’t be doing also? reply weird-eye-issue 2 hours agorootparentFear and anxiety are very different reply nottrobin 2 hours agorootparentHow so? reply poszlem 1 hour agorootparentFear is an immediate, emotional response to a known or definite threat.Anxiety is a more prolonged emotion that arises from an anticipated or potential threat or a situation that&#x27;s uncertain. Unlike fear, the source of anxiety might not be real or immediate. reply lloeki 1 hour agorootparentFrom my experience, the way I&#x27;d describe it is:- fear is transient, you feel it in the moment and then it goes away. You can then remember \"boy I was scared\" and feel the memory of fear but not fear itself. You can project and imagine a situation where you&#x27;d be scared.- anxiety is a persistent state of stressful anguish. There are peaks and troughs. During peaks it can be overwhelming and look like, trigger, or mix with fear. During troughs anxiety is still there somewhere deep, it merely takes a backseat to other emotions. In every moment it biases every process your mind undertakes. reply lionkor 3 hours agorootparentprevThen usually you shouldnt have a need to do them, and if you feel like you do, that might be the problem to address. reply NayamAmarshe 5 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s always fear, isn&#x27;t it?We&#x27;re afraid to approach people, afraid to ask for help, afraid that someone might react in the worst possible way or something really bad might happen.But obviously, it never happens the way we imagine. Reality is 100% of the time, different from our imagination and yet, many of us still fail to remember that.Every good opportunity that I ever got, was from me coming out of my comfort zone and avoiding to avoid situations.It&#x27;s important to remember, anxiety is a useful defense mechanism, but not 99% of the time. reply mindwok 4 hours agoparentAs an anxious person with people-pleasing tendencies, something I&#x27;ve been trying to focus on is reframing the situation and removing fear entirely. For me, fundamentally the fear of social interactions comes from the fear I&#x27;m going to do something wrong, that person will react badly, and I&#x27;ll feel bad about myself. I&#x27;ve realised this entire calculus is broken, because you feel good or bad based on people&#x27;s reactions which is something you cannot control.Instead, I&#x27;m trying to focus on feeling good or bad based on my intentions, and seeing people&#x27;s reactions as merely a feedback loop to better align my actions with my intentions. It has been difficult but I think it is slowly working. reply NayamAmarshe 4 hours agorootparent> Instead, I&#x27;m trying to focus on feeling good or bad based on my intentions, and seeing people&#x27;s reactions as merely a feedback loop to better align my actions with my intentions.This is the way. People might disagree, but I&#x27;ve noticed that our intentions really do influence the outcomes because our intentions affect the way we approach problems (Kinda like Wave function collapse). My world is a mere reflection of who I really am, what I really think and what I meditate upon. reply mindwok 3 hours agorootparentYes, I completely agree. Instead of being upset with outcomes (like how people react to me in interactions), there&#x27;s three things I&#x27;ve been trying to instead focus on: Am I at peace with my core values? Do my intentions align with those values? And finally, do my actions align with those intentions. If something bad has happened, and those three questions are a &#x27;yes&#x27;, then you have no reason to feel bad because you&#x27;ve been completely true to yourself and this occurence is something outside your control. If it&#x27;s a &#x27;no&#x27;, then you probably need to do some reflection and figure out where in that chain something is going wrong. reply nyanpasu64 1 hour agorootparentIf you say something unpleasant to a boss or someone else with the power to hurt you in life, even if it is aligned with your values (like enforcing boundaries or refusing unethical tasks), you may get fired, lose your income and destabilize your future safety, and have every reason to feel bad about your situation. reply mindwok 12 minutes agorootparentI see your point but I’d argue that if you feel bad about this it means your core value is actually financial stability over sticking to your principles at any cost, and in that case your actions and intentions didn’t align with what you truly value. reply frereubu 21 minutes agorootparentprevEpictetus would add that you need to act in accordance with \"nature\", by which he meant the world as it is, including human behaviour, not as we want it to be. In this case \"nature\" would include the behaviour of the boss and you can act accordingly, knowing that if you challenge them you may suffer repercussions. reply mpol 1 hour agorootparentprevStill you might think, I did the best I could. replyvoisin 5 hours agoparentprev“I&#x27;ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.” - Mark Twain reply Obscurity4340 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve weirdly noticed a type of analagous mechanism in relation to anxiety where I castastrophize or engage in worst-outcome thinking and when things inevitably turn out ok, the relief from the incongruity has a somewhat \"euphoric\" and calming effect.

This hit me a few weeks ago when I was considering a long workout class ln Peloton. I was hesitant to hit the start button because it was late, I was tired, etc. Then I realized that it was genuinely harder to hit play than to actually do the class.Literally I&#x27;ve done thousands of workouts and have never regretted one, yet every time there&#x27;s this negotiation to not do it.

Because this reads and feels backwards to me. Maybe it is a recipe for people without motivation, and that is fine. But I, for one, am mostly driven by motivation. I dont do things just because they are written on a list, or because someone told me it is supposedly good. I do things because I am intrinsically motivated to do so, or not. Just performing an action in hope of positive affirmation to boost motivation feels like the algorithm to drive a robot, not a human. reply scruple 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s sort of a meme but I experience this pretty frequently with running.

It&#x27;s always the right decision, I always feel incredible once I get going, but it&#x27;s sometimes very hard to summon the motivation at the onset. reply dotnet00 4 hours agoparentprevAt the same time, as someone very prone to this kind of behavior, with siblings with similar issues to talk to, we&#x27;ve all found that few attempts at helping are more frustrating than being told \"just remember that you don&#x27;t need to be anxious\". The entire point is that in the moment that just doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s kind of like telling a person with ADHD to just pay attention. reply imartin2k 2 hours agoparentprevYes most of human behavior is about fear - just that we mostly aren’t aware of it. Almost everything is a coping strategy for fear - some constructive, others destructive. Some people end up with more of the constructive ones, others with more of the destructive ones. The way to have some control over this is mindfulness, to practice being aware of the fear whenever it comes, and then of the habitual response. And then to practice responding differently if one doesn’t find one’s habitual response constructive. reply prawn 3 hours agoparentprevAlways comes back to uncertainty.

Everyday situations in our ancestral past were legitimately dangerous so in that context it paid to be excessively cautious. reply clnq 1 hour agorootparentYes, but we are one proverbial red button away from nuclear hell on Earth no ancestor could have prepared for, where a lot of anxiety will translate into a lot of lives being saved. So we’re not too far from being adapted to the modern world.It’s just that temporarily things are going well - there are no famines, no lawlessness, and no wars. As soon as we return to chaos even a bit, all those thrifty genes and anxious genes won’t be so maladaptive.There doesn’t even need to be a world-ending scenario. Just go live outside an urban center, among wild animals, and all these genes will help you. reply Obscurity4340 4 hours agorootparentprevIts honestly getting to that point though, and, depending on the robustness of your support network and economic situation, it can actually get that bad or worse. reply madaxe_again 4 hours agoparentprevA little anxiety is a good thing. It’s the nagging feeling that maybe you should complete that pre-flight checklist.I forecast a lot of doom, but try to bother only with the dooms I can prevent or mitigate. This is useful for going “I should replace that pipe before it bursts” or “I should fill up on gas here as it’s 300km to the next station”.Where it goes wrong is doom we either cannot control at all, or cannot control without inflicting greater dooms - what someone else might think, whether the sun will rise tomorrow.I feel we are trained (thanks, marketing. Thanks, social animals) to sensitise ourselves to a great many fears, most of which are beyond our control, and it does us little good.Case in point: a little over a week ago I was having apoplectic paroxysms over the amount of stuff I have to do at home before winter - foundations to dig, brush to clear, firewood to gather. Then, a forest fire ripped through our land, which was somewhere in my mind as “definitely one day, probably not today, don’t sweat it, but have a plan”. The former anxiety I was letting grow out of all proportion - so fucking what if I don’t dig foundations this year? No deck. Boo hoo.The latter, if I’m honest, occasionally kept me up at night, and occasionally hovered around the edge of my field of imaginary view, like a particularly irritating fly, but after I would reassure myself that we had go-bags packed, that we had the ability to run without hesitation, it would subside. It’s that whole agency thing - being able to take what actions you can to alleviate an anxiety. If there’s no meaningful action to be taken, it’s a useless anxiety, best forgotten.If anything, more positives have emerged than negatives - the fire service fixed our road, which we’d been begging the council to do for years, the flammable brush is cleared, and we discovered we have a great many friends.Sometimes it takes the manifestation of one of our anxieties to remind us what is and what isn’t worth worrying about. Watching a friend or family die also has the desired effect - but unfortunately from experience, it isn’t permanent, and we (I mean I) seem to need a slap in the face from time to time to remind us what matters. reply sgregnt 5 hours agoparentprev> \"Reality is 100% of the time, different from our imagination\" A bit of a hyperbole: 100%? So never ever we can predict reality? I think, if we focus on the core details, we are better than always wrong, perhaps even much better. reply NayamAmarshe 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what I meant. Even if you imagine a scenario you can successfully predict (a cashier handing you your change, for example), how it plays out in experience is always different.Anxiety causes you to imagine how a scenario would play out, in detail. Flashes of things going wrong, something breaking apart and all the terrible things that a horror movie director could imagine. reply DoreenMichele 2 hours agoprevIf you suffer from serious anxiety, I highly recommend you work on any health issues you have. Low blood sugar in particular is known to promote anxiety by increasing the amount of adrenaline in your system.I used to suffer a lot of anxiety. Getting physically healthier helped mitigate that enormously.Proviso: n=1, \"anecdata\" and the usual dismissals that random internet strangers desperately try to apply as if I somehow misrepresented myself and claimed it was from a large scale study. reply dathinab 1 hour agoparentThere is nothing to dismisshealth issues can both directly and indirectly make your psychological issues worse (or even be the direct cause of it)and also the other way aroundI think many of the \"dismissal\" (assuming non troll) comments come from with health issues people being feed up with getting the force feed the same advice they long time now every time their health comes up without the person giving their advice understanding their health issues. (e.g. not you because you just wrote what helped you in a neutral way).For example some absurd examples I have seen repeatedly:- a person with serve enough clinical depression to just be a step away from getting suicidal getting told \"just do sports it will help\" for the thousands time in a situation where they frequently have issues to even eat because their brain just stopped caring about being hungry- or a person with motion sickness from certain games being again and again told the same set of well known and years ago tried advice, potentially combined with \"you must never try VR\" even through they did try VR and depending on the title it&#x27;s not an issue as long as movement in VR is done through motion tracking- or a person which had to stop their masters degree because of sever depression and anxiety being told \"oh it&#x27;s you could have done the masters because I was able to do so\" when that other person just had a mild depressive phase due to overwork- or people which had Vitamin-D deficit (which is really good at making other health issues worse) now insisting that every time they meat a \"sick\" person they should take Vitamin D supplements because sure their trauma induced psychological issues are just a Vitamin D deficiency.Just to be clear I appreciate your your post, this is not trying to dismiss it in any way. In different to many of the examples I listed you bothered to formulate it neutral in a \"this helped me, fixing health issues can help, here is why it helped me if you thing this could apply to you why not try it\" way instead of a \"this helped me so it &#x27;must&#x27; help you too way\". Through the line between both formulation is thin, and not seldom a matter of tone which is often lost in writing. reply yosito 34 minutes agoparentprevNot to mention that physical activity itself can be a great, immediate remedy for anxiety.

But one thing I am curious about: during exposure, you don&#x27;t have access to your frontal cortex, that makes sense. But after exposure, do you spend any time reflecting, and reminding yourself that nothing bad actually happened to you? It might be that exercising your frontal cortex afterward could help you learn to cope with the situation in the future. At least, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done with social anxiety and it seems to help. reply jaynetics 2 hours agoparentprevNot a psychologist, but you might need to build exposure more slowly, and maybe check for other issues (such as generalized anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder, hypochondria) because a panic attack should not take months to recover from. reply petesergeant 30 minutes agoparentprevThe Claire Weekes stuff is pretty old but very very good, worth looking up reply throwing_away 4 hours agoparentprev> Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed.

The electro-chemical map of the brain that is built and used to study it, is so primitive.Almost certainly, \"the brain\" tunes itself to its environment and inner states from a preformed inner structure through evolution. A lot of what is in the brain, is not actually to be found in the brain, or by studying it materially. The \"formwork\" that formed it, is lost in evolutionary time.Unfortunately there is no way to impute the formwork from the form, like say it would be possible to (mostly accurately) impute what formwork created a square column or cast a piece of iron.\"The brain\" is not in any way shaped like a physical object, and the formwork that formed it is infinitely complex. reply otikik 1 hour agoparentThe brain is absolutely physical.> A lot of what is in the brain, is not actually to be found in the brain, or by studying it materially.You are talking about consciousness (and perhaps the non-conscious processing that the brain does as well). That is indeed a non-physical phenomenon, but it still has physical underpinnings.> The \"formwork\" that formed it, is lost in evolutionary time.You can&#x27;t lose something that you never had in the first place :). It will take that as a figure of speech.The good news are: we are very familiar with some things that \"exist\" but don&#x27;t have a physical presence. On this forum, \"software\" is the most obvious one. \"Math\" is probably the second. There&#x27;s many others, like all the emotions, entropy, and so forth. We can, to a certain degree, reverse-engineer some of these processes by looking at the physical imprint that they leave. It&#x27;s true that we never get a full picture - the same way that just looking at the source code might not give you a good idea of how the RAM will look like when the program is executing. But it can give you some insight. And then, if you are lucky, you may be able to fill in the gaps.The bad news: this is the most imbricated and complex piece of \"code\" that the humanity has ever faced. Our brains might simply not be capable of understanding their own complexity by themselves. Most of us have a \"cache\" of 7 items, after all. Barely good enough to swing to the next tree branch.But then again some good news: the complexity is definitely not infinite- just very big. And we keep improving our tools. The same way some of them expand the limits of what we can physically do with our bodies, some of them expand what we can mentally do with our brains. Wether or not that will be enough for us to understand ourselves, to a certain definition of \"understand\", is still up in the air as far as I&#x27;m concerned.

And that we can&#x27;t fix, because it isn&#x27;t really broken. I mean compare it to a bit far fetched example: Water spill ways. Especially on a larger scale they always come with drawbacks and you can&#x27;t fix that. What you can change is stuff like how you wire up the spill way (e.g. when and which gates opens when) or e.g. how likely they need to be engaged (by upstream changing things), or how well you (as a city) cope with whatever drawbacks the specific water spill way has.

A mystery unfolded when a cabinet full of Kodachrome slides was discovered lying on the sidewalk in a San Francisco neighborhood. The 920 Kodachrome slides shows San Francisco in the 1960s undergoing changes as the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system was built, the subway beneath Market Street was constructed, as well as fascinating photos of daily life in the Californian municipality. One of the mystery slides shows a section of the BART Tube segment being constructed. Top Stories 01:12 Ricoh Opens Up About its Pentax Film Camera Project and More Market Street under construction for the new BART and Metro subways, circa 1966. In fact, there was not just one cabinet stuffed with Kodachrome slides — there were three. But only one of them found its way to local photo collector David Gallagher who could not believe the treasure trove one of his social media followers had brought to him. “I was knocked out,” Gallagher tells the San Francisco Chronicle. “People bring me stuff and it’s not always great. But these were pretty amazing — things I’d never seen before.” Where Did the Kodachrome Slides Come From? Initially, Gallagher had no clue who the mysterious photographer was or how the slides had come to be dumped on a random sidewalk. The local historian even put up flyers appealing for information on the whereabouts of the two other cabinets and who the photographer is. But after the Chronicle published their article this weekend, a relative of the photographer stepped out of the shadows to reveal that his father, a schoolteacher by the name of James Martin, was the author of the photographic slides. “He loved San Francisco. He lived here his entire life, all 90 years,” Ted Martin tells the San Francisco Chronicle. “He was a big sports fan: Giants, Warriors, 49ers. He worked hard. He did his day job and then did night school and other things for extra money.” Swimmers in Fleishhacker Pool which closed in 1971. Martin, who died in 2019, would take photos and transfer them to film reels so he could make slideshows which he would use in presentations. However, the Kodachrome slides were dumped on the street by another of Martin’s sons who had “purged” the cabinet — a decision that wasn’t popular with the rest of the family. While Gallagher is glad to know the identity of the mystery photographer, there is still the matter of the two other cabinets that are missing and presumably chocked full of Martin’s fascinating photos. It’s not the first time Kodachrome slides have appeared on a sidewalk, back in 2016 a bag of them turned up in New York City. If you have any information regarding the missing cabinets, head over to Gallagher’s website, SFMemory.org.

In the 70s you can see faster film become available to filmmakers. This let them move out of the studio with more outdoor footage instead of large studio lights and hand-held instead of being locked on a tripod or crane.

I have ended up collecting vacuum tubes and I almost weep at stories of warehouses of them being junked. There have been plenty of other things like comic books, LPs, cameras, etc. that faced a similar fate. And while I would never argue that collections of these things are all that important in the grand scheme of things collecting is fun and brings enjoyment.

And sometimes older people don&#x27;t even know what markets exist. My father collects some things but has never ever used ebay for example. Plenty of collections might be valuable internationally but not valued locally.Also in my experience the best collections are for the love of it - collectors often don&#x27;t care about the value and often don&#x27;t even know the value. They might care about rareness or uniqueness but not $$$ directly.Also the value of many collections is unknown until far in the future. reply wrp 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m an oldish guy with older friends and have dealt with this problem several times. If you have a cherished collection of something, it&#x27;s very unlikely any of your heirs will be willing to put effort into finding a good home for it unless they can get significant money for it (which is also very unlikely).You are the best person to find a recipient for your collection. Do it while you still have your wits. Strongly consider having the transfer made while you are still alive, so it doesn&#x27;t have to go through probate. Don&#x27;t let your heirs maintain unrealistic expectations of how much they could get for selling the stuff. reply susiecambria 8 hours agoparentprevThis.My uncle (Uncle Bill) was fascinated with actors and ended up being good friends with a lot. He took pics and slides for years and years and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences asked for them. Well before he died he packed up a significant portion of his collection and sent them off. After he died, we gathered more and sent them out.Now that my mother is moving in with me and we are cleaning out, yet again, and packing, I&#x27;ve found more slides. Some were from Uncle Bill and others were from my father&#x27;s side of the family. I had never seen them before. Kinda cool, but not something to keep. So I bundled them up with several other items and off to the historical society they went. Over the past three years, I&#x27;ve shipped probably 10 boxes of all manner of stuff. Family bibles, mortgages, pictures, diaries, correspondence, etc. I&#x27;ve been told that some students have been helping catalog and have found the diaries and correspondence, in particular, interesting. What they were reading was written by my aunt (who married a professor of philosophy and member of the International Red Cross) as she traveled with my uncle, Colonel, around the world.So glad they are being taken care of and are of interest to at least a few. reply androidbishop 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m reminded of Jack Donaghy on 30 Rock giving away his prized cookie jar collection to Kenneth, the only person he found that would appreciate it. reply abhayhegde 7 hours agoprevKodachrome slides have a different color tint that makes them look real and incredible.

Thanks for linking! reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentKodak was always primarily film company, their camera business was an afterthought and fourth tier. reply wrp 6 hours agorootparentprevRegarding just color slide film, I think Kodak had stopped all production then resumed with just Ektachrome in 2018. reply ImPleadThe5th 2 hours agorootparentI was reading an article that they were scaling down all of their color film production, and then the mini-renisance happened right during&#x2F;after Covid and they have been having a hard time scaling back up ever since. reply anta40 4 hours agoparentprevNot yet, for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petapixel.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;kodak-specially-manufacture...Also, since the price of color negative films are slowly rising, some enthusiasts use Kodak Vision-based films (which is based on cinema film). reply xdennis 2 hours agoparentprevBankruptcy is not the same as going out of business. They restructured and still produce color film and slide film, but not Kodachrome. It was a very sophisticated film which could only be processed in a specialized lab and they couldn&#x27;t stay open with low film demand.There&#x27;s a documentary about the last Kodachrome roll developed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DUL6MBVKVLI . Very sad. reply wglb 10 hours agoprevShades of Vivian Maier https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vivian_Maier reply squarefoot 4 hours agoprevAs far as I know, slides tend to degrade over long time. I&#x27;ve seen some becoming crap in less than 40 years, so it may be advisable to scan all of them. As I also have inherited a big number of them, probably twice the number contained in that cabinet, I&#x27;d ask if anyone can suggest an automatic scanner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. reply highwaylights 4 hours agoparentI’m a layman and know very little about this but for one big job like this wouldn’t you be better off paying a specialist lab to scan these for you if it’s a one time thing? reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentScanning mounted slides, cleaning them and adjusting in post is a very manual job. Going through a large collection is going to cost you. reply ginko 3 hours agoparentprevKodachrome archives a lot better than E6 process slides. reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentYup we&#x27;re talking archival quality for couple of centuries if kept in the dark. Modern E6 is decent but earlier films and especially older Ektachrome processes fade badly. reply kmill 6 hours agoprevI&#x27;m now remembering a couple hundred slides I saw scattered on the sidewalk and street on Cesar Chavez near Sanchez in early 2020. I picked up a couple to take a look, but I can&#x27;t recall what they were of anymore... reply selimnairb 8 hours agoprevThe quality of film and Kodachrome in particular is stunning. So much information captured that the scans look great on a modern hi-DPI display. reply woodruffw 12 hours agoprevBeautiful pictures. I would have loved to have shot Kodachrome before Kodak stopped manufacturing it; the closest we can get today is Ektachrome (which has also been reformulated over the years). reply fidotron 12 hours agoparentIt is kind of funny just how different Kodachrome and Ektachrome look though. To me Ektachrome seems cold while Kodachrome always looks like the 1970s in spite of the fact it was preferred by archivists because it remains stable in storage so well.Velvia was another film stock that seemed to have an outsized personality. reply shrubble 11 hours agoparentprevI still have some Kodachrome slides and when you get the exposure right, and the scene is within the dynamic range ... it&#x27;s something quite magical! Should scan them and put them online sometime... reply whyenot 11 hours agoparentprevKodachrome required a lot more equipment and chemicals to develop. There used to be a Kodak processing plant in Palo Alto on Page Mill Road. As a high school student, I applied for a job there and got a tour. I just remember a lot of equipment in dimly lit rooms. It was a big facility. I didn’t end up getting the job and ended up working as a page at the pubilc library. reply ghaff 12 hours agoparentprevEktachrome got a lot better over the years (starting with around the Lumiere era in the 90s) and, really, it was Kodachrome 25 that was special--which was obviously ridiculously slow by modern ISO standards.Always like KC 25 a lot more than the colors of Fuji&#x27;s Velvia which while nominally ISO 50 was really about the same effective speed. reply dingaling 12 hours agoparentprevYes the saturation, detail and dynamic range is stunning. Digital is great in its own way, but never quite achieves the &#x27;look&#x27; of slide. reply woodruffw 12 hours agorootparentYeah. It&#x27;s all in the eye of the beholder, but I find Kodachrome&#x2F;Ektachrome&#x27;s saturated colors very aesthetically pleasing, while similarly saturated digital photographs come off as sterile and overly processed (the kind you&#x27;d see on a hotel&#x27;s website). reply parenthesis 10 hours agoparentprevThe other day I found an unused Kodachrome film I&#x27;d forgotten I had. Kodachrome 64 is my all time favourite film. reply gadders 11 hours agoprev\"Yeah, we found them in this weird old Armory place.
