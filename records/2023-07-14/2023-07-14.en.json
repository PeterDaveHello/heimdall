But that hype will come at a cost.Obsession with passkeys are about to turn your security keys (yubikeys, feitian, nitrokeys, ...) into obsolete and useless junk.It all comes down to one thing - resident keys.What is a Resident KeyTo understand the problem, we need to understand what a discoverable/resident key is.You have probably seen that most keys support an 'unlimited' number of accounts. This is achieved by sending a \"key wrapped key\" to the security key. When the Relying Party (Authentication Server) wants to authenticate your security key, it will provide you a \"credential id\". That credential ID is an encrypted blob that only your security key can decrypt. If your security key can decrypt that blob it yields a private key that is specific to that single RP that you can use for signatures.\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510      \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 Relying Party \u2502   \u2502   \u2502  Browser   \u2502   \u2502  \u2502 Security Key \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518             \u2502              \u2502              1.

Credential ID's as key wrapped keys are secure since they are encrypted with aes128 and hmaced. This prevents them being tampered with or decrypted by an external source. If aes128 were broken and someone could decrypt your private-key in abscence of your security key, they probably could also break TLS encyrption, attack ssh and do much worse. Your key wrapped keys rely on the same security features that TLS relies on.How does userverification factor in here?Another frequent question (or confusion) is that a credential needs to be resident to enforce userVerification. That's not the case! Your device can assert not just presence by touch, but that it's really you holding the device by internally validating a PIN or biometric. This is governed by the userVerification flags which are seperate to residency. This allows your device to be \"a self contained multifactor authenticator\". Very cool!Resident Keys and Your Security KeyNow that we know what a resident key is, we can look at how these work with your security keys.Since resident keys store their key in the device, this needs to consume space inside the security key. Generally, resident key slots are at a premium on a security key. Nitrokeys for example only support 8 resident keys. Yubikeys generally support between 20 and 32. Some keys support no resident keys at all.The other problem is what CTAP standard your key implements. There are three versions - CTAP2.0, CTAP2.1PRE and CTAP2.1.In CTAP2.1 (the latest) and CTAP2.1PRE you can individually manage, update and delete specific resident keys from your device.In CTAP2.0 however, you can not. You can not delete a residentkey without resetting the whole device. Resetting the device also resets your master key, meaning all your non-resident keys will no longer work either. This makes resident keys on a CTAP2.0 device a serious commitment. You really don't want to accidentally fill up that limited space you have!In most cases, your key is very likely to be CTAP2.0. For example some manufacturers like yubico, they're keys CTAP version is defined by their firmware version. I have multiple yk5 series keys that have different levels of CTAP support.So Why Are Resident Keys a Problem?On their own, and used carefully resident keys are great for certain applications. The problem is the hype and obsession with passkeys.In 2022 Apple annouced their passkeys feature on MacOS/iOS allowing the use of touchid/faceid as a webauthn authenticator similar to your security key. Probably quite wisely, rather than calling them \"touchid\" or \"credentials\" or \"authenticators\" Apple chose to have a nicer name for users. Honestly passkeys is a good name rather than \"webauthn authenticator\" or \"security key\". It evokes a similar concept to passwords which people are highly accustomed to, while also being different enough with the 'key' to indicate that it operates in a different way.The problem (from an external view) is that passkeys was a branding or naming term of something - but overnight authentication thought leaders needed to be on the hype. \"What is a passkey?\". Since Apple didn't actually define it, this left a void for our thought leaders to answer that question for users hungry to know \"what indeed is a passkey?\".As a creator of a relying party and the webauthn library for Rust, we defined passkeys as the name for \"all possible authenticators\" that a person may choose to use. We wanted to support the goal to remove and eliminate passwords, and passkeys are a nice name for this.Soon after that, some community members took to referring to passkeys to mean \"credentials that are synchronised between multiple devices\". This definition is at the least, not harmful, even if it doesn't express that there are many possible types of authenticators that can be used.Some months later a person took the stage at FIDO's Authenticate conference and annouced \"a passkey is a resident key\". Because of the scale and size of the platform, this definition has now stuck. This definition has become so invasive that even FIDO now use it as their definition.Part of the reason this definition is hyped is because it works with an upcoming browser feature that allows autocomplete of a username and webauthn credential if the key is resident. You don't have to type your username. This now means that we have webauthn libraries pushing for residentkey as a requirement for all registrations, and many people will follow this advice without seeing the problem.The problem is that security keys with their finite storage and lack of credential management will fill up rapidly. In my password manager I have more than 150 stored passwords. If all of these were to become resident keys I would need to buy at least 5 yubikeys to store all the accounts, and then another 5-10 as \"backups\". I really don't want to have to juggle and maintain 10 to 15 yubikeys ...This is an awful user experience to put it mildly. People who choose to use security keys, now won't be able to due to passkeys resident key requirements. What will also confuse users is this comes on the tail of FIDO certified keys marketing with statements (which are true with non-resident keys) like:Infinite key pair storageThere is no limit to the number of accounts registered in [redacted] FIDO\u00ae Security Key.To add further insult, an expressed goal of the Webauthn Work Group is that users should always be free to choose any authenticator they wish without penalty. Passkeys forcing key residency flies directly in the face of this.This leaves few authenticator types which will work properly in this passkey world. Apples own passkeys, Android passkeys, password managers that support webauthn, Windows with TPM 2.0, and Chromium based browsers on MacOS (because of how they use the touchid as a TPM).What Can Be Done?Submit to the Webauth WG / Browsers to change rk=preferred to exclude security keysRather than passkeys being resident keys, passkeys could be expanded to be all possible authenticators where some subset opportunistically are resident. This puts passwordless front and center with residency as a bonus ui/ux for those who opt to use devices that support unlimited resident keys.Currently there are three levels of request an RP can make to request resident keys. Discouraged, Preferred and Required.

It is not out of the question that browsers could implement this change externally, but that would in reality be down to the chrome team to decide.Insist on your Passkey library setting rk=discouragedRather than rk=required which excludes security keys, rk=discouraged is the next best thing. Yes it means that android users won't get conditional UI. But what do we prefer - some people have to type a username (that already has provisions to autocomplete anyway). Or do we damage and exclude security keys completely?Contact FIDO and request RK storage as a certification featureCurrently FIDO doesn't mandate any amount of storage requirements for certified devices. Given that FIDO also seem to want resident keys, then they should also mandate that certified devices have the ability to store thousands of resident keys. This way as a consumer you can pick and select certified devices.Something Else?If you have other ideas on how to improve this let me know!ConclusionThe hype around passkeys being resident keys will prevent - or severly hinder - users of security keys from choosing the authenticator they want to use online in the future.",

With this year\u2019s version, we\u2019re delivering much more than just another yearly release. Supernova represents a modernized overhaul of the software \u2013 both visually and technically \u2013 while retaining the familiarity and flexibility you expect from Thunderbird.\u201cSupernova is the beginning of a new era for Thunderbird,\u201d says Ryan Sipes, Thunderbird\u2019s Product and Business Development Manager. \u201cIt lays a beautiful, solid groundwork for future releases that will make Thunderbird a significantly better email client \u2013 and we won\u2019t stop until it\u2019s the best option out there.\u201d\u201cDuring the past year we reworked some of the oldest parts of our code base with the goal of modernizing them to make maintenance and extensibility easier,\u201d says Alex Castellani, Thunderbird\u2019s Director of Product Engineering. \u201cWe did our best to strike a comfortable balance between new features and interface changes to appeal to new users, while maintaining the current layout and interface that millions of our users know and love. This is the first step towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable Thunderbird that will accommodate different needs, preferences, and workflows.\u201dHere\u2019s a brief look at some of the best new features and improvements in Thunderbird 115. For the complete list, please visit this support article.Modernized Cards View(Mockup, subject to change)Supernova\u2019s new Card View is our version of the well-known vertical layout for the Message List, perfect for people used to modern webmail. Card View emulates a mobile interface list with multi-line support, offering a more comfortable appearance to reduce cognitive burden. (And because we want Supernova to feel familiar for veteran users, the legacy \u201cTable\u201d view is still available.)Brand New Thunderbird LogoSupernova ships with a brand new Thunderbird logo honoring our history and vital connection to Mozilla, while representing the revitalization of our brand and a promising, sustainable future.New Thunderbird AppMenu \u2261Dynamic Unified ToolbarSupernova features a single dynamic toolbar, presenting frequently used and contextual options based on the tab or Space that is currently active. Take full control by customizing the toolbar and window layout to perfectly fit your workflow.Intuitive AppMenuThe new Application Menu (\u2261) in Supernova is now keyboard-accessible, and redesigned for faster, easier navigation. Fewer submenus, persistent global options, and consistent iconography combine to create a much more intuitive experience.Improved Calendar Design(Mockup, subject to change)As part of an ongoing effort to modernize and upgrade Thunderbird\u2019s Calendar, Supernova introduces an improved \u201cmini-month\u201d layout, improvements to the day/week/month grid, a pleasing color palette, and several more minor changes.Elegant Density ControlChange your density setting and font size easily from the new AppMenuWorking with multiple monitors and display resolutions? Supernova lets you dial in the perfect density settings and font sizes for the entire application, with just a single click from the AppMenu.New + Sortable Folder ModesSupernova gives you more control by introducing sortable Folder Modes. Display all of your Tags in the Folder Pane, turn on and off Local Folders, or move your favorite Folder Mode sections up and down with one click. Less scrolling, more productivity.Eye-Catching Tags ViewTags are a familiar and powerful part of your workflow, so Supernova adds an eye-catching \u201cTags\u201d view to the Folder Pane. Quickly jump to your custom, color-coded tag categories to find and filter your messages even faster.Improved Address BookSupernova continues to iterate on the modernized Address Book introduced in Thunderbird 102. You\u2019ll enjoy a new tabular view, an improved Edit view, delete buttons, and better accessibility.Better AccessibilitySpeaking of accessibility, Supernova substantially improves Thunderbird\u2019s keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility across the entire application. We\u2019ve also greatly expanded the ability to navigate Mail content and buttons using the TAB and arrow keys.More To Come\u2026Supernova is constantly evolving. Throughout the next year, we\u2019ll deliver many improvements to existing Supernova features and introduce brand new ones, including Thunderbird Sync. Upgrade to version 115 and experience the future of Thunderbird!How To Get Thunderbird 115 \u201cSupernova\u201dAs with any major release, we sometimes become aware of corner cases after significant public testing. The Thunderbird team will wait to enable automatic updates until we\u2019re confident no such issues exist. We\u2019ll keep you posted right here, and on social media platforms. (Existing Thunderbird 102 users will continue to see security updates during this time). On Linux, the timing of this release and subsequent automatic updates may be determined by your distribution\u2019s maintainers. If it\u2019s convenient for you, we recommend installing the Thunderbird Flatpak from Flathub, which is now packaged and maintained by the Thunderbird team. (Please note that 115 is not live on Flathub at time of publication, but as always we\u2019ll keep you updated.)If you don\u2019t want to wait for an automatic update, Thunderbird 115 is also available to download directly at thunderbird.net for Windows, Linux, and macOS.Want to visualize the differences between 102 and 115 at a glance?

I\u2019m a longtime TB user and since few years I install it via Flathub. I\u2019m exited to read that now the upstream is managing TB in Flathub, like Mozilla does for Firefox.My questions are, how does it works and how can I validate it? Will you build the flatpak package internally then push it to the Flathub repository (like Mozilla does), or will you take ownership of the TB-flatpak git repository [0] and keep pushing public commits to it?I see that there is an open PR [1] to update TB in Flatpak issued by EliasOfWaffle, is him a member of the TB upstream?[0] https://github.com/flathub/org.mozilla.Thunderbird[1] https://github.com/flathub/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/pull/306ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 20:57Hi and thanks for using Thunderbird! We will be building the package ourselves and pushing directly to Flathub. The build we use to make the Flatpak is simply a repackaging of the non-flatpak Thunderbird build binaries. I hope this answers your question.ReplyMirkowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 10:06Can\u2019t wait to try it! <3ReplyPersian Guywrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 11:05It\u2019s super awesome, thank you folks.ReplyMatthieu Dubugetwrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 12:16Would be nice if the essential nostalgy plug-in would be integrated\u2026In the meantime, I won\u2019t test until it will be ported to the new thunderbird version.ReplyWildByDesignwrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 12:59Excellent release. Thank you for everything.I just wanted to point out one small issue with the new icon. In Windows 11 (likely other versions as well), the Thunderbird icon on the taskbar is about 50% of the size of all other taskbar icons, including Firefox.I checked the icon resources in the binaries and it appears that the issue is that the icons have about double the amount of empty pixels surrounding the Thunderbird logo in comparison to Firefox icon and all other icons as well.Cheers!ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 20:34Thanks for pointing this out! We\u2019re already working on a fix and hope to have this resolved and shipped ASAP.Replybasteyywrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 13:02Based on the screens, I\u2019m looking forward to testing it. Thanks to all the developers for their work. I hope that the community will be satisfied with the new design. Perhaps I find enough reasons to change back from eM Client and Outlook.ReplyTerrywrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 13:06Can I down load today and will all my data be transferred?ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 20:33The path of least resistance is to simply wait for your client to auto-update. Auto-updates will begin rolling out as soon as we\u2019re confident there are no game-breaking bugs that slipped through.ReplyTerry Youenswrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 13:07Can I install the new version today?ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 13, 2023 at 18:12Sure, you can install it manually today! If you\u2019re using Windows or macOS, you can download 115 and install it \u201cover\u201d version 102. This will act as an upgrade.ReplyGlandoswrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 14:06Hi!Thanks for the very nice improvements, this is awesome!Just a small remark: is it possible to distribute something *else* than BZip2 archive for Linux? According to my small tests, it\u2019s bigger than 20% from either XZ (-9) or ZSTD (-19), and zstd uncompress 15 times faster than bzip2.I know backward compatibility is important, but at least XZ is 2 times faster than bzip2, and it\u2019s available nearly everywhere since a long time agoReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 20:32For Linux, we\u2019re going to encourage people to use our Flatpak packages moving forward.ReplyD A Wilsonwrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 14:27Where the heck is that \u201ccool comparison slider\u201d?ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 20:31Apologies!

I switched them to Thunderbird a year ago when I could no longer install their ancient copy of Outlook 2002 on their new PC and I still have complaints about how they hate Thunderbird because everything is different. If it changes again I will never hear the end of it.I\u2019m reasonably looking forward to it for my own use, but also hope that it is customisable enough so we can turn off annoying features like the unified inbox.ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 13, 2023 at 18:08You\u2019ll be relieved to know that 115 still mostly defaults to the layout and presentation you\u2019re used to from version 102. It takes a few toggles and changes to get the \u201cSupernova\u201d look. And we did this because we understand some of our users have been used to that general paradigm for the last 20 years.We also have no plans to retire the \u201clegacy\u201d views, although the defaults *may* change in the future.ReplyVicwrote onJuly 12, 2023 at 21:00Can you tell us more about \u201cThunderbird Sync\u201d?

There are those of us that don\u2019t care for vertical mode.Is there a proper procedure if we want to try Supernova and go back? Or does the preference get update like with regular updates and you become version locked?ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 13, 2023 at 17:59We currently have to plans to sunset the Table view.As for trying Supernova without interfering with your 102 installation \u2014 assuming you\u2019re on Windows, simply install it to a non-default directory. (Change the default option that the Thunderbird installer suggests.) This will leave 102 intact.ReplyAdamwrote onJuly 13, 2023 at 01:44Will this version be able to use something like \u201cuserchrome.css\u201d to change the color of the \u201cunread\u201d messages vs the \u201cread\u201d messages in the list?ReplyJason Evangelhowrote onJuly 13, 2023 at 18:05Hi Adam, userchrome.css is present, but we do not offer any official support or troubleshooting for it.

I can\u2019t even tell what it is about, that\u2019s how messy and weird it looks.Furthermore, I believe the reason it looks like that is because it\u2019s just way too small.

The code looks very similar to Homeworld. https://github.com/HomeworldSDL/HomeworldSDLI went to SFU, where Neall Verheyde one of the programmers from Radical lectured one semester.

Sins of a Solar Empire just got better with all of it's expansions. Same goes with most paradox games (although, they'll nickel and dime you for it).It's the blockbuster games that seem to have this problem as they always seem to dilute the game mechanics down for more cinematic experiences as time goes on. It's what happened to CoH, it's what happened with Dawn of War, it's what happened with Civilization (people will variously say 3, 4 or 5 was the peak; few list 6 as it) and it might happen with the Sins sequel.replyethbr0 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I tossed a comment above, but I think it has to do more with large publisher perspectives than the model itself. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36707943Afaik, Paradox is still small enough / left alone enough by its parent to have avoided the shenanigans. We'll see what happens if they keep growing.I also think by virtue of being niche and specific, Paradox incentivizes dev teams to stay true to the spirit of their game. I.e. no one is making a detailed 4X game because they want to sell CoD numbers. They do it because they honestly love 4X games.replyRobelius 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]For Stellaris, one of Paradox\u2019s space 4x games, they have a team dedicated to maintenance and a separate team for DLCs. The result are large free updates that improve/rework on the mechanics which compliment the DLCs keeping the games fresh for years.Usually the base paradox games feel like they\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d major features which makes some DLCs necessary for a more full experience, but by the time that happens the base game is heavily discounted so base+dlc=full price of a new game.Just felt like I have to add onto the paradox comment since I enjoy their major updates + dlc approach. Whenever I buy one of their games, I know I\u2019ll probably come back to the game for at least 5 years.replymrguyorama 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]>Usually the base paradox games feel like they\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d major features which makes some DLCs necessary for a more full experience, but by the time that happens the base game is heavily discounted so base+dlc=full price of a new game.As someone who recently played a bunch of HOI4, this is not true. Even during a summer sale, game plus DLCs that fix the \"new\" ways they changed the game is often multiple hundred dollars.They don't do this out of the goodness of their heart, they do this because it's insanely profitable to make a single game and then charge $12 for every adjustment and additional mechanic over the next ten years.It's somewhat defensible for them, because I don't need the Japan DLC for HOI4 if I don't give a shit about playing as japan, but it's still the equivalent when Civ 5 charged ten dollars to add religion back to the game and fix the dumb health mechanic that allowed you to kill any unit with ten spearmen.replypdntspa 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What makes you think that the changes that are made in SaaS are always an improvement?Sometimes that models permanently destroys something without providing users a recourse for going back.

The community for those isn't too large, though, given the somewhat niche genre. There are also some free RTS games like Beyond All Reason (though it's more similar to Total Annihilation), or some others made in the Spring engine: https://springrts.com/wiki/GamesVery few WW2 themed ones, though. I'd also mention Steel Division, the first game of which had great balance, but the second game in the series feels almost too large scale for me (like Wargame, less about micro with individual units).replySgtBastard 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Hey - thank you for Dawn of War.

Ideas that are important to more \"modern\" languages like KISS and \"nothing magic\" apply much less, as efficiency is generally more focused on. Especially in systems and embedded development.> Is this game code uniquely well written or am I often looking at the wrong codebases?I would say it's multi-faceted. Firstly, the codebases you're referring to probably aren't nearly as messy or archaic to primarily C++ developers. They just seem that way to outsiders; though there are plenty of messy codebases. Secondly, gamedev has it's own paradigms and idioms that are generally structured more agnostically and modular.That all being said, I would say modern codebases built in C++11 and newer are much \"cleaner\" for non-C++ developers with more modern idioms.replyalbertzeyer 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There are also games with lots of very hacky and ugly code. :)But I can recommend you to read the code from Quake, Doom, etc. Start with the early versions, because it's even much simpler.

I have a couple of decades in the industry, in which I\u2019ve had the honour to see quite a lot of code from many different organisations through one of my roles in Enterprise Architecture in the Danish public sector. In my completely anecdotal experience it takes quite a lot of dedication to the CI part of the development process to achieve clean code bases, and it\u2019s often not something that\u2019s going to be very beneficial in the short term. Over time, I think that most good programmers eventually ends up in a \u201creadable code is good code\u201d mantra, but it\u2019s not an easy path and a lot of the \u201cmeta\u201d philosophies that we teach programmers from their first day in programming are sort or counter-productive to writing clean code.Having gotten into programming around the millennium I\u2019m obviously mostly familiar with the OOP side of things, but many of the things I was taught in regards to OOP is still things I see CS students being taught when I do my side gig as an external examiner. Where I\u2019m from we tend to start learning OOP with a classic \u201cbird -> duck, something that flies, some bird that walks\u201d sort of thing so students can put in \u201cfly\u201d, \u201cswim\u201d, \u201cwalk\u201d and \u201csay something\u201d methods. Which is great, in theory, because in the real world (again very anecdotal) people tend to build polymorphism and inheritance in ways that eventually almost always seem to end up with code basis having been better off just writing a duck, a chicken and a ostrich instead of nesting them under a bird class. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love having basic classes to inherit from in any sort of data-modelling so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m aboard the \u201cI hate all OOP\u201d bus, my point is rather that we still teach students something that often turns out not to produce clean code. Often it\u2019ll take a long time for some of those students to get to a point where they become critical of \u201cacademic\u201d programming and many frankly never learn how to write clean code.In non-OSS you can dictate a lot of things that you can\u2019t with open source without breaking a lot of the concepts. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s wrong to demand that open source organisations make it a requirement that the only way you can build things for them is if you use their template projects in a technology they want to govern. But that goes against the principle of technology agnostics, so many will rightly not do that. If you don\u2019t, however, take control on how code is supposed to be written, then it\u2019s going to be written in a multitude of ways and I think it\u2019s very hard to avoid it becoming messy over time.Now, if you have a single project and not an organisation, and maybe you even have changing custodians, then you\u2019re likely going to end up with not only different ways of contributing but also different governing philosophies over time. Which is very democratic, and probably unavoidable, but it\u2019s also very prone to leave you with a code base that isn\u2019t easy to read because it\u2019s not actually written by a single set of \u201cclean code\u201d principles but multiple.Or in short, no, writing clean readable code is hard.replyeru 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, OOP is seldom good for writing clean code.In contrast, while far from my favourite language to write code in, I found Erlang to almost enforce, or at least strongly hint to the developer, many practices for writing clean code.replyJyaif 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Was pleasantly surprised by the comments. But while the codebase is grokkable (every line is simple), it's brittle [1].

Less so when the code is going to be used and modified for decades by thousands of people (in OS, compilers, browsers...).[1] Unchecked assumptions everywhere, #ifdef with platform specific code everywhere, singletons everywhere.

This program may be modified to acknowledge and respond to changing market conditions.\u201cWe must take every possible action to create more housing and more affordability so that Boston\u2019s growth meets the needs of current and future residents,\u201d said Mayor Michelle Wu. \u201cThis program will help us take advantage of the opportunity we have to rethink Downtown as a space where people from all over come together to collaborate, create, live, and play.\u201d\u201cThrough this conversion program, we seek to incentivize lenders, property owners, downtown stakeholders, and the State to partner with the City to increase the production of much needed housing in our downtown core,\u201d said Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison. \u201cThis public private partnership opportunity is the right tool to unlock new housing and shape a new, mixed-use neighborhood Downtown.\u201d\u201cBy converting office space into residential homes, we can fulfill the housing needs of our thriving City, while revitalizing and stabilizing our downtown neighborhood,\" said Chief of Housing Sheila Dillon. \u201cNew residents will enjoy the advantages of living in a neighborhood with many amenities, including shopping options, recreational spaces and multiple transportation hubs. This initiative aligns with this administration\u2019s dedication to creating accessible and equitable housing in every neighborhood, strengthening our small businesses and commercial centers.\u201dThe program would offer owners of commercial office buildings Downtown reduced property tax rates in return for immediately converting their buildings to residential uses. Based on studies prepared for the City as part of PLAN: Downtown, a rate reduction by up to 75% of the standard tax rate for residential for up to 29 years could provide a strong incentive to encourage conversion. This would be implemented through a public-private partnership that will enable the BPDA, the City, and the proponent to enter into a payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement. These terms were developed with the assistance of outside experts in order to make residential construction economically possible in the short term given the high cost of such conversions. These projects will also receive the support of the new Ombudsperson\u2019s office at the BPDA to help with streamlining the approvals process from other City departments following BPDA Board approval. Final program parameters will be defined when applications are made available this fall.The program is planned to be time-limited and will only accept applications through June of 2024. To be eligible, projects must comply with the proposed Inclusionary Zoning standards when approved; and the new Stretch Code\u2019s energy efficiency standards. Applicants will be encouraged to maintain ground floor retail or other public uses. Projects will be required to start construction by October 2025, and will be subject to paying any forgone taxes if these commitments are not met. In order to recoup the forgone tax revenue over time, the City will also require a 2% payment on future sales of the property.Following the release of a Downtown Revitalization Report released in October of 2022 that showed post-pandemic commercial office space vacancy rates are approximately 20 percent, Downtown neighborhood planners facilitated several conversations with developers to gather information on interest in residential conversions and possible pathways to achieve more housing Downtown. The BPDA also contracted HR&A Advisors Inc. to produce a report on the feasibility of office conversion in Downtown Boston and the Financial District. This research all suggested that partnership from the City was the only financially feasible path forward for private development to complete residential conversions. The study was conducted alongside PLAN: Downtown, the BPDA\u2019s ongoing Downtown planning initiative, a draft of which will be released in August 2023. This program furthers the Plan\u2019s goals to increase residential growth downtown and revitalize the area through a greater mix of uses while also preserving the historic urban fabric that makes Boston\u2019s Downtown so unique.The program is part of Mayor Wu\u2019s ambitious growth agenda for Boston, which is focused on advancing the City\u2019s resilience, affordability, and equity goals in order to make Boston the best city in the country to raise a family. The agenda also includes the creation of a City Planning and Design Department operating under the direction of Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison, and the appointment of Katharine Lusk to lead the newly created Planning Advisory Council which was created to coordinate planning processes across City departments. The Mayor also committed to update Boston\u2019s zoning code to create thousands of additional housing units in Boston\u2019s squares and corridors and reform the Article 80 process to increase speed and predictability for development.Share This Article:PreviousNextSubscribe to our News & Updates*indicates requiredFirst Name : Last Name :Zip Code : *Email:Get InvolvedBPDA BoardNews & UpdatesCalendarGlossaryBoston Planning & Development Agency | One City Hall Square, Boston, MA 02201Tel: 617.722.4300 Fax: 617.248.1937\u00a9 2023 Boston Planning & Development AgencyFacebook Twitter YouTube LinkedIn Instagram",

That company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was charged with fraud last year, and has pleaded not guilty.Mashinsky, 57, arrived in federal court in Manhattan for his arraignment wearing a gray polo shirt, jeans and no handcuffs.Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continueU.S. Magistrate Judge Ona Wang said he would be released on a $40 million bond secured by his Manhattan residence.\"Whether it's old-school fraud or some new-school crypto scheme, it doesn't matter one bit. It's all fraud to us,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a press conference detailing the charges.'PROFITS IN YOUR POCKET'Founded in 2017, Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after customers rushed to withdraw deposits as crypto prices fell. Many have been unable to access their funds.Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continueCrypto lenders such as Celsius grew rapidly as crypto prices surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. They promised easy loan access and eye-popping interest rates to depositors, then lent out tokens to institutional investors, hoping to profit from the difference.Celsius was among the first in a series of bankruptcies in the cryptocurrency sector last year as token prices cratered amid rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation. It filed for bankruptcy shortly after Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and rival crypto lender Voyager Digital did likewise.Mashinsky and Celsius' former chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, were charged with market manipulation of the company's crypto token, known as Cel, as well as a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the cryptocurrency and wire fraud related to the manipulation of the token, according to the indictment.People exit the headquarters of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 12, 2021. Picture taken May 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyProsecutors alleged Mashinsky also personally reaped approximately $42 million in proceeds from selling his holdings of the Cel token. Celsius was not charged.U.S. Attorney Williams said at the press conference that Cohen-Pavon is located abroad and is an Israeli citizen, but declined to comment on whether the former Celsius executive would be extradited.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued Mashinsky and Celsius on Thursday, according to a court filing, alleging he and his firm raised billions of dollars through the sale of unregistered crypto securities and misled investors about the financial state of the privately held company.The SEC, along with other regulatory agencies which also filed lawsuits Thursday, accused Mashinsky and his company of touting Celsius as safe - akin to a traditional bank - even as they took increasingly risky steps to deliver promised returns of as much as 17%.Celsius used emails with phrases like \"Pour Yourself a Cup of Profits\" and \"Profits in your Pocket\" to promote its interest-earning program.While the firm lost millions of dollars as customers raced to withdraw funds, Mashinsky and Celsius continued to claim it company was financially secure and had enough funds to meet withdrawals, regulators said.The SEC also said Celsius engaged in \"risky trading practices\" and made uncollateralized loans, despite telling investors it did not. The company also falsely claimed to have raised $50 million from its initial token sale, and claimed to have 1 million active users when in fact it only ever had around 500,000 depositors, many of whom were no longer active, the SEC said.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission also sued Celsius and Mashinsky. The FTC said it had reached a settlement with Celsius that will permanently ban it from handling customers' assets.The Justice Department entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Celsius, in which the company accepted responsibility for its role in the alleged schemes and pledged to continue cooperating with investigators, Williams said,Thursday's lawsuits add to a series of challenges for Celsius Network and its founder. In January, New York state's attorney general sued Mashinsky, also alleging fraud.The crypto industry has been on even shakier ground since the SEC sued crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase Global (COIN.O) last month raised risks of further regulatory challenges for the sector.However, the industry got some cheer in another federal court in New York on Thursday. In a landmark ruling, a judge decided Ripple Labs did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges, a win that sent that cryptocurrency's value soaring.Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington, Luc Cohen and Chris Prentice in New York and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft in London; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Michelle Price and Jonathan OatisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Luc CohenThomson ReutersReports on the New York federal courts.

This is very easy to do and will just take a few minutes. So far there are only about a dozen or so complaints filed. We can do better!!I discuss this in my latest video.Steps:1. Click this link to be taken to the FCC filing form.2. On the first line for proceedings type in 16-142 . The system will then display the text \u201cAuthorizing Permissive Use of the \u201cNext Generation\u201d Broadcasting Television Standard.\u201d Click on that to lock in the docket number. Here\u2019s what it looks like:3. Fill in your information. A US address is required and note that this will be part of the public record.4. Write your comment in the comment section. It\u2019s important to provide some detail especially how this change will make it difficult for YOU to consume over the air television.Below is what I submitted, you are free to re-purpose this for your own submission but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE. The commission values feedback on how this transition will impact consumers and each unique story helps build the case better than a form letter.I am writing in opposition to DRM Encryption being part of the ATSC 3.0 standard. Over the last several weeks broadcasters have aggressively rolled out encryption on their ATSC 3 signals throughout the United States. At the moment this restricts most currently available tuners from being able to tune ATSC 3 content.The standard\u2019s voluntary rollout began with much promise. Prior to ATSC 3 being enabled here in Connecticut I could not reliably receive ATSC 1.0 content. When ATSC 3 spun up last year I could finally receive reliable over the air signals at my home. That was until WFSB-TV encrypted their broadcast and I\u2019m now blocked from watching that station.Encrypting over the air signals goes against the spirit of serving the public\u2019s interest. Encryption adds an additional and unnecessary point of failure for receiving important information during emergency situations.There are anti-trust implications too. Encryption restricts the consumer\u2019s right to watch content from the public airwaves using tuners and personal recording equipment of their choice. With ATSC 1.0 consumers have many choices for watching and recording over the air television. With ATSC 3 only equipment blessed by the broadcasters through an arduous, opaque and expensive process will be allowed to tune content. One broadcaster, E.W. Scripps, purchased a manufacturer of tuning and recording equipment giving Scripps an advantage in the marketplace over competing products.The broadcasters have said encryption is important for copy protection or other nonsense about protection from hackers and \u201cdeep fakes.\u201d But the reality is they are trying to protect broadcast retransmission fees that now make up a significant portion of their revenue.Lawyers for the broadcasters have effectively stopped every large scale retransmission effort making encryption unnecessary to protect their broadcast exclusivity rights. What this is really about is making it more difficult for everyday consumers to watch free over the air TV in an effort to push us back onto paid subscription services.It\u2019s really important if you care about this issue to make a submission. It doesn\u2019t have to be long \u2013 just long enough for you to convey the impact that DRM encryption will have in accessing broadcasts on the public airwaves.I still plan to drop this petition off with the FCC and congressional stakeholders in person with the Antenna Man. But the more of us who tell the FCC directly the better!SHARE THIS:TwitterFacebookPosted onJuly 10, 2023AuthoradminCategoriesvideoTagsATSC 3, atsc 3.0, DRM, nextgentv",

Of course, \"cable TV\" during my lifetime has often been a type of business run, in many areas, as a sort of personal piggy-bank / for \"rents\" extraction, and not in any kind of public or consumer oriented manner at all [1]. But, really, at this point, cable is just milking as much as it can out of the generations that still are very dependent on it as it sinks into oblivion.Cable wasn't exactly great, well, ever ... but, even through perhaps about 2015, it was at least somewhat watchable. In the past few years, I've had the ... (mis)fortune of being in a household with cable (after years of only even being able to watch when I went to someone else's home). Commercials were bad enough 10 years ago. Now, they hardly show any scenes in shows / movies before there is a commercial. Movies with runtimes of 1.5 hours, will run for 2.75 hours on TV. This can be on \"broadcast\" stations as well as cable-only. The barrage of ads only drops off after about 10pm.Even worse, they now have very \"dynamic\" time slot ads, 5s ads interspersed with 15s ads etc... Plus, the ads themselves often enough feel made for the \"TikTok\" generation.Just an absolute mess.I'll never look back at TV with any deep nostalgia, though there is a bit of nostalgia for some aspects. It was never a highlight of life - like Seinfeld quips in one of his stand-ups: \"... everyone on TV is doing something better than what you are doing ... you never see someone on TV sliding off the couch with potato chip crumbs all over their face ...\" (something to that effect). But, it's really \"jumped the shark\", these days.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/obituaries/john-j-rigas-d...

Not that many channels, but as I remember it (I was very young, so it's a bit fuzzy), most channels had no commercials at all, even between programs.I haven't had cable since 2005 or so, when I canceled it. I think I got cable TV just because I assumed that was just what I was supposed to do, since I'd had it for nearly all my life. But after a year or so of living on my own, I realized I rarely watched it, and got rid of it. Haven't looked back, and I aggressively avoid being exposed advertising as much as possible. When I'm visiting family the TV is usually on in the background (with some cable channel on), and it's astonishing to me how little actual programming is there these days. Feels like mostly ads, and, as you point out, normal-length movies have their time slots expanded by at least 50% to account for ads.

Also generate keys for each node in the tree, and have the smartcard also preloaded with the keys from that customer to the root. (ie. 26 extra keys on the card - easy to store).Now, whenever a customer leaks their key, you cut that customer out of the tree and regenerate all nodes up to the root. You transmit over the air, every few minutes, all the modified keys. Each new key is transmitted multiple times encrypted with the children of that node.Now every legit keyholder either has the master key, or some set of keys that can decrypt the master key (as a combination of the keys on the card and the keys transmitted over the air). Any banned cardholders do not.Using this method, even banning hundreds of keys, there won't be more than tens of thousands of keys that need to be transmitted over the air, even though you might have 100 million cardholders.

The best I can think of is reduce the number and amount of licensed spectrum.I want there to be something left in the wireless spectrum when in maybe a few decades hopefully future humans will have a little bit more brains than us come up with a better way to allocate spectrum.Just to be clear, I am not arguing for repealing Highway Beautification.replylxgr 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Each one adds significantly more bandwidth (but worse propagation for a given transmitter power).As far as I know, that's mostly due to these bands simply having more spectrum available, in addition to actual physical propagation characteristics (lower frequencies indeed propagate a bit better across obstacles like walls or floors, and slightly better through air, but not at all through free space).In addition to that, unlicensed bands arguably work precisely because they are (by regulation) limited mostly to short-range applications, using maximum transmission power as a proxy for range. One person's signal is another person's noise, after all.There's other unlicensed bands available that are more suitable for long-range communication, but these usually come with duty cycle restrictions for the same reason.replyAvamander 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]802.11af and 802.11at are already a \"thing\", so I guess they would be useful.replybee_rider 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> If we allow broadcast television to become a subscription service, then just kill TV broadcasting and repurpose this spectrum for mobile (cellular) use.We should definitely do this, at least.

Along those lines... When I was an Amazon Product Manager back in 2020, I was tasked to work on a plan for ATSC 3.0 support in Fire TV. I actually suggested that one of the opportunities was to buy/invest in digital broadcast towers as a way of multicasting large amounts of data wirelessly. Some people in AWS were interested in the idea as well. Note - I'm talking about using the towers for one-way digital data transfer, not owning stations.Everything about my proposal - even the basic support stuff for Fire TV - was rejected wholesale and I left soon after. (In case you're wondering why Sony, Samsung, HiSense, LG and other TVs you can buy today have ATSC 3.0 support and Fire TVs don't.)

That 1mb can represent a lot of data, which ultimately gets corrupted until the next keyframe flows through.You can sort of think of it in terms of a bitmap vs jpeg. If you corrupt 40 bytes in a 1mb bitmap, no problem, it will still mostly look like the original image. However, if you turn that bitmap into a 30kb jpeg and corrupt 40 bytes, now that's a much more significant amount of the information changed.replybobdvb 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The block cipher used on broadcast doesn't have a big impact.

    "content": "This article is the second in a series that explores potential privacy vulnerabilities in Apple devices. In the first article, we discussed detecting a system Apple ID region. This article presents a technique for revealing a user's first name without permissions using the mDNS protocol.DISCLAIMER: Fingerprint as a company does not use this technique in our products, and we do not provide cross-site tracking services. We focus on detecting and preventing fraud and supporting modern privacy trends for removing third-party tracking entirely. There should be open discussions about such techniques to help internet browser providers fix them quickly.IntroductionIn this article, we explain how the real name of a macOS user can be leaked through a browser without permissions. The proof of concept demo is optimized for performance rather than accuracy and results may be affected by device or network configuration.The name brute-forcing technique uses a pre-made list of the 50 most popular gender-specific names from a specific country origin. Our experiments showed that this is enough to detect a macOS user\u2019s name correctly in 65% of the cases on average. Multicast DNS protocol and Apple Bonjour The exploit implementation relies on the multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol. In simple terms, the mDNS protocol is designed to register, discover, or broadcast device names over a local network. For instance, when a specific device, such as a printer, wants to be discovered on a local network, it sends a registration UDP packet to the reserved internal IP address 224.0.0.251, which contains a hostname like HP_LaserJet_Printer.local. The .local domain TLD indicates that the hostname should be resolved using the mDNS protocol.Such packets are automatically broadcast by a router to other devices in a local network, so they can cache the hostname. Alternatively, devices can send query packets to the same reserved IP address and try to discover a specifically named device, which may not exist in the network.Some examples of mDNS hostnames are:johns-mac-mini.localdavid-ZenBook-UX431DA-UM431DA.localjames-iphone.local canon-mf644c.localbedroom-appletv.localdlinkrouter.localThe multicast DNS protocol is widely used on Apple devices as part of the Apple Bonjour feature.By default, Apple devices expose the first name of a user in their local hostnames, which we are going to use for the name brute-forcing technique. You can view or change your macOS local hostname in the Sharing section of System Settings.Resolving mDNS hostnames from a browserUnfortunately, the multicast DNS protocol is based on UDP packets. Browser JavaScript environments do not support arbitrary UDP sockets, so it is not possible to use the mDNS protocol directly in a browser.However, we can resolve hostnames from browsers by using a timing workaround. Let\u2019s make two regular fetch GET requests to existing device-1.local and non-existing device-2.local mDNS addresses:The browser will try to resolve the hostname provided in a URL address. If the address is resolved, it will send a TCP packet to the 80 port, which in our case will most likely be closed. On the screenshot above you can see two different error messages:ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED for the existing device-1.localERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED for non-existing device-2.localBoth errors will be mapped into the same Failed to fetch JavaScript error, so we can\u2019t rely on the error type, but we can perform a timing attack. Local networks are fast, so the valid mDNS hostname registered in the network will be resolved in a reasonable time frame, which is significantly faster than the default connection timeout. In the example above, the difference is four milliseconds for a valid address versus five seconds for an invalid one. This approach is consistent enough for the proof of concept solution and works similarly in all major browsers. In practice, you can use any network JavaScript API, such as iframe, Image or WebRTC, to perform timing attacks for DNS resolving.MacOS user name brute-forcingAs illustrated earlier, the default macOS local hostname contains the user's first name and device name. Moreover, the hostname depends on a system language locale:English: <name>s-macbook-pro.localFrench: macbook-air-de-<name>.localRussian: mac-mini-<name>.localFor example, we can take the top 1,000 names, the top 10 locales, and five common macOS device names. In this scenario, it would be necessary to test 50,000 distinct hostnames, which might take over an hour. A more efficient strategy would be to limit the search scope to a single locale, a single device, and the 50 most common names within that specific locale. While this affects accuracy, it makes the attack more feasible in practical terms and significantly faster in general.The locale selection can be based on a browser time zone, language, or IP address location. Safari browser, for example, reveals the system locale with the navigator.language property, which is typically consistent with the targeted hostname locale. Also, there are other workarounds to discover the user's country of origin, such as the Apple ID region detection method discussed previously.The device options can be narrowed down by using the screen resolution. For instance, the 1728x1117 resolution is most likely a 16-inch Macbook Pro. An extended screen can be detected by using the screen.isExtended property, which will fallback the device options to three to five of the most commonly used Apple macOS devices.The proof of concept demo has a name country origin and name gender selectors, which results in 50-100 potential hostnames that can be enumerated within seconds. Among the 100 FingerprintJS employees who participated in an internal test, the demo successfully predicted the name in 65% of instances. The source code is available on GitHub.It's important to mention that the proof of concept demo is simply a demonstration of the attack and may not be successful in some cases. Some of the factors that could impact the results are:The presence of rare or unique names or non-standard macOS hostnamesParticular network configurations or VPN networksEnabled firewall in macOS network settingsIf the demo does not work for you, consider using the advanced configuration settings to verify the list of the probed names and the device name pattern applied. If you use a VPN, consider testing it with and without VPN, because the result may change.ConclusionConsidering the inherent weaknesses and numerous limitations, this attack isn't practical. It can be effortlessly detected in the network tab of browser developer tools unless there is deliberate intent from a website owner to de-anonymize its visitors.This series of articles merely explores the boundaries of internet privacy and relies on unconventional privacy breaching techniques. As another example, by combining this method with detection of installed applications, there\u2019s a potential to develop a harmful website capable of displaying your real name and job title, based on the list of professional applications used, all without requiring any permissions.Even though this article mentions Apple devices running macOS, the mDNS discovery technique can be utilized in variety of ways. For instance, it could be used to perform a local network scan to detect devices such as printers, smart TVs, smart speakers, and other home IoT devices.This method is also applicable to iPhones and iPads, given that sync over Wi-Fi or Safari remote debug features are activated.All article tagsAppleEngineering",

The text terminal SSH download will block; if I figure out it\u2019s the Little Snitch then I have to walk all the way to my desk downstairs, wiggle the mouse to wake up the monitor and unlock the screen saver, and click \u201cAllow\u201d on the Little Snitch dialog box.Works as intended.BUT by default it\u2019s common to set such things to silently allow local network requests, so I don\u2019t know if such shenanigans in the OP would work in my case.replycyrnel 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]In my case, I couldn't imagine configuring LittleSnitch to only allow certain hostnames from my browser.

So you could go with \"John Appleseed\" to get a \"john\" home directory and a \"John's MacBook Pro\" hostname. But in a small community, to local observers seeing your device on bluetooth screens, you might get weird looks (\"there is no John here, why is this sus?\") whereas \"iPhone\" looks like a default. And for non-local observers, your choice of a name like \"John\" suggests you're a westerner named John. So by just going with \"iPhone\" or \"MacBook\" you're in a smaller anonymity set but also not drawing attention to yourself in your local area, and not externally leaking information like your locale (although of course you could always leave a false trail by using a cyrillic hostname).Some other leaky, seemingly private identifiers are SSH pubkeys (I always delete the comment trailer), which are sent to every server you SSH to and also published to places like GitHub, and WiFi SSIDs (which are visible to any application with access to the network stack, and unfortunately aren't entirely within your control - often a list of nearby SSIDs, combined with a mapping of SSID to geolocation, is enough to triangulate your location to within a meter, which is one of many reasons I disable WiFi in favor of ethernet whenever possible).replyoxygen_crisis 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> seemingly private identifiers are SSH pubkeys (I always delete the comment trailer), which are sent to every server you SSH to and also published to places like GitHubI use this in my .ssh/config file: Host *  IdentitiesOnly = yes... then you'll only send keys that are specified per-host in .ssh/config with 'IdentityFile' or with a command-line argument.More discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10004678replyayewo 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I've always wondered if there was any downside to having my default private keyfile being shared whenever I fail to use the \"-i\" option to specify the correct keyfile when authenticating against a new server.Thanks for linking to the previous HN discussion!replywil421 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I prefix all my device names with \u201cMy\u201d.

Learn more.GENERAL TECHNOLOGYIt's official: Smartphones will need to have replaceable batteries by 2027Almost every smartphone \u2014 including iPhones \u2014 will need to have a replaceable battery by 2027.By C. Scott Brown\u202223 hours agoScott Scrivens / Android AuthorityTL;DRThe European Council has ended its adoption procedure for rules related to phones with replaceable batteries.By 2027, all phones released in the EU must have a battery the user can easily replace with no tools or expertise.The regulation intends to introduce a circular economy for batteries.In the middle of June, we shared a news report about the future of replaceable batteries in smartphones. That report focused on the European Parliament voting to enact a law forcing manufacturers of all battery-powered devices \u2014 including smartphones \u2014 to offer easily replaceable batteries.This week, the European Council officially agreed to the new regulation. Now, the only step left is for the European Council and Parliament to sign on the dotted line. Once they do, the clock starts ticking: any manufacturer wanting to sell phones in the EU must ensure those phones have replaceable batteries by 2027.Phones with replaceable batteries: What does this law mean?The European Council only has jurisdiction over Europe, obviously. So this law will not, technically, have an effect in any other area of the world.However, that doesn\u2019t really mean much in the grand scheme of things. Companies like Samsung, Google, Apple, etc., don\u2019t design devices specific to Europe. Apple, for example, is not going to create a European iPhone with a replaceable battery and one for the United States without. In other words, this law will change all iPhones. It will also change all tablets, laptops, EVs, e-bikes, and anything else with a rechargeable battery.The grace period from now until 2027 is to give OEMs enough time to redesign their products. This new law states, specifically, that users should be able to replace a battery in their phone without any special expertise or tools. Being that almost all smartphones today are designed like a \u201cglass sandwich\u201d that relies on extensive use of adhesives, the very fundamentals of how companies design phones will need to change.It\u2019s too early to say yet how this law will change iPhones, Galaxy S phones, Pixels, etc. However, they will change in response to this law, which is huge news.What is the intention of this law?This law exists to force manufacturers to create a circular economy for batteries. A \u201ccircular economy\u201d refers to a manufacturing model in which the resources put into it are recycled or reused as much as possible. In a perfect world, the resources needed to create a smartphone would be sourced 100% from older smartphones, so nothing new would ever need to be used. Obviously, the 100% figure would be practically impossible, but getting much closer to 100% is a very realistic goal.Here are some other rules this new law covers related to phones with replaceable batteries:Collection of waste: OEMs will need to collect 63% of portable batteries that would normally go to a landfill by the end of 2027. By the end of 2030, that number should be at 73%.Recovery of waste: Lithium recovery from waste batteries will need to be at 50% by 2027. By the end of 2031, it should be at 80%, meaning 80% of the lithium inside a battery can be recovered and repurposed for new batteries.Recycling minimums: Industrial, SLI, and EV batteries will need to be made up of certain percentages of recycled content. Initially, this will be 16% for cobalt, 85% for lead, 6% for lithium, and 6% for nickel.Early recycling efficiency target: Nickel-cadmium batteries should have a recycling efficiency target of 80% by the end of 2025. All other batteries should be at a 50% efficiency target by 2025.What happens now?We likely won\u2019t see anything change this year. However, over the next few years, you\u2019ll likely begin to see smartphones with slightly different designs as manufacturers move toward compliance with this new law. It will take years before manufacturers will have the designs, supply chains, and equipment needed to create phones with replaceable batteries at scale.Remember that consumers expect certain things from smartphones nowadays, which will mean that OEMs can\u2019t just go back to the old way of doing things. An IP68 rating would be very difficult to obtain while still offering a premium-feeling device with an easily replaceable battery, for example. These are hurdles OEMs will need to get over to be in compliance.Regardless, things are going to be very different in just a few years!NEWSsmartphonesComments",

Experts say it spells the end of social media as a reliable platform during an emergency.Stefan Labb\u00e9a day agoThe Knox Mountain wildfire near the City of Kelowna sparked an evacuation order the same weekend Twitter limited DriveBC's ability to share information on the social media platform.BC Wildfire ServiceListen to this article00:07:58A B.C. government Twitter account updating residents about driving conditions reached its tweet limit on a weekend it was sharing information about wildfire evacuations.The incident, which occurred earlier this month, prompted the Ministry of Transportation\u2019s DriveBC account to issue a warning.\u201cHEADS UP - As many others have this weekend, @DriveBC on Twitter and its sub accounts have exceeded the temporarily imposed post rate limit,\u201d tweeted the ministry account July 2.\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue going forward.\u201dThe outage, first reported by CBC News, lasted little more than an hour but nevertheless has worried emergency preparedness experts, who say it's the latest sign that the once-reliable platform can no longer be counted on.\u201cIt's kind of the end of public alerting through social media,\u201d said Ryan Reynolds, an emergency preparedness consultant with Resilience Mapping Canada.\u201cThese limits basically mean that we can't distribute that information quickly and easily at any scale.\u201dDriveBC has a dedicated website, but many access its automated messages through its Twitter account, a platform accessed by more than a quarter of Canadians in 2023, according to the company\u2019s advertising data.In the past, Twitter\u2019s more than 370 million users have accessed the platform as a last bastion of critical information during social upheavals and disaster. It played a crucial role redirecting Pakistanis to a Red Crescent emergency help line during massive floods in 2022, and amplified emergency service information when Hurricane Ian struck Florida last September.Since Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the platform, however, Twitter has put new rules in place that limit the number of automated tweets an account can send without paying.\u201cWe've been trying to use private infrastructure as public infrastructure for communications,\u201d said Reynolds. \u201cBut it really doesn't work once things change.\u201d\u201cWe need to acknowledge that we still want to be where everyone is (so on social media), but we also need fallbacks that are much more reliable.\u201dOther jurisdictions feeling pinch of Twitter\u2019s new limitsB.C. is far from the first jurisdiction to feel the effects of recent tweet limits. The U.S. National Weather Service uses Twitter to share hurricane and tornado alerts. But on July 4, its Boulder, Colo., bureau tweeted that rate limits meant it was unable to sift through tweets during active severe weather events.\u201cDue to issues with Twitter rate limits, we are unable to access most tweets at this time,\u201d said NWS Boulder.\u201cSend reports to our other social media accounts or direct through our email/phone lines.\u201dSimilar warnings were posted to the weather service\u2019s bureaus in North Carolina and Virginia.Some agencies have responded by cutting off their use of Twitter as a source of critical information. Last week, Dutch politicians told Reuters Twitter had become an unreliable platform after the Netherlands\u2019 most intense summer storm on record ripped through North Holland.In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said in April it would suspend use of the platform for service alerts after it was twice locked out of the platform\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API).\u201cThe MTA has terminated posting service information to Twitter, effective immediately, as the reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed,\u201d said North America\u2019s largest transportation authority in a press release.\"The MTA does not pay tech platforms to publish service information and has built redundant tools that provide service alerts in real time.\u201dBig disasters in big cities present largest riskTwitter\u2019s API service limits tweets for non-paying users to 1,500 a month \u2014 not enough for many emergency accounts. And while a small fee for the platform's 'Blue Check' service will increase that ceiling for individual users, the cost of an enterprise account has reportedly climbed into the tens of thousands of dollars.Twitter did not respond to Glacier Media's questions.Reynolds says Twitter's recent posting limits will likely have a limited effect on communication during emergency events in smaller communities, simply because they are less likely to send out as many tweets.But he worries what might happen during a major disaster, such as a powerful earthquake striking large population centres in Metro Vancouver or the Capital Regional District on southern Vancouver Island.\u201cFor a place like say Metro Vancouver, that's going to be a very different story, where you're seeing potentially very large number of messages going out during an emergency,\u201d Reynolds said.Like many government information services, DriveBC and the BC Wildfire Service share information on their own websites. But Reynolds worries whether such websites could handle the surge in traffic should a disaster occur in a major population centre.\u201cThat's the official way to get that message out,\u201d he said of the websites. \u201cIt has to be bulletproof and support that messaging, but I'm not convinced that that's the case right now. There aren't really good alternatives yet.\u201dA spokesperson from Metro Vancouver said it plans to use a number of communication platforms to inform residents in an emergency \u2014 including the app Alertable.\u201cMetro Vancouver is active on social media, but doesn\u2019t rely on any one platform or method to get important information out during an emergency,\u201d said the spokesperson.The B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was not immediately available for comment. Government playing catch-up with 'tech bros'Reynolds says he's worried regional, provincial and federal governments aren't taking household disaster preparedness seriously enough. A former researcher at the University of British Columbia, Reynolds led the development of an emergency app to prepare and warn British Columbians of everything from floods to tsunamis and fires.Initially rolled out in seven communities on Vancouver Island, Reynolds planned to scale up the app across B.C. But the province turned down two of his grant applications and he says the project, developed after years of community-level research, will become \u201cdead\u201d unless Public Safety Canada picks it up.\u201cThat's a concern for me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to have either a Canadian alerting app that is send only \u2014 the part of Twitter that we need for emergency management \u2014 or we need to reinforce the alternative approaches.\u201dReynolds said that could come through partnering with the U.S. and Mexico or even NATO so Canada doesn\u2019t have to \u201creinvent the wheel.\u201dIn the meantime, apps like Alert Ready offer a good option to receive emergency alerts, but they have their limits when it comes to preparing households beforehand, said Reynolds.\u201cWe're losing these other passive solutions. We don't really have a great replacement for them right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the privatization of social media, and the kind of balkanization of social media that we weren't anticipating.\u201d\u201cEmergency management moves at a much slower rate than tech bros.\u201dEditor's Note: a previous version of this story suggested Twitter's Tweet limit was initiated as part of a move to limit the company's API over rising concerns artificial intelligence platforms would use Twitter's historical archives to train their large language models.

    "hn_content": "- The BC government in Canada hit the tweet limit during wildfire evacuations, sparking a discussion about the reliability of social media during emergencies. \n- Experts suggest that relying on proprietary infrastructure, like Twitter, for essential public functionality is risky and that governments should set up their own social media servers using open protocols. \n- The Dutch government has already started setting up their own Mastodon instance, a decentralized social media platform, which is seen as a positive step towards creating a publicly-owned messaging system.\n- The discussion around the BC government's tweet limit has led to criticism of Elon Musk and his handling of Twitter, with some arguing that his personal treatment of the platform has rendered it useless for anything beyond pure vanity.\n- Suggestions have been made for the need of a publicly-owned messaging system that is federated and not controlled by a single billionaire.\n- It is important for governments to have reliable and effective communication channels during emergencies, and the limitations of platforms like Twitter highlight the need for alternative solutions.- Emergency alerts are important and shouldn't be opt-in because most people aren't proactive.\n- Traditional emergency alerts used to interrupt live media broadcasts, but that's not feasible with apps or opt-in systems.\n- The UK emergency alert system collaborates with cell networks and phone OS developers to push notifications to at-risk areas.\n- It's important to have different levels of alerts for different regions and situations.\n- Germany has an alert system called NINA that allows users to select specific geographic areas for alerts.\n- Twitter is not a reliable medium during emergencies and has a lower user base in the US compared to other platforms.\n- Governments should set up their own social media servers using open protocols in addition to using existing platforms.\n- It's important to have alternative communication channels like websites and SMS in case phone infrastructure goes down.\n- Governments need to be cautious about relying on private platforms for critical services and should consider investing in their own infrastructure.\n- Paying for a reliable service that is deemed critical is advisable, especially if the free tier has limitations.\n- Governments should have their own websites and publicize them widely for emergency information.\n- Mastodon or other platforms could be used as alternatives, but they might not have widespread usage.\n- Government websites should focus on delivering essential information rather than having social features.\n- Broadcasting emergency information through multiple channels, including social media platforms, websites, and traditional media, can reach a broader population.\n- Governments should invest in their own infrastructure rather than relying on private platforms with changing policies.\n- Having control over the systems used for critical services is important.\n- A government-run emergency broadcast website could serve as a reliable source of information.\n- Governments need to consider where the majority of people are when choosing platforms to disseminate emergency information.\n- Having a government-specific Mastodon instance could be a good option for some countries.\n- Open standards like RSS feeds can be used to share essential information and prevent reliance on proprietary platforms.\n- Disaster management experts prioritize reaching people through the platforms they already use.\n- It would be helpful to have an official government banner or JS tool that displays emergency warnings on websites.\n- Having an official website as the main source of information and sharing that on other platforms is a good approach.\n- Radio is still a reliable medium during emergencies and can reach more people than Twitter.\n- Using multiple communication channels is the best approach for disseminating emergency information.",
