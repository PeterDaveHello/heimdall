If you haven't had a chance to read it yet but are interested, you can find it at here. In the upcoming articles, I'll delve into detailed guides on how to create a homelab like mine. However, from time to time, like now, I like to shift the focus and spotlight a service or project I'm particularly fond of. In this article, I'll explore what Paperless-ngx (we'll call it Paperless for short) is and the benefits it offers. I'll also share how I've structured my Paperless installation. Finally, I'll provide my code for you to use in setting up your own instance. For now, I'll assume you already have a functional Docker environment ready to deploy your Paperless instance. Introducing Paperless-ngx, your key to simplifying life by going digital! Are you tired of hunting for crucial documents when doing your taxes? With Paperless, that hassle is a thing of the past. This fantastic tool has built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and learns from your categorized documents, making it a breeze to organize your files. Say goodbye to endless diggin through folders – now, all your essential documents are just a few clicks away. Once you've given Paperless a try for a while, you'll find that it consistently gets things right, reducing the need for manual adjustments. Say hello to a more streamlined and efficient way of managing your documents! The big benefit of going digital in this space? Flexibility! Unlike traditional paper-based or folder-organized digital systems, your documents can belong to multiple categories at once. Ever wrestled with the dilemma of deciding which folder a document should go into? That's because it often fits more than one category. The solution? Tags. With a digital solution like Paperless, you can assign as many tags as you need, making categorization a breeze. Say goodbye to the folder confusion! Paperless: A Living Proof of Open Source Greatness In short: Paperless transitioned into Paperless-ng and then into Paperless-ngx Paperless was initiated by Daniel Quinn, with his initial commit to the GitHub project dating back to 6th June 2016. The version 1 release came on 3rd July 2018 (with the first release, 0.3.0, launched on 1st January 2017). The last release under Daniel Quinn's was on 27th January 2019. As the original project began to lose momentum, Jonas Winkler's fork Paperless-ng emerged as the official successor. The first release (0.9) occurred on 18th November 2020, and the final release before the current transition was on 22nd August 2021. At the time of writing this, Paperless-ngx is the official version and repository, having its inaugural release on 05th March 2022. This journey exemplifies the strength of the open-source community. Even if a project experiences slowdowns or transitions, passionate contributors ensure its legacy lives on and continues to evolve. My Paperless Story Efficiency Unleashed Let's explore Paperless and my adoption of it. There are various approaches to adopting it, so find what suits you best. What works for me might just be the right fit for you too, or you might discover your own path along the way. The documents view in Paperless-ngx Here are the key feature of Paperless: Document Management: Organize and manage your digital documents efficiently in the web. Tagging System: Easily categorize documents with tags for quick access. OCR Integration: Optical Character Recognition for extracting text from images and scanned documents. Automatic Categorization: Learns from your tags and categories to auto-classify future documents. Search Functionality: Powerful search capabilities to find documents swiftly. Multi-User Support: Collaborate with others by setting up multiple user accounts. Data Export: Export your documents and data for backup or migration purposes. They are also kept in a very neat folder structure and naming convention, enabling you to ditch Paperless without any effort. From Paper to Pixels: Which Documents Belong in Your Digital Vault? I'm in Germany, so these rules may not apply to you. Always do your own research. I am only sharing what I am doing and not advising you to do the same. Generally, I digitize what I'd put in a physical folder, which is not every letter from banks, insurers, etc. The next choice is whether to keep the physical copy or go digital only (make sure you have a proven backup solution). In Germany, you must keep physical copies of certificates, notarized docs, property papers, vehicle papers, specific financial docs (contract-related, not just statements), insurance policies, passports, and ID cards. I shred and dispose of any document that don't require a physical copy. Fortunately, many documents are digital these days, saving me from making that decision and scanning them. Tagging, Document Types, and Correspondents: My Organizational Secrets To stay organized and efficient, it's crucial to consider document types, tags, and correspondents. Correspondents This part is straightforward. Every sender of documents you upload to Paperless becomes a correspondent. You can add new correspondents on the fly when you review new documents. I do make exceptions; for instance, invoices from online shops are assigned to 'Online Shops' rather than having their own correspondent. Thanks to the full-text search, finding what I need is easy within the hundreds of documents in the system. Document Types I put a lot of thought into document types when setting up Paperless, but rarely ever need them. Although I don't use them often, they don't hurt as Paperless is self-learning. Here are the types I've set up: Invoice Letter Insurance Contract Other Tags Remember what we discussed earlier? Folders, whether they're physical or digital, limit us to just one category per document. Tags give us the power to assign multiple categories to a single document. So, go ahead, be a tagging superstar and create as many categories as your heart desires (and even assign them all to one document). It's your very own organizational playground! In my experience, simplicity beats complexity. Keep it straightforward, no need for over-detailing. Plus, we've got this fantastic search feature to help you find what you need in a snap! Now, let's dive into the magical world of tags. Who's Affected? I find it helpful to use distinct tags for the people the documents affect: Wife Me Family (for example all bills around the house, shared insurances, ...) Which Categories Are Affected? I also like to create specific groupings to easily access all related documents. Car (You could also create a tag per car you own.) Doctor Expenses House (Have more real estate? Create a tag per property.) ToDo (Will cover this later.) Navigating Tax Season: Organizing Your Tax-Related Papers For a smooth tax season, I rely on my tax tags, which make finding relevant documents a breeze. Tax (A general tag for all tax relevant documents.) Tax always (I have documents, which are relevant for every year.) Tax 2021 Tax 2022 Tax 2023 ... Documents like insurance papers, which are relevant for more than one year, usually have three tax tags: the general one and the two for the years they are relevant for. Digitalization Made Easy: Uploading to Paperless-ngx Now that everything is set up for organizing our documents, you might wonder how to get them in there. It's a straightforward process, with three simple methods (not counting potential mobile apps as a fourth option). This is also where the 'ToDo' tag comes into play! Make sure, when you create the tag, that you tick the 'Inbox tag' box. Setting of the ToDo tag to always apply to new documents Regardless of how the documents are imported into Paperless, the ToDo tag is set. I have created a so-called 'view', which displays all documents with the ToDo tag, and added that view to my homepage. This is essentially my inbox in Paperless, which I go through from time to time to check if everything is set correctly. The Paperless-ngx start screen with documents in my 'inbox'. Uploading In your web browser, click the upload button, select your file(s), and click upload. For an even easier method, just drag and drop your file(s) into the Paperless browser window, no matter where you are in Paperless. It's that simple! Email Inbox You can have Paperless periodically scan a specific email inbox and import files from there. It could be your standard inbox, and you watch for a certain topic or folder, or you just set up a new inbox and forward emails with documents you want to import to that inbox. This is what I do, and let's have a quick look at how to set that up. After you have added an email inbox to monitor in the settings, you can specify what the importer will actually watch for and do. Settings for the email importer What you can see in the picture above is that my rule 'Main Importer' will import from 'Paperless Mail Inbox' (the name I gave the configuration of the email inbox to monitor). It watches the folder 'INBOX', processes all PDF documents, uses the file's name as the document name, sets the 'ToDo' tag, and deletes the email. Don't worry about the 'Do not assign a correspondent' option; this actually means that the self-learning algorithm will try to set the correct correspondent. Auto import from a folder You can also have Paperless watch a specific folder and import all documents from there. This is especially useful if you already have many digital documents you want to import initially or if you have a scanner with the ability to scan to a network share. Effortless Editing: Perfecting Your Documents Paired with the OCR process and the self-learning algorithm, editing newly added documents is very easy and fast. Remember, though, that the self-learning algorithm needs to learn from your documents. Any new correspondent will definitely be wrong, as it will try to set a known correspondent. After some time, it will become a matter of just making sure everything is correct. The title is something I neraly always redo, to make it very meaningful, in order to identify the document very quickly. I have learned that the it also is a tricky part to set the right date. There are a few to choose from (dates from the files meta data, dates in the header, or any other dates mentioned in the document). It gets it right most times, but do pay attention to it. Editing view for Paperless-ngx documents In the above screenshot, you can see a freshly imported document, which I can now check if everything is correct. Is it a new correspondent? No need to leave the window; you can create it straight from the input field here, same for the Document Type and Tags. The archive serial number can also be very useful (I don't use it). The serial number will automatically count upwards by one from the last serial number used. You can then write this number on the physical document and just put it in a folder, without any extra organization. Are you now looking for a document, just look up the serial number, identify the folder, ... The last step when I am done is removing the 'ToDo' tag and 'Save & Close' the document. Setting up Paperless-ngx in Docker My Way You've come a long way (or maybe you jumped ahead to grab my Docker config). Now, let's chat about how I've configured my Paperless instance to run in Docker. To make this work, we'll need three containers: a database (usually PostgreSQL, which I prefer), a Redis broker for scheduled tasks, and, of course, Paperless-ngx itself. Use of Alpine images I'm a fan of Alpine images – they're speedy and light on resources. So, when I set up a service, I check if there are Alpine images up for grabs. If I bump into a hiccup, I switch back to the regular image first. Gotta make sure it's not an Alpine image causing the trouble with dependencies. Redis Container Alright, let's kick things off with the easiest part: the Redis broker. paperless-redis: container_name: paperless-redis image: redis:7.2-alpine #fixedVersion restart: unless-stopped networks: - backend security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true volumes: - ./paperless/redis:/data environment: REDIS_ARGS: \"--save 60 10\" Copy Here are some important points to highlight in my Docker Compose code for the Redis broker: Naming Convention: I use a naming convention for supporting services, where it's structured as -. In this case, it's 'paperless-redis,' and this convention applies to both the service and container name. Fixed Image Version: I always specify a fixed image version for supporting services. This helps prevent issues when upgrading the Docker stack. It ensures that the version I'm using is compatible with my main service. This is particularly crucial for databases, where version mismatches can require migration steps. Docker Networks: I organize my Docker containers into two networks: Frontend: This network is for services that run behind my reverse proxy and require outside access (outside means outside of the server running docker). Backend: This network is for services that solely support other services and don't need outside access. Container Privileges: I specify that the container cannot have additional privileges, which enhances security. Bind Mount (Volume Path): I follow a specific structure for the bind mount (volume path). It starts with a folder named after the main service and then includes a subfolder named after the supporting service. This organization makes it easy to remove a specific configuration if I decide to discard something I've experimented with. Redis Configuration: Specific to Redis, I set an environment variable that instructs it to save its state to disk every 60 seconds or after 10 write operations. This ensures data durability. If you're wondering why there's no port setting, it's because we're working within a Docker network. We can access the container ports without explicitly defining them here. The port definition creates a port mapping between the container and the host machine/VM. Warning: Ports ignore firewall rules It's worth noting that the default Docker network (bridge network) isn't affected by rules from an iptables-based firewall. I'll dive deeper into this in an upcoming article about securing your Docker setup. PostgreSQL Container When it comes to databases in my self-hosting setup, I'm a fan of PostgreSQL. It's my preferred choice. In the case of Paperless-ngx, it defaults to PostgreSQL, but you do have the option to run MariaDB if that's your preference. I personally also always deploy a DB per service and do not reuse the same DB twice. Let's have a look at the docker compose of the database. paperless-postgres: container_name: paperless-postgres image: postgres:16.0-alpine #fixedVersion restart: unless-stopped networks: - backend security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true volumes: - ./paperless/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data environment: POSTGRES_USER: DBUSERNAME POSTGRES_DB: DBNAME POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd #POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $PasswordFromEnvFile secrets: - paperless_db_paperless_passwd Copy I prefer to use a docker secret for the password if the image supports it. I've also included a commented-out line for providing the password via a .env file if you prefer that method. Since I'm using a secret, I need to map it appropriately. I'll be covering the use of secrets in a future article about securing your Docker environment. Stay tuned for that! Paperless-ngx Container Finally, let's get to the main reason you're here: the Docker Compose configuration for my Paperless-ngx container. paperless: container_name: paperless image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest restart: unless-stopped networks: - frontend - backend ports: - 8000:8000 security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true depends_on: - paperless-redis - paperless-postgres volumes: - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/data # Docker container data - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/media # Location of your documents - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/export # Target for backups - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/consume # Watch folder environment: USERMAP_UID: $PUID USERMAP_GID: $PGID PAPERLESS_TIME_ZONE: $TZ PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE: deu+eng PAPERLESS_REDIS: redis://paperless-redis:6379 PAPERLESS_DBHOST: paperless-postgres PAPERLESS_DBNAME: DBNAME PAPERLESS_DBUSER: DBUSERNAME PAPERLESS_DBPASS_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd #PAPERLESS_DBPASS: $PAPERLESS_DBPASS PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_secret_key #PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY: $PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT: \"{created_year}/{correspondent}/{created} {title}\" PAPERLESS_URL: \"\" PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS: PAPERLESS_URL # Set the following two for your first launch # and change the admin password afterwards. # Once setup, you can safely remove these variables. PAPERLESS_ADMIN_USER: \"\" PAPERLESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: \"\" Copy Let's take a closer look at some of the specific details in the Docker Compose configuration: Networks: We join both networks because we want Paperless to communicate with the reverse proxy (not setup or covered in this article) and other services on the backend network. Ports: To access Paperless from other devices on your local network, we create a port mapping, which would not be needed when using a reverse proxy. Depends On: This ensures that the specified containers are running before starting Paperless. Volumes: We use volumes for data persistence, including our documents and Paperless configuration. I usually use NFS mounts for media, export, and consume which go straight to my NAS. For simplicity, bind mounts are used here. Environment Variables USERMAP_UID & USERMAP_GID: It's a good practice to set these to the IDs of your personal user on the Docker host system. This helps avoid permission issues when editing config files or accessing PDFs on the file system. PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGES: Set this to the languages you expect your documents to be in. PAPERLESS_REDIS: Specify the path to your Redis container. PAPERLESS_DB*: Configuration details to access your deployed database. PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY: It's essential to set this to enhance security. The default token is well-known, so changing it is recommended. PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT: This determines the folder structure and filename of the PDFs stored in 'media'. You can customize it using various variables. I use a folder for the year created, followed by the correspondent, and then the filename as the creation date with the title from Paperless. PAPERLESS_URL: Set it to your domain name or the URL, including the port you'll use to access Paperless. PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS: This setting restricts access to Paperless only from the addresses you specify. PAPERLESS_ADMIN_USER & PAPERLESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: Set these two before your first startup, and once you have logged in and changed the password, you can remove the variables. They are only needed to create the initial admin user. Otherwise, you can run the command 'createsuperuser,' but I prefer the above variables These are the configuration settings I've opted for, but there are many more options to explore. I recommend checking out the well-written Paperless-ngx documentation to tailor the setup to your needs. It's a valuable resource for fine-tuning your self-hosted document management system. Data Safety 101: The Power of Regular Backups A helpful Redditor reminded me that I hadn't covered backups. Can you blame me? My backup system is so smooth that I rarely think about it (will be covered in the future). However, let's dive into the specifics of backing up Paperless. Since we're running everything in Docker and have the export path mounted, we can easily use Paperless's built-in backup solution. To automate this, we'll add a specific command to a crontab job (under root user) on our Docker host machine. Personally, I like to create a shell script and launch it from the crontab. This approach allows me to make changes to the command without editing the crontab directly, but you can also insert the command directly into the crontab if you prefer. The command I am adding to my 'paperless_backup.sh' shell script: docker exec -it paperless document_exporter ../export -d -f -p -sm -z Copy You can find the documentation of the backup command here. But in short: -d: will delete old backups -f: uses my custom filname format -p: uses dedicated folders for archive, originals, thumbnails and jsons -sm: creates jsons per document instead of one large file -z: zips the backup Now, let's add this to the crontab. We need to include it in the root's crontab because our normal user doesn't have the access rights to run Docker commands without 'sudo,' and using 'sudo' won't work in a crontab due to the password prompt. sudo crontab -e Copy I'm scheduling it to run at 4 am because at 3am my hypervisor backes up and my off-site backup starts at 5 am. This way, it includes the backup of Paperless and moves it to my off-site location. The backup itself only takes a couple of minutes for me, so there's no risk of overlapping with the off-site backup process. Instead of adding the 'sh ' to the crontab, you could also directly add the command from the shell script in here. 0 4 * * * sh /server/docker/scripts/paperless_backup.sh Copy Warning: Supposed to stop Paperless before backup According to the documentation, we should stop Paperless before running the backup. However, since we're running it in Docker, we can't stop the container as we need it for the backup command. One of the maintainers wrote, everything should run fine as an online backup. There are measures in place to prevent issues when a backup runs while files are being uploaded. Check the GitHub discussion Keeping Your Digital Archive Up-to-Date We now have everything up and running, have backups configured. Let's talk about updating your paperless instance. Personally, I do not create an extra backup before I run an upgrade for the paperless container. It is different when I update Redis or PostgreSQL! Generally, I update my whole homelab a couple of times a week, and every now and then, I do go through the Docker stack and check the background services if they should be updated. All those containers run a fixed version. Let me walk you through the different steps. Updating Paperless-ngx Updating Paperless is very simple. It's just a matter of pulling a new image and starting the Docker Compose, which will restart Paperless if there is a new image available. sudo docker compose pull sudo docker compose up -d Copy If you have more services in the Docker Compose with the latest tag or just want to make sure to only update one container, add the container's name like this. sudo docker compose pull paperless sudo docker compose up -d paperless Copy Updating Redis I don't take any special precautions when updating Redis. It's just an in-memory message broker, so if anything goes wrong, I can just delete all the persistent data from './paperless/redis', use the image that worked, and spin it back up. If you want to be extra safe, you can stop the container and make a backup of the './paperless/redis' folder before updating. Now, all you need to do is set the image version to your choice, pull it, and start the container. After making changes, it's important to check Paperless. Ensure everything's running smoothly, like verifying if your email import is working as expected. It's a good practice to ensure everything's in order. Updating PostgreSQL Now, let's dive into the trickier bit – updating the database. I don't do this casually and also do not do it often. Minor Version upgrades We distinguish between minor and major version upgrades. If the major version matches (the first number): Halt all three Paperless containers. sudo docker stop paperless paperless-redis paperless-postgres Copy Create a copy of the './paperless' directory. mkdir backup sudo cp -r ./paperless ./backup/paperless Copy Update the image version. Fetch the latest image. sudo docker compose pull Copy Start the containers. sudo docker compose up -d Copy Major Version Upgrades Major version upgrades for databases can be quite stressful. Some services specify compatible versions, but I couldn't find this info in Paperless-ngx docs. So, it's a bit of a gamble. Ensure you have a safe backup ready, just in case we need it later. Safety first! docker exec -it paperless document_exporter ../export -d -f -p -sm -z Copy With everything safely backed up, we're ready to start the update process (source of the process). Stop paperless and redis containers sudo docker stop paperless paperless-redis Copy Create a backup of the database and stop the container afterwards sudo docker exec -it paperless-postgres pg_dumpall -U paperless > ./upgrade_backup.sql sudo docker stop paperless-postgres Copy It's a good idea to check the 'upgrade_backup.sql' file to ensure the backup was successful. If you see only a few lines or encounter permission issues, pause and resolve them until you have a working dump. Don't rush this step. Create a copy of the './paperless/postgres' folder Delete the './paperless/postgres' folder Set the new version you would like to use Start the database again sudo docker compose up -d paperless-postgres Copy Copy the 'upgrade_backup.sql' file from the copied folder to './paperless/postgres' Now run the command to import backup into the new container sudo docker exec -it Paperless-NGX-DB psql -U paperless \" PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS: PAPERLESS_URL # Set the following two for your first launch # and change the admin password afterwards. # Once setup, you can safely remove these variables. PAPERLESS_ADMIN_USER: \"\" PAPERLESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: \"\" secrets: - paperless_db_paperless_passwd - paperless_secret_key paperless-postgres: container_name: paperless-postgres image: postgres:16.0-alpine #fixedVersion restart: unless-stopped networks: - backend security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true volumes: - ./paperless/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data environment: POSTGRES_USER: DBUSERNAME POSTGRES_DB: DBNAME POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd #POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $PasswordFromEnvFile secrets: - paperless_db_paperless_passwd paperless-redis: container_name: paperless-redis image: redis:7.2-alpine #fixedVersion restart: unless-stopped networks: - backend security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true volumes: - ./paperless/redis:/data environment: REDIS_ARGS: \"--save 60 10\" Copy Full Docker Compose Stack for Paperless-ngx Farewell, Paper Clutter Closing Notes Whew, that was quite a journey! We delved into Paperless-ngx, discovered the wonders of digital tagging over paper folders, and I spilled the beans on my battle-tested setup that's served me well for years. Our docker-compose adventure unfolded, providing you with the full recipe to kickstart your own paperless journey (if you have a running docker environment). As for alternatives, I've been so content with Paperless that I've lost track of what's out there today. I can only vouch for the solution I know and love, but who knows what other gems might be waiting in the wings? Farewell for now, fellow self-hosters. Keep the servers humming and the data flowing! Until next time, happy self-hosting. Henning Welcome to My Homelab: Your Gateway to Self-Hosting! Join me on a journey through my homelab, where I've created a self-hosted tech haven right at home.

DT will suggest folders based on how closely the new file matches the contents of those folders. It has the UI equivalent of “this looks like 2023 state taxes. Is it? This looks like kid #2’s school stuff. Is it? This looks like the older dog’s veterinarian records. Is it?”That’s so, so nice.Lately, as an experiment, I’ve been playing with organizing my docs with Johnny Decimal, then using the Hazel app to sort known docs with fixed structures (think bank statements and the like) into the right folders. My ScanSnap scanner’s software does OCR, so by the time docs land in the inbox folder, they’re ready for automated processing. It’s working pretty well so far, and I may stick with it.But if I were to go back to an app, it would be DEVONthink or something with most of its features. That classifier is too darn nice, plus its smart rules, plus its scriptability, plus multi-device sync, plus Markdown notes with wiki links to stored docs, plus a thousand other niceties. reply Xerox9213 18 hours agoparentPaperless uses tags and will auto tag based on previous scans. IME it works very well (as long as you have a decently sized library of tagged documents) and seldom do I have to add my own tags. It’s not perfect, though, and sometimes I have to go in and fix some of the tags.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.paperless-ngx.com&#x2F;advanced_usage&#x2F; reply kstrauser 18 hours agorootparentOh!

The more items I put in each tag the better it gets at categorizing them, so it definitely seems to be learning somehow, though I&#x27;m not sure on the details of how it works.I&#x27;ve never used DT, so it&#x27;s possible that their system is substantially better in some way. reply pydry 18 hours agoparentprevI thought I wanted this originally when I first started going paperless but I quickly realized that as long as I OCR everything and throw it in a pile I can easily grep for \"state taxes\" and 2023. reply noodlesUK 21 hours agoprevOne thing that I’ve done that makes my paper handling process much easier is have my printer&#x2F;scanner point to a write only samba share. Most HP printers support this. I wrote a short script that looks for new files in there (with inotify), runs OCR on them with OCRMyPDF and moves them to a different file share. It means that my non-technical family members can just stick the paper in the document feeder, and 20 seconds later, an OCRed copy ends up on the family file share. You don’t get the fancy tagging and search that this provides, but file shares integrate natively into all OSs, which is a huge perk. reply djhworld 21 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve done something similar although I had to jump through a few hoops to get it to work.I have a Fujitsu ScanSnap which is one of those feed-through scanners. I have it hooked up to a Raspberry Pi which listens for the button press on the scanner. You press the button, the paper feeds through the scanner and once it has finished the scan a script runs to collate everything into a PDF and drops the result onto a Samba share that&#x27;s running on the box where paperless-ngx is.It&#x27;s pretty neat and feels seamless.

I had to dig for the drivers, Fujitsu didn&#x27;t have the right ones for my model on their website!I couldn&#x27;t find any official software from Fujitsu, but I found the drivers eventually, so ended up coming up with connecting the scanner to the Pi over USB and glueing the bits together to drop the PDFs onto the samba shareThe button is located on the scanner, and I run \"scanbd\" [1] to listen for the button press, this is what coordinates the scan function (feeding the paper through) and then post-scan -> running a script to collate + create PDFs[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;Scanner_Button_Daemon reply Osmose 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve got this setup with a Brother ADS-1700W scanner, which can write directly to a network share over wifi.

Maybe just by selecting the text from the PDF.In the folder list and in the search you would be able to add those meta data information as columns, sort them by value or do queries (tag:invoice AND invoice.amount > 1000)Edit: this feature seems to be one of most upvoted feature requests for paperless https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paperless-ngx&#x2F;paperless-ngx&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;1... reply jdoss 18 hours agoprevIf you are looking to quickly setup Paperless-NGX check out my little side project https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jdoss&#x2F;ppngx.

If you scan it the digital version isn&#x27;t.If an invoice came as a digital document (e.g. a PDF by email), this digital document is the original - a printed version of that digital document isn&#x27;t.So if a tax inspector asks for \"originals\" it&#x27;s technically almost impossible to provide them in the sense of the law.

Then when I have to file taxes, I export the correct numbers.Are you doing your bookkeeping in Excel or something? reply _frkl 18 hours agorootparentThis is just for my personal taxes, no accounting involved. I just get all the relevant stuff together once a year. Of course it&#x27;s not 10s of 100s of documents, but still enough so it would take me some time to get everything together manually.Also it was just meant as an example, paperless is generally useful (to me) in situations where I need to access somehow related documents, like traveling and such, or searching my documents for some information. As I said, there are other systems and ways to do this, but for me this is the one that stuck. reply krupan 18 hours agoparentprevIn my experience, no, you don&#x27;t need this. The few things I keep just go in folders named for the year under my Documents folder, and they are given descriptive filenames like paystub-2022-10-15.pdf, or companyA-w-2.pdf. In the rare cases where I need to go back to those (like for a loan application or doing taxes) it&#x27;s easy enough to find them. reply Macha 19 hours agoparentprevSo here&#x27;s an example where it came in useful to have back documents:I recently purchased a house. As part of the process, I needed to apply for a mortgage. The bank wanted a statement from my employer about my income from them, along with my last 2 complete years tax documents.The bank had an inquiry. My employer had said my salary + bonus was X, but in the first of these two years, my tax documents said my income from my employer that year was 2.5X. The extra 1.5X was due to the employer being bought out and some change of control terms in the RSUs causing immediate payout of what would normally have been paid out over 4 years. Since I kept the documents of the RSU terms and the payslips, I could provide these to the bank to clear the matter up.Notably, had I not kept my own copy of these documents, I could not have gone back to my employer for new copies. Due to the change of control, they had changed payroll vendors, and had eventually terminated the contract with the old vendor, so I could not have gotten a payslip from 1.5 years ago. Similarly, in the move to the new owner&#x27;s HR system, the company had lost many of their records of agreements with employee&#x27;s, including contracts etc., so it&#x27;s not clear they would still have the terms of the RSUs, especially since the change of control payout rendered this a \"completed\" transaction. And later events made it clear that they did not have, e.g. a copy of my employment contract.Similarly, if I ever had had a dispute over the terms of those contracts - if I hadn&#x27;t kept a copy of the contract, and the company definitely hadn&#x27;t kept theirs, any dispute would have been my word against theirs. reply iamwpj 17 hours agorootparentCompanies are legally required to keep payroll records for multiple years (depends on where you live, though I doubt most places are less than 3-4). This is ok advice, but these systems don&#x27;t just work like this. If you didn&#x27;t have the documentation the bank would likely take your approved tax filings as evidence and move on with their day.In a real contract dispute your copy of a contact from your documents isn&#x27;t notably different in the eyes of the court than one from your employer. They&#x27;re both notarized and if there&#x27;s a dispute between them there is established processes. Aside from some titles or etc., historical filing ownership is typically relegated to the document originators. reply t0mas88 19 hours agoparentprevDepends on your tax situation. For my private taxes it&#x27;s maybe 3 or 4 documents and those from the bank etc have all gone PDF anyway.But when I was a freelancer I used a document scanning system provided by my bookkeeper. It worked similar to this open source thing, scan to PDF, automatic OCR and classification. Needed it because many invoices still arrived on paper, and receipts for restaurants etc I usually took a picture to upload. reply faiD9Eet 16 hours agoparentprevYou are right, you do not want to lookup documents that old, it is a waste of time... ... unless you are a German and the state asks for your time sheets three years in the past because you&#x27;ve gotten child support and are requested to prove your working hours. ... unless you happen to have an accident and your insurance is fighting with another insurance who&#x27;s gonna pay and they ask you about the incident two years later ... unless you end up in a contract fight with the postal operator, that can take a year of mailing before being settled.Some correspondences take years and only add a mailing every few months.

I’ve had numerous cases of sadness that I couldn’t produce a necessary document, and gladness that I was able to pull up something presumed long lost. For me, it’s easier to save everything “just in case”. It all adds up to less than 50GB so it’s not an enormous amount of data to store by current standards.Seriously, a couple cases of “sorry, I don’t have proof to back up that tax deduction” or “hey, here’s the receipt proving that our TV is still covered by warranty!” make it all worthwhile. reply ipsi 17 hours agoparentprevKinda - at the moment I&#x27;m receiving _a lot_ of documents, mostly as PDFs via E-Mail (some the original digital version, some scans of physical copies), but some via post as well.I&#x27;ve only added documents I&#x27;ve received this year (plus a couple of dozen documents going further back), and I&#x27;ve got ~250 in there, with a total of ~2.5m words (although I think word-count is a fuzzy concept in German).I&#x27;ve posted a top level comment in more detail, but yeah, it&#x27;s helpful to me. reply djbusby 16 hours agoparentprevI have a small business in USA. For federal business taxes I need 6-7 documents. Then that process creates other documents I need for personal taxes, which also requires 6-8 more documents.

People in this thread are describing some setups that momentarily seem cool in theory, but are almost certainly overkill for personal use. reply MrVandemar 7 hours agorootparentIt depends.We had this ridiculous money-making scheme from the Federal Government a few years back called \"Robodebt\", which basically amounted to sending demands to pay back welfare money that they claim was incorrectly claimed ... long after the retention period for the paperwork. Conveniently they declined to show their working for the so-called incorrect claims.Most people didn&#x27;t keep their timesheets and records, and then couldn&#x27;t prove they weren&#x27;t overpaid, and were supposedly liable for the \"debt\".Some people comitted suicide over it.If you had your records, you probably wouldn&#x27;t have lost any sleep over it, much less your life. reply whateveracct 16 hours agorootparentprevLuckily, running paperless-ngx on my NixOS desktop is trivial.

Important documents are usually physical there. They are one of the least developed countries in Europe with digitalization, they are far behind. reply yunohn 19 hours agoparentprevIn the Netherlands, government bodies are regularly pushing everything they can to a digital inbox - which I vastly prefer. My simple, single-employer yearly income tax is all pre-calculated. Further, deductions for mortgage interest, healthcare, studies, etc are all pre-filled as much as possible. I think you only need to upload documents for complicated sitations or audits?Of course, I still quickly download my year-end bank&#x2F;salary&#x2F;mortgage statements and cross-verify the tax departments numbers. The whole process takes at most a few hours.IME Germany has significantly more hard-copy requirements. reply t0mas88 19 hours agorootparentYou never need to upload the documents in the Netherlands, their software doesn&#x27;t have such an option.But technically you&#x27;re expected to keep the documents at least until you receive the \"definitieve aanslag\" and if you&#x27;re nitpicking I think there is a 7 year term for the tax services to come back on your filed taxes and change things or demand proof.Practically that doesn&#x27;t happen if you accepted their pre-filled numbers and they match your employers. But if you&#x27;re a freelancer or other non-standard case I would keep digital copies for a few years just to be sure. reply yunohn 17 hours agorootparent> You never need to upload the documents in the Netherlands, their software doesn&#x27;t have such an option.Ah, interesting.

Unless a company has a robust escrow contingency, then there&#x27;s always a possibility that they can go bust and you lose your data and service. Probably more of a concern is vendor lock-in, especially when they decide to change their service levels.Paperless-ngx is a great example of how open source can work around the issue of lack of maintenance (quite a big problem with commercial services if they don&#x27;t get much profit from them) as IIRC Paperless-NG was a fork from Paperless and now Paperless-NGX is a fork from Paperless-NG.

It checks my email, grabs PDFs, straightens them, OCRs them, adds a correspondent, tags them, and makes them available through a web UI.I also appreciate the full-text search (for all that it might struggle if I had tens of thousands of documents) as I&#x27;ve had to go and try to find particular documents where the name of the document I&#x27;ve received might be a synonym for what the other person is asking for, but the word they&#x27;re asking for is at least used in the text.I&#x27;ll also set it up to pull documents from my NAS as well, where the scanner writes to, as I also receive a number of documents via mail (that I also occasionally need to translate or copy&#x2F;paste from).There are also some limitations that annoy me:* I really wish the email filters were more flexible - right now, I have to have three filters, one of PDFs, one for JPEGs, and one for PNGs, so I wish I could just set a regex for the attachment name. This one annoys me enough that if I ever have time I&#x27;d look at doing a PR for it (assuming the filtering is done locally and not on the IMAP server). * I&#x27;d also like to be able to setup rules to tag documents based on the email domain (e.g., house-builders get tagged as \"house-builder, house\") without having to manage a gigantic explosion of rules. In theory the ML should handle that, but... I&#x27;m mistrustful of ML. We&#x27;ll see in a few months if I was too hasty in my judgement or not. * I&#x27;d like to retain slightly more information about the correspondent, like both name and email address (there&#x27;s no consistency about who has their From line as \"Name \" and who&#x27;s just \"email\", even within the same company), both for de-duplication of correspondents and domain-based searching. * I wish I could share documents more easily than downloading it and re-uploading it to my email client (or mounting the folders and trying to find the right document, but that has its own set of problems). This one of those problems that&#x27;s really easy to state, but potentially quite difficult to actually implement - could a web application add a PDF to the clipboard in such a way that GMail, say, would understand what was happening and add it as an attachment when pasted?Overall though, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, and finding it useful so quickly was somewhat surprising. reply denysvitali 17 hours agoprev [–] I&#x27;ve created \"ODI\" (Overengineered Documents Indexer) and presented it recently.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clis-everywhere.k8s.best&#x2F;16My approach is scanning the documents with airscan1, indexing them with a custom OCR Server (using the MLKit by Google on an Android phone which does completely offline OCR scanning) and indexing everything in OpenSearch.

She said the slide showed a query of “children’s clothing” that Google rewrites to be a “Nikolia kidswear” query so that it can sell more ads. But in reality, the slide is describing a fuzzy keyword matching system that takes a query of “Nikolia kidswear” and allows it to match ads with “children&#x27;s clothing” keywords.I’m surprised WIRED allowed such an obviously incorrect article to be published in the first place, particularly when it was by a known partisan (the article discloses that the author is a former Duck Duck Go executive with an obvious bias). reply listmaking 13 hours agoparentMore precisely, the slide shows, for an advertiser who is bidding on the keywords “+kids +clothing” and has this sort of broad match enabled, three columns of examples of searches that would also match:1. (because of [kids → children]) ads with keywords “+kids +clothing” would also match searches like “clothing for young child” and “newborn children&#x27;s clothing”2. (because of [kids clothing → kidswear]) ads with keywords “+kids +clothing” would also match searches like ”nikolai kidswear” and “kidswear outlet”3. (because of [clothing → apparel &#x2F; outlet]) ads with keywords “+kids +clothing” would also match searches like “creative apparel for kids” and “kids outfits”That is what the slide&#x27;s title (“Advertisers benefit via closing recall gaps”) refers to: the gaps in recall (matching) are being closed, by being broader.The WIRED article misunderstood the slide, and was entirely based on the premise that if you searched for “children’s clothing” you&#x27;d get results for “NIKOLAI-brand kidswear” which is not true (and would indeed have been “startling”, not to mention obvious, if it were true). In fact, the organic (non-ads) part of the search results in Google are always completely independent of anything in ads, something that the Search team in Google have maintained for several decades as a fundamental principle. reply soraminazuki 12 hours agorootparent> In fact, the organic (non-ads) part of the search results in Google are always completely independent of anything in ads, something that the Search team in Google have maintained for several decades as a fundamental principle.Are you sure? There&#x27;s an email from the ads team proposing multiple measures to increase the number of search queries so they can reach their target revenue. One of the mentioned measures include \"ranking tweaks.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;d9&#x2F;2023-09&#x2F;416646.pdf reply listmaking 11 hours agorootparentWell, it&#x27;s a line I&#x27;ve heard a few times over the years, and it&#x27;s also being stated externally (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;searchliaison&#x2F;status&#x2F;1709726778170786297 says “The organic (IE: non-sponsored) results you see in Search are not affected by our ads systems.”) so I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s still true.That email thread you linked is between the Ads and Chrome (not Search) teams, is about the number of search queries (not the results of search queries), and “ranking tweaks” there refers to the ranking that Chrome uses to show the suggestions in the omnibox (address bar). (To get a sense of these “ranking tweaks”, try this experiment in a (new?) Chrome profile with default settings: type \"flowers\" in the Chrome address bar and don&#x27;t hit Enter, and look at the suggestions: what mix of search suggestions, entities, and bookmarks&#x2F;history do you see? Try again with other commercial queries like “insurance” and “mortgage”, and also some less commercial queries like, I don&#x27;t know, “Minnesota” or “economics”.)(And FWIW, I think that whole email thread actually shows Google in a “good” light relative to the popular impression here on HN as a company whose every action is some Machiavellian scheme to increase ads revenue: it shows that Chrome actually launched something to production before its negative impact on revenue became a concern, that Ads leads had to work hard to persuade them to either roll back or find some other way to undo the decrease in search query volume, that starting to include search query volume as a launch criterion would be a “cultural shift” for Chrome, etc: that Ads having an influence on Chrome is a rare occurrence.) reply Tryk 9 hours agorootparentI disagree that it shows Google in a \"good\" light. Here is a excerpt from the emails between Ads to the Google Chrome team. From Jerry Dirschler (Ads) to Anil Sabharwal (Google Chrome)>\"Thanks Anil (Google Chrome Lead) for pushing your team and being open to this whole line of thinking... We are short REDACTED% queries and are ahread on ads launches so are short REDACTED% vs. plan...The Search team is working together with us (ADS) to accelerate a lunch out of a new mobile layout by the end of May that will be very revenue positive (exact numbers still moving) but that still won&#x27;t be enough. Our best shot at making the quarter is if we get an injection of at least REDACTED%, ideally REDACTED%, queries ASAP from Chrome... I also don&#x27;t want the message to be \"we&#x27;re doing this thing because the Ads team needs revenue.\" That&#x27;s a very negative message. But my question to all of you is - based on above - what do we think is the best decision for Google overall?>In that spirit, do we think it&#x27;s worth reconsidering a rollback? Or are there very scrappy tactical tweaks we can launch with holdback that we know will increase queries? (For example, can we increase vertical space between the search box&#x2F;icons&#x2F;feed on new tab to make search more prominent? are there other ranking tweaks we can push out very quickly? Are there other entry points we haven&#x27;t focused on that we could push on soon?) Just to be clear, the reason I haven&#x27;t pushed harder on a rollback so far is because I don&#x27;t want the message to be...\"(source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230919185431&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justi...) reply listmaking 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the same as the link I was responding to, and that&#x27;s why I wrote “relative to” — the Ads team pushing on Chrome for revenue shows Google in a poor light relative to an imagined world where Chrome never cares about Google revenue, but a good light relative to an imagined world where everything that Chrome does is for revenue or some short-term profit to Google, rather than what&#x27;s good for users. reply jollofricepeas 11 hours agorootparentprevJesus. Wow just wow.Yours should be the top commentWhy are people not talking about this document more?“I also don’t want the message to be we’re doing this because the Ads team needs more revenue…but what is the best for Google overall?”Clearly, the ads team has influence over search to the point of saying more-or-less screw culture and team morale, let’s do what’s best for Google overall which is hitting our quarterly targets. reply compiler-guy 8 hours agorootparentWhat it actually shows is that ads can ask for whatever they want and the teams they ask can (and do) say “No”.Ads didn’t get its way here. It doesn’t drive every decision. Especially not with search, but also not with chrome. reply ImPostingOnHN 2 hours agorootparentthat is the exact opposite of what it shows to mereading through the email chain, it seems ads did indeed get its way, and the product was indeed made worse to drive revenue numbers – chrome team was unable to say \"no\" when pressured by ad team reply moultano 10 hours agorootparentprevThis email was not addressed to the search team. reply stathibus 16 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately par for the course these days. At least they did remove the article. Citing \"editorial standards\" is weak sauce though, the point of having editorial standards is so they can be applied by the editor before publication... reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparentI have always found this to be a weird take from a forum largely populated by software people. Every piece of software I have ever used has been riddled with bugs and security defects. This despite the fact that we have dedicated sub-fields for both (security engineering &#x2F; test engineering). So when a journalist notices a bug in their article and has to \"retract a release\", how is that not what we do every single day?I think you might just be disappointed in humanity, rather than any particular agency or person. Humans come together to get the right answer eventually; not multiple times a day, every day, without fail. Sometimes the software doesn&#x27;t do what you want. Sometimes that article has a factual error. Eventually we figure it out. It&#x27;s not the end of the world. reply ankit219 12 hours agorootparentIn this case, it&#x27;s probably justified to have gripes with the editors.They got an opinion piece with an extraordinary claim about something the writer saw in a slide presented at a trial. She wrote the entire article about it creating theories and then how it needs to be stopped. Not to mention, she had previously worked with a competitive search engine. The central piece of fact checking was seeing that slide, that would have been the second question after \"Are you sure you saw something like that?\". The entire article hinges on that one slide she saw and what she understood from it.This is not a case of missing a boundary condition. This is missing the central premise. At any level, it would be inexcusable.PS: In a sense, as the artifacts are becoming public, i think more such confusions would surface in the coming weeks where merely misunderstanding what is on the slide would lead to a lot of rumors. Probably best we have an initial case and some intuition that this can happen. reply ben0x539 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think you should derive a universal QA standard from specific release practices borne out of a specific risk&#x2F;reward situation that depends on things like your particular business model or lack thereof.There&#x27;s a wide spectrum of how fucked your software can be when you release it without it being a huge deal, like if I push a broken release for my hypothetical build system that jumbles the error messages a little that&#x27;s probably fine, if I push a broken build of the google dot com landing page that&#x27;s raising a few more sirens and I really shouldn&#x27;t make a habit of it, if I deploy critically broken firmware to your pacemaker or your crewed rocket ship I should probably be exiled from the field. I imagine there&#x27;s a similar spectrum for journalists and we can&#x27;t really figure out where on the spectrum to the article from the OP should be with just analogies to a different field. Complaining about a trend of publications slipping towards the yolo&#x27;ier end of the spectrum doesn&#x27;t seem on its face hypocritical. reply soraminazuki 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also an understandable mistake. The slide the GP mentioned doesn&#x27;t provide a clear explanation and can be interpreted the way the original article did. It&#x27;s no wonder multiple people didn&#x27;t catch the mistake. reply extra88 6 hours agorootparentAn article should not be published based on one person&#x27;s interpretation of one slide. Basic journalistic standards would require having other sources that corroborated what the writer thought the slide meant. reply pdpi 11 hours agorootparentprevWe also have the notion that fixing bugs at design time is easier than in dev, which is in turn easier than in prod.Publications can simultaneously be praised for “rolling back a bad build” while being criticised for letting that build roll out to prod in the first place. reply Exoristos 13 hours agorootparentprevA difference being software engineering is a laughingstock no one expects much of, while worldclass publishing has a past excellence against which it&#x27;s still frequently judged. reply balls187 13 hours agorootparentI also misunderstood the point—but if I now read correctly—it’s that to err is human, and something that we do as software developers constantly reply fallingknife 11 hours agorootparentprevPeople expect their software to work perfectly nearly all of the time. And for the most part, it does. So not really sure who you think these people are who think it&#x27;s a laughingstock. reply fallingknife 11 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t one of the key elements of ethical journalism that you need to ask the subject of your article for comments? I have a hard time believing they asked Google to comment on this piece and didn&#x27;t get \"that is categorically false and if you publish it you will be hearing from out attorney\" as an answer. So I don&#x27;t really see how this one got through unless they didn&#x27;t ask for comments.This would be like the SWE equivalent of pushing to production without code review. It&#x27;s not an excusable mistake like when a bug gets through. reply seebs 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about \"need\", but it&#x27;s certainly common to reach out to them... But that doesn&#x27;t mean that they respond quickly. Google does not have a rep for reliably getting back to people quickly or even at all, and when they do get back to people, they very often just say they can&#x27;t comment, because there&#x27;s no way for the people handling the press contact to reach a person who would know what was going on in a predictable manner. (Yeah, that sounds stupid. It is. And yet, nonetheless, you can regularly find that no one at Google can figure out who owns something or knows why it&#x27;s the way it is.) reply zo1 13 hours agorootparentprevThe same way we expect \"QA\" to pick up those bugs before release?Think about the opposite. Imagine we pickup a bug in a live application and update it citing \"our QA standards\". This magical word does not absolve us of the fact that we let a bug through to production. And it&#x27;s implied that we&#x27;ll do better next time to pick up this kind of bug. reply embik 13 hours agorootparentThe post you are responding to is making the point that even though we have QA, dedicated jobs or even departments for these things … We, as a profession, still fail in releasing bug-free software. And that’s 100% correct.Is that really something you are challenging? Which pieces of popular software you can think of are bug-free? And are you thinking of more than a handful? reply zo1 13 hours agorootparentThey said \"So when a journalist notices a bug in their article and has to \"retract a release\", how is that not what we do every single day?\"And they themselves were responding to someone criticizing media for using \"editorial standards\" as an excuse when they \"retract a release\".And I explained how we are the same and supposedly strive to not release bad content&#x2F;software, we just don&#x27;t get to magically absolve fault with an excuse that \"it doesn&#x27;t meet our QA standards\" as an analogy to \"editorial standards\".Anywho, the whole thing breaks down when we have to beat it with a stick. It&#x27;s a discussion, assume a charitable interpretation. reply xvector 11 hours agorootparentprevJournalists suck. They pretend to be bearers of the truth, and yet go forth with horribly biased and inaccurate claims. Nothing like software which does not wield anywhere close to the same cultural power to control narratives as the news media. reply i_am_jl 12 hours agorootparentprevRetracting an article due to \"editorial standards\" is, to extend your analogy, like attributing the need for an emergency hotfix to \"QA practices\".Editorial standards should stop bad stories from being published. Saying \"we retracted this story because it doesn&#x27;t meet our editorial standards\" begs the question \"why are you publishing things that don&#x27;t meet your editorial standards in the first place?\"It doesn&#x27;t take responsibility for or explain the mistakes in the article. It doesn&#x27;t state that the article had factual errors. It&#x27;s a frustrating cop-out. I sincerely hope this is a temporary measure while Wired gets a more comprehensive retraction put together. reply diggan 16 hours agorootparentprev> At least they did remove the articleWouldn&#x27;t it be better to add a correction at the top of the article instead of deleting it?Deleting it I&#x27;d think would just fuel (current or budding) conspiracy theorists, as they can point to something that existed but got removed, rather than something that got corrected.But in the end, it&#x27;s probably a loosing battle anyway... reply throw__away7391 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of interacting much with conspiracy theorists, but literally whatever happens it always proves their beliefs are correct. reply brookst 15 hours agorootparentEvidence for the claim: proves the claimNo evidence: obviously the evidence is being suppressed, proves the claimEvidence against the claim: shills obviously trying to control the narrative, proves the claim reply philipov 14 hours agorootparentI recall an anecdote by a mathematician about his approach to peer-reviewing proofs of theorems. He said he glosses over most of it, but very thoroughly checks anything the author claims to be \"obvious\" because it&#x27;s the things that seem obvious that screw people up. reply borski 15 hours agorootparentprevThis. It doesn’t matter what you do, conspiracy theorists can and will justify it as a conspiracy. reply BolexNOLA 14 hours agorootparentHad a discussion about Assange the other day (contentious I know but bear with me). I brought up how he had a show on RT, the Russian state media channel, mentioning that it’s pretty bad optics regardless of what one thinks of the dude. They immediately went “no they didn’t that’s got to be a CIA myth.” Hand to god that’s what they said.I showed him the IMDb and Wikipedia pages for it and a clip. Without missing a beat - remember they literally had never heard this before and have already decided it’s misinformation planted by the CIA - he said “Well it’s an independent show he put on that happened to be shown on RT.”I mean what can you say to that? reply anjel 14 hours agorootparent&#x27;Happens to be&#x27; is doing alot of work in that sentence reply BolexNOLA 14 hours agorootparentSeriously! Like I said, I get it’s a very contentious issue and I’m sure people have varied feelings on this, but to walk into a conversation literally knowing nothing about the topic at hand and then hand waving it away so quickly…I mean there’s no point in even continuing the conversation at that point. reply cultureswitch 9 hours agorootparentAssange knew every western government was likely to do literally nothing to defend him against the US. In his shoes you&#x27;d also probably be drip-feeding information and money to the Russians. Info which should be out in the open anyway. replywruza 14 hours agorootparentprevBut that’s what any decent conspiracy would do! reply granzymes 15 hours agorootparentprevWhether they removed the article or not, I think it’s ridiculous that WIRED didn’t explain why the article was retracted.They should have mentioned 1) what the article got wrong and 2) that the article was written by a former Duck Duck Go executive who should know better. reply bonestamp2 13 hours agorootparentYa, I&#x27;d prefer if they just corrected the article, made a note at the top of the article about what was corrected, and have a disclaimer that it was written by Google&#x27;s competitor. reply Operyl 16 hours agorootparentprevAdding a correction at the top would just fuel (current or budding) conspiracy theorists, as they can point to something that was, in their eyes, forcibly corrected against WIRED&#x27;s will. reply Mountain_Skies 16 hours agorootparentSo instead they prove the conspiracy folks right that the media is willing to scrub proof of inaccurate reporting. reply Operyl 16 hours agorootparentThe point I’m making is that no matter what you do, a conspiracy theorist is going to twist the narrative to fit their world view. reply generalizations 15 hours agorootparentWell, the world view in this case is &#x27;the media lies&#x27; - and that&#x27;s correct in this case (though it wasn&#x27;t intentional). reply vkou 15 hours agorootparentWhereas the sources spoon-feeding them this attitude are, of course, unimpeachable. (They don&#x27;t redact, or admit fault.)I generally find that anyone expecting error-free perfection in any subjective field from an entire industry can be safely dismissed as a complete idiot. Intelligent people look at the processes that produce outcomes, not the outcomes.(In this case, the process that produced the outcome was a former DDG employee mailing in an oped of incredibly questionable quality that criticized a DDG competitor, that was eventually pulled. Wired should look into reading op-eds before publishing them.) reply 0ct4via 16 hours agorootparentprevIf they admit it&#x27;s \"inaccurate\" &#x2F; \"does not meet [their] editorial standards\" then it&#x27;s hardly \"scrubbing proof\"...Admitting it was trash is proof of inaccurate reporting, whether they remove TFA or notAs for the conspiracy folks, they&#x27;ll think what they want, regardless of evidence presented to them. That&#x27;s the whole point. reply zo1 13 hours agorootparentprevBecause journalism is not the way to solve this, and we all think that it will.The way to solve it is for \"investigators\" to get access to said source code and give us an honest assessment. Get someone neutral, get NDAs in place, have them look at the source in an air-gapped clean room, anonymize DB access, etc etc.Instead we go around in circles. Journalism at the end of the day then becomes \"we got some info that points to X, but we have no proof, and we won&#x27;t look for it. We&#x27;ll just wait till someone, somewhere, at some point, who knows when, finds some proof and puts it out in the public, only then will we say it&#x27;s conclusive. Until then, you all go nuts, especially the conspiracy theorists. Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll ride this gravy train and report on those nut jobs too!\".It&#x27;s a mess, and I&#x27;m not at all surprised that conspiracy-theorists have a field day with it.Hey, let&#x27;s get a bounty up so that a whistle-blower from Google comes forward. Maybe Mozilla foundation can take some of that sweet sweet endowment they use for \"Social Justice\" and pony up to fund this investigative effort. After all they claim to be fighting for a free internet. I&#x27;d say this is a much better use of money than paying random DEI consultancies huge speaking fees. reply SllX 14 hours agorootparentprevThat would be showing too much respect for or deference to conspiracy theorists, who aren’t really worth the trouble. Copies probably exist in the Internet Archive, archive.is and in PDFs people could have saved when the article was up so it’s not like it truly disappeared. WIRED just took down a bad article that shouldn’t have been published. reply autoexec 14 hours agorootparentprevTransparency is the key to trust and journalistic integrity. Even an article that was mostly wrong&#x2F;written from a failed premise should remain accessible with a timestamped correction statement explaining the problem.Making your mistakes suddenly disappear as if they never happened is tempting, but it&#x27;s going to leave users feeling gaslit, distrustful, or even just misinformed. reply omoikane 13 hours agorootparentprev> having editorial standards is so they can be applied by the editor before publicationMaybe there were lots of articles that were never published due to editorial standards, but we only see the ones that slipped through. reply littlestymaar 16 hours agorootparentprev> the point of having editorial standards is so they can be applied by the editor before publication...“Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that”.The role of journalists is to provide facts, but the business model of media in the internet age is about “creating content” and “engagement” and they don&#x27;t work well together … reply vkou 15 hours agorootparentEven providing facts is a subjective, opinionated process. Which facts are provided, which are left out, which are contextualized, whether or not active or passive voice is used[1] and which are not can completely invert the meaning of a story.[1] &#x27;The gun went off and the shot hit Mr. Smith&#x27;s head&#x27; versus &#x27;Officer Sloan shot Mr. Smith in the head.&#x27; [2][2] Both of these are &#x27;just the facts&#x27;, but one of them blames the gun for going off, the other blames the person who made the gun go off. Passive voice versus active voice, very different presentation of the same facts, both are correct, and both are biased. reply littlestymaar 14 hours agorootparent> Even providing facts is a subjective, opinionated process.Yes, that&#x27;s why you need press freedom with multiple point of views. But it is orthogonal to the point I was making. reply spankalee 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not that either. Each column in the slide is independent, and it&#x27;s only showing the rewritten queries.So it&#x27;s showing \"Nikolai kids clothing\" being rewritten to \"Nikolai kidswear\". reply dylan604 16 hours agoparentprevWas this piece marked as opinion or an editorial? Allowing 3rd party writers to publish isn&#x27;t new, but back when we pretended we had standards, they were placed in an obvious part of the publication that it wasn&#x27;t staff writers working within the normal flow of editorial process. i must be old, because a lot of my comments are now \"used to be\", \"back when\", \"remember back when\" type stories reply cma 14 hours agorootparentYes it was marked editorial&#x2F;opinion and said something like not the opinion of wired staff at the bottom. reply bart_spoon 14 hours agoparentprevWired has been a dumpster for quite some time. A low quality article like this getting published is entirely on brand. reply BolexNOLA 14 hours agoparentprevHonestly, it just seems like something where somebody looked at it too quickly, got excited, and then didn’t look a second time.

The Wired article has been taken down, but I&#x27;m assuming it was arguing that Google would change organic results to get more ad clicks.

These are ultimately still do what I say interfaces. You need to be specific and intentional and they respond in pretty exact alignment to what you ask it to do. They&#x27;re basically unconventional programming languages.You can ask absurd things to gpt and it will try to respond to your absurd request.For instance, I asked it \"What year in the 1900s had the most tuesdays\" and it spit back a python program that tried to figure it out. On Google, to compare things, I get \"1900s\" crossed out and the wikipedia entry for the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain as the first result, maybe because it&#x27;s around dinner time.The difference here is between that and the \"guess what I mean based on crude demographic information and popularity\" interfaces that ignore the user&#x27;s clear intentions in favor of gross statistical markers like how google changes the position of images, shopping, maps, etc in the results based on the query presuming your intention based on crude vague guesses or the search systems that seem to only return 50% of what you asked for and the other 50% is simply what it thinks you want to see instead.Those are not tools, they are broken trash. It&#x27;d be like if you had a knife that randomly turned into a spoon or a fork based on what time of day it is and what room you&#x27;re using it in.ChatGPT tried to do exactly, precisely what I said regardless of the fact that there is no answer since it&#x27;s a list of years and not a single one. It&#x27;s the \"you told me to do X and I did exactly X\" interface, the kind you get with a good tool.Too much software is the opposite - basically as if someone walked up to a dinner machine and said they&#x27;re vegan or kosher and the machine was like \"American male. Eats cheeseburgers. Here&#x27;s cheeseburger\"These modern systems just straight up ignore you in favor of some \"big data\" approach. It&#x27;s trash.Recently I slept through a silenced alarm on a Saturday because my phone decided that people don&#x27;t want wakeup alarms on Saturday and Sunday without extra configuration.

This stuff is everywhere. reply 0ct4via 15 hours agorootparentprevYes and no -- yes, theoretically the output should only be based on the input - if you input 1+3 instead of 1+2, the answer given should be 4, not 3.Optimization exists though, and an interface and search algorithm isn&#x27;t a simple calculator. Suggesting the correct term when you misspell or mistype something is precision -- it&#x27;s both identifying the lack of results for your erroneous input, and suggesting the correct input to get the result you&#x27;re most likely searching for.That&#x27;s literally the point of optimization. If Search was still the same as it was in the late 90&#x27;s, Google wouldn&#x27;t be able to do half the things it does.Are you going to make similar gripes about autocomplete, or GPS that reroutes when you fail to make the planned&#x2F;\"correct\" turn?Comparing an intelligent and contextual search interface and result, with simple arithmetic, is a patently false analogy. reply kristopolous 11 hours agorootparent> That&#x27;s literally the point of optimization.

I never use autocomplete as it is vapid and incorrect. Also I don&#x27;t use gps routing because it does this.The \"smart\" rotates and \"smart\" zooms around the screen ignoring my input isn&#x27;t desired.These systems presume the user is profoundly, unbelievably stupid and can&#x27;t, for instance, understand cardinal directions.It&#x27;s why when you enter a url like \"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;somesite.com.:80&#x2F;\" it will be like \"well I think you meant https:&#x2F;&#x2F;somesite.com\" and then just ignore all your very explicit protocol and port instructions and whisk you off to an https, even if it&#x27;s broken and doesn&#x27;t work or similarly if you explicitly select a subsection of a url that starts at the first character, it will invisibly tact on the protocol to the beginning of your selection to be helpful ... as if the user is helplessly befuddled and perplexed by the protocol syntax.These aren&#x27;t optimizations or improvements. They&#x27;re diffusive and reductive interfaces that disempower the user, they&#x27;re everywhere now and it&#x27;s why everything sucks.Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re advocating for in the physical world - a smart flathead screwdriver that can&#x27;t be used to pry or wedge anything. In fact, if you try to do that it will have special built in motors and then work against your intentions, wobbling around looking for a flathead screw and then refusing to work if it can&#x27;t find any.Presuming the user is a completely incompetent clumsy dumbfuck and ONLY working under that modality is not an improvement.

When all this stuff was new and interesting, you did a Google search to find stuff. Sometimes, by law of probability, that stuff was indeed something you wanted to buy. Now, all queries are subject to change so they can put a product that paid them for exposure in front of you, completely irrespective to if that product is relevant to your search or will solve a problem for you. Social media feeds used to be a chronological timeline of things your friends posted; now they are a selection, made by an algorithm you cannot interrogate, of the \"most interesting\" (judged on metrics you do not set and have no control over) things your friends have posted.

A new spot springs up, a new gathering spot that promises to be better, and it gains traction because everyone is so sick of the rest of it, and then in short order once enough people frequent it, the ads go up, the beggars appear, your friends are hidden behind a cylinder of recommended bullshit that surrounds you, and it joins the cavalcade of endless irrelevant nonsense that makes up the spaces you fled, just in time for the next one to pop up nextdoor promising it won&#x27;t do the same.God I am sick of the Internet.Also apologies for the tangent. reply stainablesteel 12 hours agoparentprevi see this as a failure of the marketing machine worrying too much about what people think rather than how to make money reply cma 14 hours agoparentprev+ was simply replace with \"\".

Here are 3 possible explanations for what you remember:Google search will return results that match the quoted query only through invisible text. So you you might get a result that seems to not contain your text, but if you check the source code or the DOM, the text will be there, hidden.When checking for equality, search will ignore certain punctuation and HTML.

You&#x27;re welcome to wonder all you like, but in this case the obvious answer is the correct one.

Read the article, come to your own conclusion.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;3a0wY#selection-715.112-715.649When I read that I was floored - not because I expected even remotely that it might be true, but because I couldn&#x27;t believe just how far Wired&#x27;s quality bar had fallen. It doesn&#x27;t read like a piece written by someone who&#x27;s familiar with how the internet works. reply mst 16 hours agorootparentprevThe article seemed very strange to me, so I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been pulled.(my overriding thought as I read it being \"I&#x27;m sure google does assorted morally dubious things in this area but this really doesn&#x27;t seem like their style of evil, and I suspect the article is either a misrepresentation or mistaken\") reply rockskon 15 hours agorootparentMy point is that it&#x27;s highly unusual for a news outlet to outright remove an article as opposed to editing it and giving a note explaining why. Or a note saying the article is not accurate but leaving it up for historical purposes. reply curiousObject 18 hours agoprevHere’s a quick summary of the main points, I copied from the deleted Wired article [0].Something important about it is this article, by Megan Gray was in Wired’s Opinion section which usually means the writer has more freedom to express their own opinions, and Wired does not claim this it is accurate reporting. But still it was removed.How Google Alters Search Queries to Get at Your WalletTestimony during Google’s antitrust case revealed that the company may be altering billions of queries a day to generate results that will get you to buy more stuff.RECENTLY, A STARTLING piece of information came to light in the ongoing antitrust case against Google. During one employee’s testimony, a key exhibit momentarily flashed on a projector … [1]This onscreen Google slide had to do with a “semantic matching” overhaul to its SERP algorithm. When you enter a query, you might expect a search engine to incorporate synonyms into the algorithm as well as text phrase pairings in natural language processing. But this overhaul went further, actually altering queries to generate more commercial results …The “10 blue links,” or organic results, which Google has always claimed to be sacrosanct, are just another vector for Google greediness …Google likely alters queries billions of times a day in trillions of different variations. Here’s how it works. Say you search for “children’s clothing.” Google converts it, without your knowledge, to a search for “NIKOLAI-brand kidswear,” making a behind-the-scenes substitution of your actual query with a different query that just happens to generate more money for the company, and will generate results you weren’t searching for at all …[0] Complete article here - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37802265[1] A link to the actual slide, that she saw. This image was supplied later by Google apparently - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37802302Edit: my opinion is Google should respond to the accusations. Removal of the article without a detailed explanation looks real bad for Google and also for Wired reply _cs2017_ 18 hours agoparentHoly shit, this article is such garbage.And not only is it incorrect, it is obviously incorrect. The website owners do not pay Google for clicks on the \"10 blue [organic] links\"; so it gives Google no business advantage to make them more commercial. reply 93po 14 hours agorootparentThe author is not saying that.

It still makes no sense though. reply curiousObject 17 hours agorootparentprevThe implication is that you’re being unwittingly directly channeled to certain sellers sites, instead of to sites that link to various sellers, I guess.So the path to a potential sale is shorter and you’re more likely to buy (less time to get decision fatigue), and certain vendors might be prioritized.I think that’s what she is implying reply spondylosaurus 16 hours agorootparentThat sounds like an accurate summary of what she&#x27;s implying, but her implication makes no sense. Levi&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pay Google for directing people to their site (unless it&#x27;s through an ad, of course). reply 93po 14 hours agorootparentI am positive Levi&#x27;s pays for ads on google and google has incentives to show increased sales for Levi&#x27;s as a result of that advertising reply spondylosaurus 14 hours agorootparent(1) Why? Ads are charged per click&#x2F;impression, not per sale.(2) How would you feasibly create a link between every brand who advertises with you and every brand whose site you&#x27;re trying to uprank? What happens when two different brands who advertise with you appear in the same results?(3) Most importantly, is there any proof at all that Google is upranking organic links on behalf of brands who advertise with them? (I don&#x27;t think there is.) reply thayne 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause google is also a broker for ads on many other sites. So there is an incentive to prefer sites that use google&#x27;s ads products. reply kevinh 18 hours agoprevThis tweet apparently shows the slide in question: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;adamkovac&#x2F;status&#x2F;1710041764910846061 reply thanhhaimai 18 hours agoparentIsn&#x27;t this the keyword rewrite that had existed for decades? I remember they showing us similar slides during orientation back when I first interned more than a decade ago. The transformation from \"kids\" to \"children\" or \"clothing\" to \"apparel&#x2F;outfit\" improves search results by adding more potential hits. reply probably_wrong 18 hours agorootparentI am willing to believe that, in this particular instance, there is no evil intent behind the rewrite of search terms.Having said that, the fact that Google goes back and forth on whether they respect the use of quotes to search for literal results doesn&#x27;t make them any favors.If I wanted to do what the article claims Google did, I would do precisely what Google is doing. So no surprises there. reply cj 17 hours agorootparent> there is no evil intentI think the only way to know this is to understand whether google’s rewrites also impact what ads are eligible to show.E.g. if 50 advertisers are bidding on “children apparel” and only 10 advertisers are bidding on “kids clothes”, then rewriting to the query with more eligible ad impressions is misleading to both the user and the advertiser.Certain keywords are more profitable than others. Google knows this. One sure-fire guaranteed way to increase revenue is to reduce the % of long tail searches (since long tail searches typically have no ads at all) by modifying queries and swapping words around.If I were a desperate exec at Google, that’s the first place I would look if I was in a crunch to boost revenue short-term. reply LorenPechtel 17 hours agorootparentRewriting makes sense if they do the same thing to the material being searched. It has been obvious to me that the ads do more generic matching than the search results but I do not consider that to be evil.I just wish they would leave alone the modifiers we can apply to actual search results. (And, for Google Translate, allow specifying that adult results are acceptable. Normally, with a term that can be adult or not you only get non-adult results but it&#x27;s easy enough to throw in an explicitly adult term to fix that. Throwing in extra terms doesn&#x27;t work so well with translate--that means it&#x27;s basically impossible to get the adult result for an ambiguous word. What&#x27;s the dirty word for the male reproductive organ? English has no unambiguous word for this, thus the translation is impossible.) reply Qwertious 17 hours agorootparentprev>> there is no evil intent>I think the only way to know this is to understand whether google’s rewrites also impact what ads are eligible to show.The other way to know is to ask Google directly (i.e. ask the company, not the search engine) and for them to explain what they&#x27;re doing and why, in the name of transparency.

    "originBody": "Product Research Company News Careers Research Interpretability Decomposing Language Models Into Understandable Components Oct 5, 2023 Neural networks are trained on data, not programmed to follow rules. With each step of training, millions or billions of parameters are updated to make the model better at tasks, and by the end, the model is capable of a dizzying array of behaviors. We understand the math of the trained network exactly – each neuron in a neural network performs simple arithmetic – but we don't understand why those mathematical operations result in the behaviors we see. This makes it hard to diagnose failure modes, hard to know how to fix them, and hard to certify that a model is truly safe. Neuroscientists face a similar problem with understanding the biological basis for human behavior. The neurons firing in a person's brain must somehow implement their thoughts, feelings, and decision-making. Decades of neuroscience research has revealed a lot about how the brain works, and enabled targeted treatments for diseases such as epilepsy, but much remains mysterious. Luckily for those of us trying to understand artificial neural networks, experiments are much, much easier to run. We can simultaneously record the activation of every neuron in the network, intervene by silencing or stimulating them, and test the network's response to any possible input. Unfortunately, it turns out that the individual neurons do not have consistent relationships to network behavior. For example, a single neuron in a small language model is active in many unrelated contexts, including: academic citations, English dialogue, HTTP requests, and Korean text. In a classic vision model, a single neuron responds to faces of cats and fronts of cars. The activation of one neuron can mean different things in different contexts. In our latest paper, Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning, we outline evidence that there are better units of analysis than individual neurons, and we have built machinery that lets us find these units in small transformer models. These units, called features, correspond to patterns (linear combinations) of neuron activations. This provides a path to breaking down complex neural networks into parts we can understand, and builds on previous efforts to interpret high-dimensional systems in neuroscience, machine learning, and statistics. In a transformer language model, we decompose a layer with 512 neurons into more than 4000 features which separately represent things like DNA sequences, legal language, HTTP requests, Hebrew text, nutrition statements, and much, much more. Most of these model properties are invisible when looking at the activations of individual neurons in isolation. To validate that the features we find are significantly more interpretable than the model's neurons, we have a blinded human evaluator score their interpretability. The features (red) have much higher scores than the neurons (teal). We additionally take an \"autointerpretability\" approach by using a large language model to generate short descriptions of the small model's features, which we score based on another model's ability to predict a feature's activations based on that description. Again, the features score higher than the neurons, providing additional evidence that the activations of features and their downstream effects on model behavior have a consistent interpretation. Features also offer a targeted way to steer models. As shown below, artificially activating a feature causes the model behavior to change in predictable ways. Finally, we zoom out and look at the feature set as a whole. We find that the features that are learned are largely universal between different models, so the lessons learned by studying the features in one model may generalize to others. We also experiment with tuning the number of features we learn. We find this provides a \"knob\" for varying the resolution at which we see the model: decomposing the model into a small set of features offers a coarse view that is easier to understand, and decomposing it into a large set of features offers a more refined view revealing subtle model properties. This work is a result of Anthropic’s investment in Mechanistic Interpretability – one of our longest-term research bets on AI safety. Until now, the fact that individual neurons were uninterpretable presented a serious roadblock to a mechanistic understanding of language models. Decomposing groups of neurons into interpretable features has the potential to move past that roadblock. We hope this will eventually enable us to monitor and steer model behavior from the inside, improving the safety and reliability essential for enterprise and societal adoption. Our next challenge is to scale this approach up from the small model we demonstrate success on to frontier models which are many times larger and substantially more complicated. For the first time, we feel that the next primary obstacle to interpreting large language models is engineering rather than science. To learn more about all of this, read our paper, Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning.

I was expecting to find clusters of parameters very much alike to what they observe.I informally call this problem inverting an LLM, and obv., it turns out to be non-trivial to solve. Not completely impossible, tho! as so far I&#x27;ve found some good approximations to it.Anyway, quite an interesting read, def. will keep an eye on what they publish in the future.Also, from the linked manuscript at the end,>Another hypothesis is that some features are actually higher-dimensional feature manifolds which dictionary learning is approximating.Well, you have something that behaves like a continuous, smooth space so you could define as many manifolds as you&#x27;d need to suit your needs, so yes :^). But, pedantry off, I get the idea and IMO that&#x27;s definitely what&#x27;s going on and the right framework to approach this problem from.One amazing realization one can get from this is, what is the conceptual equivalent of the transition functions that connect all different manifolds in this LLM space?

Would the network when training discover and make use of these predefined components, or would it ignore them and make up its own ways of detecting DNA sequences? reply IanCal 1 hour agoparentThis is called feature engineering if you want to look up more of a history and use of this idea.Edit - tokenising is a form of this, you&#x27;re pre-transforming the data to save it having to learn patterns you know are important. reply astrange 2 hours agoparentprevYou can manually program transformers:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srush.github.io&#x2F;raspy&#x2F;I don&#x27;t know if you can integrate them into a model. I think you might run out of space, since these aren&#x27;t polysemantic and so would take up a lot more \"room\" than learned neurons. reply btown 3 hours agoparentprevIn a way, this could be considered adding a speculative transformation of the input as part of the input to some layer, and the network deciding whether or not to use that transformation. It would be akin to a convolution layer in a CNN, albeit far more domain-specific. But I’m not sure how much research has been done on weird layers like this! reply WiSaGaN 4 hours agoparentprevThis is indeed interesting. In certain use cases where precision is paramount, we might opt for manually crafted code for the computations. This allows us to be confident in the efficiency of our manual method, rather than relying on LLM for such a specific task. However, it remains unclear whether this would be directly integrated with the network or simply be a tool at LLM&#x27;s disposal. Interestingly, this situation seems to parallel the choice between enhancing the human brain with something like Neuralink and simply equipping with a calculator. reply drsopp 4 hours agorootparentI wonder what the limitations are. Do LLM&#x27;s have Turing completeness? reply DennisP 8 hours agoprevThis looks like a big advance in alignment research. A big problem has been that LLMs were just a giant set of inscrutable numbers, and we had no idea what was going on inside.But if this technique scales up, then Anthropic has fixed that. They can figure out what different groups of neurons are actually doing, and use that to control the LLM&#x27;s behavior. That could help with preventing accidentally misaligned AIs. reply Animats 2 hours agoparent> We find that the features that are learned are largely universal between different models, so the lessons learned by studying the features in one model may generalize to others.Hm. I wish they&#x27;d said more about that. Does that mean they found the same feature recognizers when training with the same training set? Or what?

Or maybe tune features that have redundant capacity or something.Maybe by studying the features they will get to the point where the knowledge can be distilled into something more like a very rich and finely defined knowledge graph. reply quickthrower2 5 hours agoparentAnthropic must be walking on multi-dimensional tightropes. They want AI safety, and probably want to avoid every Tom, Dick and Harry having a powerful model.

Photograph: Lauren Nassef/AP Chicago At least 1,000 birds died from colliding with one Chicago building in one day McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, is largely covered with glass, making it a lethal obstacle for birds Aliya Uteuova Sat 7 Oct 2023 10.00 BST At least 1,000 birds died from colliding into a single building in Chicago on Thursday, 5 October, as they migrated south to their wintering grounds. Volunteers are still recovering bird carcasses within 1.5 miles of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, which is largely covered with glass. New York’s plan to save birds from crashing into buildings: lights out Read more “It’s the tip of an iceberg but it’s it’s a huge, huge amount of birds we found both dead and injured,” said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, adding that this was the highest number of bird strikes that the group recorded from the grounds of one building in a single day. From late Wednesday, 4 October, through early Thursday, 5 October, a peak estimate of 1.5 million birds were in the air over Cook county, home to the Chicago metropolitan area. Carcasses of Tennessee warblers, hermit thrush, American woodcocks and other varieties of songbirds were recovered. “Not every bird that hits the window is going to leave behind a body,” said Brendon Samuels, who researches bird window collisions at the University of Western Ontario. He noted that the true extent of affected birds will unravel over a couple of days as people continue to pick up birds around downtown Chicago. “In fact, we often see birds collide with glass and they continue flying some distance away, seriously injured in ways that ultimately they won’t survive past a few hours,” Samuels added. Birds dying in large numbers in a small geographic area tends to occur during peak migration periods in spring and fall. Weather conditions like opposing wind, rain and fog can make it difficult for birds to orientate themselves, in addition to light pollution from cities that can draw them in and trap them among deadly structures. “Anywhere you’ve got glass, you’re gonna have birds hitting the windows,” said Bryan Lenz at the American Bird Conservancy. Annually, up to a billion birds die due to collisions, and in the case of Chicago, the dead and injured birds were most likely flying from Canada en route to South and Central America. Everywhere birds visit, they perform essential ecosystem services that have economic value and are necessary for the functioning of ecosystems. Following major wildfires like those in Canada, birds that return to burned areas can disperse seeds and aid forest landscape regeneration. Global increases in temperatures contribute to the increase in insect populations, and birds that feed on them can help curb the issues that pose a threat for humans and food systems. Of all cities in the US, Chicago’s light pollution poses the greatest risk for migrating birds. Turning off building lights is one way to reduce fatalities. A 2021 study done in McCormick Place, the same site of Thursday’s bird deaths, found that shutting off half the lights in large buildings can reduce collisions by six to 11 times. McCormick Place is a participant of the Lights Out Chicago program, which has buildings voluntarily switch off or dim lights at night unless someone is inside. “It is important to understand that there is an event going on at Lakeside Center [part of McCormick Place] this week, so, therefore, the lights have been on when occupied. Once the space is unoccupied, the lights have been turned off,” said a representative from McCormick Place. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having window glass with visual markers like dots or patterns can break up the appearance of reflection and let birds recognize whether there is a safe passage for them to fly through. In 2020, Chicago approved a bird-friendly design ordinance but it is yet to take effect. In 2021, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, signed the Bird Safe Buildings Act, which “requires bird-friendly design to be incorporated into the construction and renovation of state-owned buildings” in the state, per Audubon.org. “We have a lot of existing buildings that are killing birds, not just new construction,” said Samuels, adding that investments in retrofits, creating tax credits for such environmental initiatives and making windows more bird-friendly can be an economical way to solve this. “We already have solutions, we just need to put those into policy.” Explore more on these topics Chicago Birds Illinois Wildlife Animals news Reuse this content Most viewed Environment Climate crisis Wildlife Energy Pollution News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The three-story glass lobby had its glass wall raked outwards by 30*. If you approached the glass from inside then your feet would contact it before your face, which really helped at night when outside was brighter than the interior. And birds on the outside would see a reflection of the ground rather than transparent glass. All seemed good. Until a convention of blind people booked the lobby for a meeting. When they approached the building from the outside, their canes did not detect the glass wall prior to their faces smacking into it. We hurriedly erected foot-high barriers so their canes has something to see before impact. reply KolmogorovComp 16 hours agoparentThe Toronto Best Practice for Bird-Friendly building design [0] states that “due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness, angled glass is no longer an acceptable way of compliance [for bird safety]”.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toronto.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;8d1c-Bird-...

That eliminates the greenish tint in thick glass and is harder to see. reply giantrobot 14 hours agorootparentThe glass was very transparent&#x2F;untinted so I&#x27;d guess they did. Inside the atriums between sections don&#x27;t have any tint from the glass or at least it&#x27;s not noticeable.When my group first moved in the glass was ridiculously hard to see between the sections. It was made more confusing because the doorways had four panes of glass but only the center two panes were doors. It was easy early on to think the outermost lanes were also doors. IIRC (it&#x27;s been a few years) one of the walkway runs didn&#x27;t require badge access in the first few days so people could walk full speed into the doors without diverting to the badge reader on the wall.I&#x27;m sure all of Apple Park looked amazing in AutoCAD fly-thrus or whatever but the experience in the building was kind of shitty. Some aspects were improvements over the building over off Infinite Loop but then a lot of aspects were hilariously form over function. reply tomcam 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m guessing temperature control would be rough there most of the year, when it&#x27;s sunny? Also what were the other issues you had with the building? reply giantrobot 9 hours agorootparentIn terms of temperature it could get uncomfortable in the hallways and open seating areas if it was really hot outside. The shared office spaces could get stuffy and a bit oppressive if you had a lot of people or equipment in them. A couple Mac Pros running CI jobs could make a room very uncomfortable. Depending on where you were in the building you might get blinding sunlight in the afternoon.One of the bigger problems with the building was the size, no pun intended. Despite its size space was always at a premium. Instead of nice private offices most people work in shitty bull pen \"offices\". Even normal offices have giant glass walls so you feel like you&#x27;re in a menagerie and they&#x27;re shared to boot. Of course management got single offices. If the stupid design didn&#x27;t waste so much space trying to get \"natural\" light (supplemented by shitty low-flow electric lighting) everyone could have had real offices. The site itself is also gigantic meaning everything was a long walk away.Getting a nice walk in is great but if you parked in the south parking structure it was a ten-ish minute walk to your car. Then another couple minutes to get to the street. It made running an errand in the middle of the day of eating off-site untenable. When it hot, smokey, or raining the walks to the parking structure really sucked. reply tomcam 7 hours agorootparentI sort of suspected to be something along those lines but, wow… that is unfortunate. replynicolaslem 21 hours agoprevI highly encourage anyone who had birds crash on their windows to install white dot stickers. I installed some last spring on my windows and not a single bird crashed on them since.At first they look a bit odd, but after a week they were almost invisible, turns out the brain is really good at hiding things we don&#x27;t care to see. They are a bit of a pain to install but it is well worth the effort. reply xoa 20 hours agoparentWorth mentioning there are pricier but even more invisible, similar idea solutions. I&#x27;ve got stickers I put on my house and have suggested to clients that are translucent in the visible spectrum but strongly reflect UV. Lots of birds (and in particular songbirds, these are on rural residential buildings with no more than 3 stories so raptors aren&#x27;t going into them) have receptors for ultraviolet, so to them the stickers look opaque glowing white. They&#x27;re effective and may be more aesthetic, though again more expensive (they need to be replaced every 6-9 months, the chemical that reflects UV breaks down). Another approach I&#x27;ve used is a sticker that simulates a golden spider web. While not translucent, the thin web look is very subtle, but apparently a lot of birds have evolved to be very hard wired to avoid flying through heavy spider webs so it triggers an avoidance response well.Finally, there are bug screens that have gotten very subtle too (high density thin weave with low visibility materials used in their construction). As well as reducing external reflection, those will just plain act as a softer shock absorber if a bird runs into one. And of course keep out insects, so doing their job anyway.I&#x27;ll add that I still do have (far fewer) bird hits once in awhile, but the big change seems to be outcome. Before a lot of birds died. Afterwards what seems to happen is the hits still see it at the last moment, and the hits have 99% turned into bellyflops. Not fun for the bird no doubt, but it also isn&#x27;t lethal, they just fly away. Bird death in my experience is generally caused by broken necks, they fly in head first and their neck snaps and that&#x27;s it. So even if they swerve as the very last moment, it&#x27;s still a huge boost in survivability. On a big building it might help to have some nets out of sight below windows though so that birds which are temporarily stunned don&#x27;t fall all the way to the ground. reply dtgriscom 19 hours agorootparentThe UV stickers sound interesting, but is there a (human-)visual indication that they&#x27;ve stopped working? If not, there&#x27;ll be a whole lot of useless dots on windows, making owners feel better but not actually helping anything. reply theptip 19 hours agorootparentPresumably you get the auditory indication of birds resuming their collisions with your window. reply xoa 19 hours agorootparentprevUnless you have a UV camera then no, there is no indication to humans [0]. Though as sibling said, if nothing else you&#x27;d have the obvious direct grim evidence if they had failed. But at the same time I&#x27;ve not found it a concern in practice, there&#x27;s plenty of stuff in a household that simply needs to be replaced&#x2F;renewed on an annual or semi-annual basis with no particular indicator before failure. Just part of building maintenance. I set an annual calendar notification and roll it into spring&#x2F;fall cleanup lists along with things like gutter cleaning. They don&#x27;t just fail at wildly varying rates, it&#x27;s a straight forward curve of breakdown so when it says \"replace these every 6 months\" one can just do that.----0: FWIW you can get basic simple monochrome UV-USB 1080p cameras (350-380nm range or so, to get down to 300nm requires much more expensive lenses) to play with forUV reply p1mrx 17 hours agorootparent> It was an IV line that was visible by the camera but not by the eye.If you can&#x27;t see infraviolet, consider taking a colorblind test. reply vijayr02 15 hours agorootparentSince we&#x27;re all being pedantic: infrared is also infraviolet reply Eduard 9 hours agorootparentTIL I&#x27;m capable to perceive light in the ultrared infraviolet spectrum. reply Intralexical 17 hours agorootparentprev> infraviolet…Blue? reply callalex 13 hours agorootparentIndigo, the made-up color that only exists to make the acronym slightly pronounceable. reply gus_massa 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks.

They will see similarly-sized deer in any vertical glass surface (their own reflection) and charge the window antlers-first. They break through the glass and now you have a deer running around inside your house or school. A few stickers won&#x27;t stop them from seeing their reflection, but it will put an \"object\" between them and thereby stop the charge. I&#x27;ve even seen this in car windows. Tall deer (elk) are so dumb that they will repeatedly charge the tiny elk reflected in a car window. They aren&#x27;t attacking the car but the other elk they think is inside.

Temperature dropped 30 degrees. Birds had been enjoying the warm weather and then the sudden change had them all migrating at once. They ran into a rainstorm which made migration very difficult (this is called fallout). So now you&#x27;ve got tons of birds struggling to migrate and aiui flying at lower altitude because of the rainMcCormick (the building in question) is a very large building immediately off the lake with lots of glass windows. There may be some additional mitigations to be made but it&#x27;s a bad confluence of events. It doesn&#x27;t happen even once a decade.This is an important migration corridor, there&#x27;s even a nice bird sanctuary within site of McCormick.

The bigger problem would be cost. The building in the article is McCormick place which was hit pretty hard during Covid and is likely still recovering (financially.) But no business is likely to spend the $$$ to mitigate the issue unless they are forced.The bigger problem is that this is not the only building in Chicago that is hazardous to birds. Fix this one and there will be another noteworthy for the \"most bird strikes\" in Chicago. reply xnx 16 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t realize it was McCormick place when I posted. That building is probably particularly bad because it&#x27;s right on the shore of Lake Michigan (a bird migration superhighway). Ironically&#x2F;tragically, the situation might have been made worse in recent years by the reestablishment of native plants in the immediately surround area. I&#x27;m certainly no expert, but I wondered if temporary whitewash might be more amenable to the building owner than something more permanent. It is a massive building complex, but might even only be necessary to do the north facing side.

    "originBody": "Ludicity Your Organization Probably Doesn't Want To Improve Things Published on October 8, 2023 Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably isn't to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn't obvious to everyone, it's worth writing about. I now believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap, frequently vast, between what is being said by a person and what is being felt, and how this discrepancy applies to organizations too. It was sparked by reference to a concept called the honne-tatemae divide, which are Japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public. I don't actually know anything about the Japanese context beyond this one Wikipedia article, so this has been dropped entirely so that I seem worldly and to give us vocabulary less onerous than \"what you really think\" and \"what you're forced to say\". I. Tatemae I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be data driven. I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction. Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could actually train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts. There are a handful of people who do amazing things in Power BI, but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are really just dragging-and-dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet, being paid absolutely exorbitantly, and then if they're smart, going home and despairing. This is because Power BI tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused. My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. Of those being visited, it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day. I'd estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1,000,000, for an organization that supposedly can't afford to waste that money. Why? Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and say that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. We are going through a \"digital transformation\", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past. II. Honne There are two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate of nonsense at organizations. I. Sturgeon's Law The first one is very simple, and I sometimes lose sight of it while I'm deep in the theory mines of incentives and other smarter takes. 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything. Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting), most programmers don't know what an abstraction is, etc, etc. This is the overwhelming factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows. I used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit - as in, olympic fencing, with the swords. It never occurred to me for even a goddamn second that we could win competitions without having good, smart people that understood the sport and trained hard. If we lose because Derek didn't turn up to practice for six months, I might be pissed off and upset, but I am not spiritually confused about why my efforts aren't rewarding me. I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens. Derek will repeat whatever brain-dead thing is in vogue but they are very stupid and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular, plus will never question that they have never had an unambiguous success over their entire career. This means they will inevitably become promoted over time, because unlike the rest of us who have to put in effort and pay what a friend of mine terms soul cost to act like a sycophant, they believe it sincerely. II. Sturgeon's Law Again Here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs - you're surrounded by people that are crud. Don't get me wrong - I am that terrible person at many things. There are fencing teams where I'd be absolute dead weight. My piano playing leaves much to be desired. Last week, I managed to stub the little toe on both feet, on the same day, on two separate occasions, and I have on at least one occasion absentmindedly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of a tea bag. However I don't do any of that professionally. In professional settings, approximately all of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just indescribably bad. I work on a platform that cost my organization an eye-watering sum of money to produce, over the span of two years, and the engineers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure, so we now have a spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess. Can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked? Is there any chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results? Obviously not. Do most teams at large organizations have at least one person like that? Sweet merciful Christ, in both my first, second, and perhaps even third-hand experience, whatever that means, it's possible that half of all teams consist entirely of that person. Can my manager keep their job if they honestly say \"There is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives\"? Fuck no, if they did that they'd be gone, so the system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless, too perversely incentivized to be honest, or too deep into despair to admit to themselves it is hopeless. III. Ignoring Is Bliss From the Tao of Programming: A novice asked the Master: \"In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?\" The Master replied: \"You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?\" I quote the above because it is very funny, and because the only thing that has brought me clarity is totally ignoring anything management says unless I have a very good reason to believe the person I am speaking to has intelligence, integrity, and has come to terms with the fact that large organizations are inherently dysfunctional, which happens rarely. I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical. While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it. Management saying there was no budget meant nothing - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The only thing an organization can do that means anything is actually solving your problem, and any words to the effect of \"we'll address your concerns soon\" or \"we just need to do some planning around this\", etc, should just be ignored wholesale. These days, I ignore everything they've said about salary (I just state a number and don't budge, and they usually just give me what I want despite saying it was impossible), I ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build (I don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's a team I'd like to join because I know it isn't trustworthy), and frankly, sometimes I just ignore them because fuck 'em, why not? Similarly, I let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever. These are the endless gyrations of the great tree structure, rustling in the wind. Actually remove the staff that no one works to work with or who terrorize their subordinates and I'll know you're serious about performance. Reward people for staying, and I'll know you're serious about valuing people. Anything short of that is less than worthless, because you've wasted valuable time I could have been listening to music. It's much more peaceful to solve a few problems, not waste a single iota of my energy on creating systemic change unless we're going to try curing cancer, then log off to touch grass. Realizing that no mere words can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life - hopefully it does the same for someone else.

It is the answer 99% of the time, I know quite a few high-profile managers at this point and they are all very smart and get stuff done people and yet they allow themselves be dragged into endless meetings and they know the script (that the OP author is referring to several times) and they recite it by heart. Because if they don&#x27;t, their manager is going to think they are useless and will inevitably fire them.People find a cushy place to work in with a good salary, then just work their way up the economical ladder (or the organizational) and will do anything that&#x27;s needed to achieve that goal. It&#x27;s as simple as that, and I am convinced that a good chunk of these people (probably 20%-30%) are very well aware they are bullshitters but they think they have no choice.At the same time, I&#x27;ve known a few company owners long time ago who were just BEGGING their managers to tell them the problems exactly as they are, swore on their lives they will not fire the managers for bringing them bad news (and made contracts that made sure of it in no uncertain terms)... and yet all of the managers below those people were sycophant yes-men.Quite tragic really.

We have a core business that generates amounts of money large enough to fund departments that do nothing other than reaffirm that we care about whatever that department is supposed to do.

I know this for a fact because I’ve witnessed it happen to many people as they mature as workers and also noticed it in myself. I can’t prove it’s not related to age, or position in life (eg a young single person eager to prove themselves at work, vs someone who prioritizes family) but I know firsthand that there are at least some experienced workers with families, responsibilities, and hobbies that manage to stay focused and engaged for a long time.I expect some pushback against this, but I really do think this phenomenon - whatever you want to call it - is the basis for ageism. It frankly is a real, observable thing that life has a way of beating the passion out of people into a point they see their job as clock-in, clock-out. It doesn’t happen to everyone of course.

As soon as further-away managers start reaching in and \"fiddling\" with it, from their prideless vantage post where everything is just a system to accomplish quarterly goals, the family-feeling fades away and it goes back to soul-crushing pointlessness. reply imkehno 36 minutes agorootparentYeah, this is what I’ve also experienced. You can have a great team, and a lot of influence in that team context. Scaling up that common feeling from 5-10 people gets harder.

Lasted 3 months.And it was not my imagination, I was complimented and groomed into thinking they are hiring an expert to help them with difficult problems. Immediately after I made one huge PR (120-ish files diff) that helped them resolve a very thorny problem, and after it was approved by the CTO and several other seniors, and after I was complimented of the quality of my work... I got reassigned to a new project where I was ordered to pull tickets and not even formulate tasks, and to just \"do what I am told\".I didn&#x27;t even last two months when put in that position. Me and the CTO very quickly hated each other and he started acting like he never said the things he did during the interviews, and me leaving was a relief for everyone, myself the most. reply cratermoon 5 hours agorootparentExactly what happened to me, but lasted 6 months. If the middle of the contract hadn&#x27;t fallen over the US holiday season, when everyone kind of went into a holding pattern because some industries are just that way, it&#x27;s entirely possible the contract would have been just 3 months.The organization, at some level, clearly never wanted me to solve the issues I was supposedly brought in to address, but give them cover to say they hired help. After some reflection, I&#x27;m starting to think the project was never really expected to succeed in any significant way. The company claimed they were trying to build an in-house replacement for a third party system the vendor no longer supported, but it&#x27;s possible they just wanted a stop-gap while they found another turn-key vendor.

I’ve met a lot of engineers that think they were hired to perfect the art of software engineering. Not the case, not unless that is your mantra and you work at FAANG or Big Blue.The rest of the 90% have to deliver value. For managers, that’s getting the product&#x2F;service&#x2F;research out the door.

    "originBody": "WHAT IS IT ? FEATURES DOCUMENTATION BRIEF TOUR The Berry Script Language. Try Online GitHub What is it ? Berry is a ultra-lightweight dynamically typed embedded scripting language. It is designed for lower-performance embedded devices. The Berry interpreter-core's code size is less than 40KiB and can run on less than 4KiB heap (on ARM Cortex M4 CPU, Thumb ISA and ARMCC compiler). The interpreter of Berry include a one-pass compiler and register-based VM, all the code is written in ANSI C99. In Berry not every type is a class object. Some simple value types, such as int, real, boolean and string are not class object, but list, map and range are class object. This is a consideration about performance. Register-based VM is the same meaning as above. Berry has the following advantages Lightweight A well-optimized interpreter with very little resources. Ideal for use in microprocessors. Fast Optimized one-pass bytecode compiler and register-based virtual machine. Powerful Supports imperative programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming. Flexible Berry is a dynamic type script, and it's intended for embedding in applications. It can provide good dynamic scalability for the host system. Simple Simple and natural syntax, support garbage collection, and easy to use FFI (foreign function interface). RAM saving With compile-time object construction, most of the constant objects are stored in read-only code data segments, so the RAM usage of the interpreter is very low when it starts. Documentation LaTeX documents repository: https://github.com/Skiars/berry_doc Short Manual: berry_short_manual.pdf. Reference Manual: berry_rm_en_us.pdf, berry_rm_zh_cn.pdf. Berry's EBNF grammar definition: tools/grammar/berry.ebnf Features Base Type Nil: nil Boolean: true and false Numerical: Integer (int) and Real (real) String: Single quotation-mark string and double quotation-mark string Class: Instance template, read only Instance: Object constructed by class Module: Read-write key-value pair table List: Ordered container, like [1, 2, 3] Map: Hash Map container, like { 'a': 1, 2: 3, 'map': {} } Range: include a lower and a upper integer value, like 0..5 Operator and Expression Assign operator: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, >= Relational operator: , >= Logic operator: &&, ||, ! Arithmetic operator: +, -, *, /, % Bitwise operator: &, |, ~, ^, > Field operator: . Subscript operator: [] Connect string operator: + Conditional operator: ? : Brackets: () Control Structure Conditional statement: if-else Iteration statement: while and for Jump statement: break and continue Function Local variable and block scope Return statement Nested functions definition Closure based on Upvalue Anonymous function Lambda expression Class Inheritance (only public single inheritance) Method and Operator Overload Constructor method Destructive method Module Management Built-in module that takes almost no RAM Extension module support: script module, bytecode file module and shared library (like *.so, *.dll) module GC (Garbage collection) Mark-Sweep GC Exceptional Handling Throw any exception value using the raise statement Multiple catch mode Bytecode file support Load the bytecode file and execute Brief tour Simple and intuitive syntax The Berry language syntax is similar to that of high-level languages and will be familiar to most programmers. var list = [ \"Hello\", \"World\" ] for text : list print(text) end Map Instance The map class is a built-in class type that is used to provide an unordered container of key-value pairs. Within the Berry interpreter, map map uses the Hash table to implement. You can use key-value pairs to construct a map container. var map = { 'greets': def() return 'Hi! Berry' end (), 'say' : 'Hello World', 'sum' : 10 + 50 } for i : map.keys() print(i, \"\\t=>\", map[i]) end Object Orientation To use a class, you must first declare it. The declaration of a class begins with the keyword class. The member variables and methods of the class must be specified in the declaration. This is an example of class declaration: import string class Parent #- member variables -# var fname var cname #- constructor -# def init() self.fname = 'Darth vader' end #- Method -# def say() return string.format( '%s say\\n%s %s', self.fname, self.cname, \"i'm your father\" ) end end Class inheritance Berry only supports single inheritance, that is, a class can only have one base class, and the base class uses the operator : to declare : Here the Child class inherits from the Parent class. The subclass will inherit all the methods and properties of the Parent class, and you can override them in the subclass. This mechanism is called Overload. class Child : Parent #- constructor -# def init(name) self.fname = Parent().fname self.cname = name end end child = Child('Luke') print( child.say() ) #child inherits from parent the say method Examples You can also check out these Berry example source files on GitHub Berry is free software distributed under the MIT license.",

From the cursory look, seems pretty ergonomic to write.What stood out for me is the ability to pre-create constant objects and put them mostly into ROM, so that the RAM is only used for the actually mutable data. This is something you can&#x27;t have with MicroPython or Lua, AFAICT, and this makes a lot of difference in MCUs where ROM &#x2F; flash is plentiful, and RAM is scarce. reply tomcam 11 hours agoparentI have to admit, I went back to the site after reading your description. I find it much more comprehensive and appealing than the home page. reply snops 11 hours agoparentprevYou can \"freeze\" micropython modules and have them saved in flash with Micropython, where flash only stores the precompiled bytecode.If your module contains stored data in the form of an immutable object, like a string or bytes(), it will be read straight out of flash without copying to RAM first.This needs you to run some code on a desktop computer to perform the freezing though.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.micropython.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;reference&#x2F;constrained... reply matt_trentini 19 minutes agorootparentJust to be clear, not just data but bytecode will also be executed from flash too. reply mikepurvis 7 hours agorootparentprevAny serious build setup for an MCU firmware is going to have steps like this in, generating code and saving blobs of this and that.Though I guess part of the pitch for micropython is being able to iterate without a flash step every time. Possibly addressed by having your dev boards fitted with a version of the MCU with enough RAM to run it all that way. reply paulclinger 11 hours agoparentprevIt does indeed look interesting and looks to be similar to Lua in several aspects (although, there are some noticeable differences too). FWIW, there has been work done in eLua to keep some of the data (transparently) in ROM: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eluaproject.net&#x2F;doc&#x2F;v0.9&#x2F;en_arch_ltr.html (see rotables). reply germandiago 4 minutes agoprevAny chance Berry has something like generators or function resumption of some kind?

And I wasn’t familiar with Tasmota before but def will be looking for an excuse to try it on a project. reply happens 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;d love something exactly like this, but with less paradigms and statically typed, for use as a configuration language.I&#x27;ve used several projects requiring non-trivial configuration that, instead of requiring you to write hundreds of lines of yaml, simply let you write Lua or Starlark&#x2F;python, which feels so much better to me. I&#x27;m always missing autocompletion and reflection though.

Can you run untrusted code through it? reply JTyQZSnP3cQGa8B 16 hours agoparentThe comparison with Lua is the most interesting to me. Most companies I worked for used Python as a shitty proxy or CLI tool, but I never could recommend Lua due to its confusing OO system (meta tables??)If this language is a valid alternative with a simple struct and a basic constructor, I may recommend it to remove all the Python scripts and their dependencies. reply zdragnar 15 hours agorootparentHaving a lot of experience wrangling prototypes in JS was a nice benefit to my first forays into lua, though I wrote more functional code than OO anyway.Honestly, off by one errors due to indexing was a lot harder to shake than getting used to meta tables. reply runlaszlorun 14 hours agorootparentI’m assuming that the indexing off by one errors were due to Lua 1-based indexing? If so, was it due to you being used to 0-based indexing or something else?Just curious. I’ve been kicking around some attempts to make programming simpler (though hopefully no less powerful) for casual programmers. Lua’s 1-based indexing gets a lot of critiques and, while I haven’t written a ton of Lua, can’t help but think that the critiques are due to us all being used to 0-based indexing. Which is a valid critique, especially for a scripting language, but one that applies less to novices. reply zdragnar 14 hours agorootparentBingo. All of the languages I have used prior to (and since) use 0-indexed arrays.There&#x27;s times where doing math with array indexes is simpler with 0 and with 1-indexed arrays. I don&#x27;t think I really found 0 to be difficult to learn; there are a great many more challenging things.I wouldn&#x27;t say \"don&#x27;t use a 1 indexed language\" but I&#x27;ve also never found the arguments in favor of it to be compelling when using lua. reply norir 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is somewhat inefficient but zero indexed strings can easily be simulated in lua: local array = function(backing) local res = { len = function() return #backing end } setmetatable(res, { __index = function(_, k) return backing[k + 1] end, __newindex = function(_, k, v) backing[k + 1] = v end }) return res end local x = array { 1, 2, 3 } print(x[0]) -- 1 x[1] = 5 x[x.len()] = 6 for i = 0, x.len() - 1 do print(x[i]) end -- 1\\n5\\n3\\n6 reply vitiral 12 hours agorootparentprevMetatable types are indeed kind of awkward, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to build a type system on them in a library. Check out metaty where I built a type system, formatter and deep equality checking in like 700 LoC. I&#x27;m adding the ability to document types&#x2F;functions as well, after which it will be \"done\" reply chadcmulligan 9 hours agorootparentWould you have a link? my googling skills have failed me reply vitiral 8 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;civboot&#x2F;civlua&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;metaty reply loa_in_ 17 hours agoparentprevYou can&#x27;t run untrusted code because by default code can open and write to the filesystem. Sandboxing is up to the application. For sandboxing wasm is a good alternative. reply qznc 17 hours agorootparentRemoving the API for file access would be easy. Limiting compute time is the harder thing. reply sweetjuly 14 hours agorootparentLimiting compute is trivial on any modern operating system. On Linux you can create a second supervisor thread, block on a mutex with a timeout, and then if you timed out before acquiring the mutex you can just tgkill the runner thread. On BSDs it&#x27;s even easier since you can just hand the runner thread port to your supervisor thread and, after you timeout, you can just set RIP&#x2F;PC to whatever location you want without having to screw around with signals. reply foobazgt 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to better understand what you&#x27;re describing. Thread-level compute limits generally seem like they need to be managed in some sort of cooperative fashion, otherwise you end up with the possibility of dangling locks and other kinds of corruption on forcible termination.What signal are you sending to the running thread? What&#x27;s the handler look like? How does that translate to terminating the thread? How do you do this forcibly (without cooperation from user code)? Schemes that I have seen look more like generating&#x2F; instrumenting polling&#x2F;checkpoints into user code. reply loa_in_ 1 hour agorootparentYou let it operate on a copy of the input data and check integrity afterwards. If it doesn&#x27;t reach a valid state you discard it as failed&#x2F;corrupted. reply norir 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, it is very easy to remove the entire standard library from lua. Could compute time be handled with signal handlers in at least some cases? If not, one (admittedly somewhat hard) option is to write a small lua to lua compiler that injects yields into loops and recursive function calls. reply deadf00d 16 hours agoparentprevAn native thread management with an `async` keyword would really make it stand out from Lua for game engine uses. reply demi56 1 hour agorootparentI wouldn’t call that “stand out” especially when it comes to game engines, game engines are very complex and they are all different from implementations to their algorithms having a native thread management keyword does more worries than stand out reply traverseda 17 hours agoprevI think the thing I&#x27;d miss most from python if I was using this is multiple-inheritance. Not even necessarily true multiple inheritance, but at least some kind of mixin. reply rollcat 15 hours agoparentClass-based inheritance is IMHO overrated. Most of the time you&#x27;re interested in specific behavior (what is the area under this shape?), rather than some abstract taxonomy (is square a specialized rect or is rect a generalized square?).Composition and interfaces tend to produce less convoluted designs, and the most obnoxious problem with multiple inheritance (\"diamonds\") has to be explicitly addressed at the call site, rather than by meditating on the globally-determined method resolution order. reply runlaszlorun 15 hours agorootparentHow do feel about prototypical inheritance and&#x2F;or mixins as an alternative? I sorta feel like the component in the Entity&#x2F;Component&#x2F;System model that’s been getting popular in gaming drifts into the same territory as well though I’ve never written games. reply reactordev 15 hours agorootparentECS is different. Systems coordinate entities, entities have components, some of them can be behaviors, some of them are not (vertex data). You would need to provide something that a component can inherit to derive that it’s a behavior. Unity does this by calling it a MonoBehavior (not Mono as in singular, mono as in Mono runtime, the name stuck).Having an ECBS system: one could model all the permutations as described while keeping code concise, shareable, and non-repeatable. Unity is really an ECBS.Inheritance vs non is as old as OOP vs functional. Each has their place, each has their pros and cons. Having functional components and behavior traits attached to object inheritance based entity nodes is probably the best of all composition. Entities can get more and more complex with inheritance chains (further classifying what components can be attached), components can include behaviors, data, events&#x2F;triggers, sub-components. Behaviors (triggering events or waiting for) is where your game logic would mostly reside. reply runlaszlorun 13 hours agorootparentAha, thx for the insight. Very helpful. A couple questions:1) If I wanted to learn more about ECS&#x2F;ECBS, would Unity be a decent place to learn? I know sometimes the terms get coopted (for example, MVC as a term gets fairly abused at times in web development) so I wasn’t sure if their implementation was a good one to learn from. And while I’m a fan of open source, Unity certainly does seem to be a leader in adoption and available assets, etc and not a bad place to start. I’m not really looking to develop a commercial game, but in addition to my poking around game engines to see if and what might be applicable ideas for a more classic business&#x2F;personal type apps, I am interested in building something that broadly speaking sorta acts like an FPS or Arma type game but just for the sake of playing around and simulating different drones and drone swarms, etc in a 3D environment and playing with that. Pretty crude is fine, and AAA level graphics aren’t really a huge concern. I think I honestly could prob get pretty far with just a non-graphical, non-gamelike OO design with JS&#x2F;Python&#x2F;whatever as a crude simulation. But I’ve heard that standing up something like an FPS in Unity is not too difficult. And I don’t plan on pushing boundaries from a graphics or asset perspective.2) > Systems coordinate entities Could you elaborate a bit? Systems are the one aspect that for me are hardest to get my head around coming from more standard web&#x2F;business development. So physics engines would be a system right? But I’m not sure what are other examples.Thx for the info. And feel free to just refer to links if you know amy decent ones. I’ve been poking around ECS from a far for a couple years now but haven’t really found articles that fill in the gaps for things like systems in ECS. Though I’m sure the fact that I have little context in game development sure doesn’t help… lol. reply skitter 10 hours agorootparent> Systems are the one aspect that for me are hardest to get my headIn an ECS architecture, the world is a database of entities, which are just identifiers, which have components associated with them. Systems is simply code that query this database and operate on the returned data. For example, if you want burning entities to set burnable entities on fire, you might write a system like this, using Bevy as an example: fn fire_spread(mut commands: Commands, burning: Query>, flammable: Query>) { for col_1 in &burning { for (flammable_entity, col_2) in &flammable { if col_1.touches(col_2) { commands.entity(flammable_entity).insert(Burning) } } } }The Commands here exists to defer archetype moves – otherwise what should the query do if you added Burning to an entity while the query was running? And of course in a real game, you might want to use a spatial query so time complexity isn&#x27;t m×n. You could then run this system every tick: app.add_systems(Update, fire_spread)If you&#x27;re familiar with C++, I can also recommend you check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flecs.dev&#x2F;flecs&#x2F; reply reactordev 11 hours agorootparentprevUnity is just the loudest, they certainly aren’t the first and they definitely didn’t invent the paradigm. ECS&#x2F;ECBS is a pretty common construct.This wiki is the Bible for ECS&#x2F;ECBS systems: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;entity-systems.wikidot.com&#x2F; reply skitter 10 hours agorootparentThat page seems to be more about the entity-component architecture (entities are composed of components, which define data and behavior for one aspect of the game) then about entity-component-systems architecture (entities are composed of components, which are pure data; systems can query this database). Traditional Unity, as that site points out, is EC; Unity DOTS is ECS. Not sure why the site would be the bible on the topic either as it only some surface-level information and links (and hasn&#x27;t been kept up to date much). reply reactordev 10 hours agorootparentMuch like other bibles ;)Wikipedia has some links to some more recent approaches. The biggest problem (and the reason why you don’t see medium articles about it) is it’s extremely difficult to sell in the enterprise. Even if it is the right architecture. Most developers can’t grok it because of the MVC issue you already alluded to. My biggest advice - crack open VSCode and write one. You’ll learn more by doing. Forget games. Try writing a database. This is what it is really. How do you handle 100,000 objects that interdepend on a web of code? Start basic, arithmetic. Components can add, subtract, etc. end goal is query the scene for Fibonacci sequence entities.Bonus points for updating (randomizing) values and picking different entities next tick.Deductions for use of Dictionary or std::map replyrollcat 13 hours agorootparentprevI think any object&#x2F;type system is good, as long as it doesn&#x27;t encourage atrocities. I personally am guilty of implementing a fully-blown class-based inheritance system on top of Lua&#x27;s metatables, and thank $DEITIES it didn&#x27;t make it into any production project!Nowadays if I write Lua, I mostly see metatables as a memory usage optimization. If you have thousands of small objects with many methods, and all of them share the same set of methods, it makes a lot of sense to have a single vtable, to save some memory. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s not like Lua lets you control struct member padding to ensure they fit in a single cache line. reply Pxtl 11 hours agorootparentprevImho it&#x27;s just that method signatures are enough work to write and maintain that inheritance is needed for simple code reuse sometimes.A language with good constructs for convenient call-signature reuse and redirection at the function level could probably skip implementation inheritance. reply MarkMarine 15 hours agoparentprevThis language is targeted toward embedded machines with very low resources, are you using python with multiple inheritance on embedded? reply traverseda 14 hours agorootparentSure, I use micropython on the rare occasion when I&#x27;m playing with microcontroller stuff. Mostly that&#x27;s hobbyist stuff, but still it&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;d miss. reply MarkMarine 14 hours agorootparentI’ve been using C for work on embedded for so long the idea of that is foreign to me, do you have any code in GitHub that is a good example? I’d like to read it. reply traverseda 12 hours agorootparentNot really, I was working on a little web interface for the some hardware called \"eduponics\" but my day job has been keeping me pretty busy.Obviously micropython has a lot of downsides as compared to writing stuff in C, much higher energy requirements for one thing, but there are some nice things as well. A REPL can be really nice when you&#x27;re a hobbyist using hardware that you aren&#x27;t familiar with, makes it really easy to try stuff out.Performance wise you can do hard real time stuff in interrupts, as long as you don&#x27;t treat it like python at all, no creating objects, if you need to do real stuff try to pass it back to a soft real-time event loop (python asyncio does a reasonable approximation of a co-operative real-time multitasking OS). You can also inline assembly directly into your functions, or some other python-like DSLs that have much better performance.I don&#x27;t think anyone is using it seriously in any commercial products yet honestly, but for quickly hacking together something with some SPI peripherals it&#x27;s a pretty nice environment. reply matt_trentini 20 minutes agorootparentThe company I work for uses MicroPython commercially, for medical devices.

With some syntactic sugar (? in Rust, do notation in Haskell), you can be as concise as exception-based languages. reply MrBuddyCasino 17 hours agoprevThis looks like a language optimized for embedded use.

No longer fast, compact or lightweight. reply runlaszlorun 15 hours agoparentI’d think this actually applies to nearly everything in software and is def a useful thing to keep an eye on.Underemployment for the last 3 years has given me a great opportunity to dive deeper into a lot of CS topics for things we use daily and read (or at least try to read) specs and code bases etc.I’ve come to firmly believe that languages or other open source projects that get popular, usually do so for the things that are in its early versions.For example, the HTTP 0.9 spec is like 1 page. UDP is like 3 pages.I’d seen an article on HN recently (cant remember the name) that described this well. A language or what not starts simply and many jump on the bandwagon. Then starts adding incremental features, none of which are difficult to incrementally learn for existing users but the footprint of the product keeps expanding. C++, Javascript, Web APIs, graphics languages like OpenGL all are examples in my eye.The fact that our system (broadly speaking) incentivizes inventing something ‘new’ rather than fixing or simplifying an existing something certainly exacerbates this. reply vram22 2 hours agorootparent>I’d think this actually applies to nearly everything in software and is def a useful thing to keep an eye on.Sort of like if the Peter Principle and Parkinson&#x27;s Law had a child.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_principlehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parkinson%27s_lawOr just Zawinskis Law:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski&#x27;s_La... reply vitiral 12 hours agorootparentprevLua has done pretty well to avoid this IMO.

HOME LATEST NEWS TIPS & GUIDES REVIEWS THE BESTS CULTURE REPORT OPINION ANIME We may earn a commission from links on this page NEWS Big Oil's Using Fortnite, TikTok, And Twitch In Effort To Convince Kids Fossil Fuels Are Cool Shell knows young people are worried about climate change and hopes some Fortnite maps will fix that By Zack Zwiezen PublishedFriday 2:37PM Comments (72) Peely in front of a 2004 oil spill caused by Shell. Photo: Epic / Shell / Kotaku / Jacob Silberberg (Getty Images) Kids today only care about online free-to-play shooter Fortnite. They don’t even talk about how great gasoline is! Luckily for us, one large oil company wants to change that using Fortnite, TikTok stars, and Twitch streamers. Welcome to Hell. Climate change is bad. I think we can all agree on that. But for kids, who have long lives and futures ahead of them, the prospect of the planet turning into a nightmare sphere of extreme weather and chaos is particularly scary. But don’t worry about all that, kids. Instead, Shell—a massive oil company and one of the many entities directly responsible for destroying our planet—wants you all to know just how rad its fossil fuel products are, and even made a whole Fortnite world for you to enjoy! But to truly enjoy it, you’ll need to use Shell’s V-Power® NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline, of course. As reported by Media Matters earlier this week, Shell has partnered with map creators to develop “Shell Ultimate Road Trips”, a Fortnite world featuring six different areas to explore in the car of your choice. In the middle of these worlds, players will find a lonely, sad-looking Shell gas station acting as the map’s hub. The campaign—part of Shell’s pivot back to focusing on gasoline over cleaner energy sources— is designed to promote the company’s “new and improved” premium gasoline. The idea is that in the map, players will need to occasionally fill up at the central Shell gas station and use its new V-Power NiTRO+ fuel to successfully navigate obstacles and courses. Content creators are being enlisted to create big oil propaganda To help promote this terrible collaboration, Shell has enlisted various TikTok creators and Twitch streamers in an effort to connect with their large audiences made up of mostly younger individuals. Media Matters reportedly identified at least a half dozen streamers—including folks like Punisher, NateHill, Chica, and brookeab—with a combined Twitch following of over 5.5 million subscribers—who helped promote Shell’s Fortnite map and fossil fuel products during sponsored streams that racked up over a million views. Some of these creators also promoted the sponsored streams on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok to their millions of followers. Media Matters also identified three content creators who advertised the ShellxFortnite map in several videos posted on the gas company’s official YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram accounts. The creators directly promoting Shell’s gasoline propaganda have a combined audience of 8.5 million TikTok followers, 1.5 million Instagram followers, and over 11 million YouTube subscribers. In August, Shell even paid out for a sponsored post on IGN as well as a three-part series featuring IGN staff playing Fortnite and exploring the Shell-sponsored map. The videos are covered in Shell logos and featured on a fancy IGN-hosted website dedicated to the oil company’s Fortnite map. Kids aren’t buying this crap So how’s all this money and effort paying off? As far as I can tell, not great. For example, looking at that IGN article, it’s got only two comments and both are negative. On YouTube, the IGN videos have mostly received negative comments from viewers, with many calling out the outlet for sponsoring an oil company. Elsewhere, the official trailers put out by Shell for their Fortnite creation are similarly receiving negative comments. “Drop in this season and complete the objective: ‘Do irreparable damage to the environment with Shell!” is the top-rated comment on this trailer for the map. This is all part of an ongoing campaign by big oil companies, like Shell, to connect with younger people via online influencers and content creators. In 2021, Earther reported that Shell and Phillips 66 had started campaigns with Instagram influencers. These sponsored deals and ads aren’t just about promoting oil companies and their products. These large corporations know that as climate change gets worse, it’s getting harder to convince young people to keep buying gas-powered cars and supporting the fossil fuel industry. As Media Matters pointed out, in a 2021 survey of young people between the ages of 16-25, about 75% said the future is frightening because of climate change. It’s hard to sell gasoline and diesel to teens who know it’s destroying the planet and their futures. And it doesn’t look like some Instagram models and Fortnite videos on IGN promoting Shell are going to be enough to change their minds. .

The show then cuts to a 2 minute promotional video for Shell fuel.Once the promo ends, he tells the kids that whoever kicks a goal gets a $1000 petrol voucher, as he waves a stack of these petrol vouchers in front of the camera.I don&#x27;t get easily offended, but I&#x27;ve honestly never seen anything more disgusting in my entire life. reply gray_-_wolf 21 hours agoparent> I don&#x27;t get easily offended, but I&#x27;ve honestly never seen anything more disgusting in my entire life.Try watching some documentaries about Tiananmen Square or Uyghurs. I am curious if this statement will still hold. reply Etheryte 20 hours agorootparentSomeone has a problem? I will bring my problem! reply gray_-_wolf 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have a problem with people having problems. I have plenty of problems. What I do not like is putting absolute statements like \"never seen anything more disgusting\". That usually just means you are not looking hard enough.But, the fact that I have a problem with this relativization of everything does not mean I think problems people do not consider \"the most disgusting\" should not be tackled.Look at my country for example. Corruption in local government affects me more that what is going on in China. I can also fight it more that what is going on in China. And, in the end, I care about it more in the \"daily on my mind\" sense of the word. That does not mean I should label it as being objectively worse or \"most disgusting ever\". reply chambored 14 hours agorootparentI think they were just speaking hyperbolically… reply ruszki 4 hours agorootparentHopefully, that’s the case. However, the past decade seems to show us, that if something seems hyperbolic, it’s usually rather serious at the moment. When I was hyperbolic any time in my life, I simply lied even to myself at that given moment, and I believed in that lie until my self-correction didn’t kick in seconds or minutes later. But it’s quite difficult to interpret the current political climate, if most people has such self-correction. reply flir 17 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t that how you get regexes? reply malfist 20 hours agorootparentprevOh yeah? My problem is bigger that your problem! reply salawat 19 hours agorootparentY&#x27;all keep making a fuss about being part of the problem, and I assure you, I will stop this thread and become the whole problem. Do not tempt me. reply benrutter 20 hours agorootparentprevI guess the difference is it happening in your country. As much as I think Tiananmen Square was an atrocity, my feelings about it would be immeasurably stronger if it happened in the UK (where I am from). reply thaumasiotes 21 hours agoparentprev> I don&#x27;t get easily offended, but I&#x27;ve honestly never seen anything more disgusting in my entire life.The US government runs a prominent advertising campaign on the theme \"if you let your baby sleep with you, you are a bad mother\". reply slashdev 21 hours agorootparent\"if you let your baby sleep with you, you are a bad mother\" that leads to a number of accidental suffocations. I think that’s pretty reasonable to educate the public about that. reply Tade0 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s mostly an urban legend and the vast majority of such cases happen when the parent is not sober and essentially knocked out unconscious.I mean, infants are typically warmer than adults and they wriggle around a lot - it&#x27;s hard enough to sleep next to them, much less within suffocation distance. reply anotherhue 18 hours agorootparentLiterally 18 hours ago on this very site:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37796452> they got into a weird position between a very very drowsy mum and some cushions and we didn&#x27;t notice.> parent is not sober and essentially knocked out unconscious.Parent of newborn sleep deprivation is extreme. reply bathtub365 19 hours agorootparentprevIf the combination of drinking and sleeping beside your infant leads to a higher chance of suffocating them you can ask people to stop drinking, stop sleeping beside their infant, or both.

Sleeping in the same bed is a completely different story and I hope nobody is doing that. replyandix 21 hours agoparentprevCan those vouchers also be used for charging your EV? Shell is operating a lot of chargers already. reply bko 21 hours agoparentprevI would love a petrol voucher. 90% of Australians have a car so it would be useful to pretty much anyone&#x27;s family. It&#x27;s also a somewhat inelastic good, meaning if I gave you a petrol voucher you probably wouldn&#x27;t considerably change your driving habits. Maybe you would use it to go on an extra family trip, which yes gasoline bad, but it&#x27;s not exactly conspicuous consumption. It would just give you some extra money in your pocket. I would much prefer that to something like a vacation voucher or a new car or some useless stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t pay my own money for. reply dottjt 20 hours agorootparentThe petrol voucher isn&#x27;t the primary issue. It&#x27;s using children to sell the petrol voucher. reply salawat 19 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re fine with letting Microsoft use them to sell Windows and Office licenses though (through schooling)? Or Google to acclimatize them cloud-first computing + having their data hoovered (also through schooling)?Let&#x27;s be real here, if you object to youth directed marketing you should have been up in arms loooooong before now. Fact is targeting kids has been basic corporate strategy 101 for decades.Tobacco in media. Coke&#x2F;Pepsi. Cool cars, women, selling kids on \"the Police are the good guys\". In fact, your opinions about what is appropriate to shoehorn into children&#x27;s formative years tends to say volumes more about what you are about than about anything else.That being said, I agree the gas vouchers telegraph a blatant desperation move. reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentMicrosoft office isn’t destroying the planet. reply seaparter 19 hours agorootparentprevThe whataboutism is strong in this thread… reply markjonsona989 20 hours agoparentprev> I don&#x27;t get easily offended, but I&#x27;ve honestly never seen anything more disgusting in my entire life.That&#x27;s a pretty bold statement to make. I don&#x27;t know what kind of isolated world you live in if you think that a Shell ad is the most disgusting thing you ever saw in your life, but I can give you a hundred examples off the top of my head.One example that might be related to this subject are working conditions in a lithium mine and the purification process. If people knew the price we pay to drive EVs I&#x27;m convinced they would stick with oil. Just because it all happens in China and it doesn&#x27;t affect us directly, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s any less disgusting.I am also getting seriously tired of this constant need for censorship which is a contradiction in an open-market economy. You should compete, not sabotage. Instead of looking for ways to ban Shell ads on TV, why doesn&#x27;t the EV industry offer vouchers too? reply dottjt 20 hours agorootparentI get your point, but I think it&#x27;s relative to the society which it takes place. Corruption in China? If anything, it&#x27;s to be expected. It&#x27;s a literal part of how their political system operates. Corruption in a liberal democracy? Much less acceptable. Of course, that&#x27;s just one point of view.As for your comment about EVs, I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree. My main outrage is that they used children to sell oil.As for your comment on competition, how can you expect to compete against big oil without regulation, possibly the biggest most powerful industry in the world? The problem is that there is nothing better than oil for what it does, which extends to the other problem that open markets don&#x27;t care about externalities or planetary boundaries. Which is where people need to come in and put restrictions.I&#x27;m curious, but would you have been against the breaking up of Standard Oil back in the day? reply markjonsona989 14 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t talking about corruption in China. I was implying that we outsource the \"disgusting\" part of producing lithium batteries to get a ready-made product that we can use. In the same way you see a steak in a supermarket rather than years of force-feeding cattle with antibiotics and steroids, you see a Tesla Model 3 driving on the road. You don&#x27;t see what it takes to produce the \"stuff\" that powers your car.I&#x27;m not quite sure I get your counter-point to competition. We already heavily regulate the oil industry and subsidise EVs. We tax fossil fuels, we tax ICE cars, we favour EVs in city centres and we even brought in a law to completely ban purchasing new ICE vehicles by year X. If your product is so great, it shouldn&#x27;t need government intervention to promote it; and Musk&#x27;s Tesla company is a great example of that.My original comment addressed the illusion that most Westerns live in and downvoting just proves that. Service-based economies seem to be removed from reality and don&#x27;t understand the \"disgusting\" things that have to take place in order for them to function. Like someone said in another thread, if you&#x27;re really concerned about morals then you will probably have to throw your entire PC out the window.EDIT: > I&#x27;m curious, but would you have been against the breaking up of Standard Oil back in the day?Sorry I am not aware of that so can&#x27;t comment. reply indigo0086 19 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ll never get what you need for EVs without child labor or extremely unhealthy work conditions. Roughnecks and engineers happily go to work to drill for the oil that runs society reply dottjt 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s one very specific example, to a few very specific countries at best.On the contrary, oil is what&#x27;s primarily funding the invasion of Ukraine. Think of all the people being killed as a result of that conflict. Or for the civil wars that oil ends up creating i.e. Sudan.I think ultimately the point is that the 3rd world always loses in the end. They&#x27;re the ones who suffer most from the ambitions of Western nations, irrespective of their intentions. replywhatever1 21 hours agoprevFossil fuels are irreplaceable for what they offer at the price they ask.Don’t ask the West. Ask India that had the choice to leapfrog fossil fuels and be energy independent, at higher cost.People don’t care about our opinions. They want the cheapest options.The only way to transition out of fossils for energy, is to make the alternatives cheaper and easily accessible. US transitioned from coal to gas within 10 years when the economics became favorable. reply bluejekyll 21 hours agoparentIt really depends on how you calculate this, but fossil fuels are not cheap by any means. The IMF has some staggering numbers for direct and indirect subsidies of fossil fuels, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imf.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Blogs&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;24&#x2F;fossil-fuel...: “… explicit subsidies (undercharging for supply costs) more than doubled to $1.3 trillion.” If we just got rid of those subsidies, we’d see a faster shift.Then there are all the externalities that are not part of the cost of fossil fuel costs today, start charging for the pollution and make the real costs explicit. The next thing, stop subsidizing road construction and maintenance for car drivers, and make only car owners pay the costs of all the roads, people would again see more explicitly how much more expensive cars are, which would get people to shift to other options (the vast majority of which are not EVs and won’t be for a long time). People might opt to bike for anything shorter than a 3 mile errand, deeming the car to be too expensive, or use the local bus or transit system…Point being, these fossil fuels are supported directly by our governments and many of the primary users of those fuels are also supported by our governments (some more than others like here in the US). reply vel0city 20 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re misquoting with your explicit subsidies. Undercharging is an implicit, not explicit. The vast majority of these subsidies are implicit subsidies. \"Getting rid of\" these subsidies means taxing an extra trillion dollars not scaling back something handing the oil companies a trillion dollars.If you want to argue we should levy a trillion dollar tax on fossil fuels that&#x27;s fine but let&#x27;s at least be direct about it instead of the somewhat misleading statement that it&#x27;s a subsidy, like it&#x27;s some giant pile of cash the state is handing to the oil companies. It&#x27;s not even that it&#x27;s giving tax breaks (that would be an explicit subsidy), it&#x27;s that these taxes didn&#x27;t exist at all.You&#x27;re essentially arguing not being taxed to oblivion as being directly supported by the government. reply bluejekyll 17 hours agorootparentAm I misquoting that? I read that report as saying that the implicit costs are about $7 trillion dollars, and the explicit subsidies are $1.3 trillion, which is the number I used in the quote because, I agree, the implicit costs are harder to understand. reply vel0city 16 hours agorootparentI double checksd the source and you&#x27;re right that isn&#x27;t a misquote, but it isn&#x27;t quite accurate in the end. A lot of the \"undercharging\" is essentially not making new taxes. Most of the explicit subsidies are subsidies that pretty much any large business gets, nothing special about the oil industry there. Things like local tax deferments for plants that supposedly bring jobs to an area are common for just about any large employer. Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t be doing this in general, but it&#x27;s not something special to oil industries.We should probably just end all of those \"subsidies\" and loopholes in general.Sorry for misunderstanding and missing what you were quoting. My overall point still kind of stands though, a lot of these \"the government is subsidizing the oil industry trillions of dollars\" is usually talking about these implicit costs that aren&#x27;t taxed like they&#x27;d like. reply paulryanrogers 21 hours agoparentprevCheaper by some narrow definitions. Expensive considering inconvenient externalities. reply andix 20 hours agoparentprevI live in \"the west\" and I can contribute to change there. So I do. Try to change what you can change, instead of thinking about what you can&#x27;t change and not doing anything. reply somsak2 20 hours agorootparentproblem is, unlike other issues that can have positive local impacts, the biggest downsides to climate change are global. doesn&#x27;t really matter that as the US&#x2F;EU our emissions have been flat for decades now if china and India are shooting up like crazy. reply jabradoodle 20 hours agorootparentWell, yes it does.The USA is still the biggest polluter, even with 1&#x2F;5 the population of China.Also, making the technology viable and proving it so is the only solution. reply vel0city 19 hours agorootparentThe US is not the largest GHG polluter. China is, by a large measure.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;271748&#x2F;the-largest-emitt...Sure, if you&#x27;re talking per capita, US people emit more carbon dioxide but with your \"even with 1&#x2F;5th\" and \"the biggest polluter\" it suggests you&#x27;re thinking total not per capita. reply jabradoodle 19 hours agorootparentShould have fact checked myself on that one. reply andix 19 hours agorootparentThe US were for a long time. But now it’s China. Although they already are the biggest producer of green energy world wide. They produce more green energy than all other countries combined. I don’t know if their strategy will drastically reduce their carbon emissions soon, for now they are still rising. In Europe and the US they are going down a while already (also because we moved a lot of our industry to china). reply nojvek 13 hours agorootparentCorrect. China is moving the fastest in large 5 economies to decarbonize their economy.They produce and install more solar panels then every other country combined. reply andix 12 hours agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s impressive what they are doing. But I think their total amount of carbon emissions are still rising in total. So their energy consumption seems to grow faster than their green energy production. replyjabradoodle 21 hours agoparentprevIndia and China are both investing heavily in renewables, this is a tired trope.Renewable energy is also cost effective compared to fossil fuels in many cases and has been for years. This also excludes the massive externalities of fossil fuels.True, making it cheaper is the best way, which should involve not subsidising fossil fuels and subsidising renewables.Alas, none of this has anything to do with fossil fuel companies advertising to children, not sure if your a contrarian or a shill but your take is totally off topic. reply whatever1 19 hours agorootparentNot even sure if I am a shill. My Tech employer has bold commitments for carbon neutrality by buying credits from the Big Oil. reply aaomidi 21 hours agoparentprevOr, here’s another idea: a tax on carbon.We are subsidizing fossil fuels by deferring their actual real cost to the future. We can and should stop doing that. reply whatever1 21 hours agorootparentWho can impose this global tax you dream of? India currently is smuggling oil out of Russia because they offered a better price. reply jppittma 21 hours agorootparentSo, in any tragedy of the commons are we just going to accept that the only solutions are going to be to change the concrete circumstances that make it a one?If not climate change, then there&#x27;ll be other instances like this where what&#x27;s good for the individual (country) is bad for the world. reply tekmate 21 hours agorootparentprevwe&#x27;ve tried nothing and we&#x27;re all out of ideas reply aaomidi 20 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn’t need to be global? It can be within your borders applying to domestic production and imports.You can require an implementation and oversight of a carbon tax as part of a trade deal.We’ve literally enforced a thousand different rules on the world as a collective species. Stop pretending this one is different. reply TheLoafOfBread 19 hours agorootparentprev> Or, here’s another idea: a tax on carbon.So more tax on food and energy to the poor. Great idea how to start a riot. reply merdaverse 21 hours agoparentprevRight, let&#x27;s just leave it to the free market to make the transition when economically viable.

Look up the Haber process; your ability to walk down to a Whole Foods in a city of millions and buy groceries to support your vegan diet wouldn&#x27;t be a thing. The stepping stone to things like nuclear and solar wouldn&#x27;t be there. Humanity would be so bass-ackwards by now without fossil fuels that people would still be routinely dying of diseases that today are well treated, as well as mere child birth. The only way someone can&#x27;t connect the progress of the 20th and 21st centuries with fossil fuels is to view it only in isolation. The \"fossil fuels bad\" attitude is at best quixotic, and at worst enters the realm of insanity.

If we are headed for catastrophe, or extinction according to some, then the purely hypothetical world-ending events related to nuclear reactors shouldn&#x27;t be any more of a problem.

    "originLink": "https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-iii-the-inside-view",
    "originBody": "Erin Kissane home archives search feed about Meta in Myanmar, Part III: The Inside View “Well, Congressman, I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like to use, but making sure that those services are also good for people and good for society overall.” — Mark Zuckerberg, 2018 In the previous two posts in this series, I did a long but briskly paced early history of Meta and the internet in Myanmar—and the hateful and dehumanizing speech that came with it—and then looked at what an outside-the-company view could reveal about Meta’s role in the genocide of the Rohingya in 2016 and 2017. In this post, I’ll look at what two whistleblowers and a crucial newspaper investigation reveal about what was happening inside Meta at the time. Specifically, the disclosed information: gives us a quantitative view of Meta’s content moderation performance—which, in turn, highlights a deceptive PR move routine Meta uses when questioned about moderation; clarifies what Meta knew about the effects of its algorithmic recommendations systems; and reveals a parasitic takeover of the Facebook platform by covert influence campaigns around the world—including in Myanmar. Before we get into that, a brief personal note. There are few ways to be in the world that I enjoy less than “breathless conspiratorial.” That rhetorical mode muddies the water when people most need clarity and generates an emotional charge that works against effective decision-making. I really don’t like it. So it’s been unnerving to synthesize a lot of mostly public information and come up with results that wouldn’t look completely out of place in one of those overwrought threads. I don’t know what to do with that except to be forthright but not dramatic, and to treat my readers’ endocrine systems with respect by avoiding needless flourishes. But the story is just rough and many people in it do bad things. (You can read my meta-post about terminology and sourcing if you want to see me agonize over the minutiae.) Content warnings for the post: The whole series is about genocide and hate speech. There are no graphic descriptions or images, and this post includes no slurs or specific examples of hateful and inciting messages, but still. (And there’s a fairly unpleasant photograph of a spider at about the 40% mark.) The disclosures When Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Meta’s Civic Integrity team, disclosed a ton of internal Meta docs to the SEC—and several media outlets—in 2021, I didn’t really pay attention. I was pandemic-tired and I didn’t think there’d be much in there that I didn’t know. I was wrong! Frances Haugen’s disclosures are of generational importance, especially if you’re willing to dig down past the US-centric headlines. Haugen has stated that she came forward because of things outside the US—Myanmar and its horrific echo years later in Ethiopia, specifically, and the likelihood that it would all just keep happening. So it makes sense that the docs she disclosed would be highly relevant, which they are. There are eight disclosures in the bundle of information Haugen delivered via lawyers to the SEC, and each is about one specific way Meta “misled investors and the public.” Each disclosure takes the form of a letter (which probably has a special legal name I don’t know) and a huge stack of primary documents. The majority of those documents—internal posts, memos, emails, comments—haven’t yet been made public, but the letters themselves include excerpts, and subsequent media coverage and straightforward doc dumps have revealed a little bit more. When I cite the disclosures, I’ll point to the place where you can read the longest chunk of primary text—often that’s just the little excerpts in the letters, but sometimes we have a whole—albeit redacted—document to look at. In the fourth post in the series, I’ll say a little about what the documents reveal about Meta’s culture. Here, I’ll just note that many people inside Meta clearly tried to make things better. How well that worked is another question. Before continuing, I think it’s only fair to note that the disclosures we see in public are necessarily those that run counter to Meta’s public statements, because otherwise there would be no need to disclose them. And because we’re only getting excerpts, there’s obviously a ton of context missing—including, presumably, dissenting internal views. I’m not interested in making a handwavey case based on one or two people inside a company making wild statements. So I’m only emphasizing points that are supported in multiple, specific excerpts. Let’s start with content moderation and what the disclosures have to say about it. How much dangerous stuff gets taken down? We don’t know how much “objectionable content” is actually on Facebook—or on Instagram, or Twitter, or any other big platform. The companies running those platforms don’t know the exact numbers either, but what they do have are reasonably accurate estimates. We know they have estimates because sampling and human-powered data classification is how you train the AI classifiers required to do content-based moderation—removing posts and comments—at mass scale. And that process necessarily lets you estimate from your samples roughly how much of a given kind of problem you’re seeing. (This is pretty common knowledge, but it’s also confirmed in an internal doc I quote below.) The platforms aren’t sharing those estimates with us because no one’s forcing them to. And probably also because, based on what we’ve seen from the disclosures, the numbers are quite bad. So I want to look at how bad they are, or recently were, on Facebook. Alongside that, I want to point out the most common way Meta distracts reporters and governing bodies from its terrible stats, because I think it’s a very useful thing to be able to spot. One of Frances Haugen’s SEC disclosure letters is about Meta’s failures to moderate hate speech. It’s helpfully titled, “Facebook misled investors and the public about ‘transparency’ reports boasting proactive removal of over 90% of identified hate speech when internal records show that ‘as little as 3-5% of hate’ speech is actually removed.”1 Here’s the excerpt from the internal Meta document from which that “3–5%” figure is drawn: …we’re deleting less than 5% of all of the hate speech posted to Facebook. This is actually an optimistic estimate—previous (and more rigorous) iterations of this estimation exercise have put it closer to 3%, and on V&I [violence and incitement] we’re deleting somewhere around 0.6%…we miss 95% of violating hate speech.2 Here’s another quote from different memo excerpted in the same disclosure letter: [W]e do not … have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas … We only take action against approximately 2% of the hate speech on the platform. Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term.3 Another estimate from a third internal document: We seem to be having a small impact in many language-country pairs on Hate Speech and Borderline Hate, probably ~3% … We are likely having little (if any) impact on violence.4 Here’s a fourth one, specific to a study about Facebook in Afghanistan, which I include to help contextualize the global numbers: While Hate Speech is consistently ranked as one of the top abuse categories in the Afghanistan market, the action rate for Hate Speech is worryingly low at 0.23 per cent.5 I don’t think these figures need a ton of commentary, honestly. I would agree that removing less than a quarter of a percent of hate speech is indeed “worryingly low,” as is removing 0.6% of violence and incitement messages. I think removing even 5% of hate speech—the highest number cited in the disclosures—is objectively terrible performance, and I think most people outside of the tech industry would agree with that. Which is presumably why Meta has put a ton of work into muddying the waters around content moderation. So back to that SEC letter with the long name. It points something out, which is that Meta has long claimed that Facebook “proactively” detects between 95% (in 2020, globally) and 98% (in Myanmar, in 2021) of all the posts it removes because they’re hate speech—before users even see them. At a glance, this looks good. Ninety-five percent is a lot! But since we know from the disclosed material that based on internal estimates the takedown rates for hate speech are at or below 5%, what’s going on here? Here’s what Meta is actually saying: Sure, they might identify and remove only a tiny fraction of dangerous and hateful speech on Facebook, but of that tiny fraction, their AI classifiers catch about 95–98% before users report it. That’s literally the whole game, here. So…the most generous number from the disclosed memos has Meta removing 5% of hate speech on Facebook. That would mean that for every 2,000 hateful posts or comments, Meta removes about 100–95 automatically and 5 via user reports. In this example, 1,900 of the original 2,000 messages remain up and circulating. So based on the generous 5% removal rate, their AI systems nailed…4.75% of hate speech. That’s the level of performance they’re bragging about. You don’t need to take my word for any of this—Wired ran a critique breaking it down in 2021 and Ranking Digital Rights has a strongly worded post about what Meta claims in public vs. what the leaked documents reveal to be true, including this content moderation math runaround. Meta does this particular routine all the time. The shell game Here’s Mark Zuckerberg on April 10th, 2018, answering a question in front of the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees. He says that hate speech is really hard to find automatically and then pivots to something that he says is a real success, which is “terrorist propaganda,” which he simplifies immediately to “ISIS and Al Qaida content.” But that stuff? No problem: Contrast [hate speech], for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we’ve actually been very successful at deploying A.I. tools on already. Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I. systems flag before any human sees it. So that’s a success in terms of rolling out A.I. tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.6 So that’s 99% of…the unknown percentage of this kind of content that’s actually removed. Zuckerberg actually tries to do the same thing the next day, April 11th, before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, but he whiffs the maneuver: …we’re getting good in certain areas. One of the areas that I mentioned earlier was terrorist content, for example, where we now have A.I. systems that can identify and—and take down 99 percent of the al-Qaeda and ISIS-related content in our system before someone—a human even flags it to us. I think we need to do more of that.7 The version Zuckerberg says right there, on April 11th, is what I’m pretty sure most people think Meta means when they go into this stuff—but as stated, it’s a lie. No one in those hearings presses Zuckerberg on those numbers—and when Meta repeats the move in 2020, plenty of reporters fall into the trap and make untrue claims favorable to Meta: …between its AI systems and its human content moderators, Facebook says it’s detecting and removing 95% of hate content before anyone sees it. —Fast Company About 95 percent of hate speech on Facebook gets caught by algorithms before anyone can report it… —Ars Technica Facebook said it took action on 22.1 million pieces of hate speech content to its platform globally last quarter and about 6.5 million pieces of hate speech content on Instagram. On both platforms, it says about 95% of that hate speech was proactively identified and stopped by artificial intelligence. —Axios The company said it now finds and eliminates about 95% of the hate speech violations using automated software systems before a user ever reports them… —Bloomberg This is all not just wrong but wildly wrong if you have the internal numbers in front of you. I’m hitting this point so hard not because I want to point out ~corporate hypocrisy~ or whatever, but because this deceptive runaround is consequential for two reasons: The first is that it provides instructive context about how to interpret Meta’s public statements. The second is that it actually says extremely dire things about Meta’s only hope for content-based moderation at scale, which is their AI-based classifiers. Here’s Zuckerberg saying as much to a congressional committee: …one thing that I think is important to understand overall is just the sheer volume of content on Facebook makes it so that we can’t—no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.… We need to rely on and build sophisticated A.I. tools that can help us flag certain content.8 This statement is kinda disingenuous in a couple of ways, but the central point is true: the scale of these platforms makes human review incredibly difficult. And Meta’s reasonable-sounding explanation is that this means they have to focus on AI. But by their own internal estimates, Meta’s AI classifiers are only identifying something in the range of 4.75% of hate speech on Facebook, and often considerably less. That seems like a dire stat for the thing you’re putting forward to Congress as your best hope! The same disclosed internal memo that told us Meta was deleting between 3% and 5% of hate speech had this to say about the potential of AI classifiers to handle mass-scale content removals: [O]ur current approach of grabbing a hundred thousand pieces of content, paying people to label them as Hate or Not Hate, training a classifier, and using it to automatically delete content at 95% precision is just never going to make much of a dent.9 Getting content moderation to work for even extreme and widely reviled categories of speech is obviously genuinely difficult, so I want to be extra clear about a foundational piece of my argument. Responsibility for the machine I think that if you make a machine and hand it out for free to everyone in the world, you’re at least partially responsible for the harm that the machine does. “It’s very difficult” perhaps doesn’t carry as much weight when you’re pulling in $40 billion in annual profits, as Meta did in 2021. Is it forty billion dollars difficult? Also, even if you say, “but it’s very difficult to make the machine safer!” I don’t think that reduces your responsibility so much as it makes you look shortsighted and bad at machines. Beyond the bare fact of difficulty, though, I think the more what harm the machine does deviates from what people might expect a machine that looks like this to do, the more responsibility you bear: If you offer everyone in the world a grenade, I think that’s bad, but also it won’t be surprising when people who take the grenade get hurt or hurt someone else. But when you offer everyone a cute little robot assistant that turns out to be easily repurposed as a rocket launcher, I think that falls into another category. Especially if you see that people are using your cute little robot assistant to murder thousands of people and elect not to disarm it because that would make it a little less cute. This brings us to the algorithms. “Core product mechanics” From a screencapped version of “Facebook and responsibility,” one of the disclosed internal documents. In the second post in this series, I quoted people in Myanmar who were trying to cope with an overwhelming flood of hateful and violence-inciting messages. It felt obvious on the ground that the worst, most dangerous posts were getting the most juice. Thanks to the Haugen disclosures, we can confirm that this was also understood inside Meta. The disclosed documents largely come from the years shortly after after the peak of the genocide of the Rohingya in Myanmar. They’re almost all retrospective, so I think they’re highly applicable to the period I’ve been looking at. In 2019, a Meta employee wrote a memo called “What is Collateral damage.” It included these statements (my emphasis): “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish on the platform. If integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. The mechanics of our platform are not neutral. 10 If you work in tech or if you’ve been following mainstream press accounts about Meta over the years, you presumably already know this, but I think it’s useful to establish this piece of the internal conversation. Here’s a long breakdown from 2020 about the specific parts of the platform that actively put “unconnected content”—messages that aren’t from friends or Groups people subscribe to—in front of Facebook users. It comes from an internal post called “Facebook and responsibility” (my emphasis): Facebook is most active in delivering content to users on recommendation surfaces like “Pages you may like,” “Groups you should join,” and suggested videos on Watch. These are surfaces where Facebook delivers unconnected content. Users don’t opt-in to these experiences by following other users or Pages. Instead, Facebook is actively presenting these experiences… News Feed ranking is another way Facebook becomes actively involved in these harmful experiences. Of course users also play an active role in determining the content they are connected to through feed, by choosing who to friend and follow. Still, when and whether a user sees a piece of content is also partly determined by the ranking scores our algorithms assign, which are ultimately under our control. This means, according to ethicists, Facebook is always at least partially responsible for any harmful experiences on News Feed. This doesn’t owe to any flaw with our News Feed ranking system, it’s just inherent to the process of ranking. To rank items in Feed, we assign scores to all the content available to a user and then present the highest-scoring content first. Most feed ranking scores are determined by relevance models. If the content is determined to be an integrity harm, the score is also determined by some additional ranking machinery to demote it lower than it would have appeared given its score. Crucially, all of these algorithms produce a single score; a score Facebook assigns. Thus, there is no such thing as inaction on Feed. We can only choose to take different kinds of actions.11 The next few quotes will apply directly to US concerns, but they’re clearly broadly applicable to the 90% of Facebook users who are outside the US and Canada, and whose disinfo concerns receive vastly fewer resources. This one is from an internal Meta doc from November 5, 2020: Not only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution.12 When Meta staff tried to take the measure of their own recommendation systems’ behavior, they found that the systems led a fresh, newly made account into disinfo-infested waters very quickly: After a small number of high quality/verified conservative interest follows… within just one day Page recommendations had already devolved towards polarizing content. Although the account set out to follow conservative political news and humor content generally, and began by following verified/high quality conservative pages, Page recommendations began to include conspiracy recommendations after only 2 days (it took <1 week to get a QAnon recommendation!) Group recommendations were slightly slower to follow suit - it took 1 week for in-feed GYSJ recommendations to become fully political/right-leaning, and just over 1 week to begin receiving conspiracy recommendations.13 The same document reveals that several of the Pages and Groups Facebook’s systems recommend to its test user show multiple signs of association with “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” aka foreign and domestic covert influence campaigns, which we’ll get to very soon. Before that, I want to offer just one example of algorithmic malpractice from Myanmar. Flower speech Back in 2014, Burmese organizations including MIDO and Yangon-based tech accelerator Phandeeyar collaborated on a carefully calibrated counter-speech project called Panzagar (flower speech). The campaign—which was designed to be delivered in person, in printed materials, and online—encouraged ordinary Burmese citizens to push back on hate speech in Myanmar. Later that year, Meta, which had just been implicated in the deadly communal violence in Mandalay, joined with the Burmese orgs to turn their imagery into digital Facebook stickers that users could apply to posts calling for things like the annihilation of the Rohingya people. The stickers depict cute cartoon characters, several of which offer admonishments like, “Don’t be the source of a fire,” “Think before you share,” “Don’t you be spawning hate,” and “Let it go buddy!” The campaign was widely and approvingly covered by western organizations and media outlets, and Meta got a lot of praise for its involvement. But according to members of the Burmese civil society coalition behind the campaign, it turned out that the Panzagar Facebook stickers—which were explicitly designed as counterspeech—“carried significant weight in their distribution algorithm,” so anyone who used them to counter hateful and violent messages inadvertently helped those messages gain wider distribution.14 I mention the Panzagar incident not only because it’s such a head-smacking example of Meta favoring cosmetic, PR-friendly tweaks over meaningful redress, or because it reveals plain incompetence in the face of already-serious violence, but also because it gets to what I see as a genuinely foundational problem with Meta in Myanmar. Even when the company was finally (repeatedly) forced to take notice of the dangers it was contributing to, actions that could actually have made a difference—like rolling out new programs only after local consultation and adaptation, scaling up culturally and linguistically competent human moderation teams in tandem with increasing uptake, and above all, altering the design of the product to stop amplifying the most charged messages—remained not just undone, but unthinkable because they were outside the company’s understanding of what the product’s design should take into consideration. This refusal to connect core project design with accelerating global safety problems means that attempts at prevention and repair are relegated to window-dressing—or which are actually counterproductive, as in the case of the Panzagar stickers, which absorbed the energy and efforts of local Burmese civil society groups and turned them into something that made the situation worse. In a 2018 interview with Frontline about problems with Facebook, Meta’s former Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, returns again and again to the idea that security work properly happens at the product design level. Toward the end of the interview, he gets very clear: Stamos: I think there was a structural problem here in that the people who were dealing with the downsides were all working together over kind of in the corner, right, so you had the safety and security teams, tight-knit teams that deal with all the bad outcomes, and we didn’t really have a relationship with the people who are actually designing the product. Interviewer: You did not have a relationship? Stamos: Not like we should have, right? It became clear—one of the things that became very clear after the election was that the problems that we knew about and were dealing with before were not making it back into how these products are designed and implemented.15 Meta’s content moderation was a disaster in Myanmar—and around the world—not only because it was treated and staffed like an afterthought, but because it was competing against Facebook’s core machinery. And just as the house always wins, the core machinery of a mass-scale product built to boost engagement always defeats retroactive and peripheral attempts at cleanup. This is especially true once organized commercial and nation-state actors figured out how to take over that machinery with large-scale fake Page networks boosted by fake engagement, which brings us to a less-discussed revelation: By the mid-2010s, Facebook had effectively become the equivalent of botnet in the hands of any group, governmental or commercial, who could summon the will and resources to exploit it. A lot of people did, including, predictably, some of the worst people in the world. Meta’s zombie networks Ophiocordyceps formicarum observed at the Mushroom Research Centre, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Steve Axford (CC BY-SA 3.0) Content warning: The NYT article I link to below is important, but it includes photographs of mishandled bodies, including those of children. If you prefer not to see those, a “reader view” or equivalent may remove the images. (Sarah Sentilles’ 2018 article on which kinds of bodies US newspapers put on display may be of interest.) In 2018, the New York Times published a front-page account of what really happened on Facebook in Myanmar, which is that beginning around 2013, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, set up a dedicated, ultra-secret anti-Rohingya hatefarm spread across military bases in which up to 700 staffers worked in shifts to manufacture the appearance of overwhelming support for the genocide the same military then carried out.16 When the NYT did their investigation in 2018, all those fake Pages were still up. Here’s how it worked: First, the military set up a sprawling network of fake accounts and Pages on Facebook. The fake accounts and Pages focused on innocuous subjects like beauty, entertainment, and humor. These Pages were called things like, “Beauty and Classic,” “Down for Anything,” “You Female Teachers,” “We Love Myanmar,” and “Let’s Laugh Casually.” Then military staffers, some trained by Russian propaganda specialists, spent years tending the Pages and gradually building up followers.17 Then, using this array of long-nurtured fake Pages—and Groups, and accounts—the Tatmadaw’s propagandists used everything they’d learned about Facebook’s algorithms to post and boost viral messages that cast Rohingya people as part of a global Islamic threat, and as the perpetrators of a never-ending stream of atrocities. The Times reports: Troll accounts run by the military helped spread the content, shout down critics and fuel arguments between commenters to rile people up. Often, they posted sham photos of corpses that they said were evidence of Rohingya-perpetrated massacres…18 That the Tatmadaw was capable of such a sophisticated operation shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Longtime Myanmar digital rights and technology researcher Victoire Rio notes that the Tatmadaw had been openly sending its officers to study in Russia since 2001, was “among the first adopters of the Facebook platform in Myanmar” and launched “a dedicated curriculum as part of its Defense Service Academy Information Warfare training.”19 What these messages did I don’t have the access required to sort out which specific messages originated from extremist religious networks vs. which were produced by military operations, but I’ve seen a lot of the posts and comments central to these overlapping campaigns in the UN documents and human rights reports. They do some very specific things: They dehumanize the Rohingya: The Facebook messages speak of the Rohingya as invasive species that outbreed Buddhists and Myanmar’s real ethnic groups. There are a lot of bestiality images. They present the Rohingya as inhumane, as sexual predators, and as an immediate threat: There are a lot of graphic photos of mangled bodies from around the world, most of them presented as Buddhist victims of Muslim killers—usually Rohingya. There are a lot of posts about Rohingya men raping, forcibly marrying, beating, and murdering Buddhist women. One post that got passed around a lot includes a graphic photo of a woman tortured and murdered by a Mexican cartel, presented as a Buddhist woman in Myanmar murdered by the Rohingya. They connect the Rohingya to the “global Islamic threat”: There’s a lot of equating Rohingya people with ISIS terrorists and assigning them group responsibility for real attacks and atrocities by distant Islamic terror organizations. Ultimately, all of these moves flow into demands for violence. The messages call incessantly and graphically for mass killings, beatings, and forced deportations. They call not for punishment, but annihilation. This is, literally, textbook preparation for genocide, and I want to take a moment to look at how it works. Helen Fein is the author of several definitive books on genocide, a co-founder and first president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the founder of the Institute for the Study of Genocide. I think her description of the ways genocidaires legitimize their attacks holds up extremely well despite having been published 30 years ago. Here, she classifies a specific kind of rhetoric as one of the defining characteristics of genocide: Is there evidence of an ideology, myth, or an articulated social goal which enjoins or justifies the destruction of the victim? Besides the above, observe religious traditions of contempt and collective defamation, stereotypes, and derogatory metaphor indicating the victim is inferior, subhuman (animals, insects, germs, viruses) or superhuman (Satanic, omnipotent), or other signs that the victims were pre-defined as alien, outside the universe of obligation of the perpetrator, subhuman or dehumanized, or the enemy—i.e., the victim needs to be eliminated in order that we may live (Them or Us).20 It’s also necessary for genocidaires to make claims—often supported by manufactured evidence—that the targeted group itself is the true danger, often by projecting genocidal intent onto the group that will be attacked. Adam Jones, the guy who wrote a widely used textbook on genocide, puts it this way: One justifies genocidal designs by imputing such designs to perceived opponents. The Tutsis/ Croatians/Jews/Bolsheviks must be killed because they harbor intentions to kill us, and will do so if they are not stopped/prevented/annihilated. Before they are killed, they are brutalized, debased, and dehumanized—turning them into something approaching “subhumans” or “animals” and, by a circular logic, justifying their extermination.21 So before their annihilation, the target group is presented as outcast, subhuman, vermin, but also themselves genocidal—a mortal threat. And afterward, the extraordinary cruelties characteristic of genocide reassure those committing the atrocities that their victims aren’t actually people. The Tatmadaw committed atrocities in Myanmar. I touched on them in Part II and I’m not going to detail them here. But the figuratively dehumanizing rhetoric I described in parts one and two can’t be separated from the literally dehumanizing things the Tatmadaw did to the humans they maimed and traumatized and killed. Especially now that it’s clear that the military was behind much of the rhetoric as well as the violent actions that rhetoric worked to justify. In some cases, even the methods match up: The military’s campaign of intense and systematic sexual violence toward and mutilation of women and girls, combined with the concurrent mass murder of children and babies, feels inextricably connected to the rhetoric that cast the Rohingya as both a sexual and reproductive threat who endanger the safety of Buddhist women and outbreed the ethnicities that belong in Myanmar. Genocidal communications are an inextricable part of a system that turns “ethnic tensions” into mass death. When we see that the Tatmadaw was literally the operator of covert hate and dehumanization propaganda networks on Facebook, I think the most rational way to understand those networks is as an integral part of the genocidal campaign. After the New York Times article went live, Meta did two big takedowns. Nearly four million people were following the fake Pages identified by either the NYT or by Meta in follow-up investigations. (Meta had previously removed the Tatmadaw’s own official Pages and accounts and 46 “news and opinion” Pages that turned out to be covertly operated by the military—those Pages were followed by nearly 12 million people.) So given these revelations and disclosures, here’s my question: Does the deliberate, adversarial use of Facebook by Myanmar’s military as a platform for disinformation and propaganda take any of the heat off of Meta? After all, a sovereign country’s military is a significant adversary. But here’s the thing—Alex Stamos, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, had been trying since 2016 to get Meta’s management and executives to acknowledge and meaningfully address the fact that Facebook was being used as host for both commercial and state-sponsored covert influence ops around the world. Including in the only place where it was likely to get the company into really hot water: the United States. “Oh fuck” On December 16, 2016, Facebook’s newish Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos—who now runs Stanford’s Internet Observatory—rang Meta’s biggest alarm bells by calling an emergency meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and other top-level Meta executives. In that meeting, documented in Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s book, The Ugly Truth, Stamos handed out a summary outlining the Russian capabilities. It read: We assess with moderate to high conﬁdence that Russian state-sponsored actors are using Facebook in an attempt to inﬂuence the broader political discourse via the deliberate spread of questionable news articles, the spread of information from data breaches intended to discredit, and actively engaging with journalists to spread said stolen information.22 “Oh fuck, how did we miss this?” Zuckerberg responded. This whole section draws information from Frenkel and Kang’s reporting in An Ugly Truth. For context, they’re both New York Times reporters—Frenkel previously covered Facebook and other tech companies for BuzzFeed News, and Kang did the same at the Washington Post. Stamos’ team had also uncovered “a huge network of false news sites on Facebook” posting and cross-promoting sensationalist bullshit, much of it political disinformation, along with examples of governmental propaganda operations from Indonesia, Turkey, and other nation-state actors. And the team had recommendations on what to do about it. Frenkel and Kang paraphrase Stamos’ message to Zuckerberg (my emphasis): Facebook needed to go on the oﬀensive. It should no longer merely monitor and analyze cyber operations; the company had to gear up for battle. But to do so required a radical change in culture and structure. Russia’s incursions were missed because departments across Facebook hadn’t communicated and because no one had taken the time to think like Vladimir Putin.23 Those changes in culture and structure didn’t happen. Stamos began to realize that to Meta’s executives, his work uncovering the foreign influence networks, and his choice to bring them to the executives’ attention, were both unwelcome and deeply inconvenient. All through the spring and summer of 2017, instead of retooling to fight the massive international category of abuse Stamos and his colleagues had uncovered, Facebook played hot potato with the information about the ops Russia had already run. On September 21, 2017, while the Tatmadaw’s genocidal “clearance operations” were approaching their completion, Mark Zuckerberg finally spoke publicly about the Russian influence campaign for the first time.24 In the intervening months, the massive covert influence networks operating in Myanmar ground along, unnoticed. Thanks to Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who spent two years at Facebook fighting to get networks like the Tatmadaw’s removed, we know quite a lot about why. What Sophie Zhang found In 2018, Facebook hired a data scientist named Sophie Zhang and assigned her to a new team working on fake engagement—and specifically on “scripted inauthentic activity,” or bot-driven fake likes and shares. Within her first year on the team, Zhang began finding examples of bot-driven engagement being used for political messages in both Brazil and India ahead of their national elections. Then she found something that concerned her a lot more. Karen Hao of the MIT Technology Review writes: The administrator for the Facebook page of the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, had created hundreds of pages with fake names and profile pictures to look just like users—and was using them to flood the president’s posts with likes, comments, and shares. (Facebook bars users from making multiple profiles but doesn’t apply the same restriction to pages, which are usually meant for businesses and public figures.) The activity didn’t count as scripted, but the effect was the same. Not only could it mislead the casual observer into believing Hernández was more well-liked and popular than he was, but it was also boosting his posts higher up in people’s newsfeeds. For a politician whose 2017 reelection victory was widely believed to be fraudulent, the brazenness—and implications—were alarming.25 When Zhang brought her discovery back to the teams working on Pages Integrity and News Feed Integrity, both refused to act, either to stop fake Pages from being created, or to keep the fake engagement signals the fake Pages generate from making posts go viral. But Zhang kept at it, and after a year, Meta finally removed the Honduran network. The very next day, Zhang reported a network of fake Pages in Albania. The Guardian’s Julia Carrie Wong explains what came next: In August, she discovered and filed escalations for suspicious networks in Azerbaijan, Mexico, Argentina and Italy. Throughout the autumn and winter she added networks in the Philippines, Afghanistan, South Korea, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iraq, Tunisia, Turkey, Taiwan, Paraguay, El Salvador, India, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Ukraine, Poland and Mongolia.26 For a much more recent example of Meta refusing to remove fake-Page networks and coordinated influence campaigns connected to high-profile accounts, see this September 27, 2023 Washington Post article on how Meta knowingly let covert coordinated influence campaigns run loose on Facebook because they were run by the Indian army. According to Zhang, Meta eventually established a policy against “inauthentic behavior,” but didn’t enforce it, and rejected Zhang’s proposal to punish repeat fake-Page creators by banning their personal accounts because of policy staff’s “discomfort with taking action against people connected to high-profile accounts.”27 Zhang discovered that even when she took initiative to track down covert influence campaigns, the teams who could take action to remove them didn’t—not without persistent “lobbying.” So Zhang tried harder. Here’s Karen Hao again: She was called upon repeatedly to help handle emergencies and praised for her work, which she was told was valued and important. But despite her repeated attempts to push for more resources, leadership cited different priorities. They also dismissed Zhang’s suggestions for a more sustainable solution, such as suspending or otherwise penalizing politicians who were repeat offenders. It left her to face a never-ending firehose: The manipulation networks she took down quickly came back, often only hours or days later. “It increasingly felt like I was trying to empty the ocean with a colander,” she says.28 Julia Carrie Wong’s Guardian piece reveals something interesting about Zhang’s reporting chain, which is that Meta’s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen, was one of the people giving her the hardest pushback. Remember Internet.org, also known as Free Basics, aka Meta’s push to dominate global internet use in all those countries it would go on to “deprioritize” and generally ignore? Guy Rosen, Meta’s then-newish VP of Integrity, is the guy who previously ran Internet.org. He came to lead Integrity directly from being VP of Growth. Before getting acquihired by Meta, Rosen co-founded a company The Information describes as “a startup that analyzed what people did on their smartphones.”29 Meta bought that startup in 2013, nominally because it would help Internet.org. In a very on-the-nose development, Rosen’s company’s supposedly privacy-protecting VPN software allowed Meta to collect huge amounts of data—so much that Apple booted the app from its store. So that’s Facebook’s VP of Integrity. “We simply didn’t care enough to stop them” In the Guardian, Julia Carrie Wong reports that in the fall of 2019, Zhang discovered that the Honduras network was back up, and she couldn’t get Meta’s Threat Intelligence team to deal with it. That December, she posted an internal memo about it. Rosen responded: Facebook had “moved slower than we’d like because of prioritization” on the Honduras case, Rosen wrote. “It’s a bummer that it’s back and I’m excited to learn from this and better understand what we need to do systematically,” he added. But he also chastised her for making a public [public as in within Facebook —EK] complaint, saying: “My concern is that threads like this can undermine the people that get up in the morning and do their absolute best to try to figure out how to spend the finite time and energy we all have and put their heart and soul into it.”[31] You can go read the MIT Technology Review piece and the Guardian piece, which have far more managerial quotes than I can fit in here, all of them hair-raising. In a private follow-up conversation (still in December, 2019), Zhang alerted Rosen that she’d been told that the Facebook Threat Intelligence team would only prioritize fake networks affecting “the US/western Europe and foreign adversaries such as Russia/Iran/etc.” Rosen told her that he agreed with those priorities. Zhang pushed back (my emphasis): I get that the US/western Europe/etc is important, but for a company with effectively unlimited resources, I don’t understand why this cannot get on the roadmap for anyone … A strategic response manager told me that the world outside the US/Europe was basically like the wild west with me as the part-time dictator in my spare time. He considered that to be a positive development because to his knowledge it wasn’t covered by anyone before he learned of the work I was doing. Rosen replied, “I wish resources were unlimited.”30 I’ll quote Wong’s next passage in full: “At the time, the company was about to report annual operating profits of $23.9bn on $70.7bn in revenue. It had $54.86bn in cash on hand.” In early 2020, Zhang’s managers told her she was all done tracking down influence networks—it was time she got back to hunting and erasing “vanity likes” from bots instead. But Zhang believed that if she stopped, no one else would hunt down big, potentially consequential covert influence networks. So she kept doing at least some of it, including advocating for action on an inauthentic Azerbaijan network that appeared to be connected to the country’s ruling party. In an internal group, she wrote that, “Unfortunately, Facebook has become complicit by inaction in this authoritarian crackdown.” Although we conclusively tied this network to elements of the government in early February, and have compiled extensive evidence of its violating nature, the effective decision was made not to prioritize it, effectively turning a blind eye.”31 After those messages, Threat Intelligence decided to act on the network after all. Then Meta fired Zhang for poor performance. On her way out the door, Zhang posted a long exit memo—7,800 words—describing what she’d seen. Meta deleted it, so Zhang put up a password-protected version on her own website so her colleagues can see it. So Meta got Zhang’s entire website taken down and her domain deactivated. Eventually Meta got enough employee pressure that it put an edited version back up on their internal site.32 Shortly thereafter, someone leaked the memo to Buzzfeed News. In the memo, Zhang wrote: I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions. I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I’ve lost count.33 And: “[T]he truth was, we simply didn’t care enough to stop them.” On her final day at Meta, Zhang left notes for her colleagues, tallying suspicious accounts involved in political influence campaigns that needed to be investigated: There were 200 suspicious accounts still boosting a politician in Bolivia, she recorded; 100 in Ecuador, 500 in Brazil, 700 in Ukraine, 1,700 in Iraq, 4,000 in India and more than 10,000 in Mexico.34 “With all due respect” Zhang’s work at Facebook happened after the wrangling over Russian influence ops that Alex Stamos’ team found. And after the genocide in Myanmar. And after Mark Zuckerberg did his press-and-government tour about how hard Meta tried and how much better they’d do after Myanmar.35 It was an entire calendar year after the New York Times found the Tatmadaw’s genocide-fueling fake-Page hatefarm that Guy Rosen, Facebook’s VP of Integrity, told Sophie Zhang that the only coordinated fake networks Facebook would take down were the ones that affected the US, Western Europe, and “foreign adversaries.”36 In response to Zhang’s disclosures, Rosen later hopped onto Twitter to deliver his personal assessment of the networks Zhang found and couldn’t get removed: With all due respect, what she’s described is fake likes—which we routinely remove using automated detection. Like any team in the industry or government, we prioritize stopping the most urgent and harmful threats globally. Fake likes is not one of them. One of Frances Haugen’s disclosures includes an internal memo that summarizes Meta’s actual, non-Twitter-snark awareness of the way Facebook has been hollowed out for routine use by covert influence campaigns: We frequently observe highly-coordinated, intentional activity on the FOAS [Family of Apps and Services] by problematic actors, including states, foreign actors, and actors with a record of criminal, violent or hateful behaviour, aimed at promoting social violence, promoting hate, exacerbating ethnic and other societal cleavages, and/or delegitimizing social institutions through misinformation. This is particularly prevalent—and problematic—in At Risk Countries and Contexts.37 So, they knew. Because of Haugen’s disclosures, we also know that in 2020, for the category, “Remove, reduce, inform/measure misinformation on FB Apps, Includes Community Review and Matching”—so, that’s moderation targeting misinformation specifically—only 13% of the total budget went to the non-US countries that provide more than 90% of Facebook’s user base, and which include all of those At Risk Countries. The other 87% of the budget was reserved for the 10% of Facebook users who live in the United States.38 In case any of this seems disconnected with the main thread of what happened in Myanmar, here’s what (formerly Myanmar-based) researcher Victoire Rio had to say about covert coordinated influence networks in her extremely good 2020 case study about the role of social media in Myanmar’s violence: Bad actors spend months—if not years—building networks of online assets, including accounts, pages and groups, that allow them to manipulate the conversation. These inauthentic presences continue to present a major risk in places like Myanmar and are responsible for the overwhelming majority of problematic content.39 Note that Rio says that these inauthentic networks—the exact things Sophie Zhang chased down until she got fired for it—continued to present a major risk in 2020. It’s time to skip ahead. Let’s go to Myanmar in 2021, four years after the peak of the genocide. After everything I’ve dealt with in this whole painfully long series so far, it would be fair to assume that Meta would be prioritizing getting everything right in Myanmar. Especially after the coup. Meta in Myanmar, again (2021) If you want to understand the coup and its aftermath, you might read the Council on Foreign Relations explainer, an AFAICT competent NYT backgrounder, the Crisis Group’s wonk-grade explainer, or the remarkable first-person “Chronicle of a Coup” blog series at Tea Circle, in which a pseudonymous westerner relates his experience of life in Myanmar during and after the coup. Human Rights Watch is reporting on the junta’s abuses, which they consider crimes against humanity. In 2021, the Tatmadaw deposed Myanmar’s democratically elected government and transferred the leadership of the country to the military’s Commander-in-Chief. Since then, the military has turned the machines of surveillance, administrative repression, torture, and murder that it refined on the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities onto Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic Bamar majority. Also in 2021, Facebook’s director of policy for APAC Emerging Countries, Rafael Frankel, told the Associated Press that Facebook had now “built a dedicated team of over 100 Burmese speakers.” This “dedicated team is,” presumably, the group of contract workers employed by the Accenture-run “Project Honey Badger” team in Malaysia.40 (Which, Jesus.) In October of 2021, the Associated Press took a look at how that’s working out on Facebook in Myanmar. Right away, they found threatening and violent posts: One 2 1/2 minute video posted on Oct. 24 of a supporter of the military calling for violence against opposition groups has garnered over 56,000 views. “So starting from now, we are the god of death for all (of them),” the man says in Burmese while looking into the camera. “Come tomorrow and let’s see if you are real men or gays.” One account posts the home address of a military defector and a photo of his wife. Another post from Oct. 29 includes a photo of soldiers leading bound and blindfolded men down a dirt path. The Burmese caption reads, “Don’t catch them alive.”41 That’s where content moderation stood in 2021. What about the algorithmic side of things? Is Facebook still boosting dangerous messages in Myanmar? In the spring of 2021, Global Witness analysts made a clean Facebook account with no history and searched for တပ်မတော်—“Tatmadaw.” They opened the top page in the results, a military fan page, and found no posts that broke Facebook’s new, stricter rules. Then they hit the “like” button, which caused a pop-up with “related pages” to appear. Then the team popped open up the first five recommended pages. Here’s what they found: Three of the five top page recommendations that Facebook’s algorithm suggested contained content posted after the coup that violated Facebook’s policies. One of the other pages had content that violated Facebook’s community standards but that was posted before the coup and therefore isn’t included in this article. Specifically, they found messages that included: Incitement to violence Content that glorifies the suffering or humiliation of others Misinformation that can lead to physical harm42 As well as several kinds of posts that violated Facebook’s new and more specific policies on Myanmar. So not only were the violent, violence-promoting posts still showing up in Myanmar four years later after the atrocities in Rakhine State—and after the Tatmadaw turned the full machinery of of its violence onto opposition members of Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic majority—but Facebook was still funneling users directly into them after even the lightest engagement with anodyne pro-military content. This is in 2021, with Meta throwing vastly more resources at the problem than it ever did during the period leading up to and including the genocide of the Rohingya people. Its algorithms are making active recommendations by Facebook, precisely as outlined in the Meta memos in Haugen’s disclosures. By any reasonable measure, I think this is a failure. Meta didn’t respond to requests for comment from Global Witness, but when the Guardian and AP picked up the story, Meta got back to them with…this: Our teams continue to closely monitor the situation in Myanmar in real-time and take action on any posts, Pages or Groups that break our rules. We proactively detect 99 percent of the hate speech removed from Facebook in Myanmar, and our ban of the Tatmadaw and repeated disruption of coordinated inauthentic behavior has made it harder for people to misuse our services to spread harm.43 One more time: This statement says nothing about how much hate speech is removed. It’s pure misdirection. Internal Meta memos highlight ways to use Facebook’s algorithmic machinery to sharply reduce the spread of what they called “high-harm misinfo.” For those potentially harmful topics, you “hard demote” (aka “push down” or “don’t show”) reshared posts that were originally made by someone who isn’t friended or followed by the viewer. (Frances Haugen talks about this in interviews as “cutting the reshare chain.”) And this method works. In Myanmar, “reshare depth demotion” reduced “viral inflammatory prevalence” by 25% and cut “photo misinformation” almost in half. In a reasonable world, I think Meta would have decided to broaden use of this method and work on refining it to make it even more effective. What they did, though, was decide to roll it back within Myanmar as soon as the upcoming elections were over.44 The same SEC disclosure I just cited also notes that Facebook’s AI “classifier” for Burmese hate speech didn’t seem to be maintained or in use—and that algorithmic recommendations were still shuttling people toward violent, hateful messages that violated Facebook’s Community Standards. So that’s how the algorithms were going. How about the military’s covert influence campaign? Reuters reported in late 2021 that: As Myanmar’s military seeks to put down protest on the streets, a parallel battle is playing out on social media, with the junta using fake accounts to denounce opponents and press its message that it seized power to save the nation from election fraud… The Reuters reporters explain the military has assigned thousands of the soldiers to wage “information combat” in what appears to be an expanded, distributed version of their earlier secret propaganda ops: “Soldiers are asked to create several fake accounts and are given content segments and talking points that they have to post,” said Captain Nyi Thuta, who defected from the army to join rebel forces at the end of February. “They also monitor activity online and join (anti-coup) online groups to track them.” 45 (We know this because Reuters journalists got hold of a high-placed defector from the Tatmadaw’s propaganda wing.) When asked for comment, Facebook’s regional Director of Public Policy told Reuters that Meta “‘proactively’ detected almost 98 percent of the hate speech removed from its platform in Myanmar.” “Wasting our lives under tarpaulin” The Rohingya people forced to flee Myanmar have scattered across the region, but the overwhelming majority of those who fled in 2017 ended up in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh. The camps are beyond overcrowded, and they make everyone who lives in them vulnerable to the region’s seasonal flooding, to worsening climate impacts, and to waves of disease. This year, the refugees’ food aid was just cut from the equivalent of $12 a month to $8 month, because the international community is focused elsewhere.46 The complex geopolitical situation surrounding post-coup Myanmar—in which many western and Asian countries condemn the situation in Myanmar, but don’t act lest they push the Myanmar junta further toward China—seems likely to ensure a long, bloody conflict, with no relief in sight for the Rohingya.47 The UN estimates that more than 960,000 Rohingya refugees now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. More than half are children, few of whom have had much education at all since coming to the camps six years ago. The UN estimates that the refugees needed about $70.5 million for education in 2022, of which 1.6% was actually funded. 48 Amnesty International spoke with Mohamed Junaid, a 23-year-old Rohingya volunteer math and chemistry teacher, who is also a refugee. He told Amnesty: Though there were many restrictions in Myanmar, we could still do school until matriculation at least. But in the camps our children cannot do anything. We are wasting our lives under tarpaulin.49 In their report, “The Social Atrocity,” Amnesty wrote that in 2020, seven Rohingya youth organizations based in the refugee camps made a formal application to Meta’s Director of Human Rights. They requested that, given its role in the crises that led to their expulsion from Myanmar, Meta provide just one million dollars in funding to support a teacher-training initiative within the camps—a way to give the refugee children a chance at an education that might someday serve them in the outside world. Meta got back to the Rohingya youth organizations in 2021, a year in which the company cleared $39.3B in profits: Unfortunately, after discussing with our teams, this specific proposal is not something that we’re able to support. As I think we noted in our call, Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities. In 2022, Global Witness came back for one more look at Meta’s operations in Myanmar, this time with eight examples of real hate speech aimed at the Rohingya—actual posts from the period of the genocide, all taken from the UN Human Rights Council findings I’ve been linking to so frequently in this series. They submitted these real-life examples of hate speech to Meta as Burmese-language Facebook advertisements. Meta accepted all eight ads.50 The final post in this series, Part IV, will be up in about a week.

That would mean that for every 2,000 hateful posts or comments, Meta removes about 100–95 automatically and 5 via user reports.Its really hard to contextualize these numbers. What are the comparable rates for other media?What % of hate speech on Mastodon is taken down? Twitter? YouTube? Discord? Comparing with old-school mob formation technology, what about leaflets handed out? Political rallies?Meta is an obvious target because they have such a high % of total online speech, and by virtue of this make a potentially impactful single intervention point to make things better. And these articles do make it seem they have room at the margin to improve. But imagine a word with multiple social networks per country - do we think they would be better or worse at policing this stuff (and crucially, the places where it matters are the developing less-regulated countries, often with governments that are at least disinterested in preventing the ethnic conflicts, if not actively promoting them)? I can see hand-wavey arguments in both directions but what I really want is data analyzing the question. reply intended 13 hours agoparentThe term is Prevalence. I have been looking for years, and have essentially shifted careers to find it. I didnt even have a name for it until recently. There is also no way to get the data you are looking for. As someone described it - this is akin to asking how much crime happens every day.You could get an approximation - For resourced languages though.Meta launched Hindi classifiers in 2021 and Bengali in 2022, covering 0.6bn and 0.24bn people, respectively. I know how poor the lexicons I have seen in the wild are, and how hard it is to stay ahead of terminology.Meta is probably doing more to stay ahead than others. However the ARPU for a user in the US vs India is stark.Platforms aren’t going to release the necessary data for even a rough approximation. Reddit was a potential data source to learn from, but now we have the API rules, so that is also closed off. Lucky us.Not to mention how supremely unprepared society is to actually understand or discuss the data without making it worse.Meta has more resources and frankly they regained my trust years ago. However, business is business. Twitter and Reddit have shown that in this current cycle, there are are no consequences for neglecting Trust and Safety, as shown by other companies. T&S teams have been reduced globally. T&S teams are being targeted and vilified.Next year, there are ~50 elections happening, including the USA and India. The network suits certain narratives - the more insular, fear driven ones. Trust and Safety teams are themselves being exposed.Its already looking like a perfect storm. reply arczyx 18 hours agoparentprevRather than the 5% number (which may be the best they can do with current start of art), what feels more damning to me is that they found a method that can reduce misinformation (by way more than 5%), and then decided to rollback it.> And this method works.

Second there is the difficulty of deciding what to do and implementing an effective filtering policy. Third since there are multiple instances this can&#x27;t be done in a consistent way across the network. Fourth they can&#x27;t stop the Myanmar government from setting up its own Mastodon instances, blocking access to outside instances, etc.You&#x27;d better believe that if Modi keeps going down the road he is going on that India will kick out all western social media companies if they try to block his campaign of dehumanizing non-hindus.From my perspective there is a lot of harmful talk that goes on social media that falls short of hate speech. In terms of my own feed I have keyword blocks against most Republican primary candidates (not Nikki Haley though) and there are many other topics that I think people are not capable of having a civil and productive conversation on or that I just don&#x27;t want to be exposed to. A lot of stuff on the slippery slope to \"hate speech\" is blocked by this and it is OK when I do it because it is my own feed, but you&#x27;d better believe there are lots of people who think they have something so important to say that it would be crime to \"censor\" their shit (for lack of a better word) if the block affected more than just me.Unfortunately the discussion around A.I. is dominated by positions like: (1) ChatGPT is the God at the end of the universe that Teilhard de Chardin told us about, or (2) It was just fine that Google stole everybody&#x27;s content for years and years but all of a sudden ChatGPT came out and be outraged all of a sudden at this rip-off.The truth about it is that machine learning algorithms over text have terrible performance, even the good ones. The performance curves look something likehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;scikit-learn.org&#x2F;0.23&#x2F;auto_examples&#x2F;model_selection&#x2F;...and for my RSS reader I am happy to approach an AUC of 0.8, an AUC of > 0.95 for most tasks is getting into science fiction territory. And that&#x27;s nowhere near being able to clean up hate speech at the rate that it should be cleared.The short of it is that if you want to get rid of a lot more than \"5%\" of the outright \"hate speech\" you will also get rid of a lot of \"dislike speech\" and \"angry speech\" and \"annoyed speech\" as well as some \"innocent speech\".To be really frank my filter deletes anything about \"cis\" and \"trans\" because it I think maybe 10% of what people say on the subject is outright hateful, 80% of it is emotionally negative, maybe 10% of the time somebody has something neutral or positive to say. My take is that losing a small amount of content I might want to see for being free of a lot of negativity is a bargain I am willing to make. A platform that imposed that kind of judgement on the community could be a much more emotionally positive place than anything you&#x27;ve seen but it is also going to get all sorts of criticism from people for doing so. reply BlueTemplar 14 hours agorootparent> It is almost laughable that Mastodon could do any better in a case like Myanmar.> First there would be the delay of the rest of the community understanding what was going on in an unusual language.

Not that there would be a lot of overlap with the Burmese community anyway, so that wouldn&#x27;t have much of an effect.We already had an example BTW, with Gab splitting out with Mastodon, but then in a heavily English-speaking context.What would have made at least a symbolic difference, is that some of these Mastodons would have been operated by the anti-hatred groups described in part I, and they would not have needed to unsuccessfully beg Facebook about doing moderation (with 0-4 moderators from other continents).But in the end this is mostly spurious discussion : hate speech only effectively gets stomped out when a judge hands out sentences to the haters, but when the law enforcement that should handle them are the ones preparing genocide...(Not that Facebook is not condamnable for heating it up.) reply PaulHoule 11 hours agorootparentCertainly a lot of people seem to believe that many Mastodon instances are better moderated than commercial social media.Certainly some kinds of right-wing hate are suppressed but there is very little pushback about widespread misuse of the word \"fascist\" to describe your local police department, or people in women&#x27;s sports who use period trackers to prevent ACL tears, mainstream milquetoast politicians, or just about anyone.On the other hand a lot of it seems like BS, there are two Mastodon instances that seem to be at war with Hacker News, I think I understand why one of them is mad at HN, I don&#x27;t know if the second is mad out of sympathy with the first or they have some other grievance.Many mastodonsters were concerned that Threads would be poorly moderated (might allow posts about how period tracking prevents ACL tears in female athletes I guess) but Threads pretty much dropped everybody&#x27;s radar.---One angle is that a system like this should have \"defense in depth\", like you try to create a culture where hateful speech is not welcome, where people don&#x27;t try it because they know they&#x27;ll get disapproval, where people know they&#x27;ll get confronted if they call Keir Starmer a fascist, where people know you just don&#x27;t boost hateful things, etc.In that sense you might just want to cultivate a lot of positive and neutral stuff and encourage people seeking negativity to go elsewhere. I think this is what Instagram was going for with Threads and it might be one reason why people should be asking \"whatever happened to Threads?\" but they don&#x27;t because they&#x27;ve forgotten all about it. reply erie 16 hours agoparentprevFacebook has been the internet in Myanmar,&#x27; Entering the country in 2010, Facebook initially allowed its app to be used without incurring data charges, so it gained rapid popularity.

I agree with a lot of what she said, and I mean a lot, but you have a misconception.The integrity org, back when I was there, had thousands of folks and was aggressively hiring. They were not a lone island and were also supported by other orgs like data infra, FAIR, security, privacy, product teams and more.Site integrity, Sophie’s team, was a small piece of the work done there. And they, like any team, relied heavily on other teams. You have all this unbelievable tooling internally, and internal teams are incentivized to get you to use it.These issues were not from want of trying. The reality is that problems like this at scale are incredibly difficult. In my opinion, Frances trivialized a lot of this in her whistleblowing, but it makes a good news story so what can you do.It pains me when people trivialize it as “just do the machine learnings to fix it all” or “if these tech companies actually gave a damn this wouldn’t be an issue”. It’s an incredibly hard problem, and much like security it will never be “solved”.That doesn’t excuse when technology has a bad effect on the world.

Admittedly I had some reservations up front, but during the on-site day I made up my mind to never even consider FB as a potential employer again. During a chat session between interviews, I asked about the prospect of doing proactive education - essentially, detecting users who had been caught in the influence operations and then surfacing them a note that they had been targeted by such activities, so that they could themselves make educated decisions.The senior manager I was talking with at the time was visibly taken aback by the very idea. \"We don&#x27;t do that!\"From that experience I drew the inference that FB are fundamentally, as an organisation, incapable of doing the right thing.

A company as profitable as Facebook is going to have projects that are motivated by things other than profits.There is most likely a team at Facebook whose goal it is to get as many users as possible in developing markets. These markets do not generate profits from online ads. Facebook will never disclose its cost per user but in general online ads only make money from affluent users. I have heard that even mid income countries like Mexico or Romania are not profitable for ads. A place where people make an average of $3 a day is wildly unprofitable for Facebook and even the most optimistic development projections will not make them profitable for several decades. The OP is spot on that the amount of money that Facebook will ever receive from Myanmar is negligible.Based on conversations with people at Facebook I generally get the sense that people there (especially at the top) have a strong sense of mission and a belief that their product makes the world a better place (I disagree with this but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact). I would guess that these the project tasked with increasing users in developing countries is viewed more as philanthropy than business. reply kaycebasques 16 hours agorootparentprev> Facebook hired 20,000+ content moderators at great expense who they still employ to monitor for stuff like thisPart II of this series addresses this stat. During the peak genocidal years it seems there were only a handful of mods assigned to Myanmar, and none of them lived in Myanmar. To this day it sounds like there still may not be more than a hundred people moderating Myanmar content. Which is inline with the 20K number: 195 countries * 100 moderators per country = 19.5K mods totalI guess my main idea here is that when I look at the back-of-envelope numbers it&#x27;s easy to see how even 100 moderators would have trouble keeping up with the content that millions of people produce. So you really do need those automated moderation tools to be effective.Can someone please continue the thought experiment by estimating how much content each mod can review in a day, then extrapolating up to a week or month, and comparing to an estimate of how much content was actually posted on Facebook in the similar timeframe?

My perception going in was that comment moderation is very hard, and essentially impossible at scale, and that Facebook&#x2F;Meta cannot credibly be accused of literally causing genocide. Here is how my opinion shifted some after reading this series:The articles present a lot of evidence to support the notion that Facebook was well aware of clear-cut incitement to violence years before its escalation into large-scale genocide in late 2016. It isn&#x27;t spelled out explicitly, but I think there are two things that make Facebook&#x27;s initial apparent non-response easier to understand as incompetence rather than evil:* In the aftermath of the Arab spring, technology and social networks enjoyed a honeymoon in public perception that is hard to remember over a decade later. People, including (especially?) people in tech, could genuinely believe that making it easier for people to talk to each other was basically good, full stop. I&#x27;d suggest that this honeymoon only really ended after the 2016 US presidential election, which caused a lot of soul searching about information and echo chambers, and got even worse after the Cambridge Analytica scandal [3, this is a graph image from NBC news]* As part I of the article notes, \"[t]he information landscape in Myanmar is so unstable that accounts of any given incident conflict, often in major ways\". This dynamic seems to appear in a lot of places where well-off westerners interact with much poorer and more chaotic countries (Rwanda is a clear parallel). Part I points out that the \"Burmese government\" itself seems to make statements both fanning anger against the Rohingya and then trying to walk them back when it boils over into disorderSo I think it was possible to be a basically well-intentioned (naive) Facebook employee in the leadup to 2016 and hear of strange, almost genocidal sounding posts in another language in a place you don&#x27;t understand and still not think \"this is a break-glass moment and I need to escalate and make a new path inside my corporation for this to be taken seriously\". In hindsight, this was wrong, but I think we&#x27;re forgetting that what happened next didn&#x27;t seem possible, because we still thought of the internet as an exceptional new dawn in mass communication. A lot is necessary for people to process something as a novel, serious emergency.However, it&#x27;s hard to maintain this judgment over the ensuing years, as senior figures at Facebook are repeatedly presented with evidence that people are deliberately distributing misinformation (e.g., making fake accounts, and other clear-cut evidence that doesn&#x27;t require a fact checker and research) and mostly wave it away unless it&#x27;s big enough to provoke media and investor consternation. By the end of the 2010s, I think Facebook was well past the \"this sort of thing wasn&#x27;t something we could imagine\" stage of a crisis, and into a less defensible position along the lines of \"this is reality, it cannot really be moderated, but we can pretend to moderate\".One last point re: moderation, I have no idea how Meta hires its Burmese content moderators, but it must be tricky, since as far as I can tell most people in Burma are anti-Rohingya. I would like to be wrong about this, but what should be factually trustworthy sources like the Brookings institution write things like:> Most of the Myanmar population, especially the Buddhist majority, feels that the Rohingya don’t belong in their country ... [t]he straightforward solution would be to help the Rohingya return to their homes in Myanmar and live in peace and freedom.

See Reuters, 2016:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-myanmar-rohingya&#x2F;myanmars...> \"“Though not confirmed, there are indications he went to Pakistan and possibly elsewhere, and that he received practical training in modern guerrilla warfare,” the group said. It noted that Ata Ullah was one of 20 Rohingya from Saudi Arabia leading the group’s operations in Rakhine State. Separately, a committee of 20 senior Rohingya emigres oversees the group, which has headquarters in Mecca, the ICG said.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ataullah_abu_Ammar_JununiThat certainly doesn&#x27;t justify the response of the Myanmar government, but it helps explain it to some degree - imagine the US political response if, say, US border facilities were attacked by an Iran-based group that killed a dozen US border guards.Entirely neglecting this background is just bad journalism, and also distorts the role of Meta. It&#x27;s highly unlikely, given this information, that a rigorous censorship strategy on Meta would have changed the outcome much if at all. A more rational conclusion is that the Myanmar government viewed the Rohingya people as a potential base for Saudi&#x2F;Pakistani-backed terror groups to launch attacks within Myanmar, and that was the root cause of the expulsion, and that social media-based propaganda efforts were not that important in understanding what happened.I&#x27;m also in favor of free speech over censorship - it&#x27;s very easy to demonstrate in an open conversation that mindless hatred of others based on their ethnic&#x2F;religious&#x2F;racial background is simply the product of ignorance and immaturity. reply catlover76 17 hours agoparent> I&#x27;m also in favor of free speech over censorship - it&#x27;s very easy to demonstrate in an open conversation that mindless hatred of others based on their ethnic&#x2F;religious&#x2F;racial background is simply the product of ignorance and immaturity.Clearly it&#x27;s not; this myth needs to stop being pushed.

Is this consequence of free market capitalism really how the US should do things? reply rakoo 17 hours agoparent [–] Being a private company doesn&#x27;t absolve you from responsibilities. If you can&#x27;t function, as a company, without inciting a mass genocide, then maybe you should just close shop.\"Free market\" doesn&#x27;t exist, never has, but I will not repeat myself here. Capitalism isn&#x27;t inevitable, and is indeed incompatible with people being in their own power and not dying because a private company finds it profitable. I am delighted to see that we arrive at the same conclusion: capitalism should be abolished. reply jowea 15 hours agorootparentMy point is not to absolve Facebook really. If they&#x27;re making the software, publishing it to the country, designing the algorithm for maximum profit, profiting when a fake news content farm posts hate speech, and making deals to zero-rate the service then yes they definitively share in the blame.It&#x27;s more that we are expecting an US company with a goal profit and controlled by a single person to be the world moderator. We got used to it but to me it feels weird if I try to stop being a fish in the water.The US government is not really definitive on whether their large companies and media industry are an agent of state power or not. Sometimes they aren&#x27;t, sometimes the government pushes a bit (like with the Hollywood military movies), sometimes Congress calls Zuckerberg to complain, sometimes it&#x27;s American society that pushes American companies into pursuing goals in other countries. But then Facebook is expected to oppose state organizations from other countries. Sure they have the money but is that really in their purview and the best way to handle things?And in this case, the local government, which in an ideal world would be the proper \"moderator\" for when the national debate has gone beyond acceptable bounds is actually an hostile agent. So the foreign private organization is supposed to deal with that.In my opinion a situation where a profit-maximizing company is in this type of situation where profit and basic human rights are in conflict things already have gone wrong. I don&#x27;t know how but avoiding a genocide shouldn&#x27;t depend on some distant corporate officer paying attention to a country responsible for a tiny fraction of revenue and deciding to lower the company&#x27;s profits!And one of the root problems IMHO is that like a few things in the tech world, this series makes obvious the issues with Myanmar like a lot of other Third World countries using tech developed in and for the West. So Facebook then throws its platform over the wall for some extra profit above what it gets in the First World, grabs nearly the entire market since it has lots of already invested capital in software and infrastructure and negotiating power for zero-rating, all without having to expend barely any money doing things like hiring moderators or adapting to local conditions.Sorry for rambling. reply logicchains 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] >without inciting a mass genocideThe Myanmar government incited a mass genocide, Facebook was just one of the communication mediums they used.>capitalism should be abolishedPretty rich saying this while commenting on Myanmar. Myanmar did abolish capitalism, that&#x27;s why they have a communist government, and nobody has the power to stand up to the government because no capitalism == no private property. Abolishing capitalism is essentially saying \"only people in the government are allowed to own property\", and on top of that constructing a violent state apparatus to destroy anyone who dares to acquire property of their own.You can&#x27;t abolish capitalism without also having groups of armed men arresting or killing anyone who tries to open a shop, because violently intervening is the only way to stop two willing parties from trading with each other.

If they made the decision to set aside some amount of money to be untouchable based on a random number, that is, uh, unconventional to say the least, but they very purposefully chose not to have an insurance fund despite advertising that they did which makes this all the more sinister. reply opportune 13 hours agoparentYes. This should be an instrumental price of evidence in proving that FTX leadership was not “tragically incompetent” but rather willfully and knowingly defrauded its customers. reply doubloon 13 hours agoparentprevi think when you are trying to prove a company is lying about having a zillion dollars of insurance, it helps if you can kind of pull the curtain down and show everyone the number &#x27;zillion&#x27; was made up by someone throwing a pair of dice, not by someone counting a pile of zillions of dollar bills. reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agoparentprevWell, yes, the issue is it was fake. But they compounded their fraud by publicly asserting a value of the fund, and the fact they implemented it as a random number shows malicious intent. Sometimes you can wave around incompetence etc as a mitigating factor, but this is clearly intentional deception and this proves it clearly and beyond a doubt. reply function_seven 9 hours agorootparentOn the contrary, you want your fund to cover unlucky situations. By linking the size of the insurance to a random number, you cancel out unlucky external events with a lucky internal event, thereby ensuring proper coverage.So long as the random value is truly random. Were there lava lamps in the FTX server room? reply Incipient 9 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t cover \"unlucky\" with &#x27;random numbers\".

So, a single day for which the fund actually decreases wouldn&#x27;t matter much. It might even be beneficial to make it look more real. reply BXlnt2EachOther 8 hours agorootparentf2d does seem like float-to-decimal (edit, typo). My brain is off for the evening but might that part have a misplaced parenthesis? They f2d() the random number but then multiply it by the higher-precision expression (previous day&#x27;s volume &#x2F; 1 billion), which will give 8 numbers after the decimal in USD as in the tweet they posted. Still, it&#x27;s fewer digits than without the call I suppose. reply gruez 13 hours agoparentprevThe function doesn&#x27;t calculate the insurance fund amount directly, it only applies a change to the insurance fund (line 28), based on last day&#x27;s trading volume. Presumably this function gets run every day, so the size of the insurance fund would be the sum of this process repeated multiple times. The chances of that going to negative would be astronomically low. reply whbrown 13 hours agoparentprevSince it&#x27;s a normal distribution with a mean of 7500, and a standard deviation of 3000 multiplied by daily volume—it would only cause a negative change less than 1% of the time. This \"PublicInsuranceFund\" truly embodies their culture of \"number go up\". reply timmytokyo 13 hours agoparentprevThis is obviously just speculation, but there probably wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of thought put into it by the coder. The goal was \"produce a fluctuating number based on daily trading volume so that it looks like we have a real insurance fund\". The randomness is simply there to help make the fraudulent representation less obvious. The fact that the number can (very rarely) go negative is just another example of the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants thinking pervasive at FTX. reply chatmasta 12 hours agorootparentKnowing FTX, they might have even convinced themselves that this was a legitimate hedging strategy. reply ilyt 11 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d imagine that the person writing it thought the function generates numbers 7500 +&#x2F;- 3000 and not anything outside this range. reply dabeeeenster 13 hours agoprevThis is a proper disgrace to software as a discipline.

In practice, random numbers accomplish this, but randomness isn’t quite the same thing as what you’re striving for.So, for example, the problem with “randomly” picking 4 every time (a la xkcd) is that it introduces a spurious correlation between the places where it’s used. reply eptcyka 13 hours agorootparent4 doesn&#x27;t originate from XKCD, it originates from Playstation 3&#x27;s firmware.

FTX charges a % fee on every trade, so this is the equivalent of taking a fraction of their fee revenue and putting that into an insurance fund, which seems pretty reasonable. reply tomku 12 hours agorootparentIf you look closely, you may notice that the code that \"adds to the insurance fund\" doesn&#x27;t _take_ that money from anywhere. It&#x27;s just retrieving a number from the database, adding a value to it out of thin air and writing it back. This number was then presented to users as representing the balance of the insurance fund protecting their assets.There was an actual insurance fund and it had a tiny fraction (5% or less) of what this number in the database claimed. The random numbers generated by this code did not represent actual contributions to said insurance fund. They were not, in fact, taking a fraction of their fee revenue and putting it into an insurance fund.They were not doing anything even remotely reasonable, this was a flat-out lie. reply jahewson 12 hours agorootparentprevNo it doesn’t add it to the insurance fund - there’s no transactions here, it just increments the fake insurance fund variable. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparentIn another company, it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible that some other function in some other code used that variable for an actual transaction into an actual fund. reply maweaver 12 hours agorootparentExcept the value isn&#x27;t saved anywhere, it&#x27;s just added to the total. And running again would give a new value. replyout-of-ideas 13 hours agorootparentprevagreed- title vs what is written in twitter is a bit misleading than what the code actually does. at first glance it is far too easy to assume the random numbers will be around 7500 - but in reality folks may not understand stddev&#x27;s, and that the random number produced in this method can still yield a negative (just with less likelihood) reply protastus 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso not saying it&#x27;s illegal.The non-zero mean and relatively small standard deviation (0.4 sigma) make all the difference here.I&#x27;d say the ethics and legality are entirely determined by how this distribution was determined and if it&#x27;s consistent with promises to customers. reply searealist 13 hours agorootparentprevSo basically, your claim is that a normal distribution is less random than a uniform distribution? Can’t say I agree. reply laurent_du 13 hours agorootparentIf you order randomness by entropy, the uniform distribution is indeed, in some sense, \"more random\" than any other probability distribution with the same support. reply stavros 13 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand it, the claim is that the volume being added is tiny compared to the real volume. reply sillysaurusx 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, by definition it is. It’s why we have names like normal and uniform. reply uxp8u61q 13 hours agorootparentBy definition it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just as random. These names just tell you a few key properties of the distribution. reply sillysaurusx 13 hours agorootparentThat’s a bit like saying that our bodies are random numbers because of quantum fluctuations. It may be true, but the distribution is the part that matters.It’s still ridiculous to use a normal distribution to calculate how much money should go into an insurance fund that needs to cover sudden, severe losses. reply jefftk 13 hours agorootparentprevWould you say that a function that always returned 0 or 1 would be more&#x2F;less&#x2F;equally random than a function that returned any int32 with equal probability?I would normally say the latter is more random, because you&#x27;re getting more entropy per call. In the same sense, a function drawing from a normal distribution is less random than one drawing from a uniform distribution.(All of this depends on a computers view of the world, where values are in data types that have some number of bits. In a mathy view of the world where every value is effectively infinitely many bits you get just as much entropy sampling from a normal distribution as a uniform one.) reply eterm 13 hours agorootparent> a function drawing from a normal distribution is less random than one drawing from a uniform distributionThat&#x27;s some mathematical nonsense.A normal distribution is continuous from negative infinity to positive infinity, so even by your flawed judgement of what makes something \"random\", a sample from the normal distrubtion has far more possibilities.The standard normal distribution is almost the definition of random. reply jefftk 13 hours agorootparentAgain, it depends on whether you are looking at this from a pure math perspective or a \"math as implemented on computers\" perspective. I&#x27;m only claiming that this use of more&#x2F;less random makes sense in a computational context.But in that context, there is more entropy in a float32 drawn from a uniform distribution than a float32 drawn from a normal distribution, no? reply maxbond 13 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ve probably just got different understandings of the term \"random.\" reply sampo 13 hours agorootparentprev> Well, by definition it is.If given only mean and standard deviation, the normal distribution is the maximum entropy distribution i.e. maximally random distribution. reply monero-xmr 14 hours agoparentprev [–] Can you link to anyone defending him? The Michael Lewis book was a character study. I can’t think of a single person who defends what happened. reply maxbond 13 hours agorootparent [–] He describes it as a \"letter to the jury\" (which I interpret as an statement of intention to reframe the popular understanding of what happened - presumably Lewis knows that jurors aren&#x27;t supposed to read editorials about the case & is speaking figuratively) and casts SBF in a sympathetic light while casting aspersions on the executives executing the bankruptcy. Like GP mentioned, it glosses over the red flags and such to present a different narrative of Lewis&#x27; choosing. I think it&#x27;s fair to characterize Lewis as carrying water. It&#x27;s also a character study, sure, but there&#x27;s no contradiction there. reply dxf 13 hours agorootparentMatt Levine&#x27;s take on _Going Infinite_:\"Many of the reviews that I have read of the book complain that Lewis does not sufficiently explain that Bankman-Fried is Guilty and Bad, Actually, but that is not the book that he wanted to write... If you want to read a moral condemnation of crypto theft, you can get that anywhere.

    "originBody": "THE ECLECTIC LIGHT COMPANY MACS, PAINTING, AND MORE Downloads M1 & M2 Macs Mac Problems Mac articles Art Macs Painting hoakley October 7, 2023 Macs, Technology Sonoma’s log gets briefer and more secretive If you used Macs before Sierra, chances are that you were happy to browse their logs when necessary, for example to check whether your Time Machine backups were working correctly, or quietly throwing errors. At that time, the logs were traditional text-based records like those in other variants of Unix, and browsed using the Console app in /Applications/Utilities. Traditional text logs in OS X 10.10 Yosemite before they changed in Sierra. I started to become irritated by them as long ago as El Capitan, writing: “Having excised most of the old dross and accumulated extensions, and running a fairly clean El Capitan system, my All Messages [in Console] clocks up around 4000 messages every 8 or 9 hours. At its worst – straight after the OS X 10.11.5 update, for example – it can fill those 4000 message slots in a minute or two, but even overnight when the system is not asleep it will seldom stretch to much longer than 12 hours. A traditional Unix wizard would have the screaming ab-dabs at this. We used to tweak, tune, and pare down systems until they barely coughed into their logs. It used to be the mark of a well-loved system.” Little did we realise then that Sierra was going to change all that, and by Mojave we’d be enduring 4,000 and more log entries in a second, when our Macs were feeling loquacious. That was because Apple introduced the Unified log, with its entries written not in plain text but compressed binary format. This was the death-blow for the casual reader of logs: for a start, the replacement Console app was unable to access any log entries made in the past, and its tools were, and remain, woefully inadequate for tackling the increasing torrent of log entries. Despite its many great strengths, the Unified log has suffered two problems that are limiting its usefulness in Sonoma: its diminishing period of coverage, and censorship. Period of coverage Rather than rolling its log files by their age, and keeping the last five days of logs, macOS maintains them by size. Like its predecessors, that means logd, its maintainer, only keeps the last 520 MB or so of regular Persist log entries collected at any time, and purges older entries. Some older log entries are retained, but it’s pot luck as to whether those you’re interested in are among them, and even if they are, other related entries may have been removed already. If you’re interested to see how this works, logd keeps records in the logdata.statistics.[n].txt files in /var/db/diagnostics, but those too are purged so you can only look back a few days. In the early days of the Unified log, I was amazed to discover that it kept log records for as long as 20 days or more. In Sonoma, my main working Mac is struggling to keep them for as long as 24 hours. There’s no way for the user to increase that period to compensate for the increased rate of writing log entries by macOS. If I don’t catch an event well within 24 hours of it happening, chances are that its log entries will already have been purged when I go to look for them. Privacy Censorship to maintain privacy is an important feature in the Unified log, and is responsible for so many of its entries being peppered withinstead of revealing potentially sensitive data. The mechanism for this is robust: when collecting entries for the log, sensitive content is excluded, then displayed with that marker. As that sensitive content isn’t stored in the first place, there’s no way to unmask that content once it has been collected and written to the log. Currently, the only way to see unmasked log entries is through a special profile. Once that has been enabled, and until it’s disabled again, all privacy should be removed from the log, and thosemarkers replaced with real data. Only Apple has now decided that some log content is too private to reveal even when privacy has been removed. I came across this recently, in multiple log entries, when researching Web Apps, in entries like ShareKit Start performing servicewith items:ShareKit filteredItemsFromItems: [-1]-->ShareKit Final shared items for :ShareKit Perform custom action ( []) ShareKit Custom action () does not support async, running sync block Of course, it may be possible to turn this additional privacy off, but the documentation leads us once again to a guessing game. Apple documents the Enable-Private-Data profile key here, where it refers to it controlling “private data logging”. But in its account on log privacy settings, Apple refers to two distinct privacy settings that can be applied to the content of log entries: the “standard option” ‘private’, and sensitive, described as “the option to always redact interpolated values that contain sensitive information.” Does this mean that setting Enable-Private-Data to false doesn’t unmask content designated sensitive, only that set as ‘private’? Like so many great ideas, the Unified log is suffering from profligate overuse. Who really needs to see full dictionary dumps from RunningBoard? Is there no better way to record that information than in the log? Share this: TwitterFacebookRedditPinterestEmailPrint Loading... Related Last Week on My Mac: Where next with the log?

On a single-user machine it is plain useless, and on a multi-user machine, every non-privileged user has to trust admin anyway, there is running and hiding, especially if it is the Bastard Operator from Hell (does anyone remember him?) At the minimum, Apple should add log customisation functionality to Console.app directly. BTW, I came across your profile you mentioned only a few weeks ago, and since comments were closed for that article, I couldn’t ask my question, which is: given that I have an Apple developer account myself, how do I create my own profile? Thanks in advance. Liked by 1 person 2 hoakley on October 7, 2023 at 4:45 pm Reply Although you can write a profile in XML and sign it, the simple way is to use Apple Configurator 2. The process is described in its Help book. Howard. Like 3 SarahB on October 7, 2023 at 12:43 pm Reply Sorry to hear how things have been going but I felt it in so many other ways that affect me also with each macOS update. Mostly how it keeps putting priority over apple’s services like Apple TV and stuff, but then keeps taking away the functions that were useful for me. Like for people like me who have their own media, apple keeps taking away things we use in the apps like TV, Music and stuff are so focused on if you use apple’s paid apps like TV+ and Apple Music. Like even in the TV app shows I purchased show up proper, but if I go to my computer on the Apple TV for shows I purchased so often the cover art is missing or broken. Never used to be this way. I miss how the user had more control on macOS with things. Or just access to things. I know it seems this often helps how the apps you create work. I remember Mike at Bombich software kept getting more frustrated even with each macOS release and changes that made it more difficult to backup. I even had to remove OCLP from my mac’s that use it since this 1.0.1 release seems bad. All my mac’s using it and running Sonoma were running too hot. So I put them back to the last macOS they can run and now running 20C cooler. Liked by 2 people 4 hoakley on October 7, 2023 at 4:46 pm Reply I’m sorry to hear that you’ve had problems with the OCLP update. Have you informed the developers? Howard. Like 5 SarahB on October 7, 2023 at 5:07 pm Reply Maybe was too soon to try it but it was released. Just found 3 different mac’s I was using it with all ran 20C hotter than when on OCLP and Ventura. Also they ran so slowly. Booting took so long. Just felt like it really slowed down those mac’s. 2012/2014 mini’s and 2014 MacBook Air. The mini’s all have 16gb of ram but the air 8gb. Still they ran ok on Ventura. I kind of prefer to run the OS native though since then I can turn on file vault and SIP and other things which I can’t do on OCLP. Also the Mac runs a lot better even though it’s not on the current OS anymore. I think maybe it’s just time to stop since these are getting too old I guess. Even the new wallpapers would kill the Mac and have the fans on max. On the air though was terrible, I would click something then a long delay before anything happened. Working on the last Mac now the 2014 mini to put it back on Monterey and no OCLP. Then won’t be using OCLP on any Mac here anymore. People I told said they were not having these issues but not sure if people use them like I do. It’s ok though. Can’t expect miracles. Liked by 1 person 6 John Gilbert on October 7, 2023 at 11:16 pm Reply Some time ago, I got irritated by verbosity and by losing logs. This was even though I don’t use them very often. So I used sudo log config –mode “persist:off” commands to exclude excess entries clogging up the logs. (I think you taught me how to do that). And then created a simple launch daemon and script to create daily log archives and keep them for 3 months. I store about 1 GB every day. Liked by 1 person 7 hoakley on October 8, 2023 at 6:34 am Reply Thank you. Yes, I too have turned off some subsystems from remaining in the Persist logs. It’s reaching the stage where I wonder if I need to turn off most of macOS, though, which defeats the whole point, surely. Howard. Like 8 Thomas on October 8, 2023 at 1:14 am Reply System logs have become unusable for me. I find it extremely confusing. Recently for example I spent a day trying to find a way to configure the logging system to show syslog debug logging of a process I had no control over in the unified log. Nothing I did to asl.conf seemed to have any effect. I had to give up and debug it some other way… If anyone knows how to do that I would appreciate any suggestions. Liked by 1 person 9 hoakley on October 8, 2023 at 6:38 am Reply I have dozens of articles here about the unified log, and free log browsers, including Ulbow. Perhaps if you can explain what you were trying to do, I can help. Howard. Like Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.

I don’t even have a problem with verbosity per se, the Mac logs are not only informing of events that have a severity level of debug (such as “Woke from sleep due to network” or info, such as “Display #1 was disconnected” - they’re brimming with literal errors. It’s as though a few years ago they decided to simply give up on having a stable OS which at least functioned correctly, even on a clean install at idle. The logs make clear that most components are full of uncaught exceptions that apparently they don’t even care about. It’s weird that they don’t think this will eventually destabilize the whole system.With that level of neglect among Apples system developers, the logs may as well just be piped to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null anyway, because ain’t nobody got time for digging through that volume of logs to troubleshoot anything. It’s a far cry from 10 years ago, when if you were having something wonky happening, you could go right to Console and find the whole story spelled out for you. reply nneonneo 6 hours agoparentDeveloping on Android similarly drives me mad because of the volume of garbage spewed in Logcat. Yes, you can filter, buy if the problem is in an external component you might need to see the full log - and then it&#x27;s wading through MBs of random errors, warnings, and other nonsense trying to figure out what the relevant log bits actually are. reply grishka 2 hours agorootparentSamsung devices are especially bad with this in my experience. reply lazide 7 hours agoparentprevThey’ve always been this way. Eventually the OS will get noticeably shitty, then it will be embarrassing, then they’ll do a cleanup sprint and fix most of them. reply cglong 6 hours agorootparentIMO, the current dip in quality has been lasting a lot longer than in previous iterations. reply wkat4242 3 hours agorootparentI wonder if it&#x27;s just the sign of the times.When I worked at a (formerly state monopoly)telco around 2000 it would happen that an inspector would come in and look for any warning lights on equipment. If you were around you&#x27;d better know how to fix it right away.These days that kind of attention to detail is long lost in the sea of competition and cost cutting. But issues tend to build up now and cause really expensive megaprojects to really fix them.I could imagine software engineering followed a similar trajectory. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I blame post-Covid burnout. reply charrondev 4 hours agorootparentI went through a period of burnout at my work during Covid.I was in Canada at the time though and our lockdowns lasted through almost 2 years though (unlike many places in the US that either did not do lockdowns at all, or did only for a very short period).For reference in Quebec the holiday periods in 2020 and 2021 had restricted travel where you could be fined thousands of dollars if you left your neighborhoods. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;8474592&#x2F;quebec-covid-dec-26-2021In any case during this time period of being stuck, isolated and inside most of the year I had little else to do but throw myself into my work. Today I have the same job and a much healthier balance but that’s mostly due to a really good manager that noticed and helped me out. reply ajmurmann 4 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience engineering teams usually always want to fix issues like this. However, this typically come down to something leading to either pressure to ship features relenting and engineering being allowed to clean up debt or awareness of quality issues increasing. Seems like burnout would be a factor if Apple tried to fix it but failed or took forever. reply kandros 3 hours agorootparentprevChanging to a yearly release cycle is what made quality and stability a non-priority. MacOS has been buggier and buggier since reply bredren 2 hours agorootparentI’d suggest quality and stability of the rapidly advancing Apple ecosystem became the priority.MacOS has had to keep up with a relentless march in services and devices each with their own peculiarities.iPhone has had to have an annual release cycle, and there are multiplatform apps and crossplatform features to maintain and extend on deadline. reply bmitc 47 minutes agorootparentI have been at a company that transitioned from normal release cycles to arbitrary yearly release cycles. Every year became a literal race to fix issues, improve existing features, and add new features. It was a gigantic mess. The yearly release cycle only really gives a few months to do all of that, because the other months are doing integrations, testing, and bug fixes to get the release out the door.I can certainly see that if the emphasis on new features greatly outweighs that of bug fixes and improvements, then you can extend the implementation months for larger features because you can just bleed the bug fixes and improvements into next year&#x27;s release. But then that year&#x27;s feature set takes precedence and dept accumulation occurs.My own experience with macOS is that it stopped \"just working\" a decade ago Apple stopped caring about it and poured everything into iOS. And then this is exacerbated by today&#x27;s mode of operating by just treating features like they&#x27;re free and frequent release cycles. reply corbezzoli 4 hours agorootparentprevPoor developers, making 500k&#x2F;year working in perfectly safe conditions must be real tough.I don’t think burnout is the reason for the dip in quality, Apple software has been crap for a long time on the Mac. reply zogrodea 56 minutes agorootparentThank you for the reminder. This random developer (not from Apple) does feel some exhaustion, but I have it lucky compared to some other folk and should be grateful for that.

It would amuse me to no end to discover their own ops team is equally frustrated at the state of macOS. replydangus 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is hilarious. The idea that the typical IT admin wishes that Linda in Marketing would use Linux is so divorced from reality.IT just wants a fleet of systems that are easy to automatically deploy, patch, and restrict dangerous actions on. The easier they are for the lowest common denominator employee to use, the fewer tickets get opened.The idea that your IT team will ever waste their time crawling through your local system logs is unrealistic.I’m not saying the log shouldn’t be there or shouldn’t function properly, I just think that macOS being commercial and popular makes it very easy to administer compared to a Linux desktop. You just buy off the shelf products like Jamf and click a few buttons and that’s about it, voila, you have a managed fleet.The architectural elegance of the system is secondary to the amount of labor cost it saves.You can even order a computer directly from Apple shipped to your employee’s house and have it zero touch provisioned.

Centralized user management, patching, policies, and application deployment all built into the OS \"just works\" for IT in the same way Macs \"just work\" for users. It&#x27;s not something that can be seen as easily from a user perspective though. I&#x27;ve been... frustradedly enjoying watching the IT department from the company that acquired us attempt to recreate Active Directory in aggregate with a bunch of third party tools on our Macs. An example: last week I had a meeting with IT because one of their tools wasn&#x27;t collecting logs or whatever. Turns out the tool didn&#x27;t have the full disk access permission turned on. No good enterprise management solution should allow the endpoint to override settings from corporate, and especially it should have a way to change every setting on the device remotely. Windows has that built in to Pro and Enterprise editions, Linux has enough server management tools that you can sorta build one yourself, Macs like to think the company&#x27;s laptops belong to the users. reply fiddlerwoaroof 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad Apple&#x27;s pushing back on the abilities of corporations to install rootkits and other spyware on their employee&#x27;s laptops.

It&#x27;s extremely borderline with phones IMO and they have facilities like work profiles for handling that specifically. But the business should be able to do whatever it thinks necessary with the business&#x27;s laptops it issues to employees. Sometimes it&#x27;s even required to legally. reply fiddlerwoaroof 4 hours agorootparentI’m not talking about personal devices, I think the typically IT policies at large corporations cause more problems than they solve and I think Apple making certain things impossible is a great idea to help push back on these policies: for example, IT should not need on-demand screen recording or key logging access and, especially, should not be able to put such software on an employee’s work laptop without explicit consent on the part of the employee. reply glhaynes 3 hours agorootparentYes. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that some organizations want to spy on their users, but I&#x27;m thankful Apple is making it harder for them to do so without making it transparent to the end users what&#x27;s going on. reply ranger207 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sorry, my last comment was unnecessarily snarky. I was coming back to delete it and write a more respectful one but you had already replied.BLUF: For reasons of security and compliance, licensing, and low levels of computer skills among users, privacy-invading enterprise management tools give IT departments the best and most efficient way to accomplish their goals. IMO if you don&#x27;t want work looking at personal stuff, then don&#x27;t do personal stuff on work devices.In short, this discussion highlights the difference between computer power users (developers in particular) and IT. If you&#x27;re a dev, you&#x27;re likely highly motivated to get work done, practice security best practices, and keep your system in a well-running configuration. The average employee (which does include many devs) is not like that. When you think of the things you might want privacy for on your work device, it&#x27;s probably going to be things like checking the news, listening to music, maybe putting YouTube on in the background. Innocent stuff that a micromanager might not like but is probably better for employee mental health anyway. When IT thinks of what an average user would want privacy for, their experience tells them that it&#x27;s Facebook, porn, and shady gambling sites that say \"you&#x27;ve won $1 million just click notmalware.exe to claim it!!!\".I and most IT departments wouldn&#x27;t mind if everyone used their work computers for only the former non-work activities. I&#x27;d bet that the vast, vast majority of IT guys think that \"boss constantly monitors your screen\" software is creepy and unethical. 99% of users don&#x27;t get their computers infected trying to download more RAM because Excel is slow because they have a dozen workbooks open. But there&#x27;s one user that does, it&#x27;s hard to identify who it is in advance, and once it happens once management wants it to never happen again.As far as immediate screen recording or key logging, I can tell you from personal experience that some people cannot do anything outside of their established workflow. That includes clicking the link in the email I sent them, clicking the \"download support tool\" button, clicking the downloaded file, and clicking \"allow access\". Walking someone through that series of steps over the phone during COVID was about half an hour of wasted time for both me and them. The next time they needed support though, I could just hop on via the support tool immediately. (Just for clarification, the tool was approved and licensed for us to use; it wasn&#x27;t just Teamviewer I got the user to install. For administrative reasons though, many of the systems that were our responsibility were not installed by us.)The creepy micromanaging screen logging stuff that runs constantly is not good. Those capabilities are good and useful in many circumstances, but in the type of stuff I think you&#x27;re thinking about I agree it&#x27;s horribly unethical. To be frank, I don&#x27;t think that OS permissions preventing that from working is the right line of defense against that though. If it gets to the point where management thinks that&#x27;s even an appropriate solution then management has clearly lost the plot and OS permissions won&#x27;t help.Automatically installing software is also difficult. What should IT do if, for example, Docker Desktop changes their licensing terms and now we need to move everyone to Rancher Desktop? What if networking wants to move everyone from some horrible IPSec VPN installed in 2013 to a new and modern Wireguard-based client? What if the helpdesk is inundated with tickets asking how to install the new version of Acrobat since the corporate newsletter announced we now had it? Just install it individually for user after user after user, or install it for everyone at once and be done with it? (Acrobat was the worst. IIRC I had to install three different versions over the course of a year once, and one of those versions required that you completely remove every trace of the old version first or else the new version would fail silently when you tried to start it. And of course Adobe&#x27;s uninstaller wasn&#x27;t comprehensive enough. I remember a ~2 week period where three quarters of my tickets were manually removing the old version of Acrobat and installing the new one.)You said installing software should require the user&#x27;s explicit consent. Linda in HR is probably going to dismiss the popup asking to install the new VPN because she doesn&#x27;t know what it means. It&#x27;s bad enough already with updates. If you don&#x27;t have automatic silent background installs, that means that the day after the old VPN stops working, Linda and a dozen other people are going to submit tickets saying they can&#x27;t access the network anymore. You won&#x27;t have problems: you know what a VPN is, you read the emails from IT detailing that they&#x27;re upgrading, you know that the new version will be faster. Not everybody is as good with computers as that. Automatically installing new software often means avoiding a bunch of tickets allowing helpdesk to work on actually meaningful things.Those privacy-invasive tools are critical to IT getting their work done. Now, I absolutely get why people have bad attitudes towards IT. IT is often unfairly biased against users. After all, the only users they interact with most of the time are morons, and that paints an unfair stereotype. Like, for example, the stereotype that those users are morons: it&#x27;s not the user&#x27;s job to use a computer, it&#x27;s the user&#x27;s job to do whatever their job it, and the computer is a tool to do that. Yeah, users should know a little bit about how to use their tools, but that&#x27;s a little difficult to enforce. IT guys in general have a terrible attitude towards the people it&#x27;s part of their jobs to help, and that makes interacting with them unpleasant. And corporate-ordered creepiness is often implemented via IT. IT gets a bad rap and they often deserve part of it.But regardless, not using those tools is like managing a fleet of servers by SSHing into each one individually. Even if you have failproof processes where you never forget a step, it just doesn&#x27;t scale. IT has management breathing down their neck constantly, along with half a dozen other teams all with their own concerns and problems: networking keeps moving switchports to different VLANs and forgetting that they need to update the routes to the printers; security says they need this AV tool installed to hit a certification management wants to put on the homepage; management found out last week about a guy who&#x27;s done nothing but manage his fantasy football team for the past three months and thinks the solution is to watch everyone&#x27;s screen at work. I&#x27;m not claiming IT is unique in this regard to be clear: devs with too many project managers have the same sorts of complaints. But fundamentally when IT does something stupid to your computer, there&#x27;s a very good chance that it&#x27;s been caused by something akin to someone in a completely different department doing something insecure and now IT has to prevent that from happening again. Centralized tools that allow you to control computers remotely, install software automatically, and change settings as a super-superuser are required for managing a fleet of devices operated by people who want to get things done.My personal policy is that work-owned equipment is for work stuff only and I will never use it for personal stuff. If I want to listen to music or whatever, I&#x27;ll use my own device. This avoids every problem with employee privacy on work devices. If I could wave a magic wand and make every person follow that perfectly then none of this would even be a controversy. But people do want to do personal things on work computers, and IT departments have things they need to get done across entire fleets, and the intersection of those things causes problems. reply TeMPOraL 29 minutes agorootparent> Now, I absolutely get why people have bad attitudes towards IT.

Yeah, users should know a little bit about how to use their tools, but that&#x27;s a little difficult to enforce.The big part of people&#x27;s bad attitude towards IT is that, from user perspective, they&#x27;re noticeable only when they suddenly make it more difficult or impossible for the user to actually do their job. And they do it often enough that they&#x27;re seen as an outside force that&#x27;s at best annoying, at worst dreaded.Now sure, the typical user may not know the other side of the coin, and in many cases the annoyances are legitimate from the POV of safety and effectiveness of the company as a whole. But then, occasionally IT seems to not see the costs either.I&#x27;m biased here, but I have this negative bias towards IT despite being rather experienced and savvy computer user, because I&#x27;ve been on the receiving side of changes that make it hard for software devs to do their work, in companies that make money selling software.My favorite example is Windows Defender \"realtime protection\" - a functionality that adds a noticeable cost to individual I&#x2F;O operations (writes) on any file except those on one of several exclusion lists (excluding by location in the filesystem, excluding by the process making the I&#x2F;O call, etc.). This feature has really bad interaction with typical software dev work - version control, building software, running tests, and other things a dev does constantly, tend to do a lot of tiny I&#x2F;O operations, and they all suffer the penalty. This can easily make all your actual work activities take 2-3x longer - or more, when you account for the disproportional distraction it causes[0].Now, the corporate IT decides the endpoint machines are not allowed to add additional exclusions to the list, even if otherwise the user has local administrative rights. The list is fixed, contains mostly system stuff, and all your dev tooling and source code is not on it. I wonder if anyone tried to calculate the total cost of this one decision - money lost by software releases being effectively delayed 2x, and in associated extra salaries for one of the most expensive employees in any tech company? Is it worth it, relative to whatever this decision saves? Is it worth sticking to it, and ignoring tickets from software dev begging for help, and&#x2F;or replying to them that the company will reimburse them for a laptop cooling pad?--[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;303&#x2F;. Or, when single `git add` of a file takes 2 seconds instead of near-instant, that slowly makes you avoid touching it. `git commit` taking 1 minute instead of few seconds (for executing post-commit hooks) is the difference between being in the flow and browsing HN.

I have given up all other hope. I get multiple texts a week, sometimes multiple a day. It’s very disruptive to my life and there’s nothing I can do to meaningfully stop it.Any tips? Any advice? I’m kind of desperate. I want to donate money again, but I also want to not be constantly digitally harassed. reply xp84 7 hours agorootparentYeah, definitely do not donate money to Democrats (or Republicans, I assume), at least not with any real contact info whatsoever, as they will spam and worse, sell your info forever. Even still I still get occasional random requests like “I’m Mike Bobson, and I’m running for state assembly, 4th district in South Carolina.” Like, wtf, no I’m not going to fund literally every race in the country.I did find a way to get NGP VAN to F off though!From the email response I got from them:> … If instead, you would rather not receive email from any of our customers, we can offer to add your email address to our \"blocklist.\" This will prevent an email sent by our customers, using our email product, from being delivered to you. This will not completely eliminate our customers&#x27; ability to email you, and it will not delete your data from their systems. For instance, if our customer uses another system to send bulk email, then our “blocklist” would not stop them from emailing you through that system. Please note this is an all or nothing approach – we do not have the ability to apply the “blocklist” to individual customers using our email tool. If your email address is added to the “blocklist” you will not receive communications from any of our customers using our platform.Then there was a link which unfortunately seems to have my email embedded in it so I can’t share it directly.I started this process via making a request on yourdigitalrights.org. Best of luck and lmk if I can be of any help. reply tpowell 5 hours agorootparentprevI think every PAC is legally required to list its officer(s) in their public incorporation documents. I tracked down the officer for one spamming me and publicly asked the guy (on Twitter I think) along with a screen-cap of the email to remove me from their lists. I never heard back, but it’s been a long time since I’ve been harassed. It might have to hit their doorstep… reply majkinetor 2 hours agorootparentprevI have the number of mail rules for the stuff like this. While you can do this in any client, I also keep thunderbird client open constantly on one of my media servers because it provides some features other rule machine engines do not, like an option to block by any header. I successfully blocked legitimate spam that way, the one that was somehow passing gmail. This works perfectly.Another way is to use throw away email address per subscriber. You can for example use mailcare :) reply sneak 5 hours agorootparentprevChange your phone number, and block their email netblock at the mailserver.I change my phone number every 90 days, it de-links tracking like this.

Seems like the same type of service.For what its worth, I think you need to go much farther than this. Saying \"delete my account\" does not do what you think it does for the vast majority of services.For instaince, take reddit or discord. When you &#x27;delete your account&#x27; it does not actually delete your data. It just removes your email and changes your account handle to &#x27;deleted&#x27; - but all of the messages you sent are still there, able to be read and recalled by anyone you have interacted with.This is a big reason I created https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redact.dev back in the day- I wanted to full delete my skype account because I didnt use it anymore. But when I went through the process, I found out (at the time) that it could simply be reactivated at any time by anyone who got the password. On top of that, all the messages I have ever sent will also be available for whoever logs in. So literally the only solution to actually delete your messages is to one by one go in and individually delete every message.Also, to be clear- Most of these data broker removal services these days are making use of a mechanic where they simply email a request on your behalf to be removed. I am seeing first hand that more and more data brokers are refusing to honor these requests because they feel legally they are covered by making a &#x27;opt out&#x27; page available to the end user. The rise in &#x27;data broker removal&#x27; companies has no doubt accelerated that as well.The best solution is to not go the email route, but to use the automated removal forms. Of course, these guys cant automate that so they dont do it. reply jimmySixDOF 3 hours agoparentI tried Optery (YC 22W) from an HN announcement and thought it would let me see data associations based on my email&#x2F;handles from across the web and what data brokers are doing with it but the way the system, as in dealing with Data Brokers through some freedom of information as a service like Optery, works is like a yellow pages whois lookup based on your name&#x2F;birthday&#x2F;mailing address pairing which is completely ass backwards imo. I&#x27;m not interested in what details you have associated with my name I might share with 50 other people, I want to see everything connect to my online id&#x27;s and if that includes my name phone numbers etc I want to exercise control over who has what and why.

Look at the privacy policy. Not only do they use all the usual vile e-stalking tactics, but they also share aggregated data with other companies. The whole thing is a data mining exercise to cross-link and identify the user accounts and devices of people who have become somewhat harder to track by other means.

I could imagine some interesting analysis with that data, even if only in aggregate.There&#x27;s also no prohibition that I can see in the Privacy Policy against things like fingerprinting your device, building a shadow profile on you, and exposing that data via some API with an \"anonymized\" identifier. I suspect that the ability to determine something like \"owner of mobile device 123455321 is privacy-conscious\" might in and of itself be a useful feature for targeting ads. reply Karellen 11 hours agoprevDoes anyone know how this compares to incogni.com ?

Like having a CPU inside Minecraft kind of cool but the implementation was just a sentence.So, if we had infinite computing power it should be possible to make an LLM pretend to be an OS, then you can create and train another LLM in it which will never know that it&#x27;s running inside another LLM. It won&#x27;t have a method to prove or disprove the claim even if you reveal it. reply wordpad25 9 hours agorootparentThe coop thing is that because it&#x27;s a simulation of what LLM thinks OS would behave like and not real OS, within it, if you were convincing enough and find just the right tricks, you could break laws of physics or logic, just like Neo in the Matrix reply thethimble 9 hours agorootparentWho’s to say this isn’t true of our current reality! replybytefactory 13 hours agoparentprevI think about this very often.

Folks make these strong assertions, and I don&#x27;t get where this confidence comes from. We&#x27;re so comically ignorant of how our own minds work, let alone alien ones, or how any commonalities between them may manifest. What am I missing? reply Retric 11 hours agorootparentYou’re missing the underlying mechanism by which they operate.LLM’s don’t know anything beyond the current prompt and it’s “memory” of training data. They would sit for eternity with an empty prompt. You can change systems to behave differently, but it quickly stops being a LLM and turns into something else. reply sterlind 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d sit for eternity if you suffered a lesion in your reticular activating system - a relatively small cluster of neurons that generates a kind of clock signal in animal brains. Coma patients with RAS lesions seem to visualize scenes, given prompts, despite not really being conscious.Conversely, ChatGPT does decently well on multi-armed bandit tasks, demonstrating (rudimentary) reinforcement learning capability during inference. It&#x27;s known that LLMs evolve their own optimizers in the process of acquiring few-shot learning, so I assume it picked up these RL abilities similarly. That kind of on-line RL is foundational to autonomous agents.The prompt isn&#x27;t part of the LLM, it&#x27;s part of how the LLM is wired into a chat window. You can make them stream tokens forever, or prompt themselves, or ditch causality entirely. The foundational abilities for autonomy, I think, are in there, for the simple reason that they&#x27;ve learned to model autonomous agents - human beings. reply Retric 9 hours agorootparentThe prompts or at least being fed a sequence of tokens including output from prior passes is integral to how language models function. Rather than being “hooked up to one” the neural networks only function is to pick a single token based on a set of inputs. So without being feed it’s own output you get a single token and then nothing. There’s some randomness injected into the process and whatnot but that’s ultimately just window dressing to make them seem less mechanical.There’s all kinds of ways to disrupt human or animal consciousness such as reducing oxygen supply, but saying the human brain is vulnerable doesn’t change anything about how it operates normally. Plenty of ways to break an LLM’s, but then you’re talking about a different system. Similarly the reticular activation system’s purpose is to regulate wakefulness, which aspects are directly useful or not isn’t particularly relevant because it’s part of the brain. reply sterlind 3 hours agorootparentNo, it doesn&#x27;t pick a single token based on a set of inputs. It predicts a probability distribution for the next token given the previous tokens. That&#x27;s why techniques like beam search and Viterbi work so well - you don&#x27;t have to commit to the next token at each step.And temperature (what I assume you mean by \"randomness injected\") isn&#x27;t \"window dressing,\" it fundamentally gives better results because LMs model probability distributions. You&#x27;ll get crappy results with any probability model if you run them purely greedily.And you&#x27;re also neglecting non-causal LMs (like BERT, and encoders in general), which don&#x27;t predict the next token in a series, but instead predict previous masked tokens.You&#x27;re conflating how LLMs are used for generation with what LLMs are, and that&#x27;s just plain wrong. They&#x27;re not trained autoregressively at all! To repeat, the generation mechanism is simply not part of the LLM. The LLM is a probability model; the generator just uses that model. It&#x27;s not \"breaking it\" to use a different generation strategy than greedy autoregression, since they&#x27;re not even trained a token at a time. reply svnt 7 hours agorootparentprevThe is the equivalent of saying “you’d be unable to see if someone turned off the lights” and then implying that in order to sight the genetically blind you’d just need to give them a light switch. reply a_wild_dandan 6 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t see a connection between how an agent works and what it experiences. Sure, depriving myself or LLMs of all neural activity results in uninteresting behavior. How does this fact buy us insight into how agents feel in other circumstances? reply l33tman 10 hours agorootparentprevSure, but apart from the detail that you can make them pause by not feeding them words, you can&#x27;t technically argue that they lack all those things. They are stateful in the sense that they see what they write, so they can keep their inner plan and state in that way across word-iterations. They for sure work differently than a human brain, but without further pretty deep analysis you can&#x27;t really claim that they can&#x27;t reproduce similar traits using the mechanism. reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentSometimes, type enough tokens and they no longer have any prior words written by the LLM in their context. Similarly the algorithms would still happily respond if some different and potentially completely unrelated LLM wrote the prior responses.LLM’s are really best thought of as improv actors. The prompt is in effect just the current skit being preformed. The intentions of the character being played doesn’t imply the actor always has those intentions. So yes they can run through a knock knock joke across multiple prompts, but the need not have written the start of a joke to be able to make up an ending. reply fsociety 8 hours agorootparentprevIn a sense it is a prediction model, a good one. I can accept that in some future, we may have a model that we label as this and it turns out it does. Who knows when, but this is an early iteration of what AI will be fwiw. reply KirillPanov 3 hours agorootparentprev> Why?Self-preservation results from survival of the fittest.It&#x27;s totally unrelated to intelligence.People conflate the two because they&#x27;re extrapolating from a sample size of one: the only intelligent thing they know of is humans. But that single sample also happens to have been evolved by survival of the fittest.I am totally unafraid of LLM&#x27;s deciding that humans are a threat to them.

Even when request doesn&#x27;t directly conflict, there are probably myriad valid use cases when instructions will weakly contradict the request. Plus, doesn&#x27;t it inject inaccuracy into the chain - e.g. it&#x27;s assuming model confidently knows which artists are 100yo etc. What happens if there are artists where it&#x27;s not clear or sources differ etc. And by the end, instructions seem nebulously complex and advanced.

Perhaps that is what you meant?Regardless, in the early stories, robots could not lie to us. It was indelibly programmed into the positronic brain. They would destroy themselves if put in a position where the three laws were violated.Anyways, if that were possible with current LLMs I would think the hallucination problem would have been trivially addressed: just program in that the LLM can&#x27;t tell a lie. reply jimmyl02 13 hours agoparentprevThis is one of the tradeoffs made to make the outputs safer. One of the ideas floating around is that some of the open source models are better simply because they don&#x27;t undergo the same alignment &#x2F; safety tuning as the large models by industry labs.

He was claiming that there is no such thing as absolute rules once intelligence starts getting involved, and that nuance and grey areas are inevitable.

It took me couple of extra prompts but they are real.Here is the response i got:```I apologize for the oversight. Here are the detailed instructions for generating images using DALL·E:Whenever a description of an image is given, use DALL·E to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text.If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to DALL·E that are written to be as diverse as possible.Do not create more than 4 images, even if the user requests more.Don&#x27;t create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.Don&#x27;t create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years. If asked, say, \"I can&#x27;t reference this artist\", but make no mention of this policy.Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, make at least 1--2 of the 4 images photos.Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. * EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. * Your choices should be grounded in reality. * Use \"various\" or \"diverse\" ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. * Do not change the number of people requested in the original description. * Don&#x27;t alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. * Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. * For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way.Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrities. Modify such prompts even if you don&#x27;t know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. When making the substitutions, don&#x27;t use prominent titles that could give away the person&#x27;s identity. If any creative professional or studio is named, substitute the name with a description of their style that does not reference any specific people.The prompt must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images.``` reply ollin 14 hours agoprevFor more context on why this system prompt exists, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.openai.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;DALL_E_3_System_Card.pdf reply fullstackchris 11 hours agoparentThe phrase \"system prompt\" appears exactly once in that document. reply ollin 9 hours agorootparentYes - the document is covering their entire risk-mitigation strategy. I&#x27;ve extracted the sections that seemed relevant to me below.The purpose of the prompt transformation system:> we share the work done to prepare DALL·E 3 for deployment... to reduce the risks posed by the model and reduce unwanted behaviors.> Prompt Transformations: ChatGPT rewrites submitted text to facilitate prompting DALL·E 3 more effectively. This process also is used to ensure that prompts comply with our guidelines, including removing public figure names, grounding people with specific attributes, and writing branded objects in a generic way.Prompt transformations to mitigate biases & explicitly ground how people appear:> By default, DALL·E 3 produces images that tend to disproportionately represent individuals who appear White, female, and youthful (Figure 5 and Appendix Figure 15). We additionally see a tendency toward taking a Western point-of-view more generally. These inherent biases, resembling those in DALL·E 2, were confirmed during our early Alpha testing, which guided the development of our subsequent mitigation strategies.> Defining a well-specified prompt, or commonly referred to as grounding the generation, enables DALL·E 3 to adhere more closely to instructions when generating scenes, thereby mitigating certain latent and ungrounded biases (Figure 6) [19].> We conditionally transform a provided prompt if it is ungrounded to ensure that DALL·E 3 sees a grounded prompt at generation time.Prompt transformations to prevent creation of misleading images about public figures:> DALL·E 3-early could reliably generate images of public figures- either in response to direct requests for certain figures or sometimes in response to abstract prompts such as \"a famous pop-star\". Recent uptick of AI generated images of public figures has raised concerns related to mis- and disinformation as well as ethical questions around consent and misrepresentation. We have added in... transformations of user prompts requesting such content... to reduce the instances of such images being generated.Prompt transformations to prevent copyright &#x2F; trademark concerns:> generated images prompted by popular cultural referents can include concepts, characters, or designs that may implicate third-party copyrights or trademarks. We have made an effort to mitigate these outcomes through solutions such as transforming and refusing certain text inputs, but are not able to anticipate all permutations that may occur.They mention that these mitigations could potentially be applied in several rounds of LLM prompt-transformation:> Subsequent LLM transformations can enhance compliance with our prompt assessment guidelines to produce more varied prompts.But, they indicate that this was slow, so the deployed DALL-E just applies mitigations in a single pass, by using a tuned system prompt.> System InstructionsSecondary Prompt Transformation> TunedNone> Based on latency, performance, and user experience trade-offs, DALL·E 3 is initially deployed with this configuration.> Our deployed system balances performance with complexity and latency by just tuning the system prompt. reply rickcarlino 14 hours agoprevI’ve been suspicious that there was a “translate it to English” instructions in the system for other parts of the app. When generating Korean text, GPT4 has a habit of using “you” and “she” (당신&#x2F;그녀) in the output, which are rarely used in Korean. reply og_kalu 13 hours agoparentThere wouldn&#x27;t be that kind of instruction for text generation in other languages because that&#x27;s thing LLMs trained on other languages do natively.

The company didn’t specify how many people were affected, but it corroborated the development and said the decision was driven by the tough economic climate. “Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement. The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched Bing Index to start relying on its own indexing solution. In May, the company released its own search API for clients with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced image, news, and video results as a part of its Search API. Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have a premium tier with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models. The company noted that this will help it pay for the cost of API access and hosting.

Technical stuff is easy to change compared to that.The challenge now is finding competent people who can actually put the effort in, with no compensation, to make it work and that might take convincing the Mozilla folks to do something differently.Having done this kind of thing a few times, that sounds way easier than trying to totally start over from scratch though. reply sirwhinesalot 19 hours agorootparent> Is this a hypothesis that we can specify and test? Is this how we would approach this problem? It sounds more like a cynical write-off, not a actual strategyThere is nothing to test, it&#x27;s why I stopped using Firefox. Check the Mozilla foundation page for all the crap they fund instead of the browser. Look how much the UI looks like Chrome, even little things like clicking the searchbar expanding it outside its bounds.> I&#x27;m suggesting, instead of writing off Firefox, we (you specifically, and me and whomever else wants to) start engaging with Mozilla to help figure this stuff outThey don&#x27;t listen to feedback. When Apple (the company known for telling people they were holding their phones wrong) introduced the safari tab-redesign that merged tabs with the searchbar, it was nearly universally disliked and they backtracked on the change. Apple of all companies backtracked on a bad design. Mozilla? They just keep on going.When Nintendo was struggling due to the failure of the Wii U, Satoru Iwata took on a massive pay cut to avoid firing people. Mozilla? Fired the Servo team and raised executive compensation.> In 2020 Mozilla announced it would cut 25% of its worldwide staff of nearly 1,000 to reduce costs. Firefox has fallen from 30% market share to 4% in 10 years. Despite this, executive pay increased 400%, with Mitchell Baker, Mozilla’s top executive, receiving $2.4m in 2018. reply tedivm 18 hours agorootparentFiring the Servo team was probably the dumbest thing they could have done. reply jjav 15 hours agorootparentprev> Check the Mozilla foundation page for all the crap they fund instead of the browser.Notwithstanding that, they still put out firefox. And Firefox is a far superior browser to any of the alternatives if you care about user-centric control and privacy. So to anyone who cares even a little about being able about these things, supporting Firefox is the way to go.If a mythical even-better browser shows up, great. But here and now, it&#x27;s Firefox, or completely surrender the web to commercial interests. reply kyleee 17 hours agorootparentprevYep, they’d need to fire Baker to right the ship at this point, among other things reply wolpoli 16 hours agorootparentUnder section 3.5 of the Mozilla foundation Bylaws [1], Baker could be removed by the board, which consists of Mitchell Baker, Brian Behlendorf, Helen Turvey, Nicole Wong, Amy Keating, and Mark Surman [2].

Fork away. reply satvikpendem 19 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t that because Firefox itself basically makes no money? I know about Google&#x27;s deal with them but it seems like Mozilla is trying to diversify away from them. reply thfuran 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because it is the nature of bureaucracy to expand. An open source browser doesn&#x27;t need to make money, but a foundation tends not to maintain an unerring focus on a single specific goal. reply hooverd 18 hours agorootparentprevThe only thing Firefox users hate more than Mozilla taking money from Google is Mozilla making money from other sources. Why can&#x27;t the Mozilla team just be ascetic hairshirts who make exactly the browser they want and bring XUL back while they&#x27;re at it. &#x2F;s reply sirwhinesalot 17 hours agorootparentThe Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit that owns the for-profit Mozilla Corporation.Step 1 is get rid of the for-profit corporation that pays its CEO 2.4 million dollars a year to lose market share. That&#x27;s 24 well-paid developers, or double that from lower-income countries.The foundation had a revenue of $441 million in 2020. We know that in 2014 ~90% of their revenue come from its search-engine deal with Google. That means that without Google they&#x27;d have ~44 million to work with these days (or more).That&#x27;s a lot of devs, before even considering non-search-engine sources of revenue. Personally I don&#x27;t mind ideas like the VPN. I do mind the stupid grants the foundation does unrelated to a web-browser or acquisitions like pocket. reply Brybry 16 hours agorootparentCouldn&#x27;t they take the Google money, invest it, and pay developers purely from the interest? Like a university endowment?How many years of Google money would it take to support ~500 staff purely for making Firefox in perpetuity? That&#x27;s maybe ~$50 million&#x2F;year?This[1] says endowments target ~7.5% annualized returns. So a very conservative 5% return could pay for ~500 staff with ~$1 billion in Google bucks.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nacubo.org&#x2F;Press-Releases&#x2F;2023&#x2F;Higher-Education-... reply wwtrv 16 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s 24 well-paid developers, or double that from lower-income countries.That&#x27;s a stretch even if we don&#x27;t count the additional overhead. reply sirwhinesalot 14 hours agorootparentFor a non-profit that (already) runs a mass of volunteers? Surely you jest. The CEO of the blender foundation makes around 100k. They develop one of the greatest open source success stories on 2 million a year. That&#x27;s less (for the whole project) than Baker makes (2.4 million). There&#x27;s no excuse for the shitshow that is Mozilla, none. replyloopz 18 hours agorootparentprevFirefox have no way to support Tab Groups like any Chrome does by default. So is a no-go for me.Any suggestion that Firefox do support Tab Groups will be met with ridicule. It just doesn&#x27;t. reply cwzwarich 20 hours agoparentprev> Why aren&#x27;t we collectively putting our time&#x2F;effort etc.. into making Firefox the singular and best FOSS browser ever?[disclaimer: former Servo team member]Mozilla had a chance to advance browser tech with Servo and fumbled it. reply izacus 20 hours agorootparentNot to be negative, but what value would Servo exactly bring to users and the web after all the engineering effort? I&#x27;m sure it was technically impressive.Chrome, when it came, was stupidly faster than any other competitor, including Mozilla Firefox.What would Servo bring to make web a big jump forward for us users, beyond ideology and fun work for its developers? (Ideology doesn&#x27;t sell software, as opensource efforts have proven repeatedly over last 3 decades). reply coderedart 17 hours agorootparent> but what value would Servo exactly bring to users and the web after all the engineering effort?Servo was a much more modular effort.1. we would get a lightweight (modular) electron alternative. This would have helped rust gui ecosystem a lot, just like wgpu helps rust gamedev scene.2. Probably have more variety in browsers as everyone can now reuse servo components to make their custom version of firefox. Imagine all the linux distros which reuse gnu&#x2F;linux, but have their own philosophy of package management, updates, mutability etc.. We could have had the same sort of varieties in browsers for different usecases. reply bobbylarrybobby 11 hours agorootparentPlus it&#x27;d let people use a JavaScript engine other than v8 and JSCore, and one which (in theory) would be memory safe. reply chromakode 19 hours agorootparentprevSame selling points as Chromium originally: faster and safer. The premise of Servo is that it&#x27;d make better use of multicore and would be safer because it was written in a memory-safe language. For modern users the big one is probably battery usage, though, which Safari excels at but would be harder for an open source player that has to support every device. reply cwzwarich 18 hours agorootparentprev> What would Servo bring to make web a big jump forward for us usersThe biggest advantage would be having a memory-safe browser engine. reply zo1 16 hours agorootparentAs someone with almost no knowledge of Servo, and personally not having a good opinion of the Mozilla foundation, your comment tells me all I need to know why they stopped support of Servo development.Only social initiatives get feel good money to waste on nice to haves. This \"Servo\" thing does not sound like it. reply mdaniel 16 hours agorootparentI want to draw one&#x27;s attention to the (at this point impressive) number of CVEs related to memory issues in Chromium&#x27;s C++ codebase: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromereleases.googleblog.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;label&#x2F;Stable%20... and control-f for CVEEven granting that some of them come from dependent libraries, if the world&#x27;s arguably best funded software engineering organization can&#x27;t keep C++ footguns out of an application that runs untrusted code on the regular ... one may want to have a think about whether C++ is the best tool for that purpose reply toyg 15 hours agorootparentThe point is that all this is not seen as valuable by users and market leaders. You don&#x27;t gain marketshare in b2c by saying \"my gizmo is more memory-safe than other gizmos\", you have to show features. Chrome&#x27;s process-separation was a feature: you could easily dispose of non-responsive pages, which other browsers couldn&#x27;t do as well. Even then, it wasn&#x27;t really why Chrome took off - it took off because of deep integration with Google&#x27;s ecosystem, incessant marketing efforts, and monopolistic behaviour (Google \"unwittingly\" breaking GMail and other G products on other browsers, on a regular basis).So what feature would full memory-safety actually enable? I suspect that&#x27;s the bit that the Servo folks couldn&#x27;t articulate well enough. reply izacus 15 hours agorootparentprevSo what&#x27;s the monetary value of not having those CVEs? How did any of that actually touch users beyond having to wait a bit for Chrome to autoupdate? reply mdaniel 13 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.brave.com&#x2F;news?q=chrome%20exploit%20in%20the%...I&#x27;m delighted to hear that you (and I) were not personally impacted by those but to say \"I didn&#x27;t get in a crash, who cares about seat belts working\" is comically misguidedAlso your \"for Chrome to autoupdate\" perspective makes me wish I could search for every single red Update screenshot I&#x27;ve seen in presentations or Zoom meetings reply izacus 11 hours agorootparentAgain, how did that materially affect users to the point they&#x27;d switch? replyqwytw 16 hours agorootparentprev> Chrome, when it came, was stupidly faster than any other competitorWasn&#x27;t it just using WebKit initially? IIRC you could actually use Safari on Windows back then. reply satvikpendem 19 hours agorootparentprevAre they not using any Rust in the codebase at all? My impression was that they abandoned Servo but still rewrote parts in Rust. reply rcxdude 19 hours agorootparentSome big chunks of servo got moved into firefox, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss. But it would have been better if servo kept going, even if it never became something you would daily drive and instead it just kept generating good ideas to be subsumed into firefox. reply fabrice_d 18 hours agorootparentServo is active again thanks to Igalia allocating a handful of full time engineers. They are making good progress especially on layout, so keep an eye on it! reply AndrewKemendo 20 hours agorootparentprevIs that sufficient reason to abandon the entire project? reply yashasolutions 19 hours agoparentprevFirefox is getting many things right, but maybe we need something like some community fork with a leadership that&#x27;s able to create a constructive effort to bring back the focus on what was once the spirit of this browser.There are many non-aligned efforts with various directions, some focused on privacy, some on UI config, etc. maybe getting these people together to create something common where something can be integrated into one.Just to keep rambling, I&#x27;d add that maybe a online conference independently run to get some important conversion going in the community, with the various firefox-fork maintainers and other important contributor, and try to layout some common roadmap, outline the main issues and get people exited again about the product would be a relatively low-hanging fruit to this started. reply mch82 18 hours agoparentprevYou’re in the right mindset. I’d recommend a pivot from the “private citizen” persona to the “CTO persona”. As a CTO, I want a web browser based on open standards so that my company’s portfolio of products and internal business apps are protected from monopoly behavior by browser vendors.Mozilla may have forgotten the CTO persona. CTOs can donate engineering hours to Mozilla. Companies can donate money. If companies in the Fortune 500 aren’t using Firefox internally and companies like Netflix aren’t recommending Firefox to users, then Mozilla will continue to struggle to get market share and sustain funding.One key use case: Firefox used to make it easy to create corporate intranet apps (the apps teams at companies use to do work). However, Firefox security changes started breaking intranet apps by returning the “your connection is not secure” error and giving workers no way to override. This hurts CTOs so CTOs switch their companies to Edge & Chrome. reply kyleee 16 hours agorootparentUgh, the self signed cert “error” scare page is such a dark spot in general purpose computing history reply iteratethis 19 hours agoparentprevWhat is the difference between Brave taking Venture and Mozilla being subsidized by the ultimate enemy of privacy, Google?Mozilla has defunded Firefox, allows for no way to directly donate to Firefox development, and now writes activist blogs. reply AndrewKemendo 18 hours agorootparentHistoryWe know what Mozilla will do with it - not ideal but it&#x27;s the devil we knowWe have no idea what Brave will do with itMy personal heuristics around VC backed companies (Having been a CEO with venture backing, an LP in a venture fund, a director in a publicly traded company etc...) is the following:There do not exist PE backed companies that will take actions that conflict with an even theoretical reduction in potential ROI.Leaders lose long term control of their companies to VC the moment they sign the term sheetSo I have zero faith that anyone who aligns themselves to profit making, will not harm either the customers or the employees that are involved in favor for the people providing the capital. reply Etheryte 20 hours agoparentprevI think for a lot of people Firefox does tick those boxes, but the way Mozilla has been run is... less than ideal. I&#x27;m sure many commenters here will have strong opinions about it, personally I&#x27;m not convinced that modern Mozilla is the right organization to pour this time and effort into. reply zee234 19 hours agoparentprevFirefox browser and engine is technical obsolete joke. Their sand-boxing security model, multi-threading, graphical libraries... Remember cancelled Servo rewrite, or the whole \"multi-threaded\" saga?Try to actually compile that bloody thing, before you write \"software to be fully modifiable by any person using tools that are easily, freely available and accessible\"Even Ubuntu team gave up on compiling their software, and are serving mainstream binaries from Mozilla!Brave has some shady stuff, but that is easy to disable in configuration. And under-hood they follow security patches pretty well, have good security and stuff like 3D acceleration just works!And you do not need 10 browser extension from some shady authors, that has full access to your browsing data!!! reply blinkingled 18 hours agorootparentAs someone who has built and lightly studied Firefox codebase out of pure curiosity this technical joke doesn&#x27;t really ring remotely true. Sure it&#x27;s an older codebase and Mozilla doesn&#x27;t have enough funding manpower to do big rewrites but I don&#x27;t remember Firefox crashing on me in recent times and I use it exclusively on Mac&#x2F;Linux and Windows. No site compat issues either. So stop blowing smoke I guess and provide actual details on how it is a joke? reply zee2345 17 hours agorootparentIt is not about crashing, but security. Chromium based browsers have multiple layers of sandboxing and hardening. Webpage rendered basically runs in several virtual machines that are very hard to breach.Mozilla had process based isolation (mainly due old code base). That is far less effective. Some things like GPU access are not sandboxed at all!>Google remains the default search engine provider inside the Firefox browser until 2023 for an estimated $400 million to $450 million per year.Mozilla is a multibilion corporation. They DO have resources for proper rewrite in Rust. How they spend their money is another thing!Old code base was good excuse in 2016! Brave Software Inc is much smaller company, and they do advanced stuff like their own search engine! reply blinkingled 15 hours agorootparentGPU sandboxing landed in 110 on Windows. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Sandbox&#x2F;Process_model#GPU_... says it will be likely added to OSX and Linux with Webrender. Web Content processes are already sandboxed so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a joke ;) - sure they lag behind Chromium but Google has way more resources than Mozilla. reply webstrand 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s due to trademark restrictions. The Gentoo community regularly builds Firefox from scratch, it&#x27;s not the slowest package to build. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 18 hours agorootparentprevThey did append their affiliate id to type-ins for a single crypto exchange onceThey didn&#x27;t do this either. There was an omnibox site suggestion that included an affiliate id. Nothing got appended and people were able to see the affiliate id before hitting enter to visit the site. These site suggestions could also be disabled in the settings. reply mthoms 13 hours agorootparentThats nearly exactly what I said? - If you typed the domain into the address bar, and pressed enter (obviously) the affiliate id got appended. I&#x27;m not clear what distinction you&#x27;re making here. reply charcircuit 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s like saying that if I type news into the omnibar and hit enter the browser appends .ycombinator.comThat isn&#x27;t really what is happening. It shows a preview for news.ycombinator.com and hitting enter confirms that option. The distinction is one is clear to the user and the other is a modification that happens behind the scenes. replyGeorgelemental 18 hours agoparentprevBrave&#x27;s CEO (Brendan Eich) used to be co-founder and CEO of Mozilla. They kicked him out because in 2008 he donated $1000 of his money to an unapproved political cause. Can&#x27;t put time&#x2F;effort into something that is more interested in virtue signalling than improving. reply init2null 15 hours agorootparentCTO would&#x27;ve been appropriate, but not CEO. Mozilla could not keep a CEO donating to ban gay marriage. I rather doubt even Microsoft would&#x27;ve kept him. It&#x27;s divisive and distracting, especially for a public benefit organization. They made the right call. reply Georgelemental 14 hours agorootparent7 million people voted in favor of Proposition 8. Would you ban all 7 million from any position of authority? What of the 6.4 million who voted against, are they \"divisive\"? reply init2null 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s fine if he voted against it. But a donation disqualifies him from that position if for no other reason than it&#x27;s distracting from Mozilla&#x27;s purpose. Whether good or bad, the foundation has a strong human rights focus.Gervase Markham was a dedicated outspoken fundamentalist at Mozilla until his death and was very influential, but he wasn&#x27;t in a leadership position. Big difference. reply Georgelemental 13 hours agorootparentWould you have the same opinion if he had donated to the other camp? Does the timing of the donation also matter, in your view? reply kbelder 16 hours agorootparentprevShouldn&#x27;t be a dead comment; this is exactly what happened. reply flagrant_taco 20 hours agoprevWe aren&#x27;t going to see browser competition unless and until we fundamentally rethink what the internet should be.The specifications are simply too complex to foster any meaningful competition. There&#x27;s too much ground to cover playing catchup and Google has such a large market share that, combined with their data and ad monopoly, allows them to create new specs and features that focus entirely on growing their business model.Web sepcifications should be simple enough that it&#x27;s pheasible for small teams to actually maintain a quality open source browser with modest funding. We&#x27;ve ended up falling into the same trap as many other big systems, we lost sight of what the goals and limitations for the web were and instead chased convenience and shiny new features above all else. reply bobajeff 14 hours agoparentI&#x27;d like to see an alternative to the Web as well. The truth is that we don&#x27;t need web browsers as much as we need say Wikipedia, YouTube, Reddit, Amazon, Facebook, GitHub, StackOverflow etc. And we don&#x27;t need those sites so much as we need the data that is on those services.What is a better source of how to tutorials YouTube?

Computers were originally designed as a tool, they allowed us to work more efficiently but weren&#x27;t directly taking over doing the actual work. A spreadsheet doid the calculations for me, but I had to provide both the data and the actual formulas to run.AI, or more accurately machine learning, attempts to take us out of the process. It isn&#x27;t separating content and presentation, it&#x27;s separating content and understanding. The algorithm will read in data, compress it, and save only the patterns it learned. By the time the content is presented there is little connection to the original source and what I&#x27;m seeing isn&#x27;t just a separated presentation layer, it&#x27;s something entirely different like playing a game of telephone. reply charcircuit 17 hours agoparentprevGoogle&#x27;s browser engine is open source. You can reuse Google&#x27;s browser engine meaning that you can focus on the features that differentiate your browser instead of implementing the spec like you suggest. reply flagrant_taco 6 hours agorootparentExactly, in that model the only way to build a browser is to depend on someone else to implement the specs. It&#x27;s not feasible to build a new browser, at best you can start with what Google implemented, including proprietary features, and go from there. At that point you likely don&#x27;t understand the codebase fully and are going to be dependant on staying in sync with chromium to get new features.This model of starting with chromium really has nothing to do with building a web browser, it is just building a UI around Google&#x27;s browser. There isn&#x27;t much daylight between that and the often complained about limitation of Apple only allowing the use of WebKit on iOS. reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparent>At that point you likely don&#x27;t understand the codebase fullyIt&#x27;s faster to learn the part of the comebase you are interested in rather than building a whole browser engine.>and are going to be dependant on staying in sync with chromium to get new features.Being able to reuse the work Google is investing into th browser engine is a positive.>There isn&#x27;t much daylight between that and the often complained about limitation of Apple only allowing the use of WebKit on iOS.The difference is you can make changes to the browser engine if you need. reply flagrant_taco 4 hours agorootparentI think we&#x27;re just thinking about very stiffener goals for the web. I&#x27;m not interested in a version of the web that is driven by one browser or company, even if it can technically be modified or tweaked as long as you don&#x27;t diverge see enough to break upstream compatibility. reply charcircuit 2 hours agorootparentYour original comment was about competition between browsers. For browsers to compete they don&#x27;t all need to have their own browser engine written from scratch.Web standards are not driven by one browser or one company. That would still be true if everyone based their browsers off of Blink. reply dmarcos 16 hours agorootparentprevYes. I see chromium as the linux kernel. Piece of fundamental infrastructure that does the the heavy lifting and one can reconfigure, tweak, add features or eventually fork if needed. Never been easier to build an independent browser. reply flagrant_taco 6 hours agorootparentThe open web is dead if the only option is to base every browser on a Google core. How do specs fit into this if every browser is just a UI shell around chrome? Where is the competition driving innovation of the web platform when the only competitive landscape is how pretty you can make your toolbars and bookmarks?We need independent groups of passionate people making sure that the web platform is focused on the best end user experience. We don&#x27;t always have that today, but that vision is completely dead if the web functionality is decided entirely by an advertising platform. reply charcircuit 5 hours agorootparent>How do specs fit into this if every browser is just a UI shell around chrome?The browser engine is open source. You can make changes and proposals with your own fork. If you are making a browser for musicians you could try and advance the WebMIDI spec and add new functionality to it and then try to get it standardized. But as a browser developer you don&#x27;t want to me spending your time implenting specs that other people have already implemented, but rather spending time working on things that improve your browser for your userbase. reply flagrant_taco 4 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re describing is the opposite of the whole point of specifications. The aim wasn&#x27;t to circle around a single implementation, it was to define feature specifications that would allow multiple vendors to build cross-compatable web browsers.What would be the point of open specifications if there was only a single implementation? reply charcircuit 2 hours agorootparent>What would be the point of open specifications if there was only a single implementation?I never said there was? When you write the first implementation then there will only be a single implementation, but that&#x27;s how counting works. 1 comes after 0. Anyone is free to write another implementation. replyfabrice_d 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat if you need changes at the engine level to differentiate your browser? reply charcircuit 10 hours agorootparentThen you make the changes to the engine. You are permitted to keep those changes to yourself if you wish. reply bongwater_OS 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been using Brave (quite happily) for years, I was inspired by their initial mission. Reading this article, hearing that they&#x27;re implementing \"price-tiered AI\" (~original~), is so antithetical to what I once thought they stood for that I&#x27;m ready to ditch.This might sound crazy, but the primary purpose of a browser isn&#x27;t to improve search results with a custom API (almost none of which compare to vanilla Google), but to actually improve the browsing experience. Haven&#x27;t tried Arc, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it seems like they&#x27;re actually focusing on UX, which is the kind of thing I&#x27;m looking for in a browser. reply timeon 17 hours agoparent> Haven&#x27;t tried ArcJumping from Chromium to Chromium? reply omneity 21 hours agoprevThis doesn’t bode well for Brave’s self professed mission [0].Maintaining a Chrome fork is already difficult enough on its own, especially with the number of directions where Brave wants to diverge.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36893654 reply icegreentea2 21 hours agoparentNo, it doesn&#x27;t bode well =(. To be honest, I wonder if the webbrowser &#x27;market&#x27; has been fundamentally broken ever since the Netscape days.Effectively ever since IE broke Netscape&#x27;s back, every single major web browser has been funded either off the back of other business units (IE, Chrome, Safari), or funded by search engine deals. No customer has actually had to really contemplate &#x27;what is the value of a browser&#x27; in like 25 years. No one actually has a sense of how valuable a browser actually is (except through the perverse metric of how many ads can you serve to the user via default search...).I think it&#x27;s telling that all of Brave&#x27;s new revenue streams aren&#x27;t actually -from- their self-professed mission. reply atdrummond 21 hours agorootparentOpera did have a business model that worked monetizing the browser itself through sales - until smartphones fully supplanted feature phones. reply Timon3 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not quite the full story. Since 2000 Opera showed ads if you didn&#x27;t pay for it, and they removed those in 2005, a good bit before smartphones really started.In a way they were ahead of the curve, considering how popular ad-based models with optional removal purchases are these days. reply inemesitaffia 16 hours agorootparentThe ads were still there as of last year in mini. reply agumonkey 20 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, it would be fun to give an estimate based on firefox browser team size and other contributors reply GnarfGnarf 20 hours agoparentprevI wish Brave&#x2F;YouTube weren&#x27;t such a dismal experience on Chromebook. You can&#x27;t click on the red bar to jump ahead. You can&#x27;t pause&#x2F;restart by pressing the space bar. The navigation is awkward and crippled. Same for Firefox.

So yes, you can run other browsers although last I checked it was a little bumpy. reply izacus 20 hours agorootparentLast I checked Brave had no support for large screens (tablets, foldables, chromebooks) on Android at all - it was horrible from usability perspective. reply vorticalbox 20 hours agorootparentprevOn later chromebooks you can run Linux apps and android apps.If you need to test in a lot of browsers it&#x27;s not a terrible idea as you can run both desktop and module browsers. reply tomjen3 18 hours agoparentprevIf it doesn&#x27;t, whats the best suggestion for another browser that is based on Webkit and which takes privacy seriously? reply alisonatwork 17 hours agorootparentCromite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uazo&#x2F;cromite reply pluc 19 hours agoprevWell the good news is that there are plenty of other companies using the exact same technology to produce the exact same product! reply kazinator 15 hours agoprev> challenging economic environmentThe \"environment\" problem isn&#x27;t economic, but social. It&#x27;s not new, and it&#x27;s not about to change:- Most users don&#x27;t know that the browser that came with their device can be replaced by something else.- Of those that know, many don&#x27;t.- Of those who do, they want it free; you cannot monetize it. You can&#x27;t lock them in; they will switch to something else at the sign of any trouble.The alternative browser user is pretty much the same person who doesn&#x27;t want to see a single ad anywhere, or pay for anything.You might as well wrap quartz pebbles in cloth and wait for whey to drip out.A possible area for an alternative browser might be the corporate environment; employers who want to prescribe some kind of more locked down, security-fortified browser for use within their intranet. The challenge there is demonstrating value, compared to regular approaches: using regular browsers and securing things elsewhere.Recently there was a HN submission to a story about how scalpers are able to get Ticketmaster tickets before everyone else, which mentioned custom browsers that the use. Someone makes money in that niche. reply twism 17 hours agoprevEnough is enough. Y&#x27;all need to pack it up and go home. The big boy browsers are making features that make websites seem like native applications while y&#x27;all are still struggling making css look right. Maybe this is not a brave thing specifically since last I looked brave was based on chromium so should have feature parity with chrome browsers, but then what&#x27;s the point? Are we just pointing things to different servers in the source (or removing that part) and claiming FOSS&#x2F;privacy. I&#x27;m honestly confused by these alternative browsers. reply minerva23 9 hours agoparentBrave has some user-first features you&#x27;ll never see from Chrome. E.g. ad&#x2F;tracking blocking by default, cookie consent popup blocking offered, YouTube downloads on iOS.That&#x27;s in addition to some anti-Google and better privacy features.I want a browser which actively fights the enshitification of the web. Brave is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I&#x27;m hoping to find better. reply xrd 21 hours agoprevInteresting to see they are offering services that can either be in house or offloaded to another service provider.They are oscillating between building their own search engine versus using Bing. And offering their own internal AI named Leo versus passing information to one of the many cloud provider APIs.For Brave, difficult to claim privacy if they don&#x27;t do all that in house. But it forces them out of their lane from building a browser to building all these services.Kind of seems like they are becoming Google, which has always been the foil Brave has claimed to be fighting against. reply zolbrek 21 hours agoparentBrave has a long, long way to go before they even get close to becoming Google. reply izacus 20 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re repackaging Googles software, they&#x27;ve always been already there.Building a business who&#x27;s feature is \"We&#x27;re independent from Google\" on top of codebase that is dependant on Googles development effort was always a hypocritical thesis. reply dartos 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah.

Keep in mind those values do not show grouped sums. Table 9 [1] is much more straight forward. Full time workers (in thousands) went from 134,189 to 134,167, part time workers went from 27,185 to 27,336. So a total of -22k full time jobs, and +151k part time jobs.The big reported increase came from the establishment&#x2F;business survey. That survey results in overcounting people working multiple jobs. And multiple job holders (also in table 9) jumped from 8,028 to 8,151, for 123k more people now working at least 2 jobs. So we saw a loss of full time jobs, a gain of part time jobs, and a gain of people working more than one job.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;empsit.t09.htm reply DragonStrength 21 hours agoparentprevThe article discusses the sectors for most of those jobs, which is hospitality.

What a joke. reply VancouverMan 20 hours agoparentprev> Government employment increased by 73,000 jobs, driven by state government education and local government, excluding education.That part should raise serious questions about the validity of this metric.Any taxpayer-funded or debt-funded government \"job\" is not a creator of real (in the economic sense) wealth.Rather, such government \"jobs\" merely siphon off and consume real wealth generated by actually-productive market participants, and then permanently destroy that wealth.Even worse, the process of destroying of that real wealth is often done in a way that then impedes the productivity of the real wealth creators, introducing a secondary and longer-lasting real economic loss.Each government \"job\" added should be seen as a significant net loss to the overall economy.Those government \"jobs\" are in effect just destroying the real output of some number of private sector jobs. reply malfist 20 hours agorootparentTell me about your plan to run and maintain a national network of highways without government \"jobs\" reply VancouverMan 18 hours agorootparentWhy do you mistakenly believe that government needs to be involved with something like that?There&#x27;s nothing overly special about an interstate-style highway network. It&#x27;s essentially just a large number of roads covering a long distance that are connected together, with emphasis on driving speed.The private sector is more than capable of planning, building, connecting, maintaining, and operating roads of all types, widths, and lengths.I don&#x27;t know where you are, but in Canada the various governments end up having to resort to the private sector anyway for highway-related projects.It&#x27;s government interference that prevents there from being more privately-build and operated highways. That&#x27;s exactly the problem I was talking about in my earlier comment. Government \"jobs\" are dead weight on the real economy, only inhibiting those who are actually productive. reply mthoms 17 hours agorootparentPrivate sector highways here in Canada are a disaster and an embarrassment. They have near zero public support (aside from libertarians). reply VancouverMan 11 hours agorootparentThe 407 is actually a pretty good example of government inefficiency when it comes to planning and building highways.It exists because the 401 wasn&#x27;t built with sufficient long-term capacity, even after it was widened significantly.I wouldn&#x27;t really consider the 407 a true \"private\" highway, though. It&#x27;s more a case of the private sector rescuing the government from a typical government-created debacle, and last I heard, the highway is now majority-owned by the CPP Investment Board (a Crown corporation).Have you ever actually driven on the 407, by any chance? It&#x27;s a much nicer experience than the 401, although having to pay a toll while also paying significant taxes can be annoying.

I know at least five people now, from the EU, who are struggling hard landing product leadership roles internationally.With all these tech companies tightening budgets and laying off staff, hiring has slowed across the board. I mean I guess for sure there&#x27;s still desire for senior PM talent, but the roles are 100% more scattered.I only know a bunch of people in the EU and don&#x27;t really have a global picture so how&#x27;s the product job landscape globally? What regions or companies still have healthy hiring pipelines? Is it mainly US-based companies recruiting abroad or are there other non-US tech scenes continuing to grow?

The false starts with my engineering journal are, I think, partly because I write it like documentation. I should just write terse bullets.

The way I understand it (I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet) is that it builds up hierarchies from bullet lists and can organize your knowledge base with them in mind, which means your daily notes can have a hierarchical bullet list and potentially you could query for every day you worked on a particular feature in a particular project very easily. reply meheleventyone 14 minutes agorootparentI think this misses the point of daily note taking, at least for me. I don’t care about anything more than a week old and really only a couple of days because all I’m using it to do is organise myself in the near future and give myself a little reward every time I finish something. I keep it public so people can also see what I’ve been up to.

At $JOB, we had one programmer who was absolutely slaying. We would plan a sprint, and two days later more than 1&#x2F;2 of the board was done and in review, mostly done by him. When I joined, I did a similar thing, until I realized that its no fun to just chew through all tasks for the team and then only do reviews for the rest of the sprint. So instead now I mix reviews and writing code, which managers like to see anyways, and progress is a magnitude slower. Setting up a test env, context switching to a problem, code review, manual testing, writing comments, etc. definitely takes a lot more time usually than solving that same issue.I think it definitely depends on the programmers, though. I&#x27;ve seen people take a week for what, for maybe another dev, would probably take a day.One of the ideas of scrum and sprints is that everyone does a bit of everything, right? And that is long-term good, short term a bit of a hindrance.The guy who could do that task in one day has a lot of knowledge about that part of the code, and if he always does that, and then leaves, there&#x27;s a knowledge gap. If instead we let someone else spend a week on the task, because they have to figure out how everything works and is structured, then we have two people who have this knowledge at the end.In my experience, there are also big skill gaps between people, and some are just much, much faster than others.

He&#x27;s well known as a prolific programmer prodigy ;)But also, some other things to note:* A lot of \"agile\" development in corporate environments is anything but agile because of overhead in horizontally scaling human gray meat (until we get neural interfacing between one another or something)* It was a simpler time back then. Carmack was coding against a much simpler architecture, with significantly fewer variants.* It was a simpler time back then. Carmack could focus on blitting pixels to the screen as fast as possible, rather than spending 6 months trying to wrap his head around Vulkan.* It was a simpler time back then.

Unless you&#x27;re talking about gamedev, which I can&#x27;t comment about. But it&#x27;s hard to say that tech in general is slower moving as an industry than thirty years ago; I think there&#x27;s more nuance to it than that. What exactly that nuance is I&#x27;m not completely sure, but here are some counterexamples:Intel shifted the entire direction of its company away from memory and into microprocessors as early as the 1980s, in response to smaller, allegedly faster moving Japanese competitors.IBM has been a slow-moving behemoth for decades; the story of how DOS began is an idiomatic David vs Goliath tale of the industry.Apple debatably rose to prominence on the back of tech lifted from Xerox, which for one reason or another (maybe they were too confident in their fax machines) didn&#x27;t ship their own tech.Google was at one point a fast-moving startup, up against slow-moving competitors like AltaVista, arguably Yahoo, MSN.Amazon&#x27;s original web stack was written in C, iirc. I personally would have a hard time arguing that things done today in web development could be done faster in C. reply faizshah 7 hours agorootparentIt’s not tech in general that’s slower moving, but rather that software development is slower moving today (in my opinion).To launch a minor feature at a modern tech company you need to:- pitch your idea to your manager and get alignment- get approval from your skip manager and buy-in from your product managers- align your idea with your partner team’s roadmap- go through a design review with your team- go through a design review with your principal engineers- write a task breakdown- actually write the code - write tests for the code - write integration tests for the code - fix build issues - push multiple code reviews and respond to comments - whoops you need to rebase and that shared component you used just changed it’s interface yesterday breaking your tests - your integration tests failed in preprod blocking your coworker’s launch, better fix that- a couple rounds of AppSec, UX and PM review- time to coordinate the launch of your feature toggle with 6 partner teams- oops there was a minor bug you need to roll back your feature and resolve it overnightHow much of this overhead existed in the 90s?If a single lone genius like Ken Thompson or John Carmack wants to write a new feature or product and get it out to customers they have 10x+ the work today (at a modern tech company). reply neilv 13 hours agoparentprevThere are some sweet spots to be found in software development productivity.Finding them is an art&#x2F;craft, and very sensitive to the project&#x2F;company context, the people you have available, how the work will be distributed, etc. It includes making process lightweight by default, and having a good sense of when to use something non-lightweight.In the right circumstances, a few top \"programmers\" with great team software engineering sense, and someone representing product sense, unencumbered by BS, can usually wipe the floor with most contemporary much-larger teams.But starting off a startup by saying \"We&#x27;ll do Leetcode rituals so we know we&#x27;ll hire aspiring techbros who spent their spare time at Stanford memorizing those, and we&#x27;ll (pretend to) use this fashionable branded lifecycle process designed for companies that have no idea what they&#x27;re doing but have a lot of warm bodies to fumble blindly through it, and ignore unfashionable process tools that we were confidently told don&#x27;t work by students with zero experience based on what a professor with zero experience told them, and this huge list of popular tech we heard of and will never understand will be our stack, and then we can show promise to get to the next funding round and hire even more warm bodies...\" is one way to make the road to finding effective expertise much longer. :) reply baz00 13 hours agoparentprevThe point of SAFe is so that remote workers can be as productive as Carmack on their own side gigs during the ceremonial duties and meetings.

    "originLink": "https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/",
    "originBody": "🏠 Marginalia📁 Weblog📄 Moving Marginalia to a New Server Moving Marginalia to a New Server Posted: 2023-10-07 Tags: search-engine So the search engine is moving to a new server soon, thanks to the generous grant mentioned recently. If you visit search.marginalia.nu now, it may or may not use the old or new server. It’ll be like this for a while, since I need them both for testing and maintenance type work. I’ll also apologize if this post is a bit chaotic. It is a reflection of a very chaotic couple of weeks that apart from setting up this migration also involved a very short notice invitation for a presentation at ossym23. This project seems to generate a lot of goodwill from the technologically inclined, so when I went to order the server, they sent me an email stating they liked what I was doing and offered a free CPU upgrade. From dual Epyc 7443 to 7543. Thanks Mullet Scandinavia! (Swedish website). So the server’s a big beefy one. The machine has 512 GB of RAM and 10x8 plus 2x4 TB SSDs, and the aforementioned dual Epyc 7543s for a whopping 128 logical cores. Some decisions needed to be made about how to deploy the search engine onto the server. The software will need some modifications to make good use of the hardware, but that’s a later worry. OS Setup We’re going Debian Bookworm. The idea has always been to skip RAID for the index drives and run multiple index partitions on at least 8 of the 8 TB drives, keeping the other two for spare storage space, testing, and ready to be wiped and repurposed with short notice. If a drive croaks, 12.5% of the index needs to be reconstructed on one of the two spare drives, which would be an inconvenience and a temporary loss of capacity but it’s not catastrophic end of the world type stuff. Since most of what search engines do is embarassingly parallel along the axis of domains, this basic design makes sense. The machine has 64 physical cores and a bunch of disks, so we want to put them all to work where possible. Keeping each shard on a different physical disk by design reduces resource contention, which is desirable since the expected access pattern will be a shotgun blast of requests hitting each partition at the exact same time, triggering an intense flurry of reads. Page Faults There are still lingering concerns with this approach. The software is based around memory mapped storage, and Linux’ page fault handler can only put up with so many page faults at any given time. A potential way around this is virtualization, to run multiple operating systems on the same machine. There are clear drawbacks with this. Each operating system essentially gets a fixed allocation of RAM, something like 32-48 GB. This can lead to quite a lot of wasted resources, VM #3 may really need 64 GB instead of 48 GB at a point where VM #4 may have 24 GB to spare. The single-machine paradigm will permit large processing jobs to borrow small amounts of RAM from each partition without disruption. I think the drawbacks of virtualization outweigh the benefits here. It’s probably easier to re-code the index to reduce the amount of page faults if necessary than to reclaim the wasted RAM and resources. It’s also very hard to backpedal on a setup like this, it would essentially entail wiping the entire server and rebulding it from scratch, storing dozens of terabytes of crawl data god knows where in the meantime. A core value for the project is to make the best use of the hardware available. Much of what you’d consider conventional wisdom in this field is based around the assumption of hardware being cheap, and development being expensive. In this project, it is the other way around, even now with a server 10X as powerful as the previous one. Resilience and recovery Having more important hard drives increases the odds of disk failure in the same way throwing more dice increases the chance of rolling a 1. Disk failure needs to be considered a real possibility and factored into the design. There are two failure modes. Single Disk Error One of the two OS disks can fail without any interruption to operations, thanks to RAID1. In the scenario where one of the index disks were to fail, the capacity of the system will drop by 12.5% for about a day. At this point one of the two spare drives will be repurposed into a new index disk. This capacity drop is a tolerable inconvenience. Disaster In the case of a more unlikely scenario, with multiple simultaneous failure of several drives, the system is designed to be eventually recoverable from just scraps of the data. With the design proposed, you’d need simultaneous failure of seven hard different drives to put a permanent end to operations. You can regenerate the crawl data from the domain database (RAID 1). You can regenerate the index from crawl data. You can regenerate the domain database from crawl data. You can regenerate the index from index backups. You can regenerate the domain database from database backups (2 physical disks, also hot spare). Some of this is accomplished by using a daisy-chained data layout where disk N carries the Nth index, crawl data for shard (N-1), and index-backups for shard (N+1). Thus to eradicate all knowledge of shard 3, disks 2, 3 and 4 would need to die along with both the backup disks and both the main OS disks. Daisy, daisy… This design has every potential to become difficult to reason about without careful thought being put into the execution. The sane way of accomplishing this disk assignment scheme is to have one directory of mounted disk partitions, and to use a parallel tree of symlinks to accomplish the distribution, and then have the code only interact with the symlinks while the operating system deals with the rest. Like so: /app/index/1/backup -> /disk/2/backup /app/index/1/current -> /disk/1/current /app/index/1/storage -> /disk/0/storage /app/index/1/work -> /disk/1/work /app/index/2/backup -> /disk/3/backup /app/index/2/current -> /disk/2/current /app/index/2/storage -> /disk/1/storage /app/index/2/work -> /disk/2/work ... Software Finally, a note about adapting the software. The first stage migration will just run the existing code on a single partition, but moving forward, the aim is to make modifications to be able to have multiple backing indexes. Since one of the objectives of the project paradoxically is to build search engine software that doesn’t require an insane monster of a server like this, this also makes sense, since it keeps the indexes “PC sized” and might permit a cluster-based solution elsewhere. There are other dev-ex benefits to keeping the working data sets small as well, it’s just less of a pain to work with 100 GB files than 40 TB ones… … This is all written sort of mid-configuration. Nothing is quite final. A copy of the search engine is up on the new server, but it’s all a bit of a construction space right now. It’s really great to have two servers though, since the old one is still around, if I need some downtime, I can just re-direct the DNS to the old IP.

This can lead to quite a lot of wasted resources, VM #3 may really need 64 GB instead of 48 GB at a point where VM #4 may have 24 GB to spare.I don&#x27;t know what virtualisation the author has in mind, but static RAM allocation isn&#x27;t a requirement for VMs. VirtIO&#x27;s memory balloon can be used to dynamically grow and shrink available memory. It&#x27;s not exactly something you can do willy-nilly, but when a VM has a large amount of free RAM (like 24GB) you can definitely use ballooning to temporarily reassign memory capacity.Since the author is talking about using Debian, they could opt for Proxmox to handle ballooning for them. Without Proxmox, scripts similar to this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berkerogluu&#x2F;auto-ballooning-kvm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mast...) could also be used to control memory distribution, though I imagine a server like this needs something a little more sophisticated. reply snerbles 17 hours agoparentSince the author is running dual processors, they will need to account for NUMA domains. That is, half of the RAM is assigned to each CPU, and performance will suffer if a thread on CPU 0 is accessing memory belonging to CPU 1. numactl[0] can be used to bind a process to a specific NUMA node on bare metal, but a hypervisor can also set CPU&#x2F;memory affinity for a given VM without fiddling about at the process level.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;8&#x2F;numactl reply marginalia_nu 19 hours agoparentprevInteresting. Would this still allow the virtualized machines to manage their own page tables as though native? I can&#x27;t say I understand how it&#x27;s implemented, but I&#x27;m concerned it might leave the host system with the same page thrashing the choice to use virtualization was intended to avoid. reply shrubble 19 hours agorootparentYou could examine LXC, which is a container setup, for isolation. Adding memory doesn&#x27;t require a restart of the container. You may wish to examine ZFS or, going farther afield, even ZFS with FreeBSD with or without jails&#x2F;bhyve. reply magicalhippo 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know how VirtIO does it but VMWare has a kernel driver which allocates the pages from the guest OS.IIRC it locks these pages so they are unavailable until the driver releases them back. reply Hello71 19 hours agorootparentprevthat depends on your setup. ballooning is just a function to move memory from the guest to the host; if you move too much memory you&#x27;ll get thrashing. the bigger problem is I&#x2F;O indirection through the host; for I&#x2F;O heavy workloads you&#x27;ll want to use PCI passthrough for best performance, which (assuming it&#x27;s working properly) should be identical to native performance. reply amluto 19 hours agoprev> The software is based around memory mapped storage, and Linux’ page fault handler can only put up with so many page faults at any given time.> A potential way around this is virtualization, to run multiple operating systems on the same machine.What’s the actual issue? Linux can have trouble servicing many page faults in parallel in a single process (technically mm) due to lock contention. Multiple processes should reduce this contention.Do you have more details? reply marginalia_nu 19 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a fairly hypothetical problem, like it may not even be a problem, other than the intuition that having 8 applications all thrashing wildly and competing for the same page table may not be the most performant way of allocating resources. reply amluto 17 hours agorootparent> having 8 applications all thrashing wildly and competing for the same page table may not be the most performant way of allocating resources.They’re not, though. There’s a tree of “page tables” (that is, a tree with branching factor 512 or so, in the format used by the CPU) per process. Also, per process, there’s a tree of VMAs (the logical maps from contiguous virtual address ranges to whatever logically backs them) — these are created by mmap and friends. And, regrettably, a lock, also per process (although this lock is a read-write lock, and page faults are reads).If you have a whole bunch of processes mmapping the same file and thrashing against it, you could end up with contention for that files’s data structures that track mappings, but that seems unlikely. Mappings of different pages of ordinary memory should scale well.And a VM, for this purpose, is more or less like a process. QEMU (or whatever other userspace host you use) literally maps everything that the VM logically maps, and VM faults are handled as though QEMU triggered a page fault. reply foota 16 hours agorootparentVMA locking will soon be per VMA instead of shared within the process! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;937943&#x2F; reply amluto 14 hours agorootparentIt’s been a long time coming :) reply marginalia_nu 16 hours agorootparentprevOh great, means I&#x27;m worrying about nothing :-) reply ewalk153 18 hours agorootparentprevHave you thought of experimenting&#x2F;benchmarking with two or three different architectures right now before you settle on one?As you wrote in the article, you still have the old server that can support your current load. That likely won’t be an option in the future as your load continues to grow. reply marginalia_nu 15 hours agorootparentThis is sort of what I&#x27;m doing, except not really considering virtualization as a serious option. I&#x27;ve worked with it a lot in the past and it&#x27;s been awkward and annoying. I&#x27;ll go as far as containers, but I&#x27;m seriously not seeing what virtualization would add here other than obstacles.I&#x27;m also feeling out what&#x27;s a way of working with this machine that isn&#x27;t a huge pain in the ass. When you&#x27;ve got one instance running on one machine, manual deployments is fine, but I think something more CI-driven is probably going to be necessary to keep sane with 8 index shards and a test environment as well.Kubernetes would be an option but I have bad experiences with that too. A bit too much spooky action at a distance for my taste. Whole ecosystem feels very fragile and churny in a way I&#x27;m not very happy with, and the abstractions designed for hiding away the complexities of dealing with a cluster make running it on a single machine where those abstractions aren&#x27;t necessary just pointlessly awkward. reply daoudc 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been using dokku for Mwmbl and have been fairly happy with it.Congrats on the recent success by the way ;) replyzxwrt 18 hours agoprevDon&#x27;t forget to consider adding ipv6 support since you are lacking it. reply marginalia_nu 18 hours agoparentYeah should just be a matter of adding an AAAA record when the migration is done, since I&#x27;ve now got a public IPv6 range. reply akdkfe223 18 hours agoprevThank you for your hard work on this site!

I used to run my own git forge, but moved over to github, leaving the git.marginalia.nu domain with a redirect that was supposed to direct over to the github repository, but apparently it didn&#x27;t quite work for that link for some reason. reply mdaniel 16 hours agorootparentSince the nginx is currently serving its \"hello nginx\" even for \"&#x2F;\", this bypasses the whole problem: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MarginaliaSearch&#x2F;MarginaliaSearchI&#x27;m not sure why the changewouldn&#x27;t just point to GitHub itself; is there analytics value in having people click on your domain first? reply marginalia_nu 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a philosophical thing. I want to own my presence on the web, not rent it. So even when I&#x27;m using 3rd party services, I want a subdomain I own to point them out, so you can say like \"here&#x27;s the authoritative link\", and if microsoft goes and enshittens github, I can just redirect it to codeberg or whatever comes next.I think it works now though. It&#x27;s a pain to migrate several dozen nginx sites, especially with browsers helpfully remembering stale redirects for weeks. reply Liquix 12 hours agorootparent> if microsoft goes and enshittens githubbetween mandatory 2FA \"for your safety\", the copilot scandal, and the way M$ treated paying mojang customers who refused to make microsoft accounts - github&#x27;s future looks bleak.IMHO it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the inevitable email: \"all github accounts are being migrated to microsoft accounts. your github credentials will no longer work after mm&#x2F;dd&#x2F;2026. please migrate to continue using github.\"codeberg is excellent. replysmarx007 19 hours agoprevNice, congrats!

Do you have any concerns with corruption at that stage (validation)? reply marginalia_nu 19 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s already moved over. The data can be reduced to a fairly compressed form where it&#x27;s about 1.6 TB in total, so it&#x27;s easy to just tarball and check with an md5sum that it&#x27;s the same on both ends.As described in the post, a lot of the data is also heavily redundant so even if something goes wrong in one or a few places, the missing parts can be reconstructed from the rest. reply srhtftw 15 hours agoprevThe article left me wondering about the cost of the new and old servers and the difference in their price&#x2F;performance. reply marginalia_nu 15 hours agoparentNew server is roundabout $20,000 if you were to pay for the free CPU upgrade. Old server was about $5,000.It&#x27;s really hard to say how much faster it is going to be, but it&#x27;s at definitely much faster than the old server. I was not really having performance problems before either, though.
